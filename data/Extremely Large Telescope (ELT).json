Too large to be made from a single piece of glass, the 39-meter-diameter mirror will consist of 798 hexagonal segments, each about 5 centimeters thick and measuring 1.4 meters across. Producing 798 segments (plus a few additional pieces) that can work together as a single giant mirror to deliver unprecedented astronomical data is an engineering challenge with milestones worth celebrating.

The funding boost approved by the ESO Council - the organisation's main governing body - brings the total cost of the project to \u20ac1.3 billion. The 39-metre telescope, being erected in Cerro Armazones near ESO's Paranal Observatory in northern Chile, will start operating later this decade.

That was the message from Roberto Tamai, program manager for the European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope, in his presentation at this week's SPIE Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation Digital Forum. Tamai said that the combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and social unrest in Chile, where the ELT is being built, meant that \"first light\" was now pencilled in for November 2026.

With a tight schedule for the delivery of the remaining lasers (ELT could eventually use up to eight guide star lasers) and \"first light\" for the telescope itself expected in the second half of the 2020s, ESO seems to be leading the race for the next-generation super telescope, commented Toptica Projects. The guide star lasers for the adaptive optics system on the ELT are based on the laser systems that have successfully operated at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) since 2016 as part of the Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF), which has shown significant improvements in image sharpness, according to ESO.

As work on manufacturing and design elements of the ELT in Europe progressed steadily, the evolution of this complex and ambitious project, set to revolutionise modern astronomy, has been closely monitored over the past year. ESO's ELT is now expected to deliver the first scientific observations in September 2027, about half a year after an initial \"telescope technical first light\".
