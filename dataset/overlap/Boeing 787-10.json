The awarding of ATC caps a successful flight test program that began in March 2017 and involved three flight test airplanes that accumulated about 900 test hours. Boeing's flight test program team took the airplanes through a series of tests to confirm the airplane's handling, systems and overall performance met internal requirements and certification standards to ensure safety of flight. \"We are pleased to have met the rigorous standards set forth by the FAA and are eager to bring the airplane to market for our valued customers,\" says Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of the 787 program. \"After years of design and testing, our team has proven the quality, safety and reliability of the newest member of the Dreamliner family and we look forward to seeing the airplane in service later this year.\" Other aviation regulatory agencies are expected to follow the FAA's lead and certify the airplane before it enters service.

The award caps a flight-test program involving three airplanes that clocked some 900 hours in the air. The amended certification lays the basis for approval by other regulatory agencies around the world, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), whose final endorsement will allow launch customer Singapore Airlines to start service during the second quarter. Boeing expects to gain certification of the GEnx-1B-powered version of the 787-10 in time for delivery to United Airlines by early in the second half of the year. Speaking with AIN early this month, Boeing 787 chief project engineer Bob Whittington explained that the company had originally planned to use four test airplanes in the program, but as the 787-10's commonality with its smaller sibling, the 787-9, became more and more apparent during the early stages of design, so did the lack of a need for much of the testing to demonstrate the differences between the two models. The 787-10 and -9 use 95 percent common part numbers, not only reducing the number of test hours needed for the -10 but undoubtedly aiding work flow once full-scale production of the latest Dreamliner begins in North Charleston, South Carolina. Apart from its 18-foot stretch, the only visually obvious difference between the -9 and -10 lies in the -10's semi-levered main landing gear, leaving only some minor structural reinforcements in the fuselage and some systems modifications to account for the bigger cabin. Boeing arrived at the 18-foot stretch by inserting five frames in front of the wing and four frames aft of the wing, allowing for the addition of 40 passengers seats and total capacity of 330 in a two-class layout. Using exactly the same wing found in the -9, the -10's only other significant differences involve localized strengthening of the fuselage, an increase in the capability of the environmental control system and enough extra cargo space for one more pallet or two extra LD-3 containers in both the forward and aft holds. While maximum landing weight increases by 20,000 pounds to 445,000 pounds and maximum zero fuel weight jumps 25,000 pounds to 425,000 pounds, maximum takeoff weight remains unchanged at 560,000 pounds. Range decreases to 6,430 nautical miles from 7,635 nautical miles. Completing function and reliability trials and ECS testing ahead of schedule, the third airplane, designated ZC002, revealed no surprises since its first flight during the summer. \"It actually performed better than expected,\" said Whittington. By the time Whittington spoke with AIN on January 5, the first airplane-Trent 1000-TEN-powered ZC001-had completed all but a final stage of stability and control software validation and performing crosswind landings and tailwind takeoffs in Newfoundland. Incorporating technologies from the Trent XWB and Advance engine including a \"rising-line\" compressor and three-stage bladed disc (blisk) at the front of the high-pressure compressor, the Trent 1000-TEN promised a 3-percent fuel burn advantage over the Trent 1000, the original Rolls option for the 787-8 and 787-9. Entering service with an Air New Zealand 787-9 and a Scoot 787-8 last November, the Trent 1000-TEN has not delivered quite the fuel burn performance Rolls promised, however, and Whittington awaited a new software package to recoup the less than 1-percent deficiency by mid-year. However, in the 787-10, Boeing's aerodynamic measurements showed a roughly 1 percent better-than-expected drag coefficient, thereby countering the slight deficiency experienced in the Trent 1000-TEN-powered -8 and -9. Overall, Whittington expressed complete satisfaction with the pace and performance of the aircraft program. As much as the smooth introduction of the 787-9 contrasted with the tortured path of the 787-8's launch to its entry into service, the 787-10 has done as well as if not better than the -9. \"It's a tough comparison to make because of that commonality difference,\" explained Whittington. \"The -8, of course, was so unique and so new and so innovative, that flight test program was very long and very complicated...The big difference for us is the customers told us they really wanted the -10 to be as common as we could with the -9, and that really did structure our test program...It's more common than any airplane that I know of and I've been here 32 years, and this has been the most straightforward test program that I've ever seen.\" Built exclusively in Charleston largely because the mid-body fuselage section cannot fit in a Dreamlifter for transport to Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington, the first -10 moved through the South Carolina factory \"significantly\" more easily than the first -9 moved thorough Everett, added Whittington. \"The 787-10 flowed seamlessly through the production system,\" he said. \"We had half the number of manufacturing problems on the -10 than we did on the -9 in terms of non-conformances written, and the total flow through the factory is almost identical...The manufacturing system doesn't really know the difference between a -9 and a -10.\" In an effort to ensure that its customers, too, will see little difference between the two models while flying them in revenue service, Boeing spent a lot of time and energy validating maintenance manuals and preparing to operate the airplanes in flight test much like an airline would. Meanwhile, the group of airlines that comprised the program's advisory panel-including Singapore-emphasized their strong desire for commonality over range. \"The group of customers that we worked with were key in telling us not to stretch the range on the -10, that building in weight or capability in the airplane that they didn't necessarily need for range was not as valuable to them as it being common to the -9,\" said Whittington. As of mid-January holding orders for 171 of the 787-10, Boeing most recently inked a letter of intent with Emirates Airline during November's Dubai Airshow calling for an eventual firm order for 40. On the decision to choose the Dreamliner over the Airbus A350, an order for 70 of which Emirates canceled some three years ago, Emirates chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum explained that fleet planners looked closely at both options and reached the conclusion that the Boeing product made the most sense for several reasons, including maintenance cost considerations.", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2018-01-22/faa-certifies-boeing-787-10-service"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Singapore Airlines' first B787-10 Dreamliner rolls off assembly line", "date": "2017-10-04", "content": "Singapore Airlines' first B787-10 Dreamliner aircraft has rolled out of the Boeing Final Assembly Facility in South Carolina, ahead of its final delivery to the airline in the first half of next year.

Singapore Airlines  Singapore has now  announced  that the plane's first scheduled destination will be Osaka beginning May 3, 2018. The route from Singapore to Osaka is just over 3,000 miles and clocks in at six hours, fifteen minutes, giving travelers plenty of time to test out the jet's bells and whistles.  Prior to the launch of the route to Osaka, the airline will fly the 787-10 on select flights to Bangkok and Singapore in order to familiarize crew with its operation.  The 787-10 is the largest of Boeing's Dreamliner family, which also includes the 787-8 and 787-9. It is 68 meters long, which is five meters longer than the 787-9 and 11 meters longer than the 787-8, has a wingspan of 60 meters, a cruising speed of up to 647 miles per hour and a range of up to 6,430 nautical miles.  Perhaps more interesting for fliers is the fact that Singapore's configuration of the jet will have 337 seats total onboard, including 301 economy seats and 36 of the airline's new regional business class seats, called the Stelia Opal, according to  Australian Business Traveller.  \"The introduction of our new regional cabin products on the 787-10s is part of our commitment to continuous product innovation and leadership, to enhance the premium travel experience for our customers,\" said Singapore Airlines Vice President of Marketing and Planning, Tan Kai Ping.

The airline has not released which other specific destinations it intends to serve with its 787-10s. However, given the details so far, it seems likely that the plane will be used on the airline's other regional routes within Asia. Singapore will use Airbus A350-900s configured with its international seats on ultra-long-haul routes like those from Singapore to San Francisco, which launched in October, and to Los Angeles and New York, which the airline has indicated it will begin flying later in 2018.

The award caps a flight-test program involving three airplanes that clocked some 900 hours in the air. The amended certification lays the basis for approval by other regulatory agencies around the world, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), whose final endorsement will allow launch customer Singapore Airlines to start service during the second quarter. Boeing expects to gain certification of the GEnx-1B-powered version of the 787-10 in time for delivery to United Airlines by early in the second half of the year. Speaking with AIN early this month, Boeing 787 chief project engineer Bob Whittington explained that the company had originally planned to use four test airplanes in the program, but as the 787-10's commonality with its smaller sibling, the 787-9, became more and more apparent during the early stages of design, so did the lack of a need for much of the testing to demonstrate the differences between the two models. The 787-10 and -9 use 95 percent common part numbers, not only reducing the number of test hours needed for the -10 but undoubtedly aiding work flow once full-scale production of the latest Dreamliner begins in North Charleston, South Carolina. Apart from its 18-foot stretch, the only visually obvious difference between the -9 and -10 lies in the -10's semi-levered main landing gear, leaving only some minor structural reinforcements in the fuselage and some systems modifications to account for the bigger cabin. Boeing arrived at the 18-foot stretch by inserting five frames in front of the wing and four frames aft of the wing, allowing for the addition of 40 passengers seats and total capacity of 330 in a two-class layout. Using exactly the same wing found in the -9, the -10's only other significant differences involve localized strengthening of the fuselage, an increase in the capability of the environmental control system and enough extra cargo space for one more pallet or two extra LD-3 containers in both the forward and aft holds. While maximum landing weight increases by 20,000 pounds to 445,000 pounds and maximum zero fuel weight jumps 25,000 pounds to 425,000 pounds, maximum takeoff weight remains unchanged at 560,000 pounds. Range decreases to 6,430 nautical miles from 7,635 nautical miles. Completing function and reliability trials and ECS testing ahead of schedule, the third airplane, designated ZC002, revealed no surprises since its first flight during the summer. \"It actually performed better than expected,\" said Whittington. By the time Whittington spoke with AIN on January 5, the first airplane-Trent 1000-TEN-powered ZC001-had completed all but a final stage of stability and control software validation and performing crosswind landings and tailwind takeoffs in Newfoundland. Incorporating technologies from the Trent XWB and Advance engine including a \"rising-line\" compressor and three-stage bladed disc (blisk) at the front of the high-pressure compressor, the Trent 1000-TEN promised a 3-percent fuel burn advantage over the Trent 1000, the original Rolls option for the 787-8 and 787-9. Entering service with an Air New Zealand 787-9 and a Scoot 787-8 last November, the Trent 1000-TEN has not delivered quite the fuel burn performance Rolls promised, however, and Whittington awaited a new software package to recoup the less than 1-percent deficiency by mid-year. However, in the 787-10, Boeing's aerodynamic measurements showed a roughly 1 percent better-than-expected drag coefficient, thereby countering the slight deficiency experienced in the Trent 1000-TEN-powered -8 and -9. Overall, Whittington expressed complete satisfaction with the pace and performance of the aircraft program. As much as the smooth introduction of the 787-9 contrasted with the tortured path of the 787-8's launch to its entry into service, the 787-10 has done as well as if not better than the -9. \"It's a tough comparison to make because of that commonality difference,\" explained Whittington. \"The -8, of course, was so unique and so new and so innovative, that flight test program was very long and very complicated...The big difference for us is the customers told us they really wanted the -10 to be as common as we could with the -9, and that really did structure our test program...It's more common than any airplane that I know of and I've been here 32 years, and this has been the most straightforward test program that I've ever seen.\" Built exclusively in Charleston largely because the mid-body fuselage section cannot fit in a Dreamlifter for transport to Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington, the first -10 moved through the South Carolina factory \"significantly\" more easily than the first -9 moved thorough Everett, added Whittington. \"The 787-10 flowed seamlessly through the production system,\" he said. \"We had half the number of manufacturing problems on the -10 than we did on the -9 in terms of non-conformances written, and the total flow through the factory is almost identical...The manufacturing system doesn't really know the difference between a -9 and a -10.\" In an effort to ensure that its customers, too, will see little difference between the two models while flying them in revenue service, Boeing spent a lot of time and energy validating maintenance manuals and preparing to operate the airplanes in flight test much like an airline would. Meanwhile, the group of airlines that comprised the program's advisory panel-including Singapore-emphasized their strong desire for commonality over range. \"The group of customers that we worked with were key in telling us not to stretch the range on the -10, that building in weight or capability in the airplane that they didn't necessarily need for range was not as valuable to them as it being common to the -9,\" said Whittington. As of mid-January holding orders for 171 of the 787-10, Boeing most recently inked a letter of intent with Emirates Airline during November's Dubai Airshow calling for an eventual firm order for 40. On the decision to choose the Dreamliner over the Airbus A350, an order for 70 of which Emirates canceled some three years ago, Emirates chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum explained that fleet planners looked closely at both options and reached the conclusion that the Boeing product made the most sense for several reasons, including maintenance cost considerations.", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2018-01-22/faa-certifies-boeing-787-10-service"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Announces World's First Boeing 787-10 Route", "date": "2018-02-09", "content": "Singapore Airlines is the delivery customer of Boeing's next-generation 787-10 Dreamliner.

Singapore Airlines  Singapore has now  announced  that the plane's first scheduled destination will be Osaka beginning May 3, 2018. The route from Singapore to Osaka is just over 3,000 miles and clocks in at six hours, fifteen minutes, giving travelers plenty of time to test out the jet's bells and whistles.  Prior to the launch of the route to Osaka, the airline will fly the 787-10 on select flights to Bangkok and Singapore in order to familiarize crew with its operation.  The 787-10 is the largest of Boeing's Dreamliner family, which also includes the 787-8 and 787-9. It is 68 meters long, which is five meters longer than the 787-9 and 11 meters longer than the 787-8, has a wingspan of 60 meters, a cruising speed of up to 647 miles per hour and a range of up to 6,430 nautical miles.  Perhaps more interesting for fliers is the fact that Singapore's configuration of the jet will have 337 seats total onboard, including 301 economy seats and 36 of the airline's new regional business class seats, called the Stelia Opal, according to  Australian Business Traveller.  \"The introduction of our new regional cabin products on the 787-10s is part of our commitment to continuous product innovation and leadership, to enhance the premium travel experience for our customers,\" said Singapore Airlines Vice President of Marketing and Planning, Tan Kai Ping.

The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.  Goh called it a \"beautiful aircraft\" and an \"unparalleled product for regional operations.\"  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.  Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models.  The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.  Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.  The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.  The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the- air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long- distance flight.  The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles.  At 223 feet long, the aircraft is 18 feet  longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.  Europe's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.  Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide- body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.  But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.  The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.  The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.  The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.  Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

With room for 330 passengers, the twin-aisle jet airliner is expected to be the most efficient aircraft of its size in terms of fuel efficiency per seat.  The 787-10, made largely of composite materials like the other Dreamliner models, has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, which is about 1,000 miles less than the 787-8 and 787-9. However, the 787-10, stretching 224-feet long, can hold 40 more passengers than older Dreamliners, and it can still fly about 90 percent of long-distance routes. The result is more efficient transport per head flying people across the world.  The 787-10 is made from parts manufactured all over the world, and the aircraft is assembled in Boeing's plant in South Carolina. The  first 787-10 took flight  on March 31, 2017, almost exactly a year ago. Singapore Airlines will be the first to operate the 787-10, with 48 more of the new Dreamliners on order. Boeing has orders for about 170 of the new widebody jets.  \"This is a big day for all of us at Boeing and for our global supplier partners,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer, in a  press release. \"We are thrilled to deliver the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading carriers.\"  The twin-engine jet will be powered by one of two engines, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 or the GE Aviation GEnx-1B depending on specific orders. The aircraft delivered to Singapore Airlines yesterday is equipped with the Trent 1000, which has a maximum takeoff thrust of about 79,000 lbf, while the GEnx-1B puts out about 76,000 lbf at takeoff.  The brand new Singapore Airlines 787-10 will fly to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur for crew training before entering service in May, flying routes from Singapore to Osaka, Japan and Perth, Australia. The 787-10 is the world's newest efficient wide-body aircraft, the kind of plane that made the double-decker, four-engine 747  obsolete. With the 787-10 officially out the door, Boeing will be looking toward the  composite-winged wide-body 777X  and likely a new aircraft called the New Midsize Airplane, an airplane to serve routes between the 737 and 787, expected to become the  Boeing 797.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a19598370/first-boeing-787-10-dreamliner-delivered-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Now Has First Dreamliner 787-10, the World's Most Advanced Jet", "date": "2018-03-26", "content": "Qantas's Boeing 787-9 may have  just made history  with its record-setting, 17-hour Perth- to-London flight on Sunday, but there's a new headline maker about to take flight: The Boeing 787-10, the third and latest airplane in the Dreamliner series, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Sunday, making it the first airline to receive the world's most advanced jet.  \"It is an honor for us to be the world's first airline to take delivery of this amazing aircraft,\" said Goh Choon Phong, chief executive officer of Singapore Airlines at the delivery ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday. \"The 787-10 is a magnificent piece of engineering and truly a work of art. It will be an important element in our overall growth strategy, enabling us to expand our network and strengthen our operations.\"  With the addition of the 787-10 to its fleet, Singapore Airlines becomes the first group to fly all three Dreamliners, as its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, flies the 787-8 and 787-9.  Compared to its family members, the 787-10 is longer but isn't necessarily leaner: Its stretch means it can seat more passengers-about 330 fliers compared to 290 on the 787-9 and 242 on the 787-8. While more bodies means shorter range-it won't break any world records, topping out at 11,910 kilometers -the 787-10 can still go where it needs to, when it needs to, designed for flights up to 12 hours. Singapore will formally begin 787-10 service in May to Osaka and Perth after familiarizing crew with the aircraft on select flights to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.  Like its fellow Dreamliners-with which it shares 95 percent commonality-the 787-10 has higher cabin humidity, lower cabin altitude, industry-large windows, and \"Smoother Air Technology\" that detects turbulence and automatically adjusts aircraft systems accordingly.. Unlike its Dreamliner counterparts, Singapore's 787-10 operate with the  Rolls Royce Trent 1000 TEN engine, a replacement for the troublesome Trent 1000 with its  deteriorating turbine blades.  The 787-10 is considered a competitor to the Airbus A330neo, which is similarly designed for shorter, regional flights.  Though Singapore has placed the largest order of 787-10, other airlines aren't far behind: Etihad, British Airways, Emirates, ANA, and Air France are all lined up to receive the newest Dreamliner, and United will be the first U.S. customer to fly the \"dash ten\" when it receives its first aircraft in the second half of 2018. Given the intent behind the airplane's design-to accommodate peak seasonal demand and profitable, popular \"trunk\" routes-it's hardly surprising.  \"It sets the bar as the most efficient twin-aisle in its class,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer.

The first of 49 regionally-configured 787-10 Dreamliners landed at Changi Airport in Singapore late Wednesday morning. This delivery also made Singapore Group the first company to operate all three Dreamliner derivatives. The airline has announced that Perth and Osaka will be the first destinations served by this type.  During the ceremony attended by over 3,000 Boeing employees, guests, and international media, Boeing CEO Commercial Airplanes Kevin McAllister remarked on Boeing's 45-year relationship with Singapore Airlines dating back to the early days of the 737  and most recently an order for the 777X and 787-10 which was commemoratively signed at the White House.  \"This combination of all three 787s  types  will allow Singapore Airlines to put the right plane on the right route or their growth,\" said McAllister.  Following McAllister, Singapore Group CEO Goh Choon Phong commented on the unseasonably frigid air, but said, \"Nothing beats the warm hospitality me and my team have received from Boeing  North  Carolina assembly,\" after which he thanked each work group that developed the aircraft.  Phong said the delivery of the aircraft is an honor, calling the plane a work of art, along with an important element in their growth strategy.  Boeing currently produces the three Dreamliner derivatives at what it calls \"Rate 12\", or 12 aircraft per month, with plans to increase production to 14 monthly in 2019. Plans are already being put into place to facilitate that increase, including a third generation automated stringer builder. Stringers are the backbone that adds rigidity to the carbon fibre barrels of the 787 aircraft. Boeing spokespeople refuse to disclose exactly how many planes are produced at each site.  Inside Singapore Airlines' new aircraft, the cabin is fit with Business and Economy cabins meant for \"regional\" flights, but would be considered long-haul layouts in the domestic US. The newly-introduced Business cabin has 36 seats,  produced by Stelia Aerospace. The seats are arranged in rows of four, in a 1-2-1 configuration, offering each passenger direct access to the aisle.  Each seat has a lie-flat function and a large 18-inch screen to enjoy IFE programming by Panasonic's eX3 system. The IFE system can be controlled by finger touch, or by using the tethered remote control next to the seat. Passengers also have the option of signing in to their Kris Flyer account in order to upload a playlist of their favourite programmes or continue a show they were watching on a previous flight.  The Economy cabin has 301 seats, designed and built by Recaro, including a six-way adjustable head rest. The cabin is configured in rows of nine seats, arranged 3-3-3.  A Singapore Airlines spokesman says, \"Economy seat width is 18\". Business is 20\" and up to 26\" with armrests lowered. Economy seat pitch is 32\"  and  44\" in Business.\" However, RGN has sought additional colour on how an 18\" width was achieved in Economy, requesting measurements for each triple-seat frame, each seat between the armrests, each armrest, and the aisle.  The screen size at these seats is 11.6 inches with high-definition viewing. The seats have a slouch-recline function, with a bottom cushion that pivots forward while the seat back reclines.  The seatback features a USB outlet, headphone outlet, and a fold-down cup holder. The tray table folds in half to accommodate either a drink or a full meal tray or laptop computer when fully extended.  In terms of a premium economy product, Phong said the demand is larger for long-haul flights, explaining why we will not see it on the 787-10, which is also void of crew rest bunks.  \"The -10 is making possible a variety of missions that were previously not viable, because it is so much more efficient,\" he said.

The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.  Goh called it a \"beautiful aircraft\" and an \"unparalleled product for regional operations.\"  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.  Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models.  The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.  Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.  The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.  The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the- air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long- distance flight.  The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles.  At 223 feet long, the aircraft is 18 feet  longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.  Europe's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.  Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide- body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.  But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.  The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.  The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.  The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.  Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

With room for 330 passengers, the twin-aisle jet airliner is expected to be the most efficient aircraft of its size in terms of fuel efficiency per seat.  The 787-10, made largely of composite materials like the other Dreamliner models, has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, which is about 1,000 miles less than the 787-8 and 787-9. However, the 787-10, stretching 224-feet long, can hold 40 more passengers than older Dreamliners, and it can still fly about 90 percent of long-distance routes. The result is more efficient transport per head flying people across the world.  The 787-10 is made from parts manufactured all over the world, and the aircraft is assembled in Boeing's plant in South Carolina. The  first 787-10 took flight  on March 31, 2017, almost exactly a year ago. Singapore Airlines will be the first to operate the 787-10, with 48 more of the new Dreamliners on order. Boeing has orders for about 170 of the new widebody jets.  \"This is a big day for all of us at Boeing and for our global supplier partners,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer, in a  press release. \"We are thrilled to deliver the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading carriers.\"  The twin-engine jet will be powered by one of two engines, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 or the GE Aviation GEnx-1B depending on specific orders. The aircraft delivered to Singapore Airlines yesterday is equipped with the Trent 1000, which has a maximum takeoff thrust of about 79,000 lbf, while the GEnx-1B puts out about 76,000 lbf at takeoff.  The brand new Singapore Airlines 787-10 will fly to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur for crew training before entering service in May, flying routes from Singapore to Osaka, Japan and Perth, Australia. The 787-10 is the world's newest efficient wide-body aircraft, the kind of plane that made the double-decker, four-engine 747  obsolete. With the 787-10 officially out the door, Boeing will be looking toward the  composite-winged wide-body 777X  and likely a new aircraft called the New Midsize Airplane, an airplane to serve routes between the 737 and 787, expected to become the  Boeing 797.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a19598370/first-boeing-787-10-dreamliner-delivered-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Now Has First Dreamliner 787-10, the World's Most Advanced Jet", "date": "2018-03-26", "content": "Qantas's Boeing 787-9 may have  just made history  with its record-setting, 17-hour Perth- to-London flight on Sunday, but there's a new headline maker about to take flight: The Boeing 787-10, the third and latest airplane in the Dreamliner series, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Sunday, making it the first airline to receive the world's most advanced jet.  \"It is an honor for us to be the world's first airline to take delivery of this amazing aircraft,\" said Goh Choon Phong, chief executive officer of Singapore Airlines at the delivery ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday. \"The 787-10 is a magnificent piece of engineering and truly a work of art. It will be an important element in our overall growth strategy, enabling us to expand our network and strengthen our operations.\"  With the addition of the 787-10 to its fleet, Singapore Airlines becomes the first group to fly all three Dreamliners, as its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, flies the 787-8 and 787-9.  Compared to its family members, the 787-10 is longer but isn't necessarily leaner: Its stretch means it can seat more passengers-about 330 fliers compared to 290 on the 787-9 and 242 on the 787-8. While more bodies means shorter range-it won't break any world records, topping out at 11,910 kilometers -the 787-10 can still go where it needs to, when it needs to, designed for flights up to 12 hours. Singapore will formally begin 787-10 service in May to Osaka and Perth after familiarizing crew with the aircraft on select flights to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.  Like its fellow Dreamliners-with which it shares 95 percent commonality-the 787-10 has higher cabin humidity, lower cabin altitude, industry-large windows, and \"Smoother Air Technology\" that detects turbulence and automatically adjusts aircraft systems accordingly.. Unlike its Dreamliner counterparts, Singapore's 787-10 operate with the  Rolls Royce Trent 1000 TEN engine, a replacement for the troublesome Trent 1000 with its  deteriorating turbine blades.  The 787-10 is considered a competitor to the Airbus A330neo, which is similarly designed for shorter, regional flights.  Though Singapore has placed the largest order of 787-10, other airlines aren't far behind: Etihad, British Airways, Emirates, ANA, and Air France are all lined up to receive the newest Dreamliner, and United will be the first U.S. customer to fly the \"dash ten\" when it receives its first aircraft in the second half of 2018. Given the intent behind the airplane's design-to accommodate peak seasonal demand and profitable, popular \"trunk\" routes-it's hardly surprising.  \"It sets the bar as the most efficient twin-aisle in its class,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer.

The first of 49 regionally-configured 787-10 Dreamliners landed at Changi Airport in Singapore late Wednesday morning. This delivery also made Singapore Group the first company to operate all three Dreamliner derivatives. The airline has announced that Perth and Osaka will be the first destinations served by this type.  During the ceremony attended by over 3,000 Boeing employees, guests, and international media, Boeing CEO Commercial Airplanes Kevin McAllister remarked on Boeing's 45-year relationship with Singapore Airlines dating back to the early days of the 737  and most recently an order for the 777X and 787-10 which was commemoratively signed at the White House.  \"This combination of all three 787s  types  will allow Singapore Airlines to put the right plane on the right route or their growth,\" said McAllister.  Following McAllister, Singapore Group CEO Goh Choon Phong commented on the unseasonably frigid air, but said, \"Nothing beats the warm hospitality me and my team have received from Boeing  North  Carolina assembly,\" after which he thanked each work group that developed the aircraft.  Phong said the delivery of the aircraft is an honor, calling the plane a work of art, along with an important element in their growth strategy.  Boeing currently produces the three Dreamliner derivatives at what it calls \"Rate 12\", or 12 aircraft per month, with plans to increase production to 14 monthly in 2019. Plans are already being put into place to facilitate that increase, including a third generation automated stringer builder. Stringers are the backbone that adds rigidity to the carbon fibre barrels of the 787 aircraft. Boeing spokespeople refuse to disclose exactly how many planes are produced at each site.  Inside Singapore Airlines' new aircraft, the cabin is fit with Business and Economy cabins meant for \"regional\" flights, but would be considered long-haul layouts in the domestic US. The newly-introduced Business cabin has 36 seats,  produced by Stelia Aerospace. The seats are arranged in rows of four, in a 1-2-1 configuration, offering each passenger direct access to the aisle.  Each seat has a lie-flat function and a large 18-inch screen to enjoy IFE programming by Panasonic's eX3 system. The IFE system can be controlled by finger touch, or by using the tethered remote control next to the seat. Passengers also have the option of signing in to their Kris Flyer account in order to upload a playlist of their favourite programmes or continue a show they were watching on a previous flight.  The Economy cabin has 301 seats, designed and built by Recaro, including a six-way adjustable head rest. The cabin is configured in rows of nine seats, arranged 3-3-3.  A Singapore Airlines spokesman says, \"Economy seat width is 18\". Business is 20\" and up to 26\" with armrests lowered. Economy seat pitch is 32\"  and  44\" in Business.\" However, RGN has sought additional colour on how an 18\" width was achieved in Economy, requesting measurements for each triple-seat frame, each seat between the armrests, each armrest, and the aisle.  The screen size at these seats is 11.6 inches with high-definition viewing. The seats have a slouch-recline function, with a bottom cushion that pivots forward while the seat back reclines.  The seatback features a USB outlet, headphone outlet, and a fold-down cup holder. The tray table folds in half to accommodate either a drink or a full meal tray or laptop computer when fully extended.  In terms of a premium economy product, Phong said the demand is larger for long-haul flights, explaining why we will not see it on the 787-10, which is also void of crew rest bunks.  \"The -10 is making possible a variety of missions that were previously not viable, because it is so much more efficient,\" he said.  He also said there have been no issues with the Rolls-Royce powered 787s already in their fleet, which other carriers have experienced.

Boeing's flight test program team took the airplanes through a series of tests to confirm the airplane's handling, systems and overall performance met internal requirements and certification standards to ensure safety of flight. \"We are pleased to have met the rigorous standards set forth by the FAA and are eager to bring the airplane to market for our valued customers,\" says Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of the 787 program. \"After years of design and testing, our team has proven the quality, safety and reliability of the newest member of the Dreamliner family and we look forward to seeing the airplane in service later this year.\" Other aviation regulatory agencies are expected to follow the FAA's lead and certify the airplane before it enters service.

The award caps a flight-test program involving three airplanes that clocked some 900 hours in the air. The amended certification lays the basis for approval by other regulatory agencies around the world, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), whose final endorsement will allow launch customer Singapore Airlines to start service during the second quarter. Boeing expects to gain certification of the GEnx-1B-powered version of the 787-10 in time for delivery to United Airlines by early in the second half of the year. Speaking with AIN early this month, Boeing 787 chief project engineer Bob Whittington explained that the company had originally planned to use four test airplanes in the program, but as the 787-10's commonality with its smaller sibling, the 787-9, became more and more apparent during the early stages of design, so did the lack of a need for much of the testing to demonstrate the differences between the two models. The 787-10 and -9 use 95 percent common part numbers, not only reducing the number of test hours needed for the -10 but undoubtedly aiding work flow once full-scale production of the latest Dreamliner begins in North Charleston, South Carolina. Apart from its 18-foot stretch, the only visually obvious difference between the -9 and -10 lies in the -10's semi-levered main landing gear, leaving only some minor structural reinforcements in the fuselage and some systems modifications to account for the bigger cabin. Boeing arrived at the 18-foot stretch by inserting five frames in front of the wing and four frames aft of the wing, allowing for the addition of 40 passengers seats and total capacity of 330 in a two-class layout. Using exactly the same wing found in the -9, the -10's only other significant differences involve localized strengthening of the fuselage, an increase in the capability of the environmental control system and enough extra cargo space for one more pallet or two extra LD-3 containers in both the forward and aft holds. While maximum landing weight increases by 20,000 pounds to 445,000 pounds and maximum zero fuel weight jumps 25,000 pounds to 425,000 pounds, maximum takeoff weight remains unchanged at 560,000 pounds.

Goh called it a \"beautiful aircraft\" and an \"unparalleled product for regional operations.\"  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.  Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models.  The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.  Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.  The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.  The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the- air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long- distance flight.  The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles.  At 223 feet long, the aircraft is 18 feet  longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.  Europe's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.  Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide- body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.  But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.  The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.  The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.  The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.  Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

With room for 330 passengers, the twin-aisle jet airliner is expected to be the most efficient aircraft of its size in terms of fuel efficiency per seat.  The 787-10, made largely of composite materials like the other Dreamliner models, has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, which is about 1,000 miles less than the 787-8 and 787-9. However, the 787-10, stretching 224-feet long, can hold 40 more passengers than older Dreamliners, and it can still fly about 90 percent of long-distance routes. The result is more efficient transport per head flying people across the world.  The 787-10 is made from parts manufactured all over the world, and the aircraft is assembled in Boeing's plant in South Carolina. The  first 787-10 took flight  on March 31, 2017, almost exactly a year ago. Singapore Airlines will be the first to operate the 787-10, with 48 more of the new Dreamliners on order. Boeing has orders for about 170 of the new widebody jets.  \"This is a big day for all of us at Boeing and for our global supplier partners,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer, in a  press release. \"We are thrilled to deliver the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading carriers.\"  The twin-engine jet will be powered by one of two engines, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 or the GE Aviation GEnx-1B depending on specific orders. The aircraft delivered to Singapore Airlines yesterday is equipped with the Trent 1000, which has a maximum takeoff thrust of about 79,000 lbf, while the GEnx-1B puts out about 76,000 lbf at takeoff.  The brand new Singapore Airlines 787-10 will fly to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur for crew training before entering service in May, flying routes from Singapore to Osaka, Japan and Perth, Australia. The 787-10 is the world's newest efficient wide-body aircraft, the kind of plane that made the double-decker, four-engine 747  obsolete. With the 787-10 officially out the door, Boeing will be looking toward the  composite-winged wide-body 777X  and likely a new aircraft called the New Midsize Airplane, an airplane to serve routes between the 737 and 787, expected to become the  Boeing 797.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a19598370/first-boeing-787-10-dreamliner-delivered-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Now Has First Dreamliner 787-10, the World's Most Advanced Jet", "date": "2018-03-26", "content": "Qantas's Boeing 787-9 may have  just made history  with its record-setting, 17-hour Perth- to-London flight on Sunday, but there's a new headline maker about to take flight: The Boeing 787-10, the third and latest airplane in the Dreamliner series, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Sunday, making it the first airline to receive the world's most advanced jet.  \"It is an honor for us to be the world's first airline to take delivery of this amazing aircraft,\" said Goh Choon Phong, chief executive officer of Singapore Airlines at the delivery ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday. \"The 787-10 is a magnificent piece of engineering and truly a work of art. It will be an important element in our overall growth strategy, enabling us to expand our network and strengthen our operations.\"  With the addition of the 787-10 to its fleet, Singapore Airlines becomes the first group to fly all three Dreamliners, as its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, flies the 787-8 and 787-9.  Compared to its family members, the 787-10 is longer but isn't necessarily leaner: Its stretch means it can seat more passengers-about 330 fliers compared to 290 on the 787-9 and 242 on the 787-8. While more bodies means shorter range-it won't break any world records, topping out at 11,910 kilometers -the 787-10 can still go where it needs to, when it needs to, designed for flights up to 12 hours. Singapore will formally begin 787-10 service in May to Osaka and Perth after familiarizing crew with the aircraft on select flights to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.  Like its fellow Dreamliners-with which it shares 95 percent commonality-the 787-10 has higher cabin humidity, lower cabin altitude, industry-large windows, and \"Smoother Air Technology\" that detects turbulence and automatically adjusts aircraft systems accordingly.. Unlike its Dreamliner counterparts, Singapore's 787-10 operate with the  Rolls Royce Trent 1000 TEN engine, a replacement for the troublesome Trent 1000 with its  deteriorating turbine blades.  The 787-10 is considered a competitor to the Airbus A330neo, which is similarly designed for shorter, regional flights.  Though Singapore has placed the largest order of 787-10, other airlines aren't far behind: Etihad, British Airways, Emirates, ANA, and Air France are all lined up to receive the newest Dreamliner, and United will be the first U.S. customer to fly the \"dash ten\" when it receives its first aircraft in the second half of 2018. Given the intent behind the airplane's design-to accommodate peak seasonal demand and profitable, popular \"trunk\" routes-it's hardly surprising.  \"It sets the bar as the most efficient twin-aisle in its class,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer.

The first of 49 regionally-configured 787-10 Dreamliners landed at Changi Airport in Singapore late Wednesday morning. This delivery also made Singapore Group the first company to operate all three Dreamliner derivatives. The airline has announced that Perth and Osaka will be the first destinations served by this type.  During the ceremony attended by over 3,000 Boeing employees, guests, and international media, Boeing CEO Commercial Airplanes Kevin McAllister remarked on Boeing's 45-year relationship with Singapore Airlines dating back to the early days of the 737  and most recently an order for the 777X and 787-10 which was commemoratively signed at the White House.  \"This combination of all three 787s  types  will allow Singapore Airlines to put the right plane on the right route or their growth,\" said McAllister.  Following McAllister, Singapore Group CEO Goh Choon Phong commented on the unseasonably frigid air, but said, \"Nothing beats the warm hospitality me and my team have received from Boeing  North  Carolina assembly,\" after which he thanked each work group that developed the aircraft.  Phong said the delivery of the aircraft is an honor, calling the plane a work of art, along with an important element in their growth strategy.  Boeing currently produces the three Dreamliner derivatives at what it calls \"Rate 12\", or 12 aircraft per month, with plans to increase production to 14 monthly in 2019. Plans are already being put into place to facilitate that increase, including a third generation automated stringer builder. Stringers are the backbone that adds rigidity to the carbon fibre barrels of the 787 aircraft. Boeing spokespeople refuse to disclose exactly how many planes are produced at each site.  Inside Singapore Airlines' new aircraft, the cabin is fit with Business and Economy cabins meant for \"regional\" flights, but would be considered long-haul layouts in the domestic US. The newly-introduced Business cabin has 36 seats,  produced by Stelia Aerospace. The seats are arranged in rows of four, in a 1-2-1 configuration, offering each passenger direct access to the aisle.  Each seat has a lie-flat function and a large 18-inch screen to enjoy IFE programming by Panasonic's eX3 system. The IFE system can be controlled by finger touch, or by using the tethered remote control next to the seat. Passengers also have the option of signing in to their Kris Flyer account in order to upload a playlist of their favourite programmes or continue a show they were watching on a previous flight.  The Economy cabin has 301 seats, designed and built by Recaro, including a six-way adjustable head rest. The cabin is configured in rows of nine seats, arranged 3-3-3.  A Singapore Airlines spokesman says, \"Economy seat width is 18\". Business is 20\" and up to 26\" with armrests lowered. Economy seat pitch is 32\"  and  44\" in Business.\" However, RGN has sought additional colour on how an 18\" width was achieved in Economy, requesting measurements for each triple-seat frame, each seat between the armrests, each armrest, and the aisle.  The screen size at these seats is 11.6 inches with high-definition viewing. The seats have a slouch-recline function, with a bottom cushion that pivots forward while the seat back reclines.  The seatback features a USB outlet, headphone outlet, and a fold-down cup holder. The tray table folds in half to accommodate either a drink or a full meal tray or laptop computer when fully extended.  In terms of a premium economy product, Phong said the demand is larger for long-haul flights, explaining why we will not see it on the 787-10, which is also void of crew rest bunks.  \"The -10 is making possible a variety of missions that were previously not viable, because it is so much more efficient,\" he said.  He also said there have been no issues with the Rolls-Royce powered 787s already in their fleet, which other carriers have experienced. Rolls-Royce also powers Singapore's 787-10 with the Trent 1000-TEN.", "url": "https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2018/03/boeing-celebrates-delivery-of-the-first-787-10-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "United Airlines looks at Newark for Boeing 787-10 pilot base, report says", "date": "2018-05-07", "content": "Wondering where United's new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners will fly once the carrier begins taking delivery of them this year? The airline's Newark hub may be a good place to look.  That's  according to FlightGlobal reporter Edward Russell, who writes United is considering a Boeing 787 pilot base at Newark, \"potentially to serve the 787-10s that begin arriving later this year.\"  United has already begun discussions with the Air Line Pilots Association that represents its pilots about such a move,  according to FlightGlobal, which cited an employee newsletter sent by United earlier this month.  \"I am unable to provide specific EWR B787 mission details; but for now, note that the B787-10 is well-suited for European destinations,\" Paul Carlson, managing director for crew resources at United, wrote in the newsletter, according to FlightGlobal. Carlson said a Newark Dreamliner pilot base could come online around April 2019.   The \"dash 10\" variant of the 787 Dreamliner is Boeing's biggest version yet of the long-range aircraft. Singapore Airlines became the first airline in the world to take delivery of a 787-10 in March.  The one-stop, 24-hour ferry flight  from Boeing's South Carolina Dreamliner factory to Singapore's main base in Singapore became one of the longest aircraft delivery flights ever for Boeing.  As for United, its first 787-10- is expected to arrive to the carrier from South Carolina later this year. The carrier has firm orders for 14 of the \"stretched\" version of the Dreamliner and is expected to have three of those in its fleet by the end of 2018.

The awarding of ATC caps a successful flight test program that began in March 2017 and involved three flight test airplanes that accumulated about 900 test hours. Boeing's flight test program team took the airplanes through a series of tests to confirm the airplane's handling, systems and overall performance met internal requirements and certification standards to ensure safety of flight. \"We are pleased to have met the rigorous standards set forth by the FAA and are eager to bring the airplane to market for our valued customers,\" says Brad Zaback, vice president and general manager of the 787 program. \"After years of design and testing, our team has proven the quality, safety and reliability of the newest member of the Dreamliner family and we look forward to seeing the airplane in service later this year.\" Other aviation regulatory agencies are expected to follow the FAA's lead and certify the airplane before it enters service. As a stretch of the 787-9, the 787-10 retains more than 95% commonality while adding seats and cargo capacity. The airplane can fly 330 passengers, in a typical two-class configuration, up to 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 km).

The award caps a flight-test program involving three airplanes that clocked some 900 hours in the air. The amended certification lays the basis for approval by other regulatory agencies around the world, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), whose final endorsement will allow launch customer Singapore Airlines to start service during the second quarter. Boeing expects to gain certification of the GEnx-1B-powered version of the 787-10 in time for delivery to United Airlines by early in the second half of the year. Speaking with AIN early this month, Boeing 787 chief project engineer Bob Whittington explained that the company had originally planned to use four test airplanes in the program, but as the 787-10's commonality with its smaller sibling, the 787-9, became more and more apparent during the early stages of design, so did the lack of a need for much of the testing to demonstrate the differences between the two models. The 787-10 and -9 use 95 percent common part numbers, not only reducing the number of test hours needed for the -10 but undoubtedly aiding work flow once full-scale production of the latest Dreamliner begins in North Charleston, South Carolina. Apart from its 18-foot stretch, the only visually obvious difference between the -9 and -10 lies in the -10's semi-levered main landing gear, leaving only some minor structural reinforcements in the fuselage and some systems modifications to account for the bigger cabin. Boeing arrived at the 18-foot stretch by inserting five frames in front of the wing and four frames aft of the wing, allowing for the addition of 40 passengers seats and total capacity of 330 in a two-class layout. Using exactly the same wing found in the -9, the -10's only other significant differences involve localized strengthening of the fuselage, an increase in the capability of the environmental control system and enough extra cargo space for one more pallet or two extra LD-3 containers in both the forward and aft holds. While maximum landing weight increases by 20,000 pounds to 445,000 pounds and maximum zero fuel weight jumps 25,000 pounds to 425,000 pounds, maximum takeoff weight remains unchanged at 560,000 pounds. Range decreases to 6,430 nautical miles from 7,635 nautical miles. Completing function and reliability trials and ECS testing ahead of schedule, the third airplane, designated ZC002, revealed no surprises since its first flight during the summer. \"It actually performed better than expected,\" said Whittington. By the time Whittington spoke with AIN on January 5, the first airplane-Trent 1000-TEN-powered ZC001-had completed all but a final stage of stability and control software validation and performing crosswind landings and tailwind takeoffs in Newfoundland. Incorporating technologies from the Trent XWB and Advance engine including a \"rising-line\" compressor and three-stage bladed disc (blisk) at the front of the high-pressure compressor, the Trent 1000-TEN promised a 3-percent fuel burn advantage over the Trent 1000, the original Rolls option for the 787-8 and 787-9. Entering service with an Air New Zealand 787-9 and a Scoot 787-8 last November, the Trent 1000-TEN has not delivered quite the fuel burn performance Rolls promised, however, and Whittington awaited a new software package to recoup the less than 1-percent deficiency by mid-year. However, in the 787-10, Boeing's aerodynamic measurements showed a roughly 1 percent better-than-expected drag coefficient, thereby countering the slight deficiency experienced in the Trent 1000-TEN-powered -8 and -9. Overall, Whittington expressed complete satisfaction with the pace and performance of the aircraft program. As much as the smooth introduction of the 787-9 contrasted with the tortured path of the 787-8's launch to its entry into service, the 787-10 has done as well as if not better than the -9. \"It's a tough comparison to make because of that commonality difference,\" explained Whittington. \"The -8, of course, was so unique and so new and so innovative, that flight test program was very long and very complicated...The big difference for us is the customers told us they really wanted the -10 to be as common as we could with the -9, and that really did structure our test program...It's more common than any airplane that I know of and I've been here 32 years, and this has been the most straightforward test program that I've ever seen.\" Built exclusively in Charleston largely because the mid-body fuselage section cannot fit in a Dreamlifter for transport to Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington, the first -10 moved through the South Carolina factory \"significantly\" more easily than the first -9 moved thorough Everett, added Whittington. \"The 787-10 flowed seamlessly through the production system,\" he said. \"We had half the number of manufacturing problems on the -10 than we did on the -9 in terms of non-conformances written, and the total flow through the factory is almost identical...The manufacturing system doesn't really know the difference between a -9 and a -10.\" In an effort to ensure that its customers, too, will see little difference between the two models while flying them in revenue service, Boeing spent a lot of time and energy validating maintenance manuals and preparing to operate the airplanes in flight test much like an airline would. Meanwhile, the group of airlines that comprised the program's advisory panel-including Singapore-emphasized their strong desire for commonality over range. \"The group of customers that we worked with were key in telling us not to stretch the range on the -10, that building in weight or capability in the airplane that they didn't necessarily need for range was not as valuable to them as it being common to the -9,\" said Whittington. As of mid-January holding orders for 171 of the 787-10, Boeing most recently inked a letter of intent with Emirates Airline during November's Dubai Airshow calling for an eventual firm order for 40. On the decision to choose the Dreamliner over the Airbus A350, an order for 70 of which Emirates canceled some three years ago, Emirates chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum explained that fleet planners looked closely at both options and reached the conclusion that the Boeing product made the most sense for several reasons, including maintenance cost considerations.", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2018-01-22/faa-certifies-boeing-787-10-service"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Announces World's First Boeing 787-10 Route", "date": "2018-02-09", "content": "Singapore Airlines is the delivery customer of Boeing's next-generation 787-10 Dreamliner.

Singapore Airlines  Singapore has now  announced  that the plane's first scheduled destination will be Osaka beginning May 3, 2018. The route from Singapore to Osaka is just over 3,000 miles and clocks in at six hours, fifteen minutes, giving travelers plenty of time to test out the jet's bells and whistles.  Prior to the launch of the route to Osaka, the airline will fly the 787-10 on select flights to Bangkok and Singapore in order to familiarize crew with its operation.  The 787-10 is the largest of Boeing's Dreamliner family, which also includes the 787-8 and 787-9. It is 68 meters long, which is five meters longer than the 787-9 and 11 meters longer than the 787-8, has a wingspan of 60 meters, a cruising speed of up to 647 miles per hour and a range of up to 6,430 nautical miles.  Perhaps more interesting for fliers is the fact that Singapore's configuration of the jet will have 337 seats total onboard, including 301 economy seats and 36 of the airline's new regional business class seats, called the Stelia Opal, according to  Australian Business Traveller.  \"The introduction of our new regional cabin products on the 787-10s is part of our commitment to continuous product innovation and leadership, to enhance the premium travel experience for our customers,\" said Singapore Airlines Vice President of Marketing and Planning, Tan Kai Ping.

The airline has not released which other specific destinations it intends to serve with its 787-10s. However, given the details so far, it seems likely that the plane will be used on the airline's other regional routes within Asia. Singapore will use Airbus A350-900s configured with its international seats on ultra-long-haul routes like those from Singapore to San Francisco, which launched in October, and to Los Angeles and New York, which the airline has indicated it will begin flying later in 2018.

The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.  Goh called it a \"beautiful aircraft\" and an \"unparalleled product for regional operations.\"  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.  Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models.  The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.  Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.  The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.  The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the- air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long- distance flight.  The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles.  At 223 feet long, the aircraft is 18 feet  longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.  Europe's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.  Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide- body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.  But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.  The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.  The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.  The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.  Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

FlightGlobal has already reported that United's 787-10s will be configured with 318 seats, including 41 lie-flat seats in \"Polaris\" business class, 21 in an international-style premium economy section and 253 in coach. Of the coach seats, 45 will be extra-legroom seats.  United has not previously said where it intends to base or fly its 787-10s. The carrier already flies about 36 other 787 models, a mix of the smaller 787-8 and 787-9 models.

The ceremonial key to the plane was handed to Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong on the tarmac at Boeing's South Carolina plant, where the carbon composite jet is built, in front of more than a thousand Boeing workers and guests.  Goh called it a \"beautiful aircraft\" and an \"unparalleled product for regional operations.\"  Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister hailed the two airlines' 45-year relationship.  Singapore Airlines was the first Southeast Asian carrier to buy Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in 1972, Goh said, and the group is now the world's first to operate all the 787 Dreamliner family of models.  The new Dreamliner was parked in front of a line of about 10 787 airplanes in various stages of completion.  Singapore Airlines, which expanded its order for 787-10s to 49 jets last year, plans to introduce the jet on services to Osaka, Japan, followed by Perth, Australia, starting in May.  The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing's factory outside Seattle. Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.  The aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the- air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long- distance flight.  The 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles.  At 223 feet long, the aircraft is 18 feet  longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.  Europe's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.  Both jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide- body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.  But after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.  The 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.  The mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.  The 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.  Boeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

With room for 330 passengers, the twin-aisle jet airliner is expected to be the most efficient aircraft of its size in terms of fuel efficiency per seat.  The 787-10, made largely of composite materials like the other Dreamliner models, has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, which is about 1,000 miles less than the 787-8 and 787-9. However, the 787-10, stretching 224-feet long, can hold 40 more passengers than older Dreamliners, and it can still fly about 90 percent of long-distance routes. The result is more efficient transport per head flying people across the world.  The 787-10 is made from parts manufactured all over the world, and the aircraft is assembled in Boeing's plant in South Carolina. The  first 787-10 took flight  on March 31, 2017, almost exactly a year ago. Singapore Airlines will be the first to operate the 787-10, with 48 more of the new Dreamliners on order. Boeing has orders for about 170 of the new widebody jets.  \"This is a big day for all of us at Boeing and for our global supplier partners,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer, in a  press release. \"We are thrilled to deliver the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading carriers.\"  The twin-engine jet will be powered by one of two engines, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 or the GE Aviation GEnx-1B depending on specific orders. The aircraft delivered to Singapore Airlines yesterday is equipped with the Trent 1000, which has a maximum takeoff thrust of about 79,000 lbf, while the GEnx-1B puts out about 76,000 lbf at takeoff.  The brand new Singapore Airlines 787-10 will fly to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur for crew training before entering service in May, flying routes from Singapore to Osaka, Japan and Perth, Australia. The 787-10 is the world's newest efficient wide-body aircraft, the kind of plane that made the double-decker, four-engine 747  obsolete. With the 787-10 officially out the door, Boeing will be looking toward the  composite-winged wide-body 777X  and likely a new aircraft called the New Midsize Airplane, an airplane to serve routes between the 737 and 787, expected to become the  Boeing 797.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a19598370/first-boeing-787-10-dreamliner-delivered-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "Singapore Airlines Now Has First Dreamliner 787-10, the World's Most Advanced Jet", "date": "2018-03-26", "content": "Qantas's Boeing 787-9 may have  just made history  with its record-setting, 17-hour Perth- to-London flight on Sunday, but there's a new headline maker about to take flight: The Boeing 787-10, the third and latest airplane in the Dreamliner series, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Sunday, making it the first airline to receive the world's most advanced jet.  \"It is an honor for us to be the world's first airline to take delivery of this amazing aircraft,\" said Goh Choon Phong, chief executive officer of Singapore Airlines at the delivery ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday. \"The 787-10 is a magnificent piece of engineering and truly a work of art. It will be an important element in our overall growth strategy, enabling us to expand our network and strengthen our operations.\"  With the addition of the 787-10 to its fleet, Singapore Airlines becomes the first group to fly all three Dreamliners, as its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, flies the 787-8 and 787-9.  Compared to its family members, the 787-10 is longer but isn't necessarily leaner: Its stretch means it can seat more passengers-about 330 fliers compared to 290 on the 787-9 and 242 on the 787-8. While more bodies means shorter range-it won't break any world records, topping out at 11,910 kilometers -the 787-10 can still go where it needs to, when it needs to, designed for flights up to 12 hours. Singapore will formally begin 787-10 service in May to Osaka and Perth after familiarizing crew with the aircraft on select flights to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.  Like its fellow Dreamliners-with which it shares 95 percent commonality-the 787-10 has higher cabin humidity, lower cabin altitude, industry-large windows, and \"Smoother Air Technology\" that detects turbulence and automatically adjusts aircraft systems accordingly.. Unlike its Dreamliner counterparts, Singapore's 787-10 operate with the  Rolls Royce Trent 1000 TEN engine, a replacement for the troublesome Trent 1000 with its  deteriorating turbine blades.  The 787-10 is considered a competitor to the Airbus A330neo, which is similarly designed for shorter, regional flights.  Though Singapore has placed the largest order of 787-10, other airlines aren't far behind: Etihad, British Airways, Emirates, ANA, and Air France are all lined up to receive the newest Dreamliner, and United will be the first U.S. customer to fly the \"dash ten\" when it receives its first aircraft in the second half of 2018. Given the intent behind the airplane's design-to accommodate peak seasonal demand and profitable, popular \"trunk\" routes-it's hardly surprising.  \"It sets the bar as the most efficient twin-aisle in its class,\" said Kevin McAllister, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive officer.

The first of 49 regionally-configured 787-10 Dreamliners landed at Changi Airport in Singapore late Wednesday morning. This delivery also made Singapore Group the first company to operate all three Dreamliner derivatives. The airline has announced that Perth and Osaka will be the first destinations served by this type.  During the ceremony attended by over 3,000 Boeing employees, guests, and international media, Boeing CEO Commercial Airplanes Kevin McAllister remarked on Boeing's 45-year relationship with Singapore Airlines dating back to the early days of the 737  and most recently an order for the 777X and 787-10 which was commemoratively signed at the White House.  \"This combination of all three 787s  types  will allow Singapore Airlines to put the right plane on the right route or their growth,\" said McAllister.  Following McAllister, Singapore Group CEO Goh Choon Phong commented on the unseasonably frigid air, but said, \"Nothing beats the warm hospitality me and my team have received from Boeing  North  Carolina assembly,\" after which he thanked each work group that developed the aircraft.  Phong said the delivery of the aircraft is an honor, calling the plane a work of art, along with an important element in their growth strategy.  Boeing currently produces the three Dreamliner derivatives at what it calls \"Rate 12\", or 12 aircraft per month, with plans to increase production to 14 monthly in 2019. Plans are already being put into place to facilitate that increase, including a third generation automated stringer builder. Stringers are the backbone that adds rigidity to the carbon fibre barrels of the 787 aircraft. Boeing spokespeople refuse to disclose exactly how many planes are produced at each site.  Inside Singapore Airlines' new aircraft, the cabin is fit with Business and Economy cabins meant for \"regional\" flights, but would be considered long-haul layouts in the domestic US. The newly-introduced Business cabin has 36 seats,  produced by Stelia Aerospace. The seats are arranged in rows of four, in a 1-2-1 configuration, offering each passenger direct access to the aisle.  Each seat has a lie-flat function and a large 18-inch screen to enjoy IFE programming by Panasonic's eX3 system. The IFE system can be controlled by finger touch, or by using the tethered remote control next to the seat. Passengers also have the option of signing in to their Kris Flyer account in order to upload a playlist of their favourite programmes or continue a show they were watching on a previous flight.  The Economy cabin has 301 seats, designed and built by Recaro, including a six-way adjustable head rest. The cabin is configured in rows of nine seats, arranged 3-3-3.  A Singapore Airlines spokesman says, \"Economy seat width is 18\". Business is 20\" and up to 26\" with armrests lowered. Economy seat pitch is 32\"  and  44\" in Business.\" However, RGN has sought additional colour on how an 18\" width was achieved in Economy, requesting measurements for each triple-seat frame, each seat between the armrests, each armrest, and the aisle.  The screen size at these seats is 11.6 inches with high-definition viewing. The seats have a slouch-recline function, with a bottom cushion that pivots forward while the seat back reclines.  The seatback features a USB outlet, headphone outlet, and a fold-down cup holder. The tray table folds in half to accommodate either a drink or a full meal tray or laptop computer when fully extended.  In terms of a premium economy product, Phong said the demand is larger for long-haul flights, explaining why we will not see it on the 787-10, which is also void of crew rest bunks.  \"The -10 is making possible a variety of missions that were previously not viable, because it is so much more efficient,\" he said.  He also said there have been no issues with the Rolls-Royce powered 787s already in their fleet, which other carriers have experienced. Rolls-Royce also powers Singapore's 787-10 with the Trent 1000-TEN.", "url": "https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2018/03/boeing-celebrates-delivery-of-the-first-787-10-to-singapore-airlines/"}, {"title": "United Airlines looks at Newark for Boeing 787-10 pilot base, report says", "date": "2018-05-07", "content": "Wondering where United's new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners will fly once the carrier begins taking delivery of them this year?

Boeing also announced a contract in April 2017 to sell Iran Aseman Airlines 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for $3 billion, with purchase rights for another 30 aircraft. Last week, a person close to the matter said engineering giant General Electric would cease all activities in Iran by November 4 and meet a 180-day deadline set by the Trump administration to exit the country.

On its 787-9s, the carrier offers reverse herringbone seats in business class.  I had a fantastic flight on  Vietnam Airlines from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City - one of their hubs. The flight was operated on a Boeing 787-9. Should you fly on a 787-10 with Vietnam Airlines, it will likely end up being a good flight. The crew seemed to take pride in service and were wonderful to interact with.  Interestingly, Vietnam Airlines will not offer  premium economy  onboard their 787-10s. Keep this in mind, since the lack of this class indicates potential uses for the aircraft.  The routes:  Vietnam Airlines did not release any official routes yet. However, the press release mentioned that the 787-10 would \"elevate the customer experience on the Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh route as well as many international routes.\"  Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh is a major domestic route in Vietnam. Thus, the 787-10 would help Vietnam Airlines add capacity on that route with new, fuel- efficient aircraft. The airline does already operate widebodies between the two major cities. The 787-10 could replace the other aircraft entirely and solely operate flights between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  The A350 will be replaced with a Boeing 787-10 on Vietnam Airlines' route from Ho Chi Minh to Seoul. Photo: Airbus  The configuration does give a little hint to this plane's purpose. Without premium economy, it does not seem that Vietnam Airlines would place this aircraft on long-haul service. Instead, these planes could fly high-density routes in  East Asia. In particular, could include routes to China, South Korea, and Japan. Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo could make for profitable, high-density markets for the 787-10.  Overall:  With the first of eight 787-10s on lease from Air Lease Corporation,  Vietnam Airlines is on a path of expansion  and  fleet renewal. Hopefully, if the 787-10 does replace other services, then Vietnam Airlines will launch new long-haul missions.  Perhaps Los Angeles  could be on the cards? Both the  A350-900  and 787-9 could make the trip.  Are you excited to try Vietnam Airlines' new 787-10? Where do you think they will fly the Boeing 787-10? Let us know in the comments below!

The announcement confirmed a Reuters report last week that Boeing had beaten out rival Airbus SE, which had proposed the A350 for the hotly contested deal.  The airline, which has Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engines that have proven problematic on its existing fleet of 13 787s, announced it had switched to GE engines for the new order.  The 787s will replace eight older 777-200ERs and leave the carrier with an all-Boeing wide-body fleet as well as Airbus A320 family jets for shorter flights.  The order comprises eight long-range 787-10s, with the agreement including an option to increase the number of aircraft to 20.  The deal also gives the airline, which has previously mentioned a goal of flying Auckland-New York non-stop, the option to switch some aircraft to the longer range 787-9s.  \"With the 787-10 offering almost 15 percent more space for customers and cargo than the 787-9, this investment creates the platform for our future strategic direction and opens up new opportunities to grow,\" Air New Zealand Chief Executive Christopher Luxon said in a statement.  The eight jets will enter the Air New Zealand fleet between 2022 and 2027, the airline said.  \"The 787-10 has 95 percent commonality with Air New Zealand's existing fleet of 787-9s and will provide the airline with added benefits in terms of capacity and overall operations,\" Vice President of Boeing Commercial Sales and Marketing for Asia Pacific Christy Reese said.  Boeing said the 787-10 is the largest member of its Dreamliner model, and can serve up to 330 passengers in a standard two-class configuration, about 40 more than the 787-9 airplane.  \"With the 777 and now the 787-9 and 787-10, Air New Zealand will have an incredible widebody family to serve its passengers and grow its international network in the years ahead,\" Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's senior vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing said in a statement.  Air New Zealand in March launched a two-year cost reduction program and said it would defer spending on aircraft by about NZ$750 million  as part of a business review.  The airline said the 787 was 25 percent more fuel efficient than the jets it is replacing, and noted that carriers typically receive large discounts on the list price of jets.  In February, Air New Zealand slashed domestic fares by as much as 50 percent in a shake-up of its pricing structure in response to the slackening travel market.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-new-zealand-boeing-orders-idUSKCN1SW0Y0"}, {"title": "Korean Air commits to order 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliner", "date": "2019-06-18", "content": "Korean Air plans to add a total of 30 new 787 Dreamliner airplanes to its fleet.

Thus, the 787-10 would help Vietnam Airlines add capacity on that route with new, fuel- efficient aircraft. The airline does already operate widebodies between the two major cities.

To celebrate the airline's 100th anniversary later this year, the airplane is wearing a special livery.  The Dreamliner jet, registered as PH-BKA, was welcomed in Amsterdam upon arrival. The new aircraft was initially planned to land at Amsterdam Schiphol on Saturday morning, 29 June. However, the delivery process was slightly delayed and the brand new 787-10 arrived one day later than anticipated.   KLM's first 787-10 is expected to enter service in the coming days on the airline's routes to Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam. The flag-carrier of the Netherlands currently serves more than 150 destinations worldwide. Furthermore, the carrier signed several partnerships and  codeshare agreements  with other airlines.  In addition to its new Boeing 787-10, its long-haul fleet consists of Airbus A330, Boeing 747-400, 777 and 787-9 aircraft. Boeing 737 aircraft and Embraer jets are used on shorter routes. Most recently, KLM announced  15 new firm orders  for the latter aircraft during the Paris Air Show 2019.

The Asian carrier has approved a budget of $6.3 billion to spend on 10 787-9 and 10 787-10 Dreamliner planes. A further 10 Dreamliner aircraft are to be leased at a cost of $3.4 billion.  The figures quoted are based on Boeing's commercial list pricing and a discount can be expected. Confirmation of the purchase came after the close of Thursday trade in the South Korean Kospi index.  The deal was first announced in June at the Paris Air Show but has now been signed off by the board of Korean Air, according to Reuters. The investment will be made between now and 2025.  Boeing's Dreamliner series, or 787, is a long-haul wide-body commercial plane that can seat up to 335 passengers. First introduced in 2011, the plane was considered a step up for fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort.  At present Boeing has delivered 859 of its 1,441 Dreamliner orders.  Korean Air Chairman Walter Cho has previously said the aircraft will become the \"backbone\" of the airline's mid and long-haul fleet strategy and will replace its existing Boeing 777s, 747s and its Airbus A330s.  Korean Air wants to modernize its fleet to save on fuel costs and quell criticism that its planes are particularly bad for the environment.  Research from the  Transition Pathway Initiative   in March this year identified the firm as the worst- performing major airline for emitting carbon particles into the atmosphere.  In a ranking of 20 airlines, stretching back to 2014, TPI found that Korean Air flights emitted between 170 and 200 grams of CO2 per passenger-kilometer.  By comparison Delta, Southwest and Qantas were calculated as closer to 100 grams of CO2 per passenger-kilometer.

Besides an agreement to lease ten additional 787-10 aircraft from Air Lease Corporation, Korean Air will quadruple its Dreamliner fleet due to the demand for the jet's efficiency and passenger comforts.  The recent addition of the 787-10 to its long-haul fleet will complement Korean Air's existing 787-9 and 777 aircraft.  As the largest member of the Dreamliner family, the 224ft-long 787-10 can accommodate up to 330 passengers in a standard two-class configuration, approximately 40 more than the 787-9 jet.    Powered by advanced technologies and a revolutionary design, the 787-10 operates at a reduced cost.  Korean Air chairman Walter Cho said: \"As we continue to innovate our product offering, the 787 Dreamliner family will become the backbone of our mid-and long-haul fleet for many years to come.  \"In addition to 25% improved fuel efficiency, the stretched 787-10 offers around 15% more space for passengers and cargo than our 787-9s, which will be critical to our long-term business goals.\"  The airliner plans to commission the 787-10 on medium-range routes and continues to enhance the longer-range capabilities of the 787-9 Dreamliner on long-haul flights.

While the exact time frame for this reduction is not yet known, Boeing hopes to return to a rate of 12 aircraft per month in 2023. The current 787 backlog is 546 aircraft strong and consists of 56 787-8, 346 787-9 and 144 of the largest Dreamliner version, the 787-10. At the current rate of 14 aircraft per month this backlog would have been fulfilled in just over three years. With the reduction to the new rate of 10 aircraft per month over the coming 23 months, this backlog would last for four years.  Last year, Boeing only recorded net orders for 82 787, about half of the 158 planes it delivered in 2019. The biggest orders came from  Emirates for 30  as well as  Lufthansa  and  Korean Air  which both ordered 20. With an end on the horizon for the US-China trade war Boeing hopes to collect more orders from Chinese airlines in the next year.  The company has two production sites for the 787 Dreamliner. Everett, Washington, where Boeing builds most its wide body aircraft types, and North Charleston, South Carolina, which was added in 2011. The longer 787-10 is exclusively being built in South Carolina, as its fuselage parts are to large for the Everett facility.

After testing is complete, the jet will join Etihad's fleet of Dreamliners. This latest announcement builds on the existing eco-partnership between Etihad and Boeing, which was announced in November 2019.  Testing the 787-10: This will be the first time a 787-10 has been used as a part of the ecoDemonstrator program. Boeing will work with several other partners, including NASA and Safran Landing Systems, to test new technology.  The testing will begin in August. Over approximately four weeks, the jet will be examined to try to reduce noise pollution and adapt future aircraft designs for quieter operations. According to  FlightGlobal, the plane will be fitted with 222 pressure sensors and over 1,000 microphones to examine its landing gear and noise signature.  Additionally, new software will be trialed, which will connect pilots to Air Traffic Control and Airline Operation Centers to optimize routes. If successful, the software could help minimize congestion over airports, reduce workload and radio traffic as well as improving efficiency. The technology will help map aircraft more accurately in four dimensions; latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.  All of the test flights will use a mixture of  sustainable aviation fuel  to minimize carbon emissions.  Etihad and Boeing's partnership: Back in November 2019, Boeing and Etihad announced they were planning to collaborate to develop an \" Ethiad Greenliner .\" Etihad is the largest operator to the Dreamliner in the Middle East. According to a statement from Etihad, the announcement today will \" leverage the Etihad Greenliner program as part of the broader Etihad-Boeing Strategic Partnership to test cutting-edge technologies and explore \"blue sky\" opportunities to improve airspace efficiency, reduce fuel use, and cut CO2 emissions.\"  Despite Etihad's enthusiasm to be a part of the program, the tests will not be as expansive this year due to financial pressure. It's thought there will be several days of testing over the four weeks. The jet is due to fly from Boeing's South Carolina assembly facility in the next few weeks. It will then remain in Montana until September for the testing process and will then return to South Carolina before heading to Etihad in late September.  The ecoDemonstrator program:  Boeing launched its ecoDemonstrator program back in 2010, with the first test flights taking place in 2012. This new collaboration is the seventh. Previously, Boing collaborated with FedEx to test on a 777 Freighter, Embraer to test an E170, Stifel to test a 757 and American Airlines to test a 737-800. It has also tested several of its own aircraft, including  a 777-200  and a 787-8.  The testing has varied over the years, and the program has now trialed over 165 technologies. Everything from winglets, wing coatings, wireless sensors to Vortex Generators, and turbulence detectors have been looked at. The program offers the unique opportunity of taking testing outside of a lab environment and into the field.  In a statement, Boeing said its ecoDemonstrator program helps drive sustainability by \" testing promising technologies that can reduce emissions, help commercial aviation meet our climate goals, and allow the industry to grow in a responsible manner that respects our planet and its natural resources.\"  Boeing is already planning its next collaborations for the program in 2021 and 2022, but it has not released any details.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/etihad-boeing-787-10-eco-demonstrator/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Etihad to operate cargo-only service utilising B787-10 passenger aircraft", "date": "2020-03-26", "content": "Etihad Cargo is introducing a fleet of Boeing 787-10 aircraft as passenger freighters to operate 34 weekly flights, serving 10 markets initially.

It's thought there will be several days of testing over the four weeks. The jet is due to fly from Boeing's South Carolina assembly facility in the next few weeks. It will then remain in Montana until September for the testing process and will then return to South Carolina before heading to Etihad in late September.  The ecoDemonstrator program:  Boeing launched its ecoDemonstrator program back in 2010, with the first test flights taking place in 2012. This new collaboration is the seventh. Previously, Boing collaborated with FedEx to test on a 777 Freighter, Embraer to test an E170, Stifel to test a 757 and American Airlines to test a 737-800. It has also tested several of its own aircraft, including  a 777-200  and a 787-8.  The testing has varied over the years, and the program has now trialed over 165 technologies. Everything from winglets, wing coatings, wireless sensors to Vortex Generators, and turbulence detectors have been looked at. The program offers the unique opportunity of taking testing outside of a lab environment and into the field.  In a statement, Boeing said its ecoDemonstrator program helps drive sustainability by \" testing promising technologies that can reduce emissions, help commercial aviation meet our climate goals, and allow the industry to grow in a responsible manner that respects our planet and its natural resources.\"  Boeing is already planning its next collaborations for the program in 2021 and 2022, but it has not released any details.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/etihad-boeing-787-10-eco-demonstrator/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "British Airways takes delivery of its first Boeing 787-10", "date": "2020-06-28", "content": "British Airways has received delivery of its first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. The -10 joins the 12 and 18 strong fleets of Boeing 787-8 and -9 fleets respectively, that the airline already has in service. This makes British Airways the third airline in the world and the first in Europe to operate all three variants of Boeing's Dreamliner family after United and ANA.  The aircraft, registered G-ZBLA, departed Boeing's Charleston plant in South Carolina and landed at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday, 28th June. It marks the first of 12 787-10 aircraft that the UK's largest airline has on order which, once fulfilled, will bring the operator's Dreamliner fleet to a total of 42 aircraft.  The new plane was originally scheduled for delivery in January, but has been delayed as  Boeing reduced the production rate of the 787  due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

The project saw an Etihad Boeing 787-10 used as a platform to test initiatives aimed at improving aviation in the future.  The ecoDemontstrator project has been running for some eight years since  an American Airlines Boeing 737 was first used in 2012. Since then, several new initiatives have been tested on various aircraft, including the 767 and 777.  Compact testing schedule:  Most recently,  a Boeing 787-10 was used for the tests. This aircraft is due to be delivered to Etihad Airways by the end of the month, meaning that the window for tests was reasonably tight. In total, tests were carried out over eight days, with the aircraft in Boeing's care for just 27 days from starting to install microphones to finishing removing equipment.  This testing was Boeing's most compact ecoDemonstrator iteration, and to ensure that everything went as planned, the entire testing program was meticulously designed virtually before the project.  Acoustic research:  Several big themes were running through this strand of Boeing's ongoing ecoDemonstrator project. The main one was to do with noise. Boeing partnered with both NASA and Safran for this.  You may notice that there seems to be a circuit board design on the aircraft's fuselage. However, this is an array of 214 microphones. Together with 1,000 microphones on the ground in Montana, over 50 maneuvers were conducted on 88 passes of the ground site, to measure precisely where noise is being generated on the aircraft.  The thinking is that if Boeing calculates this on its quietest aircraft, it can feed this into future designs that are even quieter. The remote Montana location was chosen as Boeing can avoid interference from other sources of noise such as industry.  At the same time, Safran was partnering with Boeing to test modified landing gears. Bright orange fairings were attached to the landing gear, bearing an aerofoil shape. 23 passes were made over the microphone array, with ground witnesses saying the fairings made a noticeable difference to the aircraft's noise.  This is a crucial area of research for Boeing, as the landing gear accounts for 30% of the noise generated as an aircraft comes into land.  Sustainable aviation fuels:  To prove the concept of sustainable aviation fuels, Boeing used them for the flight testing on the ecoDemonstrator. The aim was to show that large quantities of fuels could be made. As such, 50,000 US gallons of fuel were produced for the test.  The aircraft used a 50/50 blend, meaning that it is half biofuel and half regular fuel. This is the maximum permitted concentration of fuel according to certification requirements. The fuel was produced from inedible agricultural waste and can reduce an aircraft's CO2 emissions by 75% over its lifecycle.  As for the future of the ecoDemonstrator project? This Boeing 787-10 will now be reconfigured as a passenger aircraft and delivered to Etihad. Meanwhile, work will continue analyzing the data gathered and preparing for a future project.  While Boeing couldn't say what's coming next, ideas are underway. Around 1/3 of projects tested on an ecoDemonstrator have made it to fruition, such as the Boeing 737 MAX's wingtips.

The stretched version of the Boeing 787-9 was due to be delivered to Saudia yesterday but suffered a mechanical problem.  As the plane was preparing for takeoff at Charleston International Airport, a mechanical issue left it stranded on an active runway. After sitting idle for around 45 minutes, the aircraft, registration number HZ-AR28, had to have Boeing send a tug to bring the plane back to the hangar.  Saudia has more 787-10s on order:  The aircraft was set to complement Saudia's other four Boeing 787-10s that it had already received since last September. Aside from HZ-AR28,  Saudia  has eight further 787-10s on order with the Chicago-headquartered planemaker.  When taking delivery of its  first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner  at the new Terminal 1 building at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport  on September 30, 2019, Saudia director-general Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser is quoted by  Arabian Business  as saying,  \"The airplane's onboard cabin features, long-range capability, and the latest in technological advancements are among the many aspects of what makes the Boeing 787 highly popular with our guests.\"   Powered by two General Electric GEnx engines, the popular 787-9 Dreamliner's extended version adds another 40 seats to the jet. Saudia has opted for a two- class configuration with 24 seats in business class and 333 in economy class. With a range of 6,345 nautical miles, the Boeing 787-10 can fly to more than 95% of the world's airports that handle twin-aisle planes.   Boeing and Saudia have a long relationship:  When speaking about Boeing's relationship with  Saudia,  senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing for Boeing, Ihssane Mounir, said,  \"Saudia has been a valued partner with Boeing for nearly 75 years, and this delivery marks another major milestone in our partnership. Our team takes great pride in building and delivering quality aircraft to Saudia, and we are honored by the continuing confidence in the 787 Dreamliner and 777 families.\"  Boeing and Saudia have a relationship that stretches back 75 years. As well as Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Saudia also has eight Boeing 747s and 39 Boeing 777s, of which four are the freight version.   Saudi Arabia is now open to tourists:  Saudia hopes that once travel returns to normal levels following the current COVID-19 crisis, it will serve tourists visiting the Kingdom. Last September, to lessen its dependence on oil Saudi Arabia opened up its doors to international tourists.  Before this, the Kingdom only issued visas to pilgrims, business people, and expatriate workers. Under the plan, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, tourists from 49 countries will be able to visit Saudi Arabia and its five UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

When taking delivery of its  first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner  at the new Terminal 1 building at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport  on September 30, 2019, Saudia director-general Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser is quoted by  Arabian Business  as saying,  \"The airplane's onboard cabin features, long-range capability, and the latest in technological advancements are among the many aspects of what makes the Boeing 787 highly popular with our guests.\"   Powered by two General Electric GEnx engines, the popular 787-9 Dreamliner's extended version adds another 40 seats to the jet. Saudia has opted for a two- class configuration with 24 seats in business class and 333 in economy class. With a range of 6,345 nautical miles, the Boeing 787-10 can fly to more than 95% of the world's airports that handle twin-aisle planes.   Boeing and Saudia have a long relationship:  When speaking about Boeing's relationship with  Saudia,  senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing for Boeing, Ihssane Mounir, said,  \"Saudia has been a valued partner with Boeing for nearly 75 years, and this delivery marks another major milestone in our partnership. Our team takes great pride in building and delivering quality aircraft to Saudia, and we are honored by the continuing confidence in the 787 Dreamliner and 777 families.\"  Boeing and Saudia have a relationship that stretches back 75 years. As well as Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Saudia also has eight Boeing 747s and 39 Boeing 777s, of which four are the freight version.   Saudi Arabia is now open to tourists:  Saudia hopes that once travel returns to normal levels following the current COVID-19 crisis, it will serve tourists visiting the Kingdom. Last September, to lessen its dependence on oil Saudi Arabia opened up its doors to international tourists.  Before this, the Kingdom only issued visas to pilgrims, business people, and expatriate workers. Under the plan, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, tourists from 49 countries will be able to visit Saudi Arabia and its five UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The project saw an Etihad Boeing 787-10 used as a platform to test initiatives aimed at improving aviation in the future.  The ecoDemontstrator project has been running for some eight years since  an American Airlines Boeing 737 was first used in 2012. Since then, several new initiatives have been tested on various aircraft, including the 767 and 777.  Compact testing schedule:  Most recently,  a Boeing 787-10 was used for the tests. This aircraft is due to be delivered to Etihad Airways by the end of the month, meaning that the window for tests was reasonably tight. In total, tests were carried out over eight days, with the aircraft in Boeing's care for just 27 days from starting to install microphones to finishing removing equipment.  This testing was Boeing's most compact ecoDemonstrator iteration, and to ensure that everything went as planned, the entire testing program was meticulously designed virtually before the project.  Acoustic research:  Several big themes were running through this strand of Boeing's ongoing ecoDemonstrator project. The main one was to do with noise. Boeing partnered with both NASA and Safran for this.  You may notice that there seems to be a circuit board design on the aircraft's fuselage. However, this is an array of 214 microphones. Together with 1,000 microphones on the ground in Montana, over 50 maneuvers were conducted on 88 passes of the ground site, to measure precisely where noise is being generated on the aircraft.  The thinking is that if Boeing calculates this on its quietest aircraft, it can feed this into future designs that are even quieter. The remote Montana location was chosen as Boeing can avoid interference from other sources of noise such as industry.  At the same time, Safran was partnering with Boeing to test modified landing gears. Bright orange fairings were attached to the landing gear, bearing an aerofoil shape. 23 passes were made over the microphone array, with ground witnesses saying the fairings made a noticeable difference to the aircraft's noise.  This is a crucial area of research for Boeing, as the landing gear accounts for 30% of the noise generated as an aircraft comes into land.  Sustainable aviation fuels:  To prove the concept of sustainable aviation fuels, Boeing used them for the flight testing on the ecoDemonstrator. The aim was to show that large quantities of fuels could be made. As such, 50,000 US gallons of fuel were produced for the test.  The aircraft used a 50/50 blend, meaning that it is half biofuel and half regular fuel. This is the maximum permitted concentration of fuel according to certification requirements. The fuel was produced from inedible agricultural waste and can reduce an aircraft's CO2 emissions by 75% over its lifecycle.  As for the future of the ecoDemonstrator project? This Boeing 787-10 will now be reconfigured as a passenger aircraft and delivered to Etihad. Meanwhile, work will continue analyzing the data gathered and preparing for a future project.  While Boeing couldn't say what's coming next, ideas are underway. Around 1/3 of projects tested on an ecoDemonstrator have made it to fruition, such as the Boeing 737 MAX's wingtips. A further 1/3 remains under development, while the final third has been shelved for the time being.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/boeing-787-ecodemonstrator-conclusion/"}, {"title": "5th Saudia Boeing 787-10 Delivery Delayed", "date": "2020-10-13", "content": "The flag carrier of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Saudia, will have to wait for a little longer to receive its fifth Boeing 787-10 aircraft.

Since taking delivery of its 1st two Boeing 787-10s in the space of a week, the British flag carrier hasn't taken any further 787s, with brand-new aircraft going to desert storage in California instead.   Boeing  resumed 737 MAX deliveries in late 2020, though it wasn't long before the company had another issue on its hands. While the  Boeing 787 Dreamliner  model wasn't grounded as a whole, the American planemaker halted deliveries of its latest widebody for more than a year. Now, deliveries have resumed again, with  American Airlines  taking the first 787 since.  British Airways' 787 fleet grows:  British Airways  grew its Boeing 787 fleet slightly at the weekend, with the delivery of its third 787-10. The aircraft, G-ZBLF, was delivered on Saturday from Charleston, United States. This marked the first delivery of the type to British Airways since June 2020.  While some of British Airways' 787-10s have been sent to desert storage, this wasn't the case for G-ZBLF. Instead, it stayed put in Charleston, making one flight away from the Boeing plant to Myrtle Beach and several others taking off and landing in Charleston.  On Friday, the plane took off again, though this time it had a British Airways flight number instead of the previous BOE 109. BA9602 departed from Charleston at 19:18 local time. The plane headed across the Atlantic, touching down at its new London Heathrow home at 07:52 after seven hours and 34 minutes in the sky.  Two becomes three:  According to Planespottrs.net, the aircraft is now 1.4 years old, taking its first flight on April 28th, 2021. The plane's delivery means British Airways now has three Boeing 787-10s.   Readers may notice that the aircraft's registrations delivered to British Airways are not in consecutive orders. While Boeing has built the aircraft with intermediate registrations, these haven't been delivered. According to BOE Family Flights, seven British Airways Boeing 787-10s have so far been built. Three of the four undelivered aircraft were sent to storage but have since been removed.  British Airways has 12 Boeing 787-10 aircraft on order. This July, the airline's owner  IAG  indicated when the remaining nine aircraft would be delivered to the British flag carrier. In its most recent quarterly results, IAG revealed that all nine aircraft will be delivered between 2022 and 2024. Six more 787-10 aircraft are available as options should British Airways wish to exercise them. The airline's  Boeing 777X  fleet will follow from 2026, assuming no further delays to the program.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/british-airways-1st-boeing-787-delivery-2-years/"}]}]
