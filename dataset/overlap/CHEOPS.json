The contractor selection for the implementation phase is planned by mid-2014 and the launch is scheduled late 2017. The CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) will finely characterise known exoplanets and their parent stars with an unprecedented accuracy. The satellite will measure the orbit and radius of those exoplanets, enabling the scientists to assess their potential habitability. The mission will also act as a \"scout\" performing preliminary observations on targets for the future European Extremely Large Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope that will be capable of more detailed analysis. CHEOPS was selected from 25 missions proposed in response to ESA Call for Small Missions in 2012, which was targeting innovative small science missions that offer high value at low cost. CHEOPS is jointly developed by ESA and a consortium of Member States led by Switzerland: The Swiss-built instrument using a Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien optical telescope will observe the stars and their orbiting planets, while ESA is responsible for the provision of the satellite platform and the launch. Over the next 10 months SSTL will design the satellite platform, which will host the telescope payload. To provide the mission within a short schedule and at low cost, ESA asked that any solution be based on an existing, flight-proven, satellite platform. SSTL's solution is based on a variant of the highly successful SSTL-150 platform, which has seen recent service in Canada's Sapphire space surveillance mission and the 5-satellite RapidEye Earth observation constellation. In awarding the contract to SSTL, Frederic Safa, Head of Future Missions Office in ESA's Science and Robotic Exploration Directorate stated: \"We chose SSTL for this study for a combination of reasons such as their proven ability to build reliable low-cost missions and their past experience with satellites carrying high-performance optical telescopes.\" SSTL's Head of Science, Doug Liddle, commented: \"We are delighted that ESA selected SSTL to design the CHEOPS mission. We will draw on our experience to design a low cost, but high value solution that will demonstrate that ambitious science missions can be launched both quickly and economically.\" CHEOPS is envisaged as the first in a series of missions in the ESA Science Programme that will utilise small satellites for low cost and rapid development, in order to offer greater flexibility in response to new ideas from the scientific community and complement to the larger missions of ESA's Science Programme.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/esa-selects-sstl-to-design-exoplanet-satellite-mission/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Green light for CHEOPS", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "The hunt for exoplanets is launched.

The main objective of the CHEOPS mission is to monitor planetary transits by means of ultrahigh precision photometry on known stars that have planets orbiting them. The CHEOPS mission formed a very important part in the celebration of ESA's 50th anniversary at the European Astronomy Centre of ESA, in Madrid, in the presence of the President of the Spanish Government, Mariano Rajoy, and ESA's Director General, Jean Jacques Dordain. Also present at the event were the Spanish Minister of Industry, Jos\u00e9 M. Soria, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration, \u00c1lvaro Gim\u00e9nez, and the Spanish astronaut, Pedro Duque. In monitoring the brightness of a star, scientists will look for signs of \"transit\" of a planet as it passes briefly in front of its star. The satellite will thus be able to determine the exact radius of the planet. For planets with known masses, this will allow their density to be ascertained, providing an indication of their internal structure, formation and evolution. A second goal is to provide golden targets for in-depth characterisation using future ground (eg. European Extremely Large Telescope) and space-based (eg.

The main objective of the CHEOPS mission is to monitor planetary transits by means of ultrahigh precision photometry on known stars that have planets orbiting them. The CHEOPS mission formed a very important part in the celebration of ESA's 50th anniversary at the European Astronomy Centre of ESA, in Madrid, in the presence of the President of the Spanish Government, Mariano Rajoy, and ESA's Director General, Jean Jacques Dordain. Also present at the event were the Spanish Minister of Industry, Jos\u00e9 M. Soria, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration, \u00c1lvaro Gim\u00e9nez, and the Spanish astronaut, Pedro Duque. In monitoring the brightness of a star, scientists will look for signs of \"transit\" of a planet as it passes briefly in front of its star. The satellite will thus be able to determine the exact radius of the planet. For planets with known masses, this will allow their density to be ascertained, providing an indication of their internal structure, formation and evolution. A second goal is to provide golden targets for in-depth characterisation using future ground (eg. European Extremely Large Telescope) and space-based (eg. James Webb Space Telescope) spectroscopic facilities. \"The mission represents a challenge for both ESA and industry, as it requires a very demanding development programme in terms of design, quality and planning in order to achieve launch in 2017,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Auque, Head of Space Systems. \"I'm confident that our teams, building on their expertise in small Earth Observation missions such as Ingenio and Sentinel-5 Precursor will rise to this latest scientific challenge.\" CHEOPS is the first of the small-size (S class) missions of ESA, and was selected from 26 other proposed missions.

The mission is foreseen to launch in the last quarter of 2019. Cheops is a follow-up mission for the study of exoplanets. It will observe bright stars that are already known to host planets, measuring minuscule brightness changes due to the planet's transit across the star's disc. The mission will target stars hosting planets in the Earth-to-Neptune size range, yielding precise measurements of the planet sizes. This, together with known information about the planet masses, will allow scientists to determine their bulk density, enabling a first-step characterization of these extrasolar worlds. A planet's density provides vital clues about its composition and structure, indicating for example if it is predominantly rocky or gassy, or perhaps harbors significant oceans. \"We are very much looking forward to the beginning of our scientific adventure, and to follow-up on some of the known exoplanets in more detail,\" says Kate Isaak, ESA Cheops project scientist. Cheops will lift off as a secondary passenger on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket, sharing the ride into space with a satellite that is part of the Italian Cosmo-SkyMed constellation. The launcher will also carry five \"CubeSats,\" small satellites based on standardized 10 cm cubic units. This includes ESA's OPS-SAT, a 30 cm high satellite with a powerful computer to demonstrate improved mission control capabilities that will arise when satellites can fly more powerful onboard computers. The launch date will be announced once confirmed by Arianespace.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2019-07-cheops-shipment-site.html"}, {"title": "Europe's launch of space telescope called off at last minute", "date": "2019-12-17", "content": "Europe's space agency was planning to send a new telescope to study far-off planets into space Tuesday but the launch was called off at the last minute.

Cheops was launched in December to study and characterise planets outside our Solar System. And after a period of commissioning and testing, the orbiting observatory is now ready to fulfil its mission. Early targets for investigation include the so-called \"Styrofoam world\" Kelt-11b; the \"lava planet\" 55 Cancri-e; and the \"evaporating planet\" GJ-436b. Discovered in previous surveys of the sky, Cheops hopes to add to the knowledge of what these and hundreds of other far-flung objects are really like. The Swiss-led telescope will do this by watching for the tiny changes in light when a world passes in front of its host star. This event, referred to as a transit, will betray a precise diameter for the \"exoplanet\". When this information is combined with data about the mass of the object - obtained through other means - it will be possible for scientists to deduce a density. And this should say a lot about the composition and internal structure of the target. Kelt-11b has provided a good early demonstration. This is a giant exoplanet some 30% larger than our own Jupiter that orbits very close to a star called HD 93396. Kelt-11b is a seemingly \"puffed up\" world with a very low density - hence the comparison with expanded foam. From the way the light from the star dips when Kelt-11b moves in front to make its transit, Cheops' exquisite photometer instrument is able to determine the planet's diameter to be 181,600km (plus or minus 4,290km). This measurement is over five times more precise than was possible using a ground-based telescope. The European Space Agency (Esa) is part of the collaboration behind Cheops. Its project scientist Dr Kate Isaak lauded the performance of the new observatory. \"We have a very stable satellite; the pointing is excellent - better than requirements. And this is going to be a real benefit to the mission,\" she told BBC News. \"From the spacecraft side, from the instrument side, from the analysis of the data that we're getting - we can see that this mission has huge promise.\" Prof David Ehrenreich from the University of Geneva said quite a few early observations made with Cheops would be of \"super-Earths\". \"These are planets that are assumed to be rocky like Earth - but much bigger, more massive. And much hotter, too. Lava worlds,\" he explained. 55 Cancri-e fits into this category. More than eight times as massive as Earth, it takes just 18 hours to circle its parent star. Scientists believe it to have a global ocean of molten rock on its surface. About 80% of observing time on Cheops is reserved for the project consortium. Led from the universities of Bern and Geneva, this team has members in eleven European nations (with Esa as a partner also). The other 20% of time is being offered to the community at large. And the first of these external proposals will be studied in coming days. Cheops will look at a burnt-out, or white dwarf, star to see if there is any planetary material moving around it. Nobel Laureate Prof Didier Queloz, from the universities of Cambridge and Geneva, said the goal of Cheops was to improve our ideas for how planets were created. He told the BBC: \"We have built a whole theory of planet formation by observing only the eight planets of our Solar System, but by extending our observations to other kinds of planets that have no counterpart in our Solar System - we should be able to add the missing parts of this theory and get, let's say, a bigger perspective on how we actually fit in.\" Science planning for Cheops is run out of the Geneva; the telescope itself is controlled from Spain, at the National Institute for Aerospace Technology in Torrejon on the outskirts of Madrid. While the coronavirus crisis has meant considerable disruption for many space projects, Cheops has been largely unaffected. \"The completion of the test phase was only possible with the full commitment of all the participants, and because the mission has an operational control system that is largely automated, allowing commands to be sent and data to be received from home,\" said Prof Willy Benz from the University of Bern and principal investigator on the mission.

Cheops was launched in December to study and characterise planets outside our Solar System. And after a period of commissioning and testing, the orbiting observatory is now ready to fulfil its mission. Early targets for investigation include the so-called \"Styrofoam world\" Kelt-11b; the \"lava planet\" 55 Cancri-e; and the \"evaporating planet\" GJ-436b. Discovered in previous surveys of the sky, Cheops hopes to add to the knowledge of what these and hundreds of other far-flung objects are really like. The Swiss-led telescope will do this by watching for the tiny changes in light when a world passes in front of its host star. This event, referred to as a transit, will betray a precise diameter for the \"exoplanet\". When this information is combined with data about the mass of the object - obtained through other means - it will be possible for scientists to deduce a density. And this should say a lot about the composition and internal structure of the target. Kelt-11b has provided a good early demonstration. This is a giant exoplanet some 30% larger than our own Jupiter that orbits very close to a star called HD 93396. Kelt-11b is a seemingly \"puffed up\" world with a very low density - hence the comparison with expanded foam. From the way the light from the star dips when Kelt-11b moves in front to make its transit, Cheops' exquisite photometer instrument is able to determine the planet's diameter to be 181,600km (plus or minus 4,290km). This measurement is over five times more precise than was possible using a ground-based telescope. The European Space Agency (Esa) is part of the collaboration behind Cheops. Its project scientist Dr Kate Isaak lauded the performance of the new observatory. \"We have a very stable satellite; the pointing is excellent - better than requirements. And this is going to be a real benefit to the mission,\" she told BBC News. \"From the spacecraft side, from the instrument side, from the analysis of the data that we're getting - we can see that this mission has huge promise.\" Prof David Ehrenreich from the University of Geneva said quite a few early observations made with Cheops would be of \"super-Earths\". \"These are planets that are assumed to be rocky like Earth - but much bigger, more massive. And much hotter, too. Lava worlds,\" he explained. 55 Cancri-e fits into this category. More than eight times as massive as Earth, it takes just 18 hours to circle its parent star. Scientists believe it to have a global ocean of molten rock on its surface. About 80% of observing time on Cheops is reserved for the project consortium. Led from the universities of Bern and Geneva, this team has members in eleven European nations (with Esa as a partner also). The other 20% of time is being offered to the community at large. And the first of these external proposals will be studied in coming days. Cheops will look at a burnt-out, or white dwarf, star to see if there is any planetary material moving around it.

Launched in December 2019, Cheops is designed to observe nearby stars known to host planets. By ultra-precisely measuring changes in the levels of light coming from these systems as the planets orbit their stars, Cheops can initially characterize these planets - and, in turn, increase our understanding of how they form and evolve. The new finding concerns a so-called 'ultra-hot Jupiter' named WASP-189 b. Hot Jupiters, as the name suggests, are giant gas planets a bit like Jupiter in our own Solar System; however, they orbit far, far closer to their host star, and so are heated to extreme temperatures. WASP-189 b sits around 20 times closer to its star than Earth does to the Sun, and completes a full orbit in just 2.7 days. Its host star is larger and more than 2000 degrees hotter than the Sun, and so appears to glow blue. \"Only a handful of planets are known to exist around stars this hot, and this system is by far the brightest,\" says Monika Lendl of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, lead author of the new study. \"WASP-189b is also the brightest hot Jupiter that we can observe as it passes in front of or behind its star, making the whole system really intriguing.\" First, Monika and colleagues used Cheops to observe WASP-189 b as it passed behind its host star - an occultation. \"As the planet is so bright, there is actually a noticeable dip in the light we see coming from the system as it briefly slips out of view,\" explains Monika. \"We used this to measure the planet's brightness and constrain its temperature to a scorching 3200 degrees C.\" This makes WASP-189 b one of the hottest and most extreme planets, and entirely unlike any of the planets of the Solar System. At such temperatures, even metals such as iron melt and turn to gas, making the planet a clearly uninhabitable one. Next, Cheops watched as WASP-189 b passed in front of its star - a transit. Transits can reveal much about the size, shape, and orbital characteristics of a planet. This was true for WASP-189 b, which was found to be larger than thought at almost 1.6 times the radius of Jupiter. \"We also saw that the star itself is interesting - it's not perfectly round, but larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter,\" says Monika. \"It's spinning around so fast that it's being pulled outwards at its equator!

For a planet to have such an inclined orbit, it must have formed further out and then been pushed inwards. This is thought to happen as multiple planets within a system jostle for position, or as an external influence - another star, for instance - disturbs the system, pushing gas giants towards their star and onto very short orbits that are highly tilted. \"As we measured such a tilt with Cheops, this suggests that WASP-189 b has undergone such interactions in the past,\" adds Monika. Monika and colleagues used Cheops' highly precise observations and optical capabilities to reveal the secrets of WASP-189 b. Cheops opened its 'eye' in January of this year and began routine science operations in April, and has been working to expand our understanding of exoplanets and the nearby cosmos in the months since. \"This first result from Cheops is hugely exciting: it is early definitive evidence that the mission is living up to its promise in terms of precision and performance,\" says Kate Isaak, Cheops project scientist at ESA. Thousands of exoplanets, the vast majority with no analogs in our Solar System, have been discovered in the past quarter of a century, with many more to come from both current and future ground-based surveys and space missions. \"Cheops has a unique 'follow-up' role to play in studying such exoplanets,\" adds Kate. \"It will search for transits of planets that have been discovered from the ground, and, where possible, will more precisely measure the sizes of planets already known to transit their host stars. By tracking exoplanets on their orbits with Cheops, we can make a first-step characterization of their atmospheres and determine the presence and properties of any clouds present.\" In the next few years, Cheops will follow up on hundreds of known planets orbiting bright stars, building on and extending what has been done here for WASP-189b. The mission is the first in a series of three ESA science missions focusing on exoplanet detection and characterization: it has significant discovery potential also - from identifying prime targets for future missions that will probe exoplanetary atmospheres to searching for new planets and exomoons. \"Cheops will not only deepen our understanding of exoplanets,\" says Kate, \"but also that of our own planet, Solar System, and the wider cosmic environment.\"", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/extreme-alien-world-revealed-by-esas-exoplanet-observer/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "First planet spotted by Cheops spacecraft is an extreme alien world", "date": "2020-09-28", "content": "The European Space Agency's shiny new exoplanet-hunting satellite Cheops has made its first big observation since launching in December, and its target is not exactly the kind of place you'd want to visit.

The European Space Agency launched the Characterizing Exoplanet Satellite, nicknamed CHEOPS, in December; the spacecraft began science observations in April. CHEOPS isn't designed to discover alien planets, but rather to inform scientists so that they can construct portraits of the worlds. And, in the mission's first published results, scientists on the CHEOPS mission have done just that, forming a detailed picture of the planet WASP-189b, which was first detected in 2018. \"This first result from CHEOPS is hugely exciting,\" Kate Isaak, project scientist for CHEOPS at ESA, said in a statement. \"It is early definitive evidence that the mission is living up to its promise in terms of precision and performance.\" The CHEOPS observations suggest that WASP-189b is a strange world orbiting a strange star. Scientists had a hunch that might be the case, which is why mission scientists chose to study the planet so early in the spacecraft's tenure. The star is superhot, so hot it looks blue, and the planet is so close to the star it orbits in just 2.7 Earth days. \"Only a handful of planets are known to exist around stars this hot, and this system is by far the brightest,\" Monika Lendl, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland and lead author of the new study, said in the same statement. \"WASP-189b is also the brightest hot Jupiter that we can observe as it passes in front of or behind its star, making the whole system really intriguing.\" Observing a planet passing in front of its star is, at this point, fairly commonplace - the so-called transit technique is how NASA's venerable Kepler Space Telescope and its successor, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, spot planets blocking light as they pass in front of stars. Watching a planet pass behind its star is much more difficult, but WASP-189b is so bright that scientists can do just that. \"Because the exoplanet WASP-189b is so close to its star, its dayside is so bright that we can even measure the 'missing' light when the planet passes behind its star,\" Lendl said. \"It appears that the planet does not reflect a lot of starlight. Instead, most of the starlight gets absorbed by the planet, heating it up and making it shine.\" CHEOPS studied WASP-189 in March, April and June, catching the planet passing behind its star four times and in front of the star twice. From that data, scientists calculated some key features of the system. First, the researchers determined that the planet is pretty toasty, at about 5,800 degrees Fahrenheit - so hot that even iron would turn to gas. The scientists also calculated the planet's size: about 1.6 times the radius of Jupiter. The new CHEOPS observations also told scientists more about WASP-189's star. \"We also saw that the star itself is interesting - it's not perfectly round, but larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter,\" Lendl said. \"It's spinning around so fast that it's being pulled outwards at its equator!\" The star also seems to have lighter and darker patches on its surface. Unlike in our solar system, where planets orbit around the sun's equator, WASP-189b orbits its star at a dramatic tilt, bringing it close to the star's poles. That odd characteristic makes scientists suspect that the planet could have formed much farther away from the star, then some powerful gravitational force - perhaps another star - kicked the planet inward and askew. The CHEOPS scientists say that this sort of work is precisely what the telescope was designed to do: take a known exoplanet and give scientists a more detailed view of the world than a passing shadow. \"CHEOPS will not only deepen our understanding of exoplanets,\" Isaak said, \"but also that of our own planet, solar system, and the wider cosmic environment.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/strange-alien-planet-wasp-189b-cheops-discovery"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "First planet spotted by Cheops spacecraft is an extreme alien world", "date": "2020-09-28", "content": "The European Space Agency's shiny new exoplanet-hunting satellite Cheops has made its first big observation since launching in December, and its target is not exactly the kind of place you'd want to visit.

This is thought to happen as multiple planets within a system jostle for position, or as an external influence - another star, for instance - disturbs the system, pushing gas giants towards their star and onto very short orbits that are highly tilted. \"As we measured such a tilt with Cheops, this suggests that WASP-189 b has undergone such interactions in the past,\" adds Monika. Monika and colleagues used Cheops' highly precise observations and optical capabilities to reveal the secrets of WASP-189 b. Cheops opened its 'eye' in January of this year and began routine science operations in April, and has been working to expand our understanding of exoplanets and the nearby cosmos in the months since. \"This first result from Cheops is hugely exciting: it is early definitive evidence that the mission is living up to its promise in terms of precision and performance,\" says Kate Isaak, Cheops project scientist at ESA. Thousands of exoplanets, the vast majority with no analogs in our Solar System, have been discovered in the past quarter of a century, with many more to come from both current and future ground-based surveys and space missions. \"Cheops has a unique 'follow-up' role to play in studying such exoplanets,\" adds Kate. \"It will search for transits of planets that have been discovered from the ground, and, where possible, will more precisely measure the sizes of planets already known to transit their host stars. By tracking exoplanets on their orbits with Cheops, we can make a first-step characterization of their atmospheres and determine the presence and properties of any clouds present.\" In the next few years, Cheops will follow up on hundreds of known planets orbiting bright stars, building on and extending what has been done here for WASP-189b. The mission is the first in a series of three ESA science missions focusing on exoplanet detection and characterization: it has significant discovery potential also - from identifying prime targets for future missions that will probe exoplanetary atmospheres to searching for new planets and exomoons. \"Cheops will not only deepen our understanding of exoplanets,\" says Kate, \"but also that of our own planet, Solar System, and the wider cosmic environment.\"", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/extreme-alien-world-revealed-by-esas-exoplanet-observer/"}, {"title": "Strange alien planet has weird orbit and scorching temperatures", "date": "2020-10-04", "content": "Europe's new telescope studying alien planets has created its first detailed portrait of a world, and it's a weird one: hot and tilted around a warped star.

Cheops' mission is to stare at nearby stars and the planets orbiting them. Its first report is on the brightest \"hot Jupiter\" identified so far in the cosmos, a gas giant named WASP-189 b. \"Only a handful of planets are known to exist around stars this hot, and this system is by far the brightest,\" said astrophysicist Monika Lendl at the University of Geneva, in a statement. Lendl is lead author of a paper on the newfound planet published in the current issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics. To envision WASP-189 b, you need to imagine taking a gas giant like Jupiter and moving it much closer to the sun -- well within the orbit of Mercury -- like giving someone a front row seat at a theater. Or even a seat on the edge of the stage. The planet is so close to its star, WASP-189, that it completes a full orbit in under three days. To turn up the extremes even more, note that this star is larger and a few thousand degrees hotter than our sun, making it appear to glow blue. The hot Jupiter encircling it is perhaps better described as a barbecued Jupiter. Not surprisingly, this cosmic address doesn't lend itself to very pleasant weather on the surface of the planet, where temperatures can reach a toasty 5,792 degrees Fahrenheit. This makes WASP-189 b one of the most extreme and hottest planets discovered by astronomers so far, a place where even iron turns to gas. In a word, this place is mega-uninhabitable. \"We also saw that the star itself is interesting,\" adds Lendl. \"It's not perfectly round, but larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter.\" The star also spins on its axis so fast that it bloats outward at its equator. Adding to the weirdness is the inclined orbit of WASP-189 b, which traces a kind of diagonal across the face of its star, passing near its brightened poles. The hope is that studying this extreme system with its tilted orbits, hectic spinning and overheated relationship will help scientists understand hot Jupiters and other exoplanets better, leading us ultimately to new insights about our own planet and its role in the larger universe. And of course, there's the appreciation for Earth that comes when we add another horror show to the growing list of distant worlds out there that we don't have to survive on. **Correction, Sept. 28:** This story initially misstated Cheops' relationship to WASP-189 b. The satellite has investigated the planet, but did not discover it.

The finding, the very first from the mission, demonstrates Cheops' unique ability to shed light on the Universe around us by revealing the secrets of these alien worlds. Launched in December 2019, Cheops is designed to observe nearby stars known to host planets. By ultra-precisely measuring changes in the levels of light coming from these systems as the planets orbit their stars, Cheops can initially characterize these planets - and, in turn, increase our understanding of how they form and evolve. The new finding concerns a so-called 'ultra-hot Jupiter' named WASP-189 b. Hot Jupiters, as the name suggests, are giant gas planets a bit like Jupiter in our own Solar System; however, they orbit far, far closer to their host star, and so are heated to extreme temperatures. WASP-189 b sits around 20 times closer to its star than Earth does to the Sun, and completes a full orbit in just 2.7 days. Its host star is larger and more than 2000 degrees hotter than the Sun, and so appears to glow blue. \"Only a handful of planets are known to exist around stars this hot, and this system is by far the brightest,\" says Monika Lendl of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, lead author of the new study. \"WASP-189b is also the brightest hot Jupiter that we can observe as it passes in front of or behind its star, making the whole system really intriguing.\" First, Monika and colleagues used Cheops to observe WASP-189 b as it passed behind its host star - an occultation. \"As the planet is so bright, there is actually a noticeable dip in the light we see coming from the system as it briefly slips out of view,\" explains Monika. \"We used this to measure the planet's brightness and constrain its temperature to a scorching 3200 degrees C.\" This makes WASP-189 b one of the hottest and most extreme planets, and entirely unlike any of the planets of the Solar System. At such temperatures, even metals such as iron melt and turn to gas, making the planet a clearly uninhabitable one. Next, Cheops watched as WASP-189 b passed in front of its star - a transit. Transits can reveal much about the size, shape, and orbital characteristics of a planet. This was true for WASP-189 b, which was found to be larger than thought at almost 1.6 times the radius of Jupiter. \"We also saw that the star itself is interesting - it's not perfectly round, but larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter,\" says Monika. \"It's spinning around so fast that it's being pulled outwards at its equator!

CHEOPS looks at known exoplanets discovered by other missions and probes them in more detail, uncovering new information about these distant worlds. Here's what it discovered in its first year: Blurry stars: The first image taken by CHEOPS in February this year was not in fact of a planet, but a star - HD 70843, located 150 light-years away. The telescope took a deliberately blurry picture of this particularly bright star to check its brightness was properly detected, and all boded well. CHEOPS also imaged another star, HD 88111, which doesn't host any known exoplanets, but was useful as a test. That's because CHEOPS detect exoplanets by looking at stars and waiting for planets to pass in front of them, in an event called a transit. By observing the star dimming by a tiny amount, scientists can infer the presence of an exoplanet and calculate properties like its size and orbital period. A wispy puff: With the instruments confirmed to be working well, CHEOPS detected its first exoplanet in April this year. It looked to the star HD 93396, located 320 light-years away, around which orbits a planet called KELT-11b. KELT-11b is a large gas giant, being about a third larger than Jupiter but only one-fifth of its mass. That makes it one of the \"puffiest planets\" discovered so far.

However, they typically don't come in different shapes, as nearly every single planet ever discovered is thought to be spherical in shape - except for one. New data from the European Space Agency's Characterising Exoplanets Satellite space observatory, as well as data collected by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, has revealed the shape of an exoplanet that features many extreme characteristics. The CHEOPS data is the first time astrophysicists have ever detected the deformation of an exoplanet and provides valuable information into the internal structure of exoplanets. WASP-103b: The planet in question is WASP-103b, a super-Jupiter exoplanet located in the constellation Hercules. WASP-103b orbits the star WASP-103, an F-type main- sequence star that is located 1,800 \u00b1 100 light-years away from our solar system. WASP-103 is about 1.7 times larger than our Sun and is around 200 degrees hotter. WASP-103b has many unique features. Discovered in 2014, it is approximately twice the size and 1.5 times the mass of Jupiter, features an atmosphere that contains water, and orbits its star in less than a day. The exoplanet was discovered via the transit method, wherein a star is observed as an exoplanet transits it - allowing scientists to calculate the contents of a planet's atmosphere and its size. The extremely short orbital period of WASP-103b is the main cause of the planet's odd shape. The reason for WASP-103b's short orbital period is the distance at which it orbits WASP-103 - with the exoplanet's semi-major axis being an astonishing 0.01987 astronomical units - one AU being the approximate average distance between the Sun and the Earth. The smaller the orbit of a planet, the faster it will orbit its host star. Like Earth, WASP-103b experiences tidal tugging from its host star. However, WASP-103b's extremely tight orbit allows WASP-103 to exert a much stronger tidal force on the planet. This powerful tidal tug is what caused the deformation of WASP-103b. Astrophysicists and astronomers who have studied the WASP-103 system had for many years theorized that WASP-103b's star-hugging orbit would cause tidal deformation of the planet's crust. However, they hadn't been able to efficiently measure the exact amount of tidal force exerted on the exoplanet until CHEOPS' capabilities allowed them to do so. But how? CHEOPS is able to measure the specific properties of exoplanets by measuring the transits of exoplanets in front of the stars they orbit. As aforementioned, the transit method involved observing a star as an exoplanet crosses in front of it. When this occurs, the amount of light that is emitted by a star will dip and create a light curve, allowing scientists to measure characteristics including the shape, size, and atmospheric contents of the planet. Most telescopes are able to observe the transiting of an exoplanet; however, CHEOPS' advanced precision and flexibility allow it to observe very small changes in the light curve produced by an exoplanet transit event. This is precision is what allowed CHEOPS to observe the deformation in WASP-103b's shape. \"It's incredible that Cheops was actually able to reveal this tiny deformation,\" says Jacques Laskar of Paris Observatory, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sciences et Lettres, and co-author of the research. \"This is the first time such analysis has been made, and we can hope that observing over a longer time interval will strengthen this observation and lead to better knowledge of the planet's internal structure.\" Using the light curve CHEOPS produced from WASP-103b's transit of WASP-103, researchers were able to derive a value known as the Love number. The Love number measures the amount of mass and how mass is distributed within a planet. Having the Love number provides insight into the internal structure of a planet. The Love number derived for WASP-103b is similar to the Love number of Jupiter - hinting towards WASP-103b having a similar internal structure to Jupiter's, even though WASP-103b is around twice the radius of Jupiter. \"The resistance of a material to being deformed depends on its composition,\" explains the study's lead author, Susana Barros of Portugal's Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica e Ci\u00eancias do Espa\u00e7o and the University of Porto. \"For example, here on Earth we have tides due to the Moon and the Sun but we can only see tides in the oceans. The rocky part doesn't move that much. By measuring how much the planet is deformed we can tell how much of it is rocky, gaseous, or water.\" \"In principle, we would expect a planet with 1.5 times the mass of the Jupiter to be roughly the same size, so WASP-103b must be very inflated due to heating from its star and maybe other mechanisms,\" said Barros. Although the derived Love number provides some insight into the inner workings of WASP-103b, it is quite high, and there is still some uncertainty in the viability of the number. The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will work together with CHEOPS in the future to continue measuring the tidal deformation of WASP-103b and other exoplanets like it. \"If we can confirm the details of its internal structure with future observations maybe we could better understand what makes it so inflated. Knowing the size of the core of this exoplanet will also be important to better understand how it formed,\" Barros explained. On top of the strange deformation of WASP-103b, it also exhibits weird orbital properties with its star. Typically, when a planet as large as WASP-103b orbits extremely close to a star like WASP-103, the tidal interactions between the two bodies would gradually pull the planet's orbit closer to the star, until the planet is eventually engulfed by the star. However, the exact opposite is happening with WASP-103b. The measurements taken by CHEOPS of WASP-103b seem to show that the exoplanet is slowly drifting away from its parent star and that its orbital period is increasing. This would suggest that there must be a force stronger than that of WASP-103's tidal force pulling the exoplanet away from the star. Barros and her fellow researchers investigated several different scenarios that tried to tackle the question of what exactly is pulling WASP-103b away from its star. One of these scenarios involved a companion star to WASP-103 that would cause the effects the team saw in the data, while another scenario investigated whether or not an elliptical orbit could be causing the effects that the scientists observed. The team of researchers was unable to verify if any of the scenarios were correct, but they aren't ruling them out. In fact, the orbit of WASP-103b could not be increasing at all and actually be decreasing. However, to confirm this, further observations and transits of WASP-103b are needed. CHEOPS: CHEOPS launched on December 18, 2019, atop a Soyuz ST-A rocket, flight number VS23, from Kourou, French Guiana. The observatory is operated by the European Space Agency in an approximately-700-kilometer sun-synchronous polar orbit. The primary goal of CHEOPS is to measure the size of exoplanets orbiting stars throughout the universe. Being able to determine the size of an exoplanet allows teams to then estimate its mass, density, composition, formation, and other characteristics. Additionally, CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to studying exoplanets surrounding nearby stars that have previously been confirmed to have exoplanets. This allows CHEOPS to build off of previous research and data. CHEOPS is able to perform these measurements by observing the transits of exoplanets in front of their respective stars, allowing the observatory to create light curves which showcase the characteristics of the exoplanets it is studying. CHEOPS primarily targets exoplanets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range. \"The size of the effect of tidal deformation on an exoplanet transit light curve is very small, but thanks to the very high precision of CHEOPS we are able to see this for the first time,\" said Kate Isaak, ESA Project Scientist for CHEOPS. \"This study is an excellent example of the very diverse questions that exoplanet scientists are able to tackle with CHEOPS, illustrating the importance of this flexible follow-up mission,\" said Issak. As of January 2021, CHEOPS is a little over two years into its mission, which is expected to last three and a half years.

WASP-103b: The planet in question is WASP-103b, a super-Jupiter exoplanet located in the constellation Hercules. WASP-103b orbits the star WASP-103, an F-type main- sequence star that is located 1,800 \u00b1 100 light-years away from our solar system. WASP-103 is about 1.7 times larger than our Sun and is around 200 degrees hotter. WASP-103b has many unique features. Discovered in 2014, it is approximately twice the size and 1.5 times the mass of Jupiter, features an atmosphere that contains water, and orbits its star in less than a day. The exoplanet was discovered via the transit method, wherein a star is observed as an exoplanet transits it - allowing scientists to calculate the contents of a planet's atmosphere and its size. The extremely short orbital period of WASP-103b is the main cause of the planet's odd shape. The reason for WASP-103b's short orbital period is the distance at which it orbits WASP-103 - with the exoplanet's semi-major axis being an astonishing 0.01987 astronomical units - one AU being the approximate average distance between the Sun and the Earth. The smaller the orbit of a planet, the faster it will orbit its host star. Like Earth, WASP-103b experiences tidal tugging from its host star. However, WASP-103b's extremely tight orbit allows WASP-103 to exert a much stronger tidal force on the planet. This powerful tidal tug is what caused the deformation of WASP-103b. Astrophysicists and astronomers who have studied the WASP-103 system had for many years theorized that WASP-103b's star-hugging orbit would cause tidal deformation of the planet's crust. However, they hadn't been able to efficiently measure the exact amount of tidal force exerted on the exoplanet until CHEOPS' capabilities allowed them to do so. But how? CHEOPS is able to measure the specific properties of exoplanets by measuring the transits of exoplanets in front of the stars they orbit. As aforementioned, the transit method involved observing a star as an exoplanet crosses in front of it. When this occurs, the amount of light that is emitted by a star will dip and create a light curve, allowing scientists to measure characteristics including the shape, size, and atmospheric contents of the planet. Most telescopes are able to observe the transiting of an exoplanet; however, CHEOPS' advanced precision and flexibility allow it to observe very small changes in the light curve produced by an exoplanet transit event. This is precision is what allowed CHEOPS to observe the deformation in WASP-103b's shape. \"It's incredible that Cheops was actually able to reveal this tiny deformation,\" says Jacques Laskar of Paris Observatory, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sciences et Lettres, and co-author of the research. \"This is the first time such analysis has been made, and we can hope that observing over a longer time interval will strengthen this observation and lead to better knowledge of the planet's internal structure.\" Using the light curve CHEOPS produced from WASP-103b's transit of WASP-103, researchers were able to derive a value known as the Love number. The Love number measures the amount of mass and how mass is distributed within a planet. Having the Love number provides insight into the internal structure of a planet. The Love number derived for WASP-103b is similar to the Love number of Jupiter - hinting towards WASP-103b having a similar internal structure to Jupiter's, even though WASP-103b is around twice the radius of Jupiter. \"The resistance of a material to being deformed depends on its composition,\" explains the study's lead author, Susana Barros of Portugal's Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica e Ci\u00eancias do Espa\u00e7o and the University of Porto. \"For example, here on Earth we have tides due to the Moon and the Sun but we can only see tides in the oceans. The rocky part doesn't move that much. By measuring how much the planet is deformed we can tell how much of it is rocky, gaseous, or water.\" \"In principle, we would expect a planet with 1.5 times the mass of the Jupiter to be roughly the same size, so WASP-103b must be very inflated due to heating from its star and maybe other mechanisms,\" said Barros. Although the derived Love number provides some insight into the inner workings of WASP-103b, it is quite high, and there is still some uncertainty in the viability of the number. The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will work together with CHEOPS in the future to continue measuring the tidal deformation of WASP-103b and other exoplanets like it. \"If we can confirm the details of its internal structure with future observations maybe we could better understand what makes it so inflated. Knowing the size of the core of this exoplanet will also be important to better understand how it formed,\" Barros explained. On top of the strange deformation of WASP-103b, it also exhibits weird orbital properties with its star. Typically, when a planet as large as WASP-103b orbits extremely close to a star like WASP-103, the tidal interactions between the two bodies would gradually pull the planet's orbit closer to the star, until the planet is eventually engulfed by the star. However, the exact opposite is happening with WASP-103b. The measurements taken by CHEOPS of WASP-103b seem to show that the exoplanet is slowly drifting away from its parent star and that its orbital period is increasing. This would suggest that there must be a force stronger than that of WASP-103's tidal force pulling the exoplanet away from the star. Barros and her fellow researchers investigated several different scenarios that tried to tackle the question of what exactly is pulling WASP-103b away from its star. One of these scenarios involved a companion star to WASP-103 that would cause the effects the team saw in the data, while another scenario investigated whether or not an elliptical orbit could be causing the effects that the scientists observed. The team of researchers was unable to verify if any of the scenarios were correct, but they aren't ruling them out. In fact, the orbit of WASP-103b could not be increasing at all and actually be decreasing. However, to confirm this, further observations and transits of WASP-103b are needed. CHEOPS: CHEOPS launched on December 18, 2019, atop a Soyuz ST-A rocket, flight number VS23, from Kourou, French Guiana. The observatory is operated by the European Space Agency in an approximately-700-kilometer sun-synchronous polar orbit. The primary goal of CHEOPS is to measure the size of exoplanets orbiting stars throughout the universe. Being able to determine the size of an exoplanet allows teams to then estimate its mass, density, composition, formation, and other characteristics. Additionally, CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to studying exoplanets surrounding nearby stars that have previously been confirmed to have exoplanets. This allows CHEOPS to build off of previous research and data. CHEOPS is able to perform these measurements by observing the transits of exoplanets in front of their respective stars, allowing the observatory to create light curves which showcase the characteristics of the exoplanets it is studying. CHEOPS primarily targets exoplanets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range. \"The size of the effect of tidal deformation on an exoplanet transit light curve is very small, but thanks to the very high precision of CHEOPS we are able to see this for the first time,\" said Kate Isaak, ESA Project Scientist for CHEOPS. \"This study is an excellent example of the very diverse questions that exoplanet scientists are able to tackle with CHEOPS, illustrating the importance of this flexible follow-up mission,\" said Issak. As of January 2021, CHEOPS is a little over two years into its mission, which is expected to last three and a half years.

Tidal tug: We experience tides in the oceans of Earth mainly due to the Moon tugging slightly on our planet as it orbits us. The Sun also has a small but significant effect on tides, however it is too far from Earth to cause major deformations of our planet. The same cannot be said for WASP-103b, a planet almost twice the size of Jupiter with 1.5 times its mass, orbiting its host star in less than a day.
