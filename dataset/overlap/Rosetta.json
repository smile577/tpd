Originally scheduled for blastoff in January 2003, Rosetta was grounded by concerns with the Ariane 5 in the wake of a failed launch and missed its window to reach comet Wirtanen. After reprogramming the mission to target another comet, Thursday morning's initial launch attempt was thwarted by high-altitude wind conditions. While preparing for another countdown Thursday evening, the foam trouble prompted officials to halt the launch. This delay is expected to stretch into early next week. To make repairs and perform a thorough inspection of the main stage, the Ariane 5 must be rolled off the launch pad and returned to its assembly building. The rocket's main stage uses super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to feed the Vulcain 1 engine during the first 10 minutes of flight. The stage is covered with insulation to protect the cryogenic propellants inside -- a concept similar to the foam on space shuttle external tanks. There is not yet a sense of urgency to get Rosetta airborne. The available period in which the craft can embark on its trek to comet Churyumov- Gerasimenko extends to March 17. Rosetta will travel 10 years before arriving at its destination, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. A lander called Philae will separate from the Rosetta mothership and land on the comet's nucleus for detailed research. Comets are believed to be time capsules holding important clues about the birth of the solar system and its early development. The Rosetta mission seeks to understand the properties of comets and the processes that take place inside them. \"Working in unison, the lander and the orbiter will revolutionize our understanding of comets,\" Rosetta project scientist Gerhard Schwehm said. \"They will lead to amazing discoveries about the most primitive building blocks of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/ariane/v158/040227delay.html"}, {"title": "The launch of Rosetta is planned for early next week", "date": "2004-02-27", "content": "Arianespace Chief Executive Officer Jean-Yves Le Gall said today's launch was scrubbed after a routine pre-launch inspection found a small piece of foam that had broken free from the cryogenic core stage. This inspection - made at the mobile launch table on which Ariane 5 is installed - occurred several hours before the scheduled liftoff. The finding led to the creation of a team to review the situation - which eventually led to the delay. The small piece (approximately 10 X 15 cm. in size) apparently separated as a result of temperature changes that occurred with the fueling and de-fueling of Ariane 5's cryogenic stage. The stage carries 155 metric tons of the cold cryogenic propellant (liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen), and it was emptied after the first launch attempt was postponed on February 26 due to weather conditions. Ariane 5 will be moved from the ELA-3 launch zone back to the Final Assembly Building today, where the missing insulation will be replaced. A complete inspection of the thermal insulation will be made before authorization is given for Ariane 5's move back to the launch zone. Le Gall said the phenomenon of thermal insulation breakaway has occurred in the past, including on Ariane 4's cryogenic third stage. \"The situation is well identified and the repair is simple,\" Le Gall told reporters during a briefing this morning at the Spaceport. Both the launcher and its Rosetta comet-chasing spacecraft are safe and in good condition, he added.

Launched last March 2, Rosetta has now completed one revolution around the Sun in an orbit similar to that of Earth. Over the past year, European controllers have put the craft through a number of tests to verify the function of key systems and instruments, and no major problems were reported. Rosetta made its closet approach to Earth at 2209 GMT as it passed 1900 kilometers above Mexico. The fly-by will send the spacecraft into a larger solar orbit that will take it past Mars for another one of these \"sling-shot\" gravity boost maneuvers in February 2007, followed by two more passes by Earth. These planetary fly-by's save fuel that would otherwise have to be spent to propel the spacecraft toward its target comet. Controllers switched on some of Rosetta's scientific instruments in advance of the close approach to carry out calibration measurements of the Earth and Moon. Navigation cameras were also successfully tracked the Moon during the fly-by to test their ability to track objects in space. These cameras will be responsible for the rendezvous with Churyumov-Gerasimenko and for tracking as the probe passes by a pair of asteroids later in the mission. Rosetta also captured images of the Earth and Moon near the point of closest approach, but those pictures will likely not be available for a few more days. The European Space Agency also sponsored a contest for amateur astronomers to take pictures of Rosetta as it passed close to Earth. It was expected that small telescopes could distinguish the craft's 100-foot solar panels, and possibly its high-gain antenna. The fly-by also put Rosetta in position to be able to observe NASA's Deep Impact probe as it fires a small projectile into comet Tempel 1. The impact will reveal the comet's inner structure, and Rosetta will turn its instruments toward the comet to make additional observations. Rosetta is planned to be the first spacecraft to rendezvous with and enter orbit around a comet. These primordial relics from the formation of the solar system are believed to harbor materials dating back as far as 4.5 billion years. Rosetta will also release a lander to explore the comet at the surface.

A sequence of observations from today's Mars close approach were run successfully, providing an important test for the science observations of the comet nucleus to come. In addition to CIVA, the ROMAP instrument was also switched on, collecting data about the magnetic environment of Mars. The data sets acquired by both instruments are unique, as the presented image summarises for CIVA.

Launched three years ago, Rosetta zoomed just 150 miles above the Martian surface at about 22,500 miles per hour relative to the Red Planet. The probe made its closest approach at 0215 GMT Sunday as it flew behind Mars and temporarily broke off communications with Earth. Officials at the ESA Space Operations Center confirmed the speedy flyby was successful at 0257 GMT as telemetry from Rosetta began to again feed into the control room. The Mars flyby created a slingshot-like effect for Rosetta, putting the spacecraft on a path to reach Earth on Nov. 13 for a similar maneuver. \"We actually use this flyby to slow down the spacecraft to optimize the Earth gravity assist,\" said Gerhard Schwehm, Rosetta project scientist. Martian gravity was to have naturally slowed Rosetta by 4,900 miles per hour relative to the Sun, according to a European Space Agency statement. Rosetta already completed a pass by Earth in 2005, and the craft will fly past Earth two more times later this year and in 2009 to set up for a rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in early 2014. By bouncing across the solar system to utilize natural gravity assistance, Rosetta saves precious fuel that would be necessary to send the probe on a direct route to its destination. A suite of imaging instruments aboard Rosetta was commanded to observe the planet as the probe moved toward Mars, but the craft's payload systems had to be turned off about one hour prior to the flyby. Controllers were concerned Rosetta's batteries would be drained as the spacecraft passed behind Mars, which blocked the Sun's rays for about 25 minutes. \"Unfortunately, we will have to switch off the payload at closest approach as we will pass through an eclipse, a scenario Rosetta isn't built for,\" Schwehm said in an interview last week. In 2003, concerns with the reliability of the Ariane 5 rocket needed to launch Rosetta forced engineers to scrap the mission's original plan, and officials were forced to choose a backup comet for the spacecraft's new destination. The changes meant Rosetta would be subjected to more hazardous conditions during its voyage, including an unplanned eclipse during its swing by Mars, according to ESA. Rosetta's huge solar panels span nearly 100 feet tip-to-tip to gain efficiencies in power production in the outer solar system. The craft will be the first to fly beyond the asteroid belt and rely entirely on solar power. Schwehm, also head of ESA's Solar System Science Operations Division, said Rosetta's primary optical and infrared camera could have achieved an image resolution of about 12 feet as the craft swooped in for its closest approach. Despite the need to shut down Rosetta's powerful instruments, scientists still expected to get unique science opportunities from the flyby. The probe was to have downlinked the first ultraviolet measurements from near Mars, Schwehm said. Rosetta's optical and infrared camera, ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, and visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer conducted about four hours of extensive observations of Mars late Saturday before being prepared for the dangerous eclipse period. A package of plasma sensors also worked to observe the environment around the Red Planet. The instruments were turned back on to gather more data as Rosetta sped away from Mars Sunday. The flyby was also the first opportunity for Rosetta's 220-pound lander to conduct independent science observations. Imaging systems and a plasma monitor were kept on during the eclipse because the lander has its own power system, according to an ESA statement. The lander's camera captured spectacular images of Rosetta and Mars as the probe skimmed just above the planet's atmosphere. Called Philae, the tiny craft will be dropped onto the nucleus of Churyumov- Gerasimenko in November 2014 for several weeks of experiments. Philae carries nine science instruments and a small drill to retrieve samples from below the comet's surface. Rosetta will orbit Churyumov-Gerasimenko for more than a year of extensive science operations to observe the comet's changes as it approaches the Sun.

The probe performed its \"swing-by\" of the red planet early on Sunday, performing the second of four gravity-assisted manoeuvres that the ambitious craft will complete before reaching its target in 2014. The 3-tonne probe successfully rounded Mars close to the controllers' planned trajectory, at one point coming within just 250 kilometres of the planet's surface. Rosetta will ultimately catch and follow the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The craft is due to reach the comet's orbit in 2014 and send a lander to its surface to study its chemistry. Shadow of a doubt: Controllers had been concerned the probe might face difficulties as it passed through the Martian shadow, losing the solar power source of its instruments and leaving it reliant on a brace of tiny batteries. But after a 20-minute period, the probe emerged from the other side of Mars at around 0230 GMT. The spacecraft, named after the stone which unlocked the secrets of Egyptian hieroglyphics, builds on the success of earlier European comet chasers like Giotto. \"Europe has blazed the trail in terms of comet science,\" said David Southwood, ESA's director of science. \"To really understand the solar system we have to go back where it began and it began with comets.\" Sling shot: In order to reach the distant comet, the \u00801 billion probe must first pick up speed and achieve the right trajectory, accelerated and assisted by the four swing-bys which use the gravitational pull of planets as a boost.

The European Space Agency probe's narrow-angle camera apparently switched off as it closed in on the asteroid Steins, but the photo survey was ultimately \"asideline\" mission to the actual flyby and another camera worked perfectly, ESA officials said in a post-flyby briefing early Saturday at the agency's ESOC space operations center in Darmstadt, Germany. \"We were very conservative, perhaps too conservative,\" said Uwe Keller, principal investigator for Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, adding that the tool was putinto safe mode and was not damaged. \"Steins looks like a diamond in the sky,\" Keller added. The billion-dollar Rosetta satellite, carrying a small instrument package on alander that will attempt to land on a comet in 2014, came to within 500 miles of Steins as it hurtled through space at about 223 million miles from Earth. Fifteen instruments were trained on Steins. Much of the data will be delivered in the coming weeks,but Rosetta mission managers said Saturday that they have already downloaded enough data to say the flyby was a success. \"This was avery big test of the waters\" for Rosetta, which was launched in March 2004, said David Soutwood, director of science and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. \"Three hundred and sixty million kilometersis not just down the street. It is the first big step toward our grandexploration of asteroids and comets. They're small but important. Our solarsystem grew out of things like this. \" One of the flyby's most challenging aspects of the flyby was what ESA officials called a \"flip\" maneuver in which the satellite changed its attitude by 180 degrees for a brief period during the approach. AndreaAccomazzo, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said the maneuver, and the brief exposure of the temperature-sensitive underside of Rosetta to the sun,\"stretched the limits\" of what ground teams felt they could do toaccommodate scientists' desire to see Steins in full sunlight, from as close adistance as possible. Satelliteoperations managers and Rosetta scientists eventually agreed that 500 miles was as close as the satellite would be allowed to Steins. Mission managers hope that an analysis of the flyby data that will be arriving in the next few weeks will permit them to estimate Steins' age, in part from an examination of the many craters on its surface.

The command was sent from Germany on Wednesday, instructing the probe to enter a deep sleep. Only heaters and an \"alarm clock\" have been left running. Nothing will be heard from the spacecraft for the next two-and-a-half years - not even a reassuring beep. Rosetta should wake up at 1000 GMT on 20 January 2014. Assuming it does, the spacecraft will then be just a few months away from its appointment with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko out near the Planet Jupiter. The plan is for it to orbit the 4km-wide ball of ice and dust and put a small lander on its surface. \"The spacecraft may now be at rest but the team has a busy time ahead, getting ready for the meeting with the comet,\" said Dr Gerhard Schwehm, the European Space Agency's (Esa) Rosetta mission manager. \"I expect I will be a little nervous on 20 January 2014, and I might not sleep the night before - but I'll be really excited as well,\" he told BBC News. Remarkably, Rosetta caught sight of its quarry in recent weeks, even though the object is still more than 150 million kilometres away. The probe's onboard Osiris camera system, managed by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, succeeded in picking out the comet against a dense field of stars in the Scorpius Constellation.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13701808"}, {"title": "Comet-Chasing Probe Snaps First Photos of Icy Target", "date": "2011-06-20", "content": "A European spacecraft chasing a distant comet has caught sight of its quarry just before entering a planned 31-month slumber in deep space. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has been chasing the comet 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for more than seven years. In the last few weeks, Rosetta snapped its first images of the comet, ESA officials announced this month. Rosetta took a series of 52 pictures from a distance of about 101 million miles from comet 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Because of the vast distance, the comet appears as a single point of light. \"But the pictures already give us a good idea of where we are headed,\" Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, lead investigator for Rosetta's camera system, said in a June 8 statement. \"In addition, they are a remarkable proof of the camera's performance. We had not expected to be able to create first images from so far away.\" Mission scientists will have to wait a while for their second glimpse of 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or to hear anything else from Rosetta. The spacecraft went into a deep slumber on June 8, shutting down all of its instruments and most of its control systems. Only its computer and several heaters remain on. The hibernation period is no glitch. It was planned to help Rosetta save energy on its long cruise to the comet. The probe is so far from the sun - 341 million miles as of June 8 - that solar energy is tough to come by. Rosetta will rouse itself automatically in January 2014, to prepare for its rendezvous with 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in July of that year, researchers said. Chasing down a comet: The $1.4 billion Rosetta mission launched in March 2004. When it arrives at 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it will initiate a long-term, up-close study of the comet. Rosetta will orbit the icy wanderer for about 18 months, and it will drop a small lander called Philae onto the comet's surface. Comets are among the most primitive objects in the solar system, so researchers hope Rosetta's observations can help them reconstruct the early history of our cosmic neighborhood. The mission will also look for organic molecules on 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's surface, to investigate the possibility that a long-ago comet strike could have seeded Earth with the building blocks of life. 67-P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is about 2.4 miles across and completes one orbit around the sun every 6.6 years. Rosetta has been doing some science on its long journey to the comet. In 2008, for example, it made a close flyby of the asteroid Steins. And last year, it swung by the asteroid Lutetia, giving astronomers an unprecedented look at the 62-mile-wide space rock. Going to sleep: At 4 a.m. EDT on June 8, Rosetta automatically started spinning, which will stabilize the probe while its normal attitude control system is off throughout hibernation, ESA officials said. About five hours later, the final shutdown command was sent, and radio contact was lost with the probe, as expected. So now the mission team will wait until Jan. 20, 2014, when a timer will wake Rosetta and spur it to send a signal back to Earth for the first time 2 1/2 years. \"Hibernation is a necessary step to reach the final target,\" said Paolo Ferri, head of the Solar and Planetary Mission Operations Division at ESA's Space Operations Centre. \"We are now looking forward to 2014, when Rosetta becomes the first spacecraft to track the life of a comet as it arcs in toward the sun.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/12013-comet-photo-rosetta-spacecraft-hibernation.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta: 100 days to wake-up", "date": "2013-10-12", "content": "ESA's comet-chasing mission Rosetta will wake up in 100 days' time from deep-space hibernation to reach the destination it has been cruising towards for a decade.

Rosetta is chasing down Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where it will become the first space mission to rendezvous with a comet, the first to attempt a landing on a comet's surface, and the first to follow a comet as it swings around the Sun. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta has made three flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, encountering asteroids Steins and Lutetia along the way. Operating on solar energy alone, Rosetta was placed into a deep space slumber in June 2011 as it cruised out to a distance of nearly 500 million miles from the warmth of the Sun, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Now, as Rosetta's orbit has brought it back to within 418 million miles from the Sun, there is enough solar energy to power the spacecraft fully again. Thus today, still about 5.6 million miles from the comet, Rosetta's pre-programmed internal \"alarm clock\" woke up the spacecraft. After warming up its key navigation instruments, coming out of a stabilizing spin, and aiming its main radio antenna at Earth, Rosetta sent a signal to let mission operators know it had survived the most distant part of its journey. The signal was received by both NASA's Goldstone and Canberra ground stations at 19:18 CET, during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with Earth. It was immediately confirmed in ESA's space operations center in Darmstadt and the successful wake-up announced via the @ESA_Rosetta twitter account, which tweeted: \"Hello, World!\" \"We have our comet-chaser back,\" said Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez from ESA. \"With Rosetta, we will take comet exploration to a new level. This incredible mission continues our history of 'firsts' at comets, building on the technological and scientific achievements of our first deep space mission Giotto, which returned the first close-up images of a comet nucleus as it flew past Halley in 1986.\" \"This was one alarm clock not to hit snooze on, and after a tense day, we are absolutely delighted to have our spacecraft awake and back online,\" said Fred Jansen from ESA. Comets are considered the primitive building blocks of the solar system and likely helped to \"seed\" Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through its comprehensive in situ study of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets contained within. \"All other comet missions have been flybys, capturing fleeting moments in the life of these icy treasure chests,\" said Matt Taylor from ESA. \"With Rosetta, we will track the evolution of a comet on a daily basis and for over a year, giving us a unique insight into a comet's behavior and ultimately helping us to decipher their role in the formation of the solar system.\" But first, essential health checks on the spacecraft must be completed. Then the eleven instruments on the orbiter and ten on the lander will be turned on and prepared for studying Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. \"We have a busy few months ahead preparing the spacecraft and its instruments for the operational challenges demanded by a lengthy, close-up study of a comet that, until we get there, we know very little about,\" said Andrea Accomazzo from ESA. Rosetta's first images of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are expected in May, when the spacecraft is still 1.2 million miles from its target. Towards the end of May, the spacecraft will execute a major maneuver to line up for its critical rendezvous with the comet in August. After rendezvous, Rosetta will start with two months of extensive mapping of the comet's surface, and will also make important measurements of the comet's gravity, mass and shape, and assess its gaseous, dust-laden atmosphere, or coma. The orbiter will also probe the plasma environment and analyze how it interacts with the Sun's outer atmosphere, the solar wind. Using these data, scientists will choose a landing site for the mission's 100 kg Philae probe. The landing is currently scheduled for November 11, and it will be the first time that a landing on a comet has ever been attempted. In fact, given the almost negligible gravity of the comet's 2-mile-wide nucleus, Philae will have to use ice screws and harpoons to stop it from rebounding back into space after touchdown. Among its wide range of scientific measurements, Philae will send back a panorama of its surroundings, as well as high-resolution pictures of the surface. It will also perform an on-the-spot analysis of the composition of the ices and organic material, including drilling down to 9 inches below the surface and feeding samples to Philae's on-board laboratory for analysis. The focus of the mission will then move to the \"escort\" phase, during which Rosetta will stay alongside the comet as it moves closer to the Sun, monitoring the ever-changing conditions on the surface as the comet warms up and its ices sublimate. The comet will reach its closest distance to the Sun on August 13, 2015, at about 115 million miles, roughly between the orbits of Earth and Mars. Rosetta will follow the comet throughout the remainder of 2015 as it heads away from the Sun and activity begins to subside. \"We will face many challenges this year as we explore the unknown territory of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and I'm sure there will be plenty of surprises, but today we are just extremely happy to be back on speaking terms with our spacecraft,\" said Taylor.

Rosetta was reactivated Jan. 20 after a record 957 days in hibernation. U.S. mission managers are scheduled to activate their instruments on the spacecraft in early March and begin science operations with them in August. The instruments are an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a submillimeter spectrometer and radiometer and a plasma analyzer. \"U.S. scientists are delighted the Rosetta mission gives us a chance to examine a comet in a way we've never seen one before -- in orbit around it and as it kicks up in activity,\" said Claudia Alexander, Rosetta's U.S. project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"The NASA suite of instruments will provide puzzle pieces the Rosetta science team as a whole will put together with the other pieces to paint a portrait of how a comet works and what it's made of.\" Rosetta's objective is to observe the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko up close. By examining the full composition of the comet's nucleus and the ways in which a comet changes, Rosetta will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life. The ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, called Alice, will analyze gases in the tail of the comet, as well as the coma, the fuzzy envelope around the nucleus of the comet. The coma develops as a comet approaches the sun. Alice also will measure the rate at which the comet produces water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These measurements will provide valuable information about the surface composition of the nucleus. The instrument also will measure the amount of argon present, an important clue about the temperature of the solar system at the time the comet's nucleus originally formed more than 4.6 billion years ago. The Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter will identify chemicals on or near the comet's surface and measure the temperature of the chemicals and the dust and ice jetting out from the comet. The instrument also will see the gaseous activity in the tail through coma. The Ion and Electron Sensor is part of a suite of five instruments to analyze the plasma environment of the comet, particularly the coma. The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument. ROSINA will be the first instrument with sufficient resolution to separate two molecules with approximately the same mass: molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide. Clear identification of nitrogen will help scientists understand conditions at the time the solar system was born. U.S. science investigators are partnering on several non-U.S. instruments and are involved in seven of the mission's 21 instrument collaborations. NASA has an American interdisciplinary scientist involved in the research. NASA's Deep Space Network is supporting the European Space Agency's Ground Station Network for spacecraft tracking and navigation. Rosetta, composed of an orbiter and lander, is flying beyond the main asteroid belt. Its lander will obtain the first images taken from the surface of a comet, and it will provide the first analysis of a comet's composition by drilling into the surface. Rosetta also will be the first spacecraft to witness, at close proximity, how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. The potential research and data from the Rosetta mission could help inform NASA's asteroid initiative -- a mission to identify, capture and relocate an asteroid for astronauts to explore. The initiative represents an unprecedented technological feat that will lead to new scientific discoveries and technological capabilities that will help protect our home planet and achieve the goal of sending humans to an asteroid by 2025. \"Future robotic and human exploration missions to Mars, an asteroid and beyond will be accomplished via international partnerships combining worldwide scientific and engineering expertise,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington. \"Rosetta will provide an opportunity to study a small new world that could inform us on the best ways to approach, orbit and capture our target asteroid for a future human mission.\" The solar-powered spacecraft was placed into a deep sleep in June 2011 to conserve energy during the portion of its trajectory that carried it past the orbit of Jupiter. During Rosetta's hibernation, all instruments and subsystems were shut off, except the main computer including a spacecraft clock and a few heaters. ESA mission managers are beginning to commission the spacecraft and its instruments. \"The successful wake-up of Rosetta from its long, lonely slumber is a testament to the teams that built and operate the spacecraft, and the international cooperation between ESA and NASA ensured that we had some of the world's largest deep space dishes available to relay the first signal back to Earth,\" said Mark McCaughrean, senior scientific advisor in ESA's Directorate of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"There is still a lot of work ahead of us before the exciting cometary rendezvous, escort, and landing phase, but it's great to be back online.\" ESA member states and NASA contributed to the Rosetta mission. Airbus Defense and Space built the Rosetta spacecraft. JPL manages the US contribution of the Rosetta mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL also built the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter and hosts its principal investigator, Samuel Gulkis. The Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio developed the Rosetta orbiter's Ion and Electron Sensor and hosts its principal investigator, James Burch.

Rosetta is chasing down Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where it will become the first space mission to rendezvous with a comet, the first to attempt a landing on a comet's surface, and the first to follow a comet as it swings around the Sun. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta has made three flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, encountering asteroids Steins and Lutetia along the way. Operating on solar energy alone, Rosetta was placed into a deep space slumber in June 2011 as it cruised out to a distance of nearly 500 million miles from the warmth of the Sun, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Now, as Rosetta's orbit has brought it back to within 418 million miles from the Sun, there is enough solar energy to power the spacecraft fully again. Thus today, still about 5.6 million miles from the comet, Rosetta's pre-programmed internal \"alarm clock\" woke up the spacecraft. After warming up its key navigation instruments, coming out of a stabilizing spin, and aiming its main radio antenna at Earth, Rosetta sent a signal to let mission operators know it had survived the most distant part of its journey. The signal was received by both NASA's Goldstone and Canberra ground stations at 19:18 CET, during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with Earth. It was immediately confirmed in ESA's space operations center in Darmstadt and the successful wake-up announced via the @ESA_Rosetta twitter account, which tweeted: \"Hello, World!\" \"We have our comet-chaser back,\" said Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez from ESA. \"With Rosetta, we will take comet exploration to a new level. This incredible mission continues our history of 'firsts' at comets, building on the technological and scientific achievements of our first deep space mission Giotto, which returned the first close-up images of a comet nucleus as it flew past Halley in 1986.\" \"This was one alarm clock not to hit snooze on, and after a tense day, we are absolutely delighted to have our spacecraft awake and back online,\" said Fred Jansen from ESA. Comets are considered the primitive building blocks of the solar system and likely helped to \"seed\" Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through its comprehensive in situ study of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets contained within. \"All other comet missions have been flybys, capturing fleeting moments in the life of these icy treasure chests,\" said Matt Taylor from ESA. \"With Rosetta, we will track the evolution of a comet on a daily basis and for over a year, giving us a unique insight into a comet's behavior and ultimately helping us to decipher their role in the formation of the solar system.\" But first, essential health checks on the spacecraft must be completed. Then the eleven instruments on the orbiter and ten on the lander will be turned on and prepared for studying Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. \"We have a busy few months ahead preparing the spacecraft and its instruments for the operational challenges demanded by a lengthy, close-up study of a comet that, until we get there, we know very little about,\" said Andrea Accomazzo from ESA. Rosetta's first images of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are expected in May, when the spacecraft is still 1.2 million miles from its target. Towards the end of May, the spacecraft will execute a major maneuver to line up for its critical rendezvous with the comet in August. After rendezvous, Rosetta will start with two months of extensive mapping of the comet's surface, and will also make important measurements of the comet's gravity, mass and shape, and assess its gaseous, dust-laden atmosphere, or coma. The orbiter will also probe the plasma environment and analyze how it interacts with the Sun's outer atmosphere, the solar wind. Using these data, scientists will choose a landing site for the mission's 100 kg Philae probe. The landing is currently scheduled for November 11, and it will be the first time that a landing on a comet has ever been attempted. In fact, given the almost negligible gravity of the comet's 2-mile-wide nucleus, Philae will have to use ice screws and harpoons to stop it from rebounding back into space after touchdown. Among its wide range of scientific measurements, Philae will send back a panorama of its surroundings, as well as high-resolution pictures of the surface. It will also perform an on-the-spot analysis of the composition of the ices and organic material, including drilling down to 9 inches below the surface and feeding samples to Philae's on-board laboratory for analysis. The focus of the mission will then move to the \"escort\" phase, during which Rosetta will stay alongside the comet as it moves closer to the Sun, monitoring the ever-changing conditions on the surface as the comet warms up and its ices sublimate. The comet will reach its closest distance to the Sun on August 13, 2015, at about 115 million miles, roughly between the orbits of Earth and Mars. Rosetta will follow the comet throughout the remainder of 2015 as it heads away from the Sun and activity begins to subside. \"We will face many challenges this year as we explore the unknown territory of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and I'm sure there will be plenty of surprises, but today we are just extremely happy to be back on speaking terms with our spacecraft,\" said Taylor.

U.S. mission managers are scheduled to activate their instruments on the spacecraft in early March and begin science operations with them in August. The instruments are an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a submillimeter spectrometer and radiometer and a plasma analyzer. \"U.S. scientists are delighted the Rosetta mission gives us a chance to examine a comet in a way we've never seen one before -- in orbit around it and as it kicks up in activity,\" said Claudia Alexander, Rosetta's U.S. project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"The NASA suite of instruments will provide puzzle pieces the Rosetta science team as a whole will put together with the other pieces to paint a portrait of how a comet works and what it's made of.\" Rosetta's objective is to observe the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko up close. By examining the full composition of the comet's nucleus and the ways in which a comet changes, Rosetta will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life. The ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, called Alice, will analyze gases in the tail of the comet, as well as the coma, the fuzzy envelope around the nucleus of the comet. The coma develops as a comet approaches the sun. Alice also will measure the rate at which the comet produces water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These measurements will provide valuable information about the surface composition of the nucleus. The instrument also will measure the amount of argon present, an important clue about the temperature of the solar system at the time the comet's nucleus originally formed more than 4.6 billion years ago. The Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter will identify chemicals on or near the comet's surface and measure the temperature of the chemicals and the dust and ice jetting out from the comet. The instrument also will see the gaseous activity in the tail through coma. The Ion and Electron Sensor is part of a suite of five instruments to analyze the plasma environment of the comet, particularly the coma. The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument.

The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package for the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday (Aug. 6). If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will on that day become the first probe ever to orbit a comet - and, in November, the first to drop a lander onto the surface of one of these icy wanderers. \"For the first time, we will rendezvous with a comet, for the first time we will escort a comet as it passes through its closet approach to the sun and - the cherry on the top - for the first time, we will deploy a lander,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told Space.com via email. \"The rendezvous is therefore a key milestone in the mission.\" A long wait. The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.75 billion at current exchange rates) Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004, kicking off a long and circuitous journey through the solar system. The probe has swung around the sun five times and zoomed past Earth on three separate speed-boosting flybys, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. The probe was asleep during a decent chunk of its decade-long trip; mission team members woke Rosetta up in January to prepare for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record-setting 957 days of hibernation. Rosetta is homing in on the 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which takes about 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun. The comet's elliptical orbit takes it beyond Jupiter at its farthest point from the sun and between Mars and Earth at its closest point. The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets. Rosetta will provide some more deep-space drama in November, when the mother ship drops a lander called Philae onto the surface of 67P. Philae will drill into the comet to take samples and capture images from the surface of the body, ESA officials said. The Rosetta mothership and Philae will tag along with 67P as it approaches and then swings around the sun, noting how the cometchanges during the trip. The duo's observations should reveal a great deal about comet composition, which in turn should help researchers better understand solar system evolution, mission officials have said. (Comets are primitive and relatively pristine building blocks left over from the solar system's formation.) Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice. The European Space Agency's billion-euro Rosetta spacecraft caught up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko more than 400m km from Earth as it streaked towards the sun at around 55,000km per hour. The manoeuvre that brought the spacecraft alongside the comet marks the end of the beginning of a mission that lifted off from French Guiana 10 years, five months and four days ago. Rosetta now begins its scientific mission, employing a suite of instruments to analyse the comet's nucleus. The Rosetta mission will be the first to give scientists close-up measurements of a comet as it transforms from a cold and inactive state to an active body that sheds hundreds of kilos of dust and gas as it swings around the sun. The comet is in a 6.5-year elliptical orbit that comes within the orbits of Mars and Earth and back out to beyond the gas giant Jupiter. \"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4bn kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally, we are here,\" said ESA's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Wednesday's manoeuvre at 9am GMT was the last in a series of 10 burns that tweaked the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft in its approach to the comet. Images taken of the comet reveal an extraordinary rubber duck- shape, the result of two bodies fusing in what space scientists call a contact binary. Over the coming weeks, Rosetta will fly in a strange triangular orbit around the comet and map its terrain and gravitational field. Once mission controllers feel they understand the body, they will move Rosetta into a closer orbit within 30km of the surface. Sensors aboard Rosetta will gather and analyse gas and dust that start to spew from the comet as it becomes more active and develops a huge tail that could stretch for 1m kilometres. Mission controllers are working against the clock to identify a safe spot on the surface to place a small lander called Philae, which is hitching a ride on Rosetta.

The spacecraft will now track comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for a year, following it through its closest approach to the sun to monitor how the extra heating affects the icy surface. Nothing about this mission is ordinary, and these are no ordinary orbits. The weirdly shaped comet, which some have likened to the shape of a rubber duck, does not produce enough gravity to fully hold the spacecraft. Instead, the flight team will \"drive\" the spacecraft in triangular-shaped orbits, gradually lowering the altitude from today's 100km to around 30km. One of the most audacious space missions in decades, it is designed to reveal secrets about the origin of the solar system, the origin of our home planet and even the origin of life. From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public. This morning there were no red faces; just fantastic images, fantastic data and the promise of more fantastic science to come.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/aug/06/rosetta-comet-67-churyumov-gerasimenko-european-space-agency"}, {"title": "Success!

After a decade-long journey chasing its target, the European Space Agency's Rosetta, carrying three NASA instruments, became the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet. The last of a series of 10 rendezvous maneuvers that began in May, to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory to gradually match those of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, occurred on August 6, 2014. \"After 10 years, five months, and four days traveling towards our destination, looping around the sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometers, we are delighted to announce finally we are here,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's director General. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta are 252 million miles (405 million kilometers) from Earth, about halfway between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. The comet is in an elliptical, 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its farthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the sun. Rosetta will accompany the comet for over a year as it swings around the sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Rosetta is 62 miles (100 kilometers) from the comet's surface. Over the next six weeks, it will fly two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at the 62-mile (100-kilometer) altitude and then down at 31 miles (50 kilometers). At the same time, the spacecraft's suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scanning the surface to identify a target site for its comet lander, Philae. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 19 miles (30 kilometers) and, depending on the activity of the comet, may come even closer.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/rosetta-becomes-first-spacecraft-rendezvous-comet/"}, {"title": "Rosetta probe poised to touch and taste a comet", "date": "2014-08-13", "content": "THE Rosetta spacecraft made history last week when it became the first to orbit a comet, but it has no time to rest on its laurels. It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA Instruments on Rosetta Start Comet Science", "date": "2014-06-10", "content": "Three NASA science instruments aboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, which is set to become the first to orbit a comet and land a probe on its nucleus, are beginning observations and sending science data back to Earth. Launched in March 2004, Rosetta was reactivated in January 2014 after a record 957 days in hibernation. Composed of an orbiter and lander, Rosetta's objective is to arrive at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August to study the celestial object up close in unprecedented detail and prepare for landing a probe on the comet's nucleus in November. Rosetta's lander will obtain the first images taken from a comet's surface and will provide the first analysis of a comet's composition by drilling into the surface. Rosetta also will be the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. Observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life. \"We are happy to be seeing some real zeroes and ones coming down from our instruments, and cannot wait to figure out what they are telling us,\" said Claudia Alexander, Rosetta's U.S. project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Never before has a spacecraft pulled up and parked next to a comet. That is what Rosetta will do, and we are delighted to play a part in such a historic mission of exploration.\" Rosetta currently is approaching the main asteroid belt located between Jupiter and Mars. The spacecraft is still about 300,000 miles from the comet, but in August the instruments will begin to map its surface. The three U.S. instruments aboard the spacecraft are the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter, an ultraviolet spectrometer called Alice, and the Ion and Electron Sensor. They are part of a suite of 11 science instruments aboard the Rosetta orbiter. MIRO is designed to provide data on how gas and dust leave the surface of the nucleus to form the coma and tail that gives comets their intrinsic beauty. Studying the surface temperature and evolution of the coma and tail provides information on how the comet evolves as it approaches and leaves the vicinity of the sun. Alice will analyze gases in the comet's coma, which is the bright envelope of gas around the nucleus of the comet developed as a comet approaches the sun. Alice also will measure the rate at which the comet produces water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These measurements will provide valuable information about the surface composition of the nucleus. The instrument also will measure the amount of argon present, an important clue about the temperature of the solar system at the time the comet's nucleus originally formed more than 4.6 billion years ago. IES is part of a suite of five instruments to analyze the plasma environment of the comet, particularly the coma. The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package for the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument. ROSINA will be the first instrument in space with sufficient resolution to be able to distinguish between molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide, two molecules with approximately the same mass. Clear identification of nitrogen will help scientists understand conditions at the time the solar system was formed. U.S. scientists are partnering on several non-U.S. instruments and are involved in seven of the mission's 21 instrument collaborations. NASA's Deep Space Network is supporting ESA's Ground Station Network for spacecraft tracking and navigation. Rosetta is an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA.

Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with which the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will rendezvous in early August, sported a big dust cloud around its core in April and May. But photos taken by Rosetta's scientific camera on June 4 show no signs of such activity, and other observations reveal that the comet's brightness has dropped off as well, researchers said. \"The comet is now almost within our reach - and teaching us to expect the unexpected,\" the camera's principal investigator, Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"After its onset of activity at the end of April, our images are currently showing a comet back at rest.\" Comets tend to brighten and increase in activity when they approach the sun and warm up, as Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is doing now. But the icy objects are notoriously unpredictable, as 67P's current behavior demonstrates. Rosetta lauched in March 2004, beginning a long and looping trip to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is about 2.5 miles wide. Researchers woke the probe up this past January to prepare it for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record 957 days of deep-space hibernation. The spacecraft's epic journey is almost over.

The mission should give scientists an unprecedented up-close look at a comet and help them understand how the icy bodies change as they zoom close to the sun, researchers said. The data are already pouring in, as Rosetta's science instruments are back in action after the probe's long hibernation. \"It's great to have started regularly receiving science data, especially after a long, 10-year journey towards our destination,\" said Matt Taylor, the European Space Agency's Rosetta project scientist. \"The variable activity of the comet shows it definitely has personality, which makes us all the more eager to get there to learn just how it ticks.\" The Rosetta mission, whose total cost is 1.3 billion euros, is slated to end in December 2015.

If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will on that day become the first probe ever to orbit a comet - and, in November, the first to drop a lander onto the surface of one of these icy wanderers. \"For the first time, we will rendezvous with a comet, for the first time we will escort a comet as it passes through its closet approach to the sun and - the cherry on the top - for the first time, we will deploy a lander,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told Space.com via email. \"The rendezvous is therefore a key milestone in the mission.\" A long wait. The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.75 billion at current exchange rates) Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004, kicking off a long and circuitous journey through the solar system. The probe has swung around the sun five times and zoomed past Earth on three separate speed-boosting flybys, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. The probe was asleep during a decent chunk of its decade-long trip; mission team members woke Rosetta up in January to prepare for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record-setting 957 days of hibernation. Rosetta is homing in on the 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which takes about 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun. The comet's elliptical orbit takes it beyond Jupiter at its farthest point from the sun and between Mars and Earth at its closest point. The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets. Rosetta will provide some more deep-space drama in November, when the mother ship drops a lander called Philae onto the surface of 67P. Philae will drill into the comet to take samples and capture images from the surface of the body, ESA officials said. The Rosetta mothership and Philae will tag along with 67P as it approaches and then swings around the sun, noting how the cometchanges during the trip. The duo's observations should reveal a great deal about comet composition, which in turn should help researchers better understand solar system evolution, mission officials have said. (Comets are primitive and relatively pristine building blocks left over from the solar system's formation.) Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice.

The spacecraft will now track comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for a year, following it through its closest approach to the sun to monitor how the extra heating affects the icy surface. Nothing about this mission is ordinary, and these are no ordinary orbits. The weirdly shaped comet, which some have likened to the shape of a rubber duck, does not produce enough gravity to fully hold the spacecraft. Instead, the flight team will \"drive\" the spacecraft in triangular-shaped orbits, gradually lowering the altitude from today's 100km to around 30km. One of the most audacious space missions in decades, it is designed to reveal secrets about the origin of the solar system, the origin of our home planet and even the origin of life. From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public. This morning there were no red faces; just fantastic images, fantastic data and the promise of more fantastic science to come.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/aug/06/rosetta-comet-67-churyumov-gerasimenko-european-space-agency"}, {"title": "Success!

After a decade-long journey chasing its target, the European Space Agency's Rosetta, carrying three NASA instruments, became the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet. The last of a series of 10 rendezvous maneuvers that began in May, to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory to gradually match those of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, occurred on August 6, 2014. \"After 10 years, five months, and four days traveling towards our destination, looping around the sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometers, we are delighted to announce finally we are here,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's director General. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta are 252 million miles (405 million kilometers) from Earth, about halfway between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. The comet is in an elliptical, 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its farthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the sun. Rosetta will accompany the comet for over a year as it swings around the sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Rosetta is 62 miles (100 kilometers) from the comet's surface. Over the next six weeks, it will fly two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at the 62-mile (100-kilometer) altitude and then down at 31 miles (50 kilometers). At the same time, the spacecraft's suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scanning the surface to identify a target site for its comet lander, Philae. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 19 miles (30 kilometers) and, depending on the activity of the comet, may come even closer.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/rosetta-becomes-first-spacecraft-rendezvous-comet/"}, {"title": "Rosetta probe poised to touch and taste a comet", "date": "2014-08-13", "content": "THE Rosetta spacecraft made history last week when it became the first to orbit a comet, but it has no time to rest on its laurels. It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}, {"title": "Landing Site for Comet-Chasing Rosetta Spacecraft to Be Revealed Soon", "date": "2014-09-05", "content": "The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location.

If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11. The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck. This European Space Agency image shows the five candidate landing sites on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the Philae lander aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions. Philae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun. Predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface", "url": "https://www.space.com/27046-rosetta-comet-landing-site-target.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps a Selfie With Its Comet Companion", "date": "2014-09-12", "content": "It's official: A European spacecraft has snapped a robotic selfie with a comet in deep space.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object. European Space Agency researchers used a program called Microsoft ICE to stitch the four new Rosetta photos together. A few areas on the left needed exposure adjustments, and the whole image's contrast was enhanced a little, ESA officials said. Astronomers in Ukraine first spotted Comet 67P, which completes one lap around the sun every 6.5 years, in 1969. The object is unusually dark for a comet, most of which are reflective and covered in ice; so far, astronomers haven't spotted any ice patches on 67P. Achieving orbit around 67P was a cosmic first, and the Rosetta team plans to make some more history soon. The mission plan calls for Rosetta to drop a lander called Philae down onto the comet on Nov. 11. Philae will land on the smaller of 67P's two lobes to study the comet's surface and analyze its composition and atmosphere. Philae also has a drill, which it will use to take samples.

No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added. If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will deploy Philae at 4:35 a.m. EDT on Nov. 12, at a distance of 14 miles from the comet. Philae will spiral down slowly toward 67P, eventually securing itself to the surface with harpoons at Site J around 11:30 a.m. EDT that same day. Confirmation of the historic maneuver's success or failure will come 28 minutes and 20 seconds later - the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from Rosetta to its controllers here on the ground. It's also possible that Philae could touch down at a backup location called Site C, ESA officials said. Final confirmation of the landing plan will come on Oct. 14, after a formal review of data gathered by the Rosetta mothership. ESA will also launch a public competition to name Philae's landing site on that date.

Composed of an orbiter and lander, Rosetta's objective is to arrive at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August to study the celestial object up close in unprecedented detail and prepare for landing a probe on the comet's nucleus in November. Rosetta's lander will obtain the first images taken from a comet's surface and will provide the first analysis of a comet's composition by drilling into the surface. Rosetta also will be the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. Observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life. \"We are happy to be seeing some real zeroes and ones coming down from our instruments, and cannot wait to figure out what they are telling us,\" said Claudia Alexander, Rosetta's U.S. project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Never before has a spacecraft pulled up and parked next to a comet. That is what Rosetta will do, and we are delighted to play a part in such a historic mission of exploration.\" Rosetta currently is approaching the main asteroid belt located between Jupiter and Mars. The spacecraft is still about 300,000 miles from the comet, but in August the instruments will begin to map its surface. The three U.S. instruments aboard the spacecraft are the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter, an ultraviolet spectrometer called Alice, and the Ion and Electron Sensor. They are part of a suite of 11 science instruments aboard the Rosetta orbiter. MIRO is designed to provide data on how gas and dust leave the surface of the nucleus to form the coma and tail that gives comets their intrinsic beauty. Studying the surface temperature and evolution of the coma and tail provides information on how the comet evolves as it approaches and leaves the vicinity of the sun. Alice will analyze gases in the comet's coma, which is the bright envelope of gas around the nucleus of the comet developed as a comet approaches the sun. Alice also will measure the rate at which the comet produces water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These measurements will provide valuable information about the surface composition of the nucleus. The instrument also will measure the amount of argon present, an important clue about the temperature of the solar system at the time the comet's nucleus originally formed more than 4.6 billion years ago. IES is part of a suite of five instruments to analyze the plasma environment of the comet, particularly the coma. The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package for the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument. ROSINA will be the first instrument in space with sufficient resolution to be able to distinguish between molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide, two molecules with approximately the same mass. Clear identification of nitrogen will help scientists understand conditions at the time the solar system was formed.

Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with which the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will rendezvous in early August, sported a big dust cloud around its core in April and May. But photos taken by Rosetta's scientific camera on June 4 show no signs of such activity, and other observations reveal that the comet's brightness has dropped off as well, researchers said. \"The comet is now almost within our reach - and teaching us to expect the unexpected,\" the camera's principal investigator, Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"After its onset of activity at the end of April, our images are currently showing a comet back at rest.\" Comets tend to brighten and increase in activity when they approach the sun and warm up, as Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is doing now.

The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets.

Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice. The European Space Agency's billion-euro Rosetta spacecraft caught up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko more than 400m km from Earth as it streaked towards the sun at around 55,000km per hour. The manoeuvre that brought the spacecraft alongside the comet marks the end of the beginning of a mission that lifted off from French Guiana 10 years, five months and four days ago. Rosetta now begins its scientific mission, employing a suite of instruments to analyse the comet's nucleus. The Rosetta mission will be the first to give scientists close-up measurements of a comet as it transforms from a cold and inactive state to an active body that sheds hundreds of kilos of dust and gas as it swings around the sun. The comet is in a 6.5-year elliptical orbit that comes within the orbits of Mars and Earth and back out to beyond the gas giant Jupiter. \"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4bn kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally, we are here,\" said ESA's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Wednesday's manoeuvre at 9am GMT was the last in a series of 10 burns that tweaked the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft in its approach to the comet. Images taken of the comet reveal an extraordinary rubber duck- shape, the result of two bodies fusing in what space scientists call a contact binary. Over the coming weeks, Rosetta will fly in a strange triangular orbit around the comet and map its terrain and gravitational field. Once mission controllers feel they understand the body, they will move Rosetta into a closer orbit within 30km of the surface. Sensors aboard Rosetta will gather and analyse gas and dust that start to spew from the comet as it becomes more active and develops a huge tail that could stretch for 1m kilometres. Mission controllers are working against the clock to identify a safe spot on the surface to place a small lander called Philae, which is hitching a ride on Rosetta. The space agency aims to land Philae on 11 November. The box of electronics on legs will latch on to the comet with the aid of an explosive harpoon. With Philae in place, scientists will have their first opportunity to analyse material collected directly from the comet. The lander will also send x-rays through the comet's nucleus to sensors on Rosetta to reveal the inner structure of the body. Comets formed from debris left over in the early solar system around 4.6bn years ago. Through studying the make-up of a comet, Rosetta scientists hope to learn how the primordial ingredients of the solar system led to the formation of Earth and the other planets. Earth may have formed as a dry ball of rock and only later become enriched with water and organic compounds necessary for life. One theory that Rosetta will investigate is whether comets ferried water and carbon-containing molecules to Earth and potentially other planets in the solar system.

The spacecraft will now track comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for a year, following it through its closest approach to the sun to monitor how the extra heating affects the icy surface. Nothing about this mission is ordinary, and these are no ordinary orbits. The weirdly shaped comet, which some have likened to the shape of a rubber duck, does not produce enough gravity to fully hold the spacecraft. Instead, the flight team will \"drive\" the spacecraft in triangular-shaped orbits, gradually lowering the altitude from today's 100km to around 30km. One of the most audacious space missions in decades, it is designed to reveal secrets about the origin of the solar system, the origin of our home planet and even the origin of life. From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public.

It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}, {"title": "Landing Site for Comet-Chasing Rosetta Spacecraft to Be Revealed Soon", "date": "2014-09-05", "content": "The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location.

The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition.

In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions.

The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object.

No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added.

Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks. But, of course, it is much too early to be sure.\" Many properties of Cheops' boulder field are unknown. Scientists are examining what the rocks are made of, how dense they are and how they might have been created. It's possible that as the comet grows more active, the boulders will move around or become more visible to Rosetta's camera, team members said. The closest pictures of Cheops were taken from an altitude of about 9.3 miles, mission officials said. But on Oct. 9, Rosetta moved even closer to the comet to begin an imaging campaign that will take it just 6 miles above the surface. Rosetta, which launched in March 2004, will accompany Comet 67P for at least the next year to see how the icy object changes as it gets closer and closer to the sun. The mission is the first to successfully place a probe in orbit around a comet, and it will attempt to make some more history next month. On Nov. 12, Rosetta will deploy a small lander called Philae, which will try to make the first-ever soft landing on a comet.", "url": "https://www.space.com/27420-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-boulder-photos.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA Instruments on Rosetta Start Comet Science", "date": "2014-06-10", "content": "Three NASA science instruments aboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, which is set to become the first to orbit a comet and land a probe on its nucleus, are beginning observations and sending science data back to Earth. Launched in March 2004, Rosetta was reactivated in January 2014 after a record 957 days in hibernation. Composed of an orbiter and lander, Rosetta's objective is to arrive at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August to study the celestial object up close in unprecedented detail and prepare for landing a probe on the comet's nucleus in November. Rosetta's lander will obtain the first images taken from a comet's surface and will provide the first analysis of a comet's composition by drilling into the surface. Rosetta also will be the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. Observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life. \"We are happy to be seeing some real zeroes and ones coming down from our instruments, and cannot wait to figure out what they are telling us,\" said Claudia Alexander, Rosetta's U.S. project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Never before has a spacecraft pulled up and parked next to a comet. That is what Rosetta will do, and we are delighted to play a part in such a historic mission of exploration.\" Rosetta currently is approaching the main asteroid belt located between Jupiter and Mars. The spacecraft is still about 300,000 miles from the comet, but in August the instruments will begin to map its surface. The three U.S. instruments aboard the spacecraft are the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter, an ultraviolet spectrometer called Alice, and the Ion and Electron Sensor. They are part of a suite of 11 science instruments aboard the Rosetta orbiter. MIRO is designed to provide data on how gas and dust leave the surface of the nucleus to form the coma and tail that gives comets their intrinsic beauty. Studying the surface temperature and evolution of the coma and tail provides information on how the comet evolves as it approaches and leaves the vicinity of the sun. Alice will analyze gases in the comet's coma, which is the bright envelope of gas around the nucleus of the comet developed as a comet approaches the sun. Alice also will measure the rate at which the comet produces water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These measurements will provide valuable information about the surface composition of the nucleus. The instrument also will measure the amount of argon present, an important clue about the temperature of the solar system at the time the comet's nucleus originally formed more than 4.6 billion years ago. IES is part of a suite of five instruments to analyze the plasma environment of the comet, particularly the coma. The instrument will measure the charged particles in the sun's outer atmosphere, or solar wind, as they interact with the gas flowing out from the comet while Rosetta is drawing nearer to the comet's nucleus. NASA also provided part of the electronics package for the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Swiss-built Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis instrument. ROSINA will be the first instrument in space with sufficient resolution to be able to distinguish between molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide, two molecules with approximately the same mass. Clear identification of nitrogen will help scientists understand conditions at the time the solar system was formed. U.S. scientists are partnering on several non-U.S. instruments and are involved in seven of the mission's 21 instrument collaborations. NASA's Deep Space Network is supporting ESA's Ground Station Network for spacecraft tracking and navigation. Rosetta is an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA. Rosetta's Philae lander is provided by a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center, Cologne; Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottigen; French National Space Agency, Paris; and the Italian Space Agency, Rome.

Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with which the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will rendezvous in early August, sported a big dust cloud around its core in April and May. But photos taken by Rosetta's scientific camera on June 4 show no signs of such activity, and other observations reveal that the comet's brightness has dropped off as well, researchers said. \"The comet is now almost within our reach - and teaching us to expect the unexpected,\" the camera's principal investigator, Holger Sierks of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"After its onset of activity at the end of April, our images are currently showing a comet back at rest.\" Comets tend to brighten and increase in activity when they approach the sun and warm up, as Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is doing now. But the icy objects are notoriously unpredictable, as 67P's current behavior demonstrates. Rosetta lauched in March 2004, beginning a long and looping trip to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is about 2.5 miles wide. Researchers woke the probe up this past January to prepare it for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record 957 days of deep-space hibernation. The spacecraft's epic journey is almost over. Rosetta was 267,000 miles from the comet when it snapped the photos on June 4, and the probe is about 102,500 miles away now, researchers said.. Rosetta will meet up with 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in early August, then drop a lander called Philae onto the comet in November. If all goes according to plan, Philae will capture the first-ever images from the surface of a comet and drill into 67P to collect samples, which will reveal a great deal about the comet's composition. The mission should give scientists an unprecedented up-close look at a comet and help them understand how the icy bodies change as they zoom close to the sun, researchers said. The data are already pouring in, as Rosetta's science instruments are back in action after the probe's long hibernation. \"It's great to have started regularly receiving science data, especially after a long, 10-year journey towards our destination,\" said Matt Taylor, the European Space Agency's Rosetta project scientist. \"The variable activity of the comet shows it definitely has personality, which makes us all the more eager to get there to learn just how it ticks.\" The Rosetta mission, whose total cost is 1.3 billion euros, is slated to end in December 2015.

Clearly visible is the bright \"neck\" region connecting the two lobes of the nucleus, along with several other discrete bright patches.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday (Aug. 6). If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will on that day become the first probe ever to orbit a comet - and, in November, the first to drop a lander onto the surface of one of these icy wanderers. \"For the first time, we will rendezvous with a comet, for the first time we will escort a comet as it passes through its closet approach to the sun and - the cherry on the top - for the first time, we will deploy a lander,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told Space.com via email. \"The rendezvous is therefore a key milestone in the mission.\" A long wait. The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.75 billion at current exchange rates) Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004, kicking off a long and circuitous journey through the solar system. The probe has swung around the sun five times and zoomed past Earth on three separate speed-boosting flybys, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. The probe was asleep during a decent chunk of its decade-long trip; mission team members woke Rosetta up in January to prepare for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record-setting 957 days of hibernation. Rosetta is homing in on the 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which takes about 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun. The comet's elliptical orbit takes it beyond Jupiter at its farthest point from the sun and between Mars and Earth at its closest point. The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets. Rosetta will provide some more deep-space drama in November, when the mother ship drops a lander called Philae onto the surface of 67P. Philae will drill into the comet to take samples and capture images from the surface of the body, ESA officials said. The Rosetta mothership and Philae will tag along with 67P as it approaches and then swings around the sun, noting how the cometchanges during the trip. The duo's observations should reveal a great deal about comet composition, which in turn should help researchers better understand solar system evolution, mission officials have said. (Comets are primitive and relatively pristine building blocks left over from the solar system's formation.) Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice.

The manoeuvre that brought the spacecraft alongside the comet marks the end of the beginning of a mission that lifted off from French Guiana 10 years, five months and four days ago. Rosetta now begins its scientific mission, employing a suite of instruments to analyse the comet's nucleus. The Rosetta mission will be the first to give scientists close-up measurements of a comet as it transforms from a cold and inactive state to an active body that sheds hundreds of kilos of dust and gas as it swings around the sun. The comet is in a 6.5-year elliptical orbit that comes within the orbits of Mars and Earth and back out to beyond the gas giant Jupiter. \"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4bn kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally, we are here,\" said ESA's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Wednesday's manoeuvre at 9am GMT was the last in a series of 10 burns that tweaked the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft in its approach to the comet. Images taken of the comet reveal an extraordinary rubber duck- shape, the result of two bodies fusing in what space scientists call a contact binary. Over the coming weeks, Rosetta will fly in a strange triangular orbit around the comet and map its terrain and gravitational field. Once mission controllers feel they understand the body, they will move Rosetta into a closer orbit within 30km of the surface. Sensors aboard Rosetta will gather and analyse gas and dust that start to spew from the comet as it becomes more active and develops a huge tail that could stretch for 1m kilometres. Mission controllers are working against the clock to identify a safe spot on the surface to place a small lander called Philae, which is hitching a ride on Rosetta. The space agency aims to land Philae on 11 November. The box of electronics on legs will latch on to the comet with the aid of an explosive harpoon. With Philae in place, scientists will have their first opportunity to analyse material collected directly from the comet. The lander will also send x-rays through the comet's nucleus to sensors on Rosetta to reveal the inner structure of the body. Comets formed from debris left over in the early solar system around 4.6bn years ago. Through studying the make-up of a comet, Rosetta scientists hope to learn how the primordial ingredients of the solar system led to the formation of Earth and the other planets. Earth may have formed as a dry ball of rock and only later become enriched with water and organic compounds necessary for life. One theory that Rosetta will investigate is whether comets ferried water and carbon-containing molecules to Earth and potentially other planets in the solar system.

From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public.

It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}, {"title": "Landing Site for Comet-Chasing Rosetta Spacecraft to Be Revealed Soon", "date": "2014-09-05", "content": "The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location. Scientists with the European Space Agency will reveal the comet landing site target for Philae, a lander riding aboard the agency's Rosetta spacecraft, on Sept. 15. If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11. The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck. This European Space Agency image shows the five candidate landing sites on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the Philae lander aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions. Philae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun. Predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface", "url": "https://www.space.com/27046-rosetta-comet-landing-site-target.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps a Selfie With Its Comet Companion", "date": "2014-09-12", "content": "It's official: A European spacecraft has snapped a robotic selfie with a comet in deep space.

The image - released by ESA on Wednesday - gives viewers a new perspective on the spacecraft and comet flying far from Earth. The black-and-white photo shows one of Rosetta's solar wings from Philae's perspective on Sept. 7, with Comet 67P/C-G flying 31 miles away. Both the comet's smaller \"head\" and \"body\" are clearly visible in the new photograph. \"Two images with different exposure times were combined to bring out the faint details in this very high contrast situation,\" ESA officials wrote in a blog entry describing the photograph. \"The image was taken as part of the preparations being made for Philae, as the lander team gear up for the first-ever attempt to land on a comet.\" The Philae lander is expected to touch down on the comet's surface in November, and until then, it is flying with Rosetta near Comet Churyumov- Gerasimov. ESA officials are planning to announce the probe's primary landing site during an event on Sept. 15. Philae's CIVA instrument captured the image. CIVA is one of 10 instruments flying aboard Philae, according to ESA. Rosetta is carrying 11 scientific instruments. Scientists hope that Rosetta and Philae will be able to help them learn more about the mechanics of comets - bits of rock and dust leftover from the beginning of the solar system.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object. European Space Agency researchers used a program called Microsoft ICE to stitch the four new Rosetta photos together. A few areas on the left needed exposure adjustments, and the whole image's contrast was enhanced a little, ESA officials said. Astronomers in Ukraine first spotted Comet 67P, which completes one lap around the sun every 6.5 years, in 1969. The object is unusually dark for a comet, most of which are reflective and covered in ice; so far, astronomers haven't spotted any ice patches on 67P. Achieving orbit around 67P was a cosmic first, and the Rosetta team plans to make some more history soon. The mission plan calls for Rosetta to drop a lander called Philae down onto the comet on Nov. 11. Philae will land on the smaller of 67P's two lobes to study the comet's surface and analyze its composition and atmosphere. Philae also has a drill, which it will use to take samples.

No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added. If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will deploy Philae at 4:35 a.m. EDT on Nov. 12, at a distance of 14 miles from the comet. Philae will spiral down slowly toward 67P, eventually securing itself to the surface with harpoons at Site J around 11:30 a.m. EDT that same day. Confirmation of the historic maneuver's success or failure will come 28 minutes and 20 seconds later - the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from Rosetta to its controllers here on the ground. It's also possible that Philae could touch down at a backup location called Site C, ESA officials said. Final confirmation of the landing plan will come on Oct. 14, after a formal review of data gathered by the Rosetta mothership. ESA will also launch a public competition to name Philae's landing site on that date. The $1.7 billion Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004 and finally arrived in orbit around Comet 67P on Aug. 6 of this year. The Rosetta orbiter is studying the 2.5-mile-wide comet with 11 different science instruments, and Philae will contribute by photographing 67P's surface and collecting and analyzing samples. Comet 67P, which takes 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun, is now getting closer and closer to our star. Rosetta and Philae will continue to observe the comet and study how it changes as it warms up on its trek through the inner solar system.

Rosetta mission team members have named the 82-foot-tall boulder on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \"Cheops,\" after the largest pyramid in Egypt's famous Giza complex. The rock is much smaller than its namesake, however, which rises 456 feet into the Egyptian sky. Rosetta first photographed Cheops upon arriving in orbit around Comet 67P in early August. Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks. But, of course, it is much too early to be sure.\" Many properties of Cheops' boulder field are unknown. Scientists are examining what the rocks are made of, how dense they are and how they might have been created. It's possible that as the comet grows more active, the boulders will move around or become more visible to Rosetta's camera, team members said. The closest pictures of Cheops were taken from an altitude of about 9.3 miles, mission officials said. But on Oct. 9, Rosetta moved even closer to the comet to begin an imaging campaign that will take it just 6 miles above the surface. Rosetta, which launched in March 2004, will accompany Comet 67P for at least the next year to see how the icy object changes as it gets closer and closer to the sun.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present. The prime science mission is only supposed to last about 2.5 days and it will be on primary battery power. However, Philae has a second science phase planned that could last up to 3 months, which will be conducted using backup batteries that can be recharged by solar panels.

Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday (Aug. 6). If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will on that day become the first probe ever to orbit a comet - and, in November, the first to drop a lander onto the surface of one of these icy wanderers. \"For the first time, we will rendezvous with a comet, for the first time we will escort a comet as it passes through its closet approach to the sun and - the cherry on the top - for the first time, we will deploy a lander,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told Space.com via email. \"The rendezvous is therefore a key milestone in the mission.\" A long wait. The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.75 billion at current exchange rates) Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004, kicking off a long and circuitous journey through the solar system. The probe has swung around the sun five times and zoomed past Earth on three separate speed-boosting flybys, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. The probe was asleep during a decent chunk of its decade-long trip; mission team members woke Rosetta up in January to prepare for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record-setting 957 days of hibernation. Rosetta is homing in on the 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which takes about 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun. The comet's elliptical orbit takes it beyond Jupiter at its farthest point from the sun and between Mars and Earth at its closest point. The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets. Rosetta will provide some more deep-space drama in November, when the mother ship drops a lander called Philae onto the surface of 67P.

The Rosetta mothership and Philae will tag along with 67P as it approaches and then swings around the sun, noting how the cometchanges during the trip. The duo's observations should reveal a great deal about comet composition, which in turn should help researchers better understand solar system evolution, mission officials have said. (Comets are primitive and relatively pristine building blocks left over from the solar system's formation.) Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice. The European Space Agency's billion-euro Rosetta spacecraft caught up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko more than 400m km from Earth as it streaked towards the sun at around 55,000km per hour. The manoeuvre that brought the spacecraft alongside the comet marks the end of the beginning of a mission that lifted off from French Guiana 10 years, five months and four days ago. Rosetta now begins its scientific mission, employing a suite of instruments to analyse the comet's nucleus. The Rosetta mission will be the first to give scientists close-up measurements of a comet as it transforms from a cold and inactive state to an active body that sheds hundreds of kilos of dust and gas as it swings around the sun. The comet is in a 6.5-year elliptical orbit that comes within the orbits of Mars and Earth and back out to beyond the gas giant Jupiter. \"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4bn kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally, we are here,\" said ESA's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Wednesday's manoeuvre at 9am GMT was the last in a series of 10 burns that tweaked the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft in its approach to the comet. Images taken of the comet reveal an extraordinary rubber duck- shape, the result of two bodies fusing in what space scientists call a contact binary. Over the coming weeks, Rosetta will fly in a strange triangular orbit around the comet and map its terrain and gravitational field. Once mission controllers feel they understand the body, they will move Rosetta into a closer orbit within 30km of the surface. Sensors aboard Rosetta will gather and analyse gas and dust that start to spew from the comet as it becomes more active and develops a huge tail that could stretch for 1m kilometres. Mission controllers are working against the clock to identify a safe spot on the surface to place a small lander called Philae, which is hitching a ride on Rosetta. The space agency aims to land Philae on 11 November. The box of electronics on legs will latch on to the comet with the aid of an explosive harpoon. With Philae in place, scientists will have their first opportunity to analyse material collected directly from the comet. The lander will also send x-rays through the comet's nucleus to sensors on Rosetta to reveal the inner structure of the body. Comets formed from debris left over in the early solar system around 4.6bn years ago. Through studying the make-up of a comet, Rosetta scientists hope to learn how the primordial ingredients of the solar system led to the formation of Earth and the other planets. Earth may have formed as a dry ball of rock and only later become enriched with water and organic compounds necessary for life. One theory that Rosetta will investigate is whether comets ferried water and carbon-containing molecules to Earth and potentially other planets in the solar system.

The spacecraft will now track comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for a year, following it through its closest approach to the sun to monitor how the extra heating affects the icy surface. Nothing about this mission is ordinary, and these are no ordinary orbits. The weirdly shaped comet, which some have likened to the shape of a rubber duck, does not produce enough gravity to fully hold the spacecraft. Instead, the flight team will \"drive\" the spacecraft in triangular-shaped orbits, gradually lowering the altitude from today's 100km to around 30km. One of the most audacious space missions in decades, it is designed to reveal secrets about the origin of the solar system, the origin of our home planet and even the origin of life. From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public.

The last of a series of 10 rendezvous maneuvers that began in May, to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory to gradually match those of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, occurred on August 6, 2014. \"After 10 years, five months, and four days traveling towards our destination, looping around the sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometers, we are delighted to announce finally we are here,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's director General.

It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}, {"title": "Landing Site for Comet-Chasing Rosetta Spacecraft to Be Revealed Soon", "date": "2014-09-05", "content": "The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location.

If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11. The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck.

ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions. Philae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun. Predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface", "url": "https://www.space.com/27046-rosetta-comet-landing-site-target.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps a Selfie With Its Comet Companion", "date": "2014-09-12", "content": "It's official: A European spacecraft has snapped a robotic selfie with a comet in deep space.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object. European Space Agency researchers used a program called Microsoft ICE to stitch the four new Rosetta photos together. A few areas on the left needed exposure adjustments, and the whole image's contrast was enhanced a little, ESA officials said. Astronomers in Ukraine first spotted Comet 67P, which completes one lap around the sun every 6.5 years, in 1969.

No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added.

The rock is much smaller than its namesake, however, which rises 456 feet into the Egyptian sky. Rosetta first photographed Cheops upon arriving in orbit around Comet 67P in early August. Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present.

However, Philae has a second science phase planned that could last up to 3 months, which will be conducted using backup batteries that can be recharged by solar panels.

In the hours after the 11:03 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time touchdown, European scientists and engineers struggled to make sense of how stably the lander was resting on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Radio connections between the lander and the orbiter were tenuous, solar power generation was fluctuating, and the lander was not anchored by two harpoons that were supposed to have fired on touchdown. It was even possible that the lander, called Philae, had slipped or bounced\u2014but not hard enough to fling it back into the void. Stephan Ulamec, the Philae project manager for the European Space Agency (ESA), said that the lander's scientific instruments were taking data and that he was confident Philae would live for another day. \"Maybe today, we didn't just land once, but twice,\" he said at a press briefing at ESA's control center here. In addition to being a first for humanity, the \u20ac1.4 billion Rosetta mission marked a strikingly ambitious effort for ESA's planetary exploration program. It was the first successful landing for the agency since January 2005, when ESA dropped the Huygens probe onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. To a packed audience here, ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain celebrated the historic aspect of the comet landing with obvious pride. \"We're the first to have done that, and it will stay that way forever,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.science.org/content/article/rosetta-missions-lander-settles-comet-and-makes-history"}, {"title": "Sleep now for Rosetta's comet probe after a bouncy landing", "date": "2014-11-18", "content": "The European Space Agency's pioneering Rosetta mission to land on a comet has been wildly successful, but now it appears that part of its aim, the exploration of the surface by the little Philae lander, may have been cut short. Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

The European space probe used its high-powered camera OSIRIS to create the stunning \"true color\" photo of the Manhattan-sized comet. But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

There are six hours of daylight on the comet, but because of the cliff's shadow, Philae's only receiving four and a half hours. By February or March, the lander should receive enough sunlight shining at more direct angles to power it up. Although it looks like Philae will be able to survive the bitter cold until then, no one knows exactly when that will be. Rosetta's OSIRIS camera has taken even more photos of the comet, but because the spacecraft is currently trying to download so much data, mission scientists have to wait to see them.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Wednesday (Aug. 6). If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will on that day become the first probe ever to orbit a comet - and, in November, the first to drop a lander onto the surface of one of these icy wanderers. \"For the first time, we will rendezvous with a comet, for the first time we will escort a comet as it passes through its closet approach to the sun and - the cherry on the top - for the first time, we will deploy a lander,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told Space.com via email. \"The rendezvous is therefore a key milestone in the mission.\" A long wait. The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.75 billion at current exchange rates) Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004, kicking off a long and circuitous journey through the solar system. The probe has swung around the sun five times and zoomed past Earth on three separate speed-boosting flybys, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. The probe was asleep during a decent chunk of its decade-long trip; mission team members woke Rosetta up in January to prepare for the upcoming rendezvous, ending a record-setting 957 days of hibernation. Rosetta is homing in on the 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which takes about 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun. The comet's elliptical orbit takes it beyond Jupiter at its farthest point from the sun and between Mars and Earth at its closest point. The rendezvous operation actually consists of 10 different maneuvers, which began in early May and will conclude with a final engine burn on Wednesday. These moves will end up slowing Rosetta's speed relative to 67P from 1,790 mph (2,880 km/h) at the end of the probe's hibernation to 2 mph (3 km/h) - walking speed - at the time of orbital insertion, Taylor said. \"It is challenging; it's never been done before,\" Taylor said. \"Other comet missions have been flybys at high speed and about 100 kilometers or more distance.\" Learning about comets. Rosetta will provide some more deep-space drama in November, when the mother ship drops a lander called Philae onto the surface of 67P. Philae will drill into the comet to take samples and capture images from the surface of the body, ESA officials said. The Rosetta mothership and Philae will tag along with 67P as it approaches and then swings around the sun, noting how the cometchanges during the trip. The duo's observations should reveal a great deal about comet composition, which in turn should help researchers better understand solar system evolution, mission officials have said. (Comets are primitive and relatively pristine building blocks left over from the solar system's formation.) Taylor and other mission team members are very much looking forward to this \"escort phase,\" which is slated to run from Wednesday through the end of the nominal mission in December 2015. \"All the time we are looking, and sniffing the comet, and with the lander (over a shorter time period) scratching and sniffing,\" Taylor said. \"All this will provide us with an unprecedented view of a comet, its nucleus and coma and how this all works!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/26722-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-rendezvous-this-week.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta arrives at comet destination", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "After a decade-long journey chasing its target, ESA's Rosetta has today become the first spacecraft to rendezvous with a comet, opening a new chapter in Solar System exploration. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and Rosetta now lie 405 million kilometres from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, rushing towards the inner Solar System at nearly 55 000 kilometres per hour. The comet is in an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its furthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the Sun. Rosetta will accompany it for over a year as they swing around the Sun and back out towards Jupiter again. Comets are considered to be primitive building blocks of the Solar System and may have helped to 'seed' Earth with water, perhaps even the ingredients for life. But many fundamental questions about these enigmatic objects remain, and through a comprehensive,in situstudy of the comet, Rosetta aims to unlock the secrets within. The journey to the comet was not straightforward, however. Since its launch in 2004, Rosetta had to make three gravity-assist flybys of Earth and one of Mars to help it on course to its rendezvous with the comet. This complex course also allowed Rosetta to pass by asteroids \u0160teins and Lutetia, obtaining unprecedented views and scientific data on these two objects. \"After ten years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\" says Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Today saw the last of a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres that began in May to adjust Rosetta's speed and trajectory gradually to match those of the comet. If any of these manoeuvres had failed, the mission would have been lost, and the spacecraft would simply have flown by the comet. \"Today's achievement is a result of a huge international endeavour spanning several decades,\" says Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. \"We have come an extraordinarily long way since the mission concept was first discussed in the late 1970s and approved in 1993, and now we are ready to open a treasure chest of scientific discovery that is destined to rewrite the textbooks on comets for even more decades to come.\" The comet began to reveal its personality while Rosetta was on its approach. Images taken by the OSIRIS camera between late April and early June showed that its activity was variable. The comet's 'coma' - an extended envelope of gas and dust - became rapidly brighter and then died down again over the course of those six weeks. In the same period, first measurements from the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter, MIRO, suggested that the comet was emitting water vapour into space at about 300 millilitres per second. Meanwhile, the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, VIRTIS, measured the comet's average temperature to be about -70\u00baC, indicating that the surface is predominantly dark and dusty rather than clean and icy. Then, stunning images taken from a distance of about 12 000 km began to reveal that the nucleus comprises two distinct segments joined by a 'neck', giving it a duck-like appearance. Subsequent images showed more and more detail - the most recent, highest-resolution image was downloaded from the spacecraft earlier today and will be available this afternoon. \"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System's history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time? Rosetta, by design, is in the best place to study one of these unique objects.\" Today, Rosetta is just 100 km from the comet's surface, but it will edge closer still. Over the next six weeks, it will describe two triangular-shaped trajectories in front of the comet, first at a distance of 100 km and then at 50 km. At the same time, more of the suite of instruments will provide a detailed scientific study of the comet, scrutinising the surface for a target site for the Philae lander. Eventually, Rosetta will attempt a close, near-circular orbit at 30 km and, depending on the activity of the comet, perhaps come even closer. \"Arriving at the comet is really only just the beginning of an even bigger adventure, with greater challenges still to come as we learn how to operate in this unchartered environment, start to orbit and, eventually, land,\" says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. As many as five possible landing sites will be identified by late August, before the primary site is identified in mid-September. The final timeline for the sequence of events for deploying Philae - currently expected for 11 November - will be confirmed by the middle of October. \"Over the next few months, in addition to characterising the comet nucleus and setting the bar for the rest of the mission, we will begin final preparations for another space history first: landing on a comet,\" says Matt. \"After landing, Rosetta will continue to accompany the comet until its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and beyond, watching its behaviour from close quarters to give us a unique insight and realtime experience of how a comet works as it hurtles around the Sun.\" ", "url": "https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination"}, {"title": "Rosetta spacecraft makes historic rendezvous with rubber-duck comet 67P/CG", "date": "2014-08-06", "content": "A European spacecraft has become the first in history to rendezvous with a comet after a seven-minute burn of the probe's thrusters brought it within 100km of the hurtling lump of dust and ice.

The manoeuvre that brought the spacecraft alongside the comet marks the end of the beginning of a mission that lifted off from French Guiana 10 years, five months and four days ago. Rosetta now begins its scientific mission, employing a suite of instruments to analyse the comet's nucleus. The Rosetta mission will be the first to give scientists close-up measurements of a comet as it transforms from a cold and inactive state to an active body that sheds hundreds of kilos of dust and gas as it swings around the sun. The comet is in a 6.5-year elliptical orbit that comes within the orbits of Mars and Earth and back out to beyond the gas giant Jupiter. \"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4bn kilometres, we are delighted to announce finally, we are here,\" said ESA's director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start.\" Wednesday's manoeuvre at 9am GMT was the last in a series of 10 burns that tweaked the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft in its approach to the comet. Images taken of the comet reveal an extraordinary rubber duck- shape, the result of two bodies fusing in what space scientists call a contact binary. Over the coming weeks, Rosetta will fly in a strange triangular orbit around the comet and map its terrain and gravitational field. Once mission controllers feel they understand the body, they will move Rosetta into a closer orbit within 30km of the surface. Sensors aboard Rosetta will gather and analyse gas and dust that start to spew from the comet as it becomes more active and develops a huge tail that could stretch for 1m kilometres. Mission controllers are working against the clock to identify a safe spot on the surface to place a small lander called Philae, which is hitching a ride on Rosetta. The space agency aims to land Philae on 11 November. The box of electronics on legs will latch on to the comet with the aid of an explosive harpoon. With Philae in place, scientists will have their first opportunity to analyse material collected directly from the comet. The lander will also send x-rays through the comet's nucleus to sensors on Rosetta to reveal the inner structure of the body. Comets formed from debris left over in the early solar system around 4.6bn years ago. Through studying the make-up of a comet, Rosetta scientists hope to learn how the primordial ingredients of the solar system led to the formation of Earth and the other planets. Earth may have formed as a dry ball of rock and only later become enriched with water and organic compounds necessary for life. One theory that Rosetta will investigate is whether comets ferried water and carbon-containing molecules to Earth and potentially other planets in the solar system.

From a PR point of view, today's triumphant rendezvous stands in stark contrast to the last time the European Space Agency mounted a comet mission. That was back in 1986. The mission was called Giotto and the comet was the famous one named after Edmond Halley, the 18th century astronomer who predicted its return. Back then, the venerable TV astronomer Patrick Moore and James Burke conducted a live programme to bring the first pictures of the comet to the British public as they were received. Moore was in Darmstadt, Germany, where Esa's mission control is located, and Burke was in London. Viewers were promised the first ever view of the nucleus of a comet - the mountainous iceberg that evaporates to give the ghostly tails for which comets are famous. The snag was that when the pictures arrived they were incomprehensible. They were garishly colour-coded, and not even the experts could interpret them. No one knew at the time the beauty of the comet that would be revealed by subsequent analysis. Then, just around the time of closest approach, the signal from the spacecraft disappeared. The guests were left with no recourse but to speculate about whether Giotto could have been destroyed by the dust and debris coming off the nucleus. It makes uncomfortable, embarrassing watching even today. But, if the stories are true, the damage was much worse than a few red faces. It is now a piece of space folklore that UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher was watching. She was so appalled by what she perceived to be a total waste of money that she began a severe tightening of the UK's purse strings where Esa and space research were concerned. That has now turned around completely with the UK being a committed investor in the space sector. The other thing that has turned around is the way science is communicated to the public.

It must now get to work on its main mission: unlocking the secrets of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and its links with life on Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) probe has already beamed back incredible pictures of a wildly alien landscape. \"We've never seen a comet that close, that high-res - it's an all-new world,\" says Holger Sierks, the lead researcher for Rosetta's main camera, based at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. But what we can't see will be just as revealing, as Rosetta increases its detailed observations of the comet's molecular composition, internal structure and more. These details could tell us how Earth got its water. About 4.6 billion years ago, a cloud of dust and gas began clumping together to form the sun and planets of our solar system. Planets have churned and reprocessed that original material, but the unused bits became asteroids and comets, which are essentially pristine planetary building blocks. \"If you want to know what was there to start with, you've got to go and study these things which were there at the time,\" says Rosetta team member Ian Wright of the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK. \"You cannot address that question by studying the Earth, because anything that went together to make the Earth has been mixed up.\" Comets may have brought water and the carbon-based molecules necessary for life as they rained down on the early Earth's molten surface. But other theories suggest the oceans formed in situ on Earth as the planet's atmosphere evolved. Results from previous comet-fly-by missions - which have snapped photos and even grabbed particles from a comet's tail - have proved inconclusive, but Rosetta's extended stay and carefully chosen toolkit mean it is well placed to provide answers. As you read this, Rosetta will be training its array of instruments on 67P. One can grab dust ejected from the comet and place it under an on-board microscope to see what it's made of. Others will eyeball the gas tail streaming from the comet, while yet more investigate its magnetic and electrical properties. But our closest look at 67P will come in November, when Rosetta's Philae lander will physically dig into the comet's history. Getting the washing-machine-sized lander to the surface will be tricky. From the moment Rosetta arrived on 6 August, ESA researchers have been gathering data to select a place to touch down. The comet's bulbous shape and resulting strange gravity field rule out some areas, but a number of feasible landing spots have presented themselves (see \"Green marks the spot\", below). Incoming data on the comet's mass, density and surface will help ESA narrow the choice to as many as five possible zones, each 600 metres across. The smallest details will be considered: if one of the lander's feet settles on a stone just 30 centimetres high, for example, it could tip over. \"This is the difficult part, to find a sufficiently large area that is sufficiently flat,\" says Jens Biele of the German space agency DLR, which built the lander. Harpoon anchor: On 11 November, Rosetta will dive from 30 kilometres above 67P's surface to 10 kilometres, fast enough to ensure it will pass over the comet rather than crash should anything go wrong. At the right moment, Philae will be ejected backwards, allowing it to gently fall to the comet's surface, which could take as long as 12 hours. At touchdown, the lander will deploy a harpoon to anchor itself. Philae will only be able to communicate with Earth at certain points during the descent. \"It will be nerve-wracking,\" says Biele. The forces Philae records as it touches down will tell researchers whether the surface is like fresh powdered snow, hard ice or something in between. It will then drill up to 23 centimetres into the comet to take samples, untouched since the solar system formed, and identify the molecules inside. \"We will really touch and taste the comet,\" says Biele. One instrument will measure water isotopes in the comet. If they match the isotopes on Earth, it will suggest that comets brought our planet's water. \"If it came from comets, what you've got is a sample of frozen primordial soup,\" says Wright. Philae will also look at complex organic molecules thought to be precursors to life, particularly whether their form is the left-handed or right-handed mirror image. Inorganic processes produce both kinds of molecule in equal measure, but for some reason life on Earth is only left-handed. It is possible that this handedness is produced by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation with icebound organic molecules in a vacuum. In other words, sunshine on comets in space produced a plethora of left-handed molecules which could then have crashed into early Earth. \"It would help to solve the enigma of why life took one side and not the other,\" says Biele. Philae and Rosetta will work together to scan the comet's interior using radio waves, to reveal whether it is solid or more of a rubble pile inside - a technique that could prove useful for future asteroid miners (see \"Asteroid education\"). \"The team was so fortunate to pick such a great comet,\" says Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led NASA's Stardust mission to bring comet dust back to Earth. \"This really looks like a Rosetta Stone that may tell us how comets work.\"", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329822-400-rosetta-probe-poised-to-touch-and-taste-a-comet/"}, {"title": "Landing Site for Comet-Chasing Rosetta Spacecraft to Be Revealed Soon", "date": "2014-09-05", "content": "The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location. Scientists with the European Space Agency will reveal the comet landing site target for Philae, a lander riding aboard the agency's Rosetta spacecraft, on Sept. 15. If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11. The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck. This European Space Agency image shows the five candidate landing sites on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the Philae lander aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions. Philae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun. Predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface", "url": "https://www.space.com/27046-rosetta-comet-landing-site-target.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps a Selfie With Its Comet Companion", "date": "2014-09-12", "content": "It's official: A European spacecraft has snapped a robotic selfie with a comet in deep space.

The image - released by ESA on Wednesday - gives viewers a new perspective on the spacecraft and comet flying far from Earth. The black-and-white photo shows one of Rosetta's solar wings from Philae's perspective on Sept. 7, with Comet 67P/C-G flying 31 miles away. Both the comet's smaller \"head\" and \"body\" are clearly visible in the new photograph. \"Two images with different exposure times were combined to bring out the faint details in this very high contrast situation,\" ESA officials wrote in a blog entry describing the photograph. \"The image was taken as part of the preparations being made for Philae, as the lander team gear up for the first-ever attempt to land on a comet.\" The Philae lander is expected to touch down on the comet's surface in November, and until then, it is flying with Rosetta near Comet Churyumov- Gerasimov. ESA officials are planning to announce the probe's primary landing site during an event on Sept. 15. Philae's CIVA instrument captured the image. CIVA is one of 10 instruments flying aboard Philae, according to ESA. Rosetta is carrying 11 scientific instruments.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object. European Space Agency researchers used a program called Microsoft ICE to stitch the four new Rosetta photos together. A few areas on the left needed exposure adjustments, and the whole image's contrast was enhanced a little, ESA officials said. Astronomers in Ukraine first spotted Comet 67P, which completes one lap around the sun every 6.5 years, in 1969. The object is unusually dark for a comet, most of which are reflective and covered in ice; so far, astronomers haven't spotted any ice patches on 67P. Achieving orbit around 67P was a cosmic first, and the Rosetta team plans to make some more history soon. The mission plan calls for Rosetta to drop a lander called Philae down onto the comet on Nov. 11. Philae will land on the smaller of 67P's two lobes to study the comet's surface and analyze its composition and atmosphere. Philae also has a drill, which it will use to take samples.

On Nov. 12, the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will try to drop a robotic lander onto the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta has been orbiting since early August. No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added. If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will deploy Philae at 4:35 a.m. EDT on Nov. 12, at a distance of 14 miles from the comet. Philae will spiral down slowly toward 67P, eventually securing itself to the surface with harpoons at Site J around 11:30 a.m. EDT that same day. Confirmation of the historic maneuver's success or failure will come 28 minutes and 20 seconds later - the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from Rosetta to its controllers here on the ground. It's also possible that Philae could touch down at a backup location called Site C, ESA officials said. Final confirmation of the landing plan will come on Oct. 14, after a formal review of data gathered by the Rosetta mothership. ESA will also launch a public competition to name Philae's landing site on that date. The $1.7 billion Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004 and finally arrived in orbit around Comet 67P on Aug. 6 of this year. The Rosetta orbiter is studying the 2.5-mile-wide comet with 11 different science instruments, and Philae will contribute by photographing 67P's surface and collecting and analyzing samples. Comet 67P, which takes 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun, is now getting closer and closer to our star. Rosetta and Philae will continue to observe the comet and study how it changes as it warms up on its trek through the inner solar system.

Rosetta mission team members have named the 82-foot-tall boulder on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \"Cheops,\" after the largest pyramid in Egypt's famous Giza complex. The rock is much smaller than its namesake, however, which rises 456 feet into the Egyptian sky. Rosetta first photographed Cheops upon arriving in orbit around Comet 67P in early August. Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks. But, of course, it is much too early to be sure.\" Many properties of Cheops' boulder field are unknown. Scientists are examining what the rocks are made of, how dense they are and how they might have been created. It's possible that as the comet grows more active, the boulders will move around or become more visible to Rosetta's camera, team members said. The closest pictures of Cheops were taken from an altitude of about 9.3 miles, mission officials said. But on Oct. 9, Rosetta moved even closer to the comet to begin an imaging campaign that will take it just 6 miles above the surface.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present. The prime science mission is only supposed to last about 2.5 days and it will be on primary battery power. However, Philae has a second science phase planned that could last up to 3 months, which will be conducted using backup batteries that can be recharged by solar panels.

Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

The European space probe used its high-powered camera OSIRIS to create the stunning \"true color\" photo of the Manhattan-sized comet. But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August. The mission is currently scheduled to last through the end of 2015.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA.

If all goes well, the Philae lander will touch down on its target, the Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, on Nov. 11. The comet landing will mark the first time any space agency has attempted a soft landing on a comet, although NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft deliberately crashed a small probe into a different comet in 2005. Rosetta has spent the past month at Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or 67P, to help ESA scientists learn more about the comet's strange composition. The comet has two distinct sides to it, and a shape that reminds some investigators of a rubber duck. This European Space Agency image shows the five candidate landing sites on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the Philae lander aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. In late August, investigators narrowed down the list of possible comet landing sites to five candidates, with most of them located on the smaller of the two lobes. At the time, ESA officials said more investigation was needed to figure out if the area was safe for landing in terms of boulder hazards as well as lighting conditions. Philae will remain at work on the surface for at least a few weeks, harpooned in place to prevent it from easily leaving the 2.5-mile-long comet's low gravity. Rosetta itself is expected to transmit data through at least August 2015, when the comet makes its closest approach to the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars. The European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft in 2004 on a 10-year voyage to Comet 67P. Rosetta and its Philae lander traveled nearly 4 billion miles to reach the comet. One major goal of the Rosetta mission is to better understand how comets - considered one of the building blocks of the solar system - are put together, and how they react as they get close to the sun. Predicting the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult because their composition is so variable, making it hard to figure out how much gas and dust will stream away when the sun warms the comet's surface", "url": "https://www.space.com/27046-rosetta-comet-landing-site-target.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps a Selfie With Its Comet Companion", "date": "2014-09-12", "content": "It's official: A European spacecraft has snapped a robotic selfie with a comet in deep space.

Rosetta snapped the four new comet photos - which mission scientists stitched into a single mosaic - on Sept. 19, at a distance of 17.7 miles from the center of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mosaic shows ridges on 67P's \"neck\" and many cliffs and boulders scattered across the comet's surface. Some of the photos overlap, so the same comet features can be seen in multiple images. Rosetta spacecraft obtained this four-image NAVCAM mosaic of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with images taken on Sept. 19, 2014, when it was 18 miles from the comet. Rosetta launched in March 2004 and finally caught up to 67P on Aug. 6 of this year, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet. The probe has been taking photos and measurements of 67P ever since, allowing astronomers to construct the first map of the 2.5-mile-long celestial object. European Space Agency researchers used a program called Microsoft ICE to stitch the four new Rosetta photos together. A few areas on the left needed exposure adjustments, and the whole image's contrast was enhanced a little, ESA officials said. Astronomers in Ukraine first spotted Comet 67P, which completes one lap around the sun every 6.5 years, in 1969. The object is unusually dark for a comet, most of which are reflective and covered in ice; so far, astronomers haven't spotted any ice patches on 67P. Achieving orbit around 67P was a cosmic first, and the Rosetta team plans to make some more history soon. The mission plan calls for Rosetta to drop a lander called Philae down onto the comet on Nov. 11. Philae will land on the smaller of 67P's two lobes to study the comet's surface and analyze its composition and atmosphere. Philae also has a drill, which it will use to take samples.

On Nov. 12, the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will try to drop a robotic lander onto the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta has been orbiting since early August. No spacecraft has ever attempted a soft landing on a comet before. The current plan calls for the lander, named Philae, to come down at a location on Comet 67P that the mission team has dubbed Site J. \"Site J was chosen unanimously over four other candidate sites as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within a square kilometer 0.4 square miles area has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders,\" European Space Agency officials said in a statement. \"The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase,\" they added. If all goes according to plan, Rosetta will deploy Philae at 4:35 a.m. EDT on Nov. 12, at a distance of 14 miles from the comet. Philae will spiral down slowly toward 67P, eventually securing itself to the surface with harpoons at Site J around 11:30 a.m. EDT that same day. Confirmation of the historic maneuver's success or failure will come 28 minutes and 20 seconds later - the amount of time it takes for signals to travel from Rosetta to its controllers here on the ground. It's also possible that Philae could touch down at a backup location called Site C, ESA officials said. Final confirmation of the landing plan will come on Oct. 14, after a formal review of data gathered by the Rosetta mothership. ESA will also launch a public competition to name Philae's landing site on that date. The $1.7 billion Rosetta mission blasted off in March 2004 and finally arrived in orbit around Comet 67P on Aug. 6 of this year. The Rosetta orbiter is studying the 2.5-mile-wide comet with 11 different science instruments, and Philae will contribute by photographing 67P's surface and collecting and analyzing samples. Comet 67P, which takes 6.5 years to complete one lap around the sun, is now getting closer and closer to our star. Rosetta and Philae will continue to observe the comet and study how it changes as it warms up on its trek through the inner solar system.

Rosetta mission team members have named the 82-foot-tall boulder on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \"Cheops,\" after the largest pyramid in Egypt's famous Giza complex. The rock is much smaller than its namesake, however, which rises 456 feet into the Egyptian sky. Rosetta first photographed Cheops upon arriving in orbit around Comet 67P in early August. Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks. But, of course, it is much too early to be sure.\" Many properties of Cheops' boulder field are unknown. Scientists are examining what the rocks are made of, how dense they are and how they might have been created. It's possible that as the comet grows more active, the boulders will move around or become more visible to Rosetta's camera, team members said. The closest pictures of Cheops were taken from an altitude of about 9.3 miles, mission officials said. But on Oct. 9, Rosetta moved even closer to the comet to begin an imaging campaign that will take it just 6 miles above the surface.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present. The prime science mission is only supposed to last about 2.5 days and it will be on primary battery power. However, Philae has a second science phase planned that could last up to 3 months, which will be conducted using backup batteries that can be recharged by solar panels.

Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

The European space probe used its high-powered camera OSIRIS to create the stunning \"true color\" photo of the Manhattan-sized comet. But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA.

That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location.

In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft's Comet Companion Is Spouting Jets", "date": "2014-10-03", "content": "A European spacecraft's comet companion is starting to wake up as it gets closer and closer to the sun.

Rosetta mission team members have named the 82-foot-tall boulder on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \"Cheops,\" after the largest pyramid in Egypt's famous Giza complex. The rock is much smaller than its namesake, however, which rises 456 feet into the Egyptian sky. Rosetta first photographed Cheops upon arriving in orbit around Comet 67P in early August. Over the past few weeks, the probe has taken close-up pictures and several wide-angle views that highlight the rock and its surrounding boulder field. \"The surface of Cheops seems to be very craggy and irregular,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, in a statement. \"Especially intriguing are small patches on the boulder's surface displaying the same brightness and texture as the underground,\" added Sierks, a comet researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. \"It looks almost as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder's cracks.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present. The prime science mission is only supposed to last about 2.5 days and it will be on primary battery power. However, Philae has a second science phase planned that could last up to 3 months, which will be conducted using backup batteries that can be recharged by solar panels.

Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

The European space probe used its high-powered camera OSIRIS to create the stunning \"true color\" photo of the Manhattan-sized comet. But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

By February or March, the lander should receive enough sunlight shining at more direct angles to power it up. Although it looks like Philae will be able to survive the bitter cold until then, no one knows exactly when that will be. Rosetta's OSIRIS camera has taken even more photos of the comet, but because the spacecraft is currently trying to download so much data, mission scientists have to wait to see them. They hope the images will reveal Philae's exact location and enable them to better estimate when it might wake up. They should get the pictures within a few days, says Rosetta project scientists Matt Taylor, and then the team can start scouring them for signs of Philae.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August. The mission is currently scheduled to last through the end of 2015.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA.

That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location.

In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps Awesome Comet Photo in Harrowing Close Encounter", "date": "2015-03-04", "content": "Europe's Rosetta spacecraft recently beamed back an amazing photo of its comet taken during a risky, close flyby of the dusty cosmic body. Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died.

The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said. The results were published in the journal Science and led by Martin Rubin, who is with the space research and planetary sciences division of the University of Bern in Switzerland.

This double lobed icy body has been named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and it is about 2.5 miles across. If all goes according to plan, it will be one of the largest space-related events of the year - and certainly a pivotal one for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Rosetta spacecraft, which has been orbiting the comet since August 6, 2014 will deploy its box, shaped 220 lb lander called Philae for a 19 mile long descent to the surface which will take 7 hours. Landing is scheduled for 8:03 a.m. PST. The comet will be between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars (315 million miles from Earth) at landing and hurtling in toward its orbital swing around the sun, which it completes every 6.6 years. The surface of this comet is complex and varied. Rosetta images from orbit reveal a landscape that could have easily come from a science fiction movie. The surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is covered with smooth plains, depressions, boulders (some larger than a house), grooves, ridges, layered cliffs hundreds of feet high, steep slopes, pits and regions that are shooting out spectacular but hazardous jets of gas and dust akin to a spouting whale. The landing site is called Agilkia and it appears to be comprised of some fairly smooth plains/depressions with small scarps surrounding them. Some minor concentrations of boulders are also present. It should be noted that this site was chosen after 3 months of analysis from a set of candidates and this site was deemed the safest. This landing will be very risky, it is not a slam dunk by any means. Because of the comet's extreme low gravity and unknown surface conditions and properties the Philae lander has two harpoons it will fire to anchor it to the surface. Then after reeling the harpoon lines in the lander will touchdown and use its ice screws located at the bottom of each of the three feet to anchor itself onto the surface. After landing Philae will commence its science operations by taking a panorama and surface property measurements. Descent and landing images are expected to be returned as soon as possible. Philae has the unique capability to drill into the subsurface for samples which will be analyzed by its suite of instruments to determine what the comet is made of and to see if any organic molecules are present.

Problems with the landing mean Philae is now out of power in a shady area, unable to tap into enough sunlight on its solar panels to recharge its batteries. But even with this setback, the mission is far from over, and has already brought us fascinating new science. The mission is to study the comet at close range for potential insights into the origins of life on Earth. While comets originate far in the edges of the solar system, it's thought these small icy bodies may have been responsible for bringing water and other volatile elements to a young, dry Earth in a time when the solar system was far more chaotic than it is today. After 10 years in space, five loops around the sun and four gravitational slingshots around planets, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft caught up with Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko in August and manoeuvred into orbit to land a probe on it - a solar system first. Last week, on November 12, Rosetta released Philae from 22.5km above the comet's surface. Since the comet's gravitational pull is tiny, the lander was equipped with two comet-piercing harpoons, a thruster to push it onto the surface and ice screws on each of its three feet. The plan was for the comet to touch down, dig in, and hold on. The bouncy landing: When Philae landed within only 15cm of its target after a suspenseful seven-hour descent, it signalled a major triumph and an incredible feat of science and engineering. The mission leaders, along with those of us cheering Philae on from home, were elated, and rightfully so. But, unfortunately, we soon learnt that not everything went according to plan. The thruster failed and the harpoons didn't fire, rendering Philae unable to stick its landing. It bounced. The first bounce sent the lander flying for nearly two hours as the comet rotated underneath it. It took another short hop before it finally settled a kilometre away. Once the dust settled and the data arrived, it became clear that instead of anchoring down on the smooth plane of the designated landing site, Philae had ended up wedged in a rocky outcropping, with two feet on the ground and one reaching out into space. The shadow problem: The awkward pose was less of a problem than the fact that the lander was now up against solid comet on three sides and therefore in near complete shadow - bad news for a solar-powered robot. To the mission commanders at ESA, this setback meant their investigations were now governed by a countdown clock. The lander had a full battery upon release, meaning it could potentially study the surface for as much as 72 hours before it would power down. The MUlti-PUrpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science instrument got to work measuring the comet's temperature and attempting to hammer away at the surface. The lander's drill managed to get 25cm into the comet to take samples, though the full analysis would take more battery than was available. After considering all possible manoeuvres that the built-to-be-stationary lander might attempt to improve its position, the team even sent the lander a \"lift and turn\" command that managed to tilt the solar panels by 35 degrees - enough to give them just a little more time. ## So to sleep ... for now: After about 66 hours, the control room watched the voltage meter drop until the communication link could no longer be maintained. Philae had gone into sleep mode, having achieved an impressive 80% of its first-stage science goals. The data from Philae are still being analysed and are sure to be immensely valuable. Even the unfortunate bounce might indicate that the surface of the comet is far stiffer than anticipated - not so much a \"dirty snowball\" as comets are generally envisioned, but a conglomeration of loosely packed clumps of hard ice. As the mission stands now, despite Philae's misfortune, ESA considers the landing to have been a success. But there is also some small hope that Philae might come back to life. One of the main goals of the Rosetta mission is to observe how the comet changes when it approaches perihelion - the closest point to the sun in its highly elliptical orbit. At the moment, the comet is 3 Astronomical Units from the sun, but perihelion in August 2015 it will be only 1.2 AU. This means a huge boost in solar power, and it could be enough to give Philae a second lease at life. Meanwhile, we can continue to enjoy the breathtaking images provided by Rosetta and the few close-ups Philae took before shutdown. Rosetta has already done some fantastic science, including sampling the comet's \" perfume \" and listening to it \" sing \" as its magnetic field fluctuates. And it will only get more interesting as the solar radiation heats and reshapes the comet's surface. Stay tuned!

But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

The team discussed the images today, here at the American Geophysical Union meeting. As the Rosetta orbiter enters the main science phase of its mission, Philae remains in hibernation under the shadow of a cliff---stuck sideways with one of its three legs wedged in a rock. There are six hours of daylight on the comet, but because of the cliff's shadow, Philae's only receiving four and a half hours. By February or March, the lander should receive enough sunlight shining at more direct angles to power it up. Although it looks like Philae will be able to survive the bitter cold until then, no one knows exactly when that will be. Rosetta's OSIRIS camera has taken even more photos of the comet, but because the spacecraft is currently trying to download so much data, mission scientists have to wait to see them. They hope the images will reveal Philae's exact location and enable them to better estimate when it might wake up. They should get the pictures within a few days, says Rosetta project scientists Matt Taylor, and then the team can start scouring them for signs of Philae.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August. The mission is currently scheduled to last through the end of 2015.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA. The new results from Rosetta's observations of the comet were detailed in the journal Science last week.", "url": "https://www.space.com/28382-rosetta-spacecraft-comet-goosebumps-photos.html"}, {"title": "Absolutely awesome images of comet lander Philae", "date": "2015-02-03", "content": "NASA released the animated gif above on January 30, 2015. It's a series of 19 images captured by Rosetta's OSIRIS camera as the Philae lander descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on November 12, 2014. That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location. ESA said it will begin listening in a few more weeks with the hope that communications with the lander can be re-established by May or June.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/absolutely-awesome-images-of-comet-lander-philae/"}, {"title": "Rosetta closest approach to a comet photos", "date": "2015-02-19", "content": "The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft came close enough to almost kiss a comet on Valentine's Day this year. In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps Awesome Comet Photo in Harrowing Close Encounter", "date": "2015-03-04", "content": "Europe's Rosetta spacecraft recently beamed back an amazing photo of its comet taken during a risky, close flyby of the dusty cosmic body. Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died. As more sunlight falls on the surface, controllers are hoping Philae's solar panels will collect enough energy to help the lander start functioning again.", "url": "https://www.space.com/28722-rosetta-comet-close-flyby-photo.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft Listens for Wake-Up Call From Philae Comet Lander", "date": "2015-03-12", "content": "The first human-made spacecraft to soft-land on the surface of a comet might be waking up soon. The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said.

It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said. Limited science operations should resume in the coming days and weeks. Mission managers planned a series of flybys near comet 67P's nucleus in the next few months, including a targeted trip through one of the comet's active jets in July. Rosetta's struggles last week may prompt officials to reconsider how to execute future flybys. \"The science and operations teams are currently discussing the impact of the recent navigation difficulties on the current planned trajectories, possibly resulting in further replanning in order to ensure that the spacecraft can operate safely as the comet activity continues to increase towards perihelion in August,\" the blog post said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/05/rosetta-probe-disoriented-by-comet-dust/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft Releases First Color Photo of Comet 67P", "date": "2014-12-02", "content": "After months of painting Comet 67P's barren surface with shades of gray, the Rosetta spacecraft has finally released its first colored image of the space rock, which shows valleys, cliffs, and craters as a dusty mix of red and brown. The European space probe used its high-powered camera OSIRIS to create the stunning \"true color\" photo of the Manhattan-sized comet. But according to Science, Rosetta's researchers have had colored images of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since early November. Some of the images were presented at a planetary science conference in Tucson, Arizona, but not released to the public. Researchers walk a tightrope between sharing and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published. So why has it taken so long for space enthusiasts to see these colored images? One reason is because Rosetta researchers walk a tightrope between sharing their findings and images with the public, and withholding their hard-earned results until they can be published in a prestigious journal. Some instruments on the Rosetta mission have embargoes placed on their findings, which prevent their results from being publicized, sometimes for months. The positive side of the hold is that it gives scientists time to verify and reverify their findings. But it also keeps science fans temporarily in the dark. Another reason for the delay is that most images that Rosetta has beamed back were taken with its on-board navigation camera, NAVCAM. This tool only takes gray-scaled images. The new colored photo was captured using Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, which stands for Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System. It consists of a narrow-angle camera with 12 filters and a wide-angle camera with 14 filters, that allow the instrument to capture wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. The instrument then combines images from its blue, green, and orange filters to present a \"true color\" photo. The OSIRIS camera previously took jaw-dropping true color images of Mars when it passed by the red planet in 2007 during its arduous trek to Comet 67P. The new \"true color\" image does not necessarily show the comet as it would appear to someone who is riding on Rosetta. As the ESA said, comets like 67P are \"blacker than coal.\" Stubbe Hviid, a co-investigator on the Rosetta mission, reaffirmed this statement to Motherboard in an email: \"If you looked at the comet with human eyes it would basically be black.\" He added that unless you shine a complete white light on the comet, it would not appear the way it does in the photo. Still, the image illuminates the duck-shaped space rock for astronomers looking to gather scientific data. It was released accompanying an online abstract for a presentation that will be shown December 18 at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. At the meeting the scientists will also present new findings, as well as higher-resolution colored-comet images from Rosetta. The current image is bit blurry because, as some Reddit users noted, the comet moved between camera exposures. Although previous black-and-white pictures of Comet 67P have shared nail- biting, historic moments with millions, such as Philae's triple touchdown and its landing in a ditch, science enthusiasts will just have to wait before continuing the adventure in color.

There are six hours of daylight on the comet, but because of the cliff's shadow, Philae's only receiving four and a half hours. By February or March, the lander should receive enough sunlight shining at more direct angles to power it up.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA.

That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location. ESA said it will begin listening in a few more weeks with the hope that communications with the lander can be re-established by May or June.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/absolutely-awesome-images-of-comet-lander-philae/"}, {"title": "Rosetta closest approach to a comet photos", "date": "2015-02-19", "content": "The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft came close enough to almost kiss a comet on Valentine's Day this year. In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps Awesome Comet Photo in Harrowing Close Encounter", "date": "2015-03-04", "content": "Europe's Rosetta spacecraft recently beamed back an amazing photo of its comet taken during a risky, close flyby of the dusty cosmic body. Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died.

The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said.

It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said.

Mission managers planned a series of flybys near comet 67P's nucleus in the next few months, including a targeted trip through one of the comet's active jets in July.

The Philae lander's drill did not deliver any samples of the comet to instruments on the lander after the probe touched down on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko on Nov. 12, Paul Weissman, a Rosetta program scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said. Scientists deployed the Philae's lander's drill - designed to deliver sub-surface samples to various instruments on the probe - after it bounced twice, eventually landing in a shadowy part of the comet. European Space Agency officials were initially unsure about whether the drill got any material. The Rosetta mission's Philae lost power shortly after making its final landing in an unexpected spot. Philae was initially expected to function for at least a few weeks before hibernating on the comet's surface. The lander's instruments did beam back data from measurements from the comet's surface, but it now looks like that science did not come from a drill sample, Weissman said. \"It the drill didn't deliver any sample,\" Weissman told Space.com after his talk here at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday. \"That's all I know. We do have measurements from those instruments and all they're measuring is what we see in the atmosphere. They're not measuring any solids.\" All hope is not lost for Philae and its drill, however. It's possible that ESA officials might be able to re-deploy the drill if the lander wakes up later this year, Weissman added, but it depends on the position of the lander. Scientists hope to use the drill in order to learn more about the composition of the comet itself. At the moment, the Philae comet lander isn't getting enough sunlight on its solar panels to continue operations, but the environment might become more favorable as the comet gets closer to the sun this year. The lander stayed functioning for about 56 hours on the surface of Comet 67P/C-G before beginning its hibernation. Officials still aren't exactly sure where Philae is located. Scientists have been using images taken by the Rosetta orbiter - currently circling Comet 67P/C-G - to try to track down where Philae ended up after its bouncy landing. Photos taken by Philae itself after landing show a structure resembling a cliff on one side of the probe, leaving the lander in a shadow. Rosetta is still in good shape and beaming back science from orbit around the comet. Scientists have already made measurements of the water composition of the comet, and Rosetta has taken some amazing photos of the oddly shaped cosmic body. Philae and Rosetta launched to space in 2004 and arrived at Comet 67P/C-G in 2014. Rosetta is expected to continuing studying the comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun in August.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has spotted strange \"goose bumps\" and other unexpected geological formations on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the cosmic body Rosetta is now orbiting. The comet's \"goose bumps\" appear on cliff walls and are estimated to be about 9.84 feet in diameter. Scientists aren't exactly sure how the mysterious features formed on the surface of the comet. Fractures in the same area of the icy body can be explained by cooling and heating as sunlight falls across the comet, but researchers are still trying to figure out how the \"goose bumps\" came to be. \"Their origin is yet to be explained, but their characteristic size may yield clues as to the processes at work when the comet formed,\" ESA officials said in a press statement. This data was captured by the OSIRIS high-resolution camera that is scrutinizing the comet from as close as about 5 miles iabove Rosetta. After arriving at the comet in August, OSIRIS has imaged about 70 percent of the comet's surface. OSIRIS is also on an ongoing hunt for the resting site of the Philae lander, which made a bumpy but successful landing on Comet 67P/C-G in November before officials lost contact with the washing-machine-size probe. Egyptian theme: Of the regions of the comet imaged so far, scientists have found 19 distinct areas and named them after Egyptian deities, which is a naming theme for all features identified on the comet. These regions are grouped by the terrain that dominates each sector. The five basic regions are dust-covered, pits and circular structures underlain with brittle materials, those with big depressions, those with smoother features and those with rocklike surfaces, which encompass all of the remaining regions. Based on observations so far, scientists think the comet is about 70 to 80 percent porous, assuming that the comet is made up mostly of ice and water. \"The interior structure is likely comprising weakly bonded ice-dust clumps with small void spaces between them,\" ESA officials said. Comet 67P/C-G's northern hemisphere is mostly dust, which gets disturbed as the sun falls across the surface. Heating up the comet causes ice to be released into gas, which forms an atmosphere around the cosmic body. As a part of this process, the gas drags up dust. Particles traveling quickly escape the comet, while slower-moving ones gradually sink back to the surface.\"The gases that escape from the surface have also been seen to play an important role in transporting dust across the surface, producing dunelike ripples and boulders with 'wind tails' - the boulders act as natural obstacles to the direction of the gas flow, creating streaks of material 'downwind' of them,\" ESA officials added. Dust activity will likely pick up, and the size of the comet's atmosphere should increase as Comet 67P/C-G approaches the sun. Scientists expect it to make its closest pass with the sun in August, according to ESA.

That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location.

In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps Awesome Comet Photo in Harrowing Close Encounter", "date": "2015-03-04", "content": "Europe's Rosetta spacecraft recently beamed back an amazing photo of its comet taken during a risky, close flyby of the dusty cosmic body. Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died.

The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said.

It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said.

Firstly, an ultraviolet photon from the Sun hits a water molecule in the comet's coma and ionizes it, knocking out an energetic electron. This electron then hits another water molecule in the coma, breaking it apart into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen, and energizing them in the process. These atoms then emit ultraviolet light that is detected at characteristic wavelengths by Alice. Similarly, it is the impact of an electron with a carbon dioxide molecule that results in its break-up into atoms and the observed carbon emissions.", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/esa/alice-in-cometland-nasa-spectrograph-on-rosetta-spacecraft-makes-atmospheric-discovery/"}, {"title": "Philae comet lander 'wakes up' from hibernation to resume Rosetta mission", "date": "2015-06-14", "content": "From aliens bursting forth from crew members' chests to onboard computers developing a psychopathic mind of their own, waking from space hibernation rarely results in a happy ending. But a real-life space voyage has bucked the trend of science-fiction counterparts such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, as one of humankind's greatest achievements \"woke up\" to the great relief of its earthbound masters. Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, phoned home and made contact with the European Space Agency for the first time in seven months on Saturday. In a series of whimsical messages, ESA scientists revealed contact had been re-established with the probe through the Philae lander and Rosetta mission's Twitter accounts. Travelling at up to 84,000mph and more than 300m miles away from Earth, the comet known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko seemed like an impossible target. ESA, however, pulled off a sensational feat of engineering and captured the imagination of space-travel enthusiasts across the world when it launched Philae from its orbiting mothership Rosetta and landed it on the duck-shaped comet's surface on 12 November after a 10-year journey. With its solar panels in shadow, the dishwasher-sized probe was operational for just 60 hours before its batteries died on 15 November and it was placed into hibernation. Since then, ESA has been hoping there will be enough sunlight to allow the lander to wake up, re-establish a communication link and send back a \"hello\" signal. Now the wait is over. Signals were picked up at ESA's operation centre in Darmstadt, Germany, at 10.30pm on Saturday via Rosetta for just 85 seconds. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae's project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. \"The lander is ready for operations.\" More than 300 data packets have been analysed and there are a further 8,000 in Philae's memory, which will give the team information on what happened to the lander in the past few days. The Rosetta mission's chief scientist, Matt Taylor, famous for tattoos that include Rosetta on one leg, said he felt \"absolute elation\". The British scientist told the Guardian: \"I heard last night. A message came up on my phone and I was like, 'What?' It was a surprise. It was difficult getting to sleep. It's absolute elation.\" While the probe had already returned enough data for scientists to address questions of where the comet might have come from and how old it is, the team may now be able to progress the mission further, Taylor said. Drilling into the surface to analyse samples of its composition would be among the next steps for ESA to take. \"It means we can do even more science now if everything goes positively over the next few days,\" Taylor said. But he warned it was early days as only a limited amount of contact had been established. It's just pinged us a short signal. Things look good - better than expected. Things look promising, but we can't see much more. This is just housekeeping - there's no science going on yet. It's a waiting game.\" The Rosetta team was unable to determine precisely where the lander touched down on the comet after it bounced twice on the icy surface when its anchoring system failed. Studies of images taken by the Rosetta orbiter revealed the probe had crossed a large depression before coming to rest at an angle, close to the wall of a crater or cliff. Data from one of the probe's instruments suggested it was on a \"landing strip\" on the comet's smaller lobe measuring 350 metres by 30 metres. When analysing the latest status data, ESA said it became clear that Philae must also have been awake earlier. With more than 2,000 people involved in its development, the Rosetta mission is one of the most complex and ambitious ever undertaken and the first to orbit and land on a comet. It was launched to aid understanding of the evolution of the solar system. The comet's makeup reflects that of a cloud of gas out of which the sun itself was formed more than 4.6bn years ago.

The Rosetta probe is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is zooming toward its closest approach to the sun in mid-August. The European Space Agency said in a statement yesterday that it would extend the mission, which was originally funded until the end of December 2015, through September 2016. On Nov. 12, 2014, Rosetta deployed the Philae lander onto the surface of the comet. Philae came to rest in a shady spot, preventing its solar panels from recharging the lander. But just last week, Philae woke up, having regained some energy as more sunlight reached the surface of the comet. By December of 2015, Rosetta will no longer receive enough sunlight to continue operations, and its propellant will also be depleted. Patrick Martin, Rosetta's mission manager, said in the statement that \"the most logical way to end the mission is to set Rosetta down on the surface of the comet .\" \"But there is still a lot to do to confirm that this end-of-mission scenario is possible,\" Martin added. \"We'll first have to see what the status of the spacecraft is after perihelion closest solar approach and how well it is performing close to the comet, and later we will have to try and determine where on the surface we can have a touchdown.\" According to the statement from ESA, Rosetta would likely spiral down to the surface of Comet 67P \"over a period of about three months,\" and would be able to continue science operations during that descent. This would allow Rosetta, which is equipped with a much larger suite of instruments than Philae, to collect data about the comet at incredibly close distances. Comet 67P will reach its closest approach to the sun on Aug. 13, and Rosetta will follow the craft as it heads back out into the dark regions of the solar system. After December 2015, as the comet moves farther away from the sun, there will not be enough light to charge Rosetta's solar-powered suite of scientific instruments, the ESA statement said. \"This is fantastic news for science,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta Project scientist. \"We'll be able to monitor the decline in the comet's activity as we move away from the sun again, and we'll have the opportunity to fly closer to the comet to continue collecting more unique data. By comparing detailed 'before and after' data, we'll have a much better understanding of how comets evolve during their lifetimes.\" In its study of 67P, Rosetta has already illuminated details about the evolution of comets as they travel toward the sun, and the extended mission will offer even more insight into that process. In addition, scientists have learned about the materials that comets diffuse into space as they head toward the sun and warm up, and the connection between comets and materials found on Earth. The extended run for Rosetta might also make it possible for ground-based telescopes to offer complementary observations of the comet, mission team members said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/29748-rosetta-comet-probe-extended-mission.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Absolutely awesome images of comet lander Philae", "date": "2015-02-03", "content": "NASA released the animated gif above on January 30, 2015.

That was the day the Philae lander made history, becoming the first space probe to attempt a soft-landing on a comet. In the weak gravity of the 4-km-wide comet, the spacecraft bounced several times from its initial touchdown point, became lost and then went silent when its battery ran out. On January 30, ESA said it would call off further searches for the lander for the time being and wait for the lander to \"call home.\" ESA had said in November it was likely the lander had finally touched down in the shadow of a cliff or other obstruction, somewhere it could not receive enough sunlight to re-power its battery. And yet all hope for the lander was not and is not lost. As the comet continues orbiting the sun, its seasons are subtly changing, meaning the sun is continually shifting in the comet's sky, eventually, hopefully, bringing more sunlight to the lander's location. ESA said it will begin listening in a few more weeks with the hope that communications with the lander can be re-established by May or June.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/absolutely-awesome-images-of-comet-lander-philae/"}, {"title": "Rosetta closest approach to a comet photos", "date": "2015-02-19", "content": "The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft came close enough to almost kiss a comet on Valentine's Day this year. In fact, it was the closest that Rosetta has ever and will ever get to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The event marks the beginning of a new phase in Rosetta's mission. On February 14, the spacecraft came to within 3.7 miles of the comet's surface - 10 times closer than when Rosetta closed in on its target last year to deploy the Philae probe, which is the first probe to ever soft land on a comet making history when it did on November 12. This time around Rosetta's NAVCAM instrument took over a dozen close-up shots of the comet's arresting surface features - and they are some of the best photos we've ever seen. Rosetta began prepping for closest approach on February 4 when it fired its thrusters to break course from its current flight path. Over the next 10 days, the spacecraft performed a series of extreme flight maneuvers to line itself up for the close encounter that would take it past the larger of the two lobes. On February 9, the spacecraft had moved slightly closer but was still 65 miles away. The comet is 100 million times more massive than the International Space Station, traveling 40 times faster than a speeding bullet, and spitting out jets of dust and debris, but that didn't stop ESA scientists from getting a closer look. Between February 11 and 14, Rosetta headed straight for its target, closing a distance of almost 60 miles in just three days. Below is a montage of four up-close-and-personal images of the comet's rocky, uneven surface. These four photos were taken when Rosetta was 7.8 miles above the surface. But the most incredible photos of all are the ones the spacecraft captured from a mere 3.7 miles above the surface. The largest boulder in the upper right corner of this first extreme close-up is about 150 feet across and goes by the name Cheops. Check out the stark contrast in smooth and rough patches on the surface as well as the many scattered boulders. Rosetta's comet is covered with dust and jagged edges. The dust on the comet has built up over time creating a layering effect, indicated by distinct lines in the upper left corner in the image below. Scientists are not certain of how Rosetta's comet got that iconic but bizarre dumbbell shape. The two leading theories are: The comet was once more spherical but jets eroded away certain sections faster than others. Or, two smaller, separate bodies smashed and welded together. The fractures and layers in the comet, like the ones shown in the image below, has some scientists thinking that the comet formed by the latter method. It's shocking to see such detail in a picture like this of an object that is more than 300 million miles from Earth - more than three times farther than the sun. More science: The close flyby took place over the comet's most active regions, which made the event particularly exciting for scientists. \"The upcoming close flyby will allow unique scientific observations, providing us with high-resolution measurements of the surface over a range of wavelengths and giving us the opportunity to sample - taste or sniff - the very innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist, in an ESA statement released shortly before the close approach. Last month, the ESA researchers working on Rosetta published a series of papers on the data it had collected in the months since it deployed Philae. One of the important discoveries they found was that the water on the comet did not match the water on Earth, discouraging the theory that comets brought water, that eventually cultivated life, to our planet. There are still questions that need answers, like what is spitting jets of debris from the comet into space. Rosetta's close flybys are important to help scientists understand this, which is why the spacecraft has now entered a new phase of maneuvers that it will perform over the next few months. As the comet travels closer to the sun - reaching it's closest approach on August 13 this year - it will grow increasingly more active, spewing out more debris. Therefore, over the next few months, Rosetta will be making repeated close flybys of the comet to collect as much information as it can about the comet's atmosphere - but never one as close as the one it just completed. The only chance we have for pictures as spectacular as the ones above is if the Philae spacelander wakes up from hibernation, which Rosetta flight director, Andrea Accomazzo hopes could be this June or July .", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rosetta-closest-approach-to-a-comet-photos-2015-2"}, {"title": "Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream, Scientists Say", "date": "2015-02-23", "content": "NASA researchers think they understand why comets have a hard, crispy outside and a cold but soft inside - just like fried ice cream. Two NASA spacecraft have interacted with a comet surface, and both found a crunchy exterior and somewhat softer, more porous interior. Scientists know that comets are made of a mixture of rock and ice, but up until now they could not fully explain this change in texture from the inside to the outside. Now, researchers using a souped-up refrigerator have re-created the conditions on the surface of a comet. They think they can explain the process that makes a comet not unlike a flying hunk of fried ice cream. Scientists suspect that the very coldest comets and icy moons in the solar system contain a special kind of ice called amorphous, or porous, ice. To create amorphous ice, water vapor molecules must be flash-frozen at a temperature of about minus 405 degrees Fahrenheit. According to a statement from NASA, this flash- freezing process is \"sort of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie 'The Empire Strikes Back,'\" - in the film, Solo is flash-frozen alive in a slab of carbonite. Amorphous ice is extremely cold, but relatively soft, like cotton candy, according to Murthy Gudipati, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an author on the new study. When the comet makes its way toward the sun, the temperatures on the outside become too hot for amorphous ice to survive. In the new study, the researchers re-created what happens on the comet's exterior when the temperature starts to rise. \"The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallized,\" Antti Lignell, a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and lead author in the new study, said in the statement. \"This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.\" With the PAHs expelled, the now-purified ice was free to form a dense, crispy outer shell around the body of the comet. Inside, the ultracold, somewhat fluffy amorphous ice remains. \"Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice,\" said Gudipati. The PAHs, meanwhile, come together to form a final layer on top of the crunchy outer shell, Gudipati said. \"The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28530-comets-like-deep-fried-ice-cream.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Probe Snaps Awesome Comet Photo in Harrowing Close Encounter", "date": "2015-03-04", "content": "Europe's Rosetta spacecraft recently beamed back an amazing photo of its comet taken during a risky, close flyby of the dusty cosmic body. Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died.

The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said.

It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said. Limited science operations should resume in the coming days and weeks. Mission managers planned a series of flybys near comet 67P's nucleus in the next few months, including a targeted trip through one of the comet's active jets in July. Rosetta's struggles last week may prompt officials to reconsider how to execute future flybys. \"The science and operations teams are currently discussing the impact of the recent navigation difficulties on the current planned trajectories, possibly resulting in further replanning in order to ensure that the spacecraft can operate safely as the comet activity continues to increase towards perihelion in August,\" the blog post said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/05/rosetta-probe-disoriented-by-comet-dust/"}, {"title": "What an Act!

Rosetta's flyby took it from the shady side of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko towards sunlight, putting the sun directly behind the spacecraft and showing scientists how reflective the comet's surface was. The image, taken when the Rosetta spacecraft was 9.5 miles from Comet 67P/C-G's surface puts the celestial body's dusty, craggy face on display. \"The data acquired during Rosetta's close flyby will provide incredible new details of the comet's surface and near-coma environment, complementing that collected earlier in the mission while on bound orbits,\" European Space Agency officials said in a blog about the close flyby. Rosetta's flyby brought it about 3.7 miles from the comet's face on Feb. 14, but not all went according to plan during the orbit. The comet has far more dust and gas coming from its surface as it draws closer to the sun. The team discovered that this created drag on the Rosetta spacecraft, and making it difficult for the probe to view the stars it needed for navigation. Rosetta started tracking \"false stars,\" and even its backup star tracker stopped working, according to ESA. But in spite of these issues, the spacecraft continued to function, snapping the new photo and collecting data for the science teams back on Earth. \"With a lot of luck, the spacecraft did not end up in 'safe mode',\" Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same blog post. \"Although in this case we could have recovered the spacecraft and resumed operations as planned, the science instruments would have automatically switched off in the meantime. By the time they had been switched back on, we would have been relatively far away from the comet again.\" Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P-C-G in 2014. The spacecraft is expected to function in orbit around the comet through the rest of 2015, following the cosmic body as its makes its close pass of the sun later this year. In November 2015, mission controllers deployed the Philae lander from Rosetta to the comet's surface. Philae made a bumpy landing, and officials aren't yet sure where the probe ended up on the comet. The lander did spend several days gathering data before the spacecraft's battery died.

The European Space Agency's Philae lander has been in a deep sleep since November. Starting this week, however, officials at ESA will start listening for signals from the probe, which could revive when enough sunlight hits its landing site. The Rosetta spacecraft - which is currently orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko - will listen for Philae's signals from today through March 20. Philae could start sending through data from the comet's surface once sunlight charges its solar panels and boosts its battery power. \"Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,\" Stephan Ulamec, Philae's project manager at the German Aerospace Center, said in a statement. \"It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.\" Controllers are optimistic because Comet 67P/C-G is much closer to the sun now than when Philae first made its incredible landing on the dusty body's surface on Nov. 12, 2014. Harpoons inside Philae failed to fire to secure it to the surface, so Philae drifted for two hours before coming to rest in a shadier spot than expected, nicknamed Abydos. After a few dozen hours of work, its batteries ran low and the lander entered hibernation. Philae is designed to wake up once it receives more than 5.5 watts of power on its solar panels, and its internal temperature rises above minus 49 Fahrenheit. The spacecraft should then turn on its receiver every half-hour to listen for Rosetta. However, to \"answer\" Rosetta, Philae will need to have at least 19 watts of power. Meanwhile, controllers have sent commands to Philae that are intended to help the spacecraft conserve power, giving mission managers an even better chance of getting in touch with Rosetta. It's possible that not all components survived the cold as well. Philae will transmit basic information about its health once it wakes up, and controllers will make operational adjustments as needed. If the battery failed, for example, officials will plan to operate the spacecraft during the \"daytime\" on the comet landing site. Philae's exact landing site has not yet been identified, but controllers continue to search for it using high-resolution pictures from Rosetta and knowledge from the \"solar energy conditions\" Philae had in November.

Molecular nitrogen was one of the key ingredients of the young solar system. Its detection in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which Rosetta is currently orbiting, suggests that the comet formed under low-temperature conditions, according to officials with the European Space Agency. Since nitrogen is also found in planets and moons in the outer solar system, Rosetta's discovery implies that 67P's family of comets formed in the same area, ESA said. \"Its detection is particularly important since molecular nitrogen is thought to have been the most common type of nitrogen available when the solar system was forming,\" ESA officials wrote in a statement. \"In the colder outer regions, it likely provided the main source of nitrogen that was incorporated into the gas planets,\" ESA added. \"It also dominates the dense atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan and is present in the atmospheres and surface ices on Pluto and on Neptune's moon Triton.\" While nitrogen has been found on comets before, this is the first time it was detected by itself, as molecular nitrogen. Previously, nitrogen was detected inside compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen cyanide. Weird ratio: The Rosetta spacecraft detected the molecular nitrogen using the probe's ROSINA instrument between Oct. 17 and 23, 2014. At the time, Rosetta was orbiting just 6.2 miles from Comet 67P's center. But the finding also carried a surprise: The ratio of molecular nitrogen to carbon monoxide in the comet was 25 times less than what was expected from models of the early solar system. Scientists said the unexpectedly low ratio resulted from the way ice is formed at extremely low temperatures. Perhaps the molecular nitrogen was trapped inside \"cagelike\" water-ice called clathrates, at temperatures between minus 418 Fahrenheit and minus 364 Fahrenheit, ESA said. Alternatively, scientists suggest the ice could have trapped the molecular nitrogen at a temperature of roughly minus 423 F. This would make sense if 67P had been in the same region of the solar system as Triton and Pluto, which both have nitrogen in their ices. Regardless of the origin story, 67P would have released the nitrogen as it drew closer to the sun, which caused the comet's ice to melt. This could explain the low ratio, scientists said. The results were published in the journal Science and led by Martin Rubin, who is with the space research and planetary sciences division of the University of Bern in Switzerland.

After not quite sticking the landing on its 4 billion-mile journey to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko last November, the Philae lander managed to complete its primary science mission in just 64 hours before losing power. It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus. A surprising discovery: The water vapor emissions from the comet are significantly different from the stores on our planet, suggesting that asteroids, not comets, may have been the main source of Earth's water.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said. Limited science operations should resume in the coming days and weeks. Mission managers planned a series of flybys near comet 67P's nucleus in the next few months, including a targeted trip through one of the comet's active jets in July. Rosetta's struggles last week may prompt officials to reconsider how to execute future flybys. \"The science and operations teams are currently discussing the impact of the recent navigation difficulties on the current planned trajectories, possibly resulting in further replanning in order to ensure that the spacecraft can operate safely as the comet activity continues to increase towards perihelion in August,\" the blog post said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/05/rosetta-probe-disoriented-by-comet-dust/"}, {"title": "What an Act!

Such balancing rocks are set into place naturally on Earth - either because they're pushed into position by glaciers, or because wind and water erode the ground beneath them while leaving the more resilient rock balanced on top. \"How this apparent balancing rock on Comet 67P/C-G was formed is not clear at this point,\" Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, said in an image advisory issued Monday.

The activity reaches its peak intensity around perihelion and in the weeks that follow - and is clearly visible in the spectacular images returned by the spacecraft in the last months. One image taken by Rosetta's navigation camera was acquired at 01:04 GMT, just an hour before the moment of perihelion, from a distance of around 327 km. The scientific camera is also taking images today - the most recent available image was taken at 23:31 GMT on 12 August, just a few hours before perihelion. The comet's activity is clearly seen in the images, with a multitude of jets stemming from the nucleus, including one outburst captured in an image taken at 17:35 GMT yesterday. \"Activity will remain high like this for many weeks, and we're certainly looking forward to seeing how many more jets and outburst events we catch in the act, as we have already witnessed in the last few weeks,\" says Nicolas Altobelli, acting Rosetta project scientist. Rosetta's measurements suggest the comet is spewing up to 300 kg of water vapour - roughly the equivalent of two bathtubs - every second. This is a thousand times more than was observed this time last year when Rosetta first approached the comet. Then, it recorded an outflow rate of just 300 g per second, equivalent to two small glasses of water.", "url": "https://sci.esa.int/web/rosetta/-/56337-rosettas-big-day-in-the-sun"}, {"title": "Comet and Rosetta Spacecraft Make Closest Approach to the Sun", "date": "2015-08-13", "content": "After more than a year in orbit around a comet, the European Rosetta spacecraft and its icy dance partner are hitting a huge milestone: their closest approach to the sun. The Rosetta and its target, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, reach perihelion today (Aug. 13), when the comet's 6.5-year orbit brings it within 114.9 million miles (185 million kilometers) of the sun. Activity is already exploding on Comet 67P. In late July, Rosetta's camera caught a jet eruptingin the space of less than half an hour. And because it takes about a month for the comet to get its warmest, this means that activity is expected to peak in a few short weeks. \"The key to the Rosetta mission is that it is there for the long haul. It is there to watch and observe changes in the comet over time, with the same suite of instruments, as opposed to a flyby - or maybe different missions having flybys at different times with different instruments,\" said Joel Parker, an interdisciplinary scientist on the mission.

After not quite sticking the landing on its 4 billion-mile journey to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko last November, the Philae lander managed to complete its primary science mission in just 64 hours before losing power. It conducted all the planned experiments and sent the data to Earth, including the first images ever taken from a comet's surface. The lander is now powerless because its solar panels are lying in shadow, but the obstructions might melt as the comet nears the sun, allowing Philae to return to life. Meanwhile, the Rosetta probe orbiting the comet has been busy, revealing a striking array of surface features on Churyumov-Gerasimenko's two-lobed nucleus. A surprising discovery: The water vapor emissions from the comet are significantly different from the stores on our planet, suggesting that asteroids, not comets, may have been the main source of Earth's water.

Rosetta ran into trouble during a March 28 flyby near the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, the oddly-shaped comet the mission has explored since August 2014. The spacecraft uses small cameras to locate bright stars in the sky, using the stellar fixes to determine its orientation in space. During the March 28 flyby, Rosetta zipped past the comet's icy core at a distance of about 14 kilometers, or 8.7 miles. The probe aimed for a flyby point over the larger of comet 67P's two lobes, according to the European Space Agency. The comet is heating up as it swings closer to the sun, triggering plumes of outgassing water vapor and dust particles. Scientists expect the comet's awakening to continue past perihelion - its closest approach to the sun - on Aug. 13, with the period of most activity forecast for September. ESA officials blame the growing cloud around the comet's nucleus for the pointing error during the March 28 flyby. The dust grains pushed against Rosetta's long power-generating solar arrays, causing increased drag as the craft approached the comet. But ground controllers observed a more serious effect on Rosetta's star trackers, which are supposed to find guide stars to self-monitor the spacecraft's alignment with Earth and the sun. The guidance system confused the flecks of dust for stars, rendering the trackers unable to set a navigation fix. \"During the most recent flyby, a number of issues were reported, starting with the primary star tracker encountering difficulties in locking on to stars on the way in towards closest approach,\" officials wrote in a blog post on ESA's website. \"Attempts were made to regain tracking capabilities, but there was too much background noise due to activity close to the comet nucleus: hundreds of 'false stars' were registered and it took almost 24 hours before tracking was properly re-established.\" Rosetta initially recovered from the problem after its high-gain antenna drifted away from Earth. \"However, issues with false stars were still occurring,\" the blog post said. \"Cross comparisons with other navigation mechanisms showed inconsistencies with the star trackers and some on board reconfigurations occurred.\" The spacecraft ended up in safe mode, a state where Rosetta switched off its scientific instruments and halted non-essential functions to ensure the probe's survival. The safe mode occurred the day after Rosetta's closest approach to the comet. Engineers at the Rosetta control center in Darmstadt, Germany, restored the spacecraft to normal status by March 30, but science operations remain mostly suspended as officials gauge the implications of the event. The March 28 encounter was Rosetta's closest brush with the comet since a 6-kilometer flyby Feb. 14. Rosetta's star trackers experienced similar issues then, but the spacecraft weathered the flyby without defaulting to safe mode. Rosetta performed a rocket burn April 1 to bring the spacecraft from a distance of 400 kilometers to about 140 kilometers from the comet by April 8, officials said. Limited science operations should resume in the coming days and weeks. Mission managers planned a series of flybys near comet 67P's nucleus in the next few months, including a targeted trip through one of the comet's active jets in July. Rosetta's struggles last week may prompt officials to reconsider how to execute future flybys. \"The science and operations teams are currently discussing the impact of the recent navigation difficulties on the current planned trajectories, possibly resulting in further replanning in order to ensure that the spacecraft can operate safely as the comet activity continues to increase towards perihelion in August,\" the blog post said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/05/rosetta-probe-disoriented-by-comet-dust/"}, {"title": "What an Act!

After December 2015, as the comet moves farther away from the sun, there will not be enough light to charge Rosetta's solar-powered suite of scientific instruments, the ESA statement said. \"This is fantastic news for science,\" said Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta Project scientist. \"We'll be able to monitor the decline in the comet's activity as we move away from the sun again, and we'll have the opportunity to fly closer to the comet to continue collecting more unique data. By comparing detailed 'before and after' data, we'll have a much better understanding of how comets evolve during their lifetimes.\" In its study of 67P, Rosetta has already illuminated details about the evolution of comets as they travel toward the sun, and the extended mission will offer even more insight into that process. In addition, scientists have learned about the materials that comets diffuse into space as they head toward the sun and warm up, and the connection between comets and materials found on Earth.

In the year that has passed since Rosetta arrived, the comet has travelled some 750 million kilometres along its orbit towards the Sun, the increasing solar radiation heating up the nucleus and causing its frozen ices to escape as gas and stream out into space at an ever greater rate. These gases, and the dust particles that they drag along, build up the comet's atmosphere - coma - and tail. The activity reaches its peak intensity around perihelion and in the weeks that follow - and is clearly visible in the spectacular images returned by the spacecraft in the last months. One image taken by Rosetta's navigation camera was acquired at 01:04 GMT, just an hour before the moment of perihelion, from a distance of around 327 km. The scientific camera is also taking images today - the most recent available image was taken at 23:31 GMT on 12 August, just a few hours before perihelion.

The strange shape of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, which the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has been studying for more than a year, arose from the long-ago collision of two separate, slow-moving comets, researchers say. \"How the comet got its curious shape has been a major question since we first saw it,\" Holger Sierks, of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"Now, thanks to this detailed study, we can say with certainty that it is a 'contact binary,'\" added Sierks, who serves as the principal investigator of Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, the main camera system for the mission. ## Two separate onions When Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P in August 2014, scientists noted the icy object's distinctive, two-lobe shape, similar to that of a rubber ducky toy. Two main hypotheses emerged - that a single comet had eroded to form the connecting \"neck,\" or that two comets had merged. The latter theory has been proposed for the formation of other bi-lobed comets. Matteo Massironi, of the University of Padova in Italy, led a team that identified more than 100 terraces on the surface of the comet, along with parallel layers of material in exposed walls and pits. The scientists then developed a 3D-shape model of the comet to determine the directions of the terraces' slopes and visualize how they extended below the surface. \"It is clear from the images that both lobes have an outer envelope of material organized in distinct layers, and we think these extend for several hundred meters below the surface,\" Massironi said in the same statement. \"You can imagine the layering a bit like an onion, except in this case we are considering two separate onions of differing size that have grown independently before fusing together.\" It soon became clear that the features were coherently oriented around the comet's lobes, extending to a depth of around 2,100 feet. \"This was the first clue that the two lobes are independent, reinforced by the observation that the layers are inclined in opposite directions close to the comet's neck,\" Massironi said. The scientists then studied the relationship between the local gravityand the orientations of the various features. The team computed the strength and direction of the gravity at the location of each layer. In one case, they modeled the comet as a single body with a center, while in another they worked with two separate merging comets. They found that the orientation of the layers and the direction of the local gravity were closer to forming right angles in the model with two comets rather than a single one. \"This points to the layered envelopes in the comet's head and body forming independently before the two objects merged later,\" Massironi said. \"It must have been a low-speed collision in order to preserve such ordered strata to the depths our data imply.\" The structural similaritiesthroughout the comet suggest that the precursor comets formed through similar accretion processes. The layering observed on other comets during previous missions suggest that they, too, went through a similar formation history, the researchers said. ## Erosion still important Although erosion didn't create the narrow neck of Comet 67P, the team pointed out that it plays a role in how the comet continues to evolve. Local variations in the surface most likely formed as a result of ice turning directly into gas, a process called sublimation. The frozen gases embedded in the layers of the comet are not necessarily distributed evenly through its body. \"This result adds to our growing knowledge of the comet - how it formed and its evolution,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor said in the same statement. \" Rosetta will continue to observe the comet for another year, to get the maximum amount of information on this celestial body and its place in the history of our solar system.\" Massironi presented the results at the 2015 European Planetary Science Congress, which was held from Sept. 27 through Oct. 2 in Nantes, France.

The spectrograph examines the electromagnetic (light) spectrum the comet is emitting to understand the chemistry of the comet's atmosphere, or coma. Now, Alice reveals an unexpected process at work, causing the rapid breakup of water and carbon dioxide molecules spewing from the comet's surface. The scientists report their findings in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. \"The discovery we're reporting is quite unexpected,\" said Alan Stern, principal investigator for the Alice instrument at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. \"It shows us the value of going to comets to observe them up close, since this discovery simply could not have been made from Earth or Earth orbit with any existing or planned observatory. And, it is fundamentally transforming our knowledge of comets.\" Scientists discovered that the molecules seem to be broken up in a two-step process. Firstly, an ultraviolet photon from the Sun hits a water molecule in the comet's coma and ionizes it, knocking out an energetic electron. This electron then hits another water molecule in the coma, breaking it apart into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen, and energizing them in the process. These atoms then emit ultraviolet light that is detected at characteristic wavelengths by Alice. Similarly, it is the impact of an electron with a carbon dioxide molecule that results in its break-up into atoms and the observed carbon emissions.", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/esa/alice-in-cometland-nasa-spectrograph-on-rosetta-spacecraft-makes-atmospheric-discovery/"}, {"title": "Philae comet lander 'wakes up' from hibernation to resume Rosetta mission", "date": "2015-06-14", "content": "From aliens bursting forth from crew members' chests to onboard computers developing a psychopathic mind of their own, waking from space hibernation rarely results in a happy ending. But a real-life space voyage has bucked the trend of science-fiction counterparts such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, as one of humankind's greatest achievements \"woke up\" to the great relief of its earthbound masters. Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, phoned home and made contact with the European Space Agency for the first time in seven months on Saturday. In a series of whimsical messages, ESA scientists revealed contact had been re-established with the probe through the Philae lander and Rosetta mission's Twitter accounts. Travelling at up to 84,000mph and more than 300m miles away from Earth, the comet known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko seemed like an impossible target. ESA, however, pulled off a sensational feat of engineering and captured the imagination of space-travel enthusiasts across the world when it launched Philae from its orbiting mothership Rosetta and landed it on the duck-shaped comet's surface on 12 November after a 10-year journey. With its solar panels in shadow, the dishwasher-sized probe was operational for just 60 hours before its batteries died on 15 November and it was placed into hibernation. Since then, ESA has been hoping there will be enough sunlight to allow the lander to wake up, re-establish a communication link and send back a \"hello\" signal. Now the wait is over. Signals were picked up at ESA's operation centre in Darmstadt, Germany, at 10.30pm on Saturday via Rosetta for just 85 seconds. \"Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available,\" said Philae's project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. \"The lander is ready for operations.\" More than 300 data packets have been analysed and there are a further 8,000 in Philae's memory, which will give the team information on what happened to the lander in the past few days. The Rosetta mission's chief scientist, Matt Taylor, famous for tattoos that include Rosetta on one leg, said he felt \"absolute elation\". The British scientist told the Guardian: \"I heard last night. A message came up on my phone and I was like, 'What?' It was a surprise. It was difficult getting to sleep. It's absolute elation.\" While the probe had already returned enough data for scientists to address questions of where the comet might have come from and how old it is, the team may now be able to progress the mission further, Taylor said. Drilling into the surface to analyse samples of its composition would be among the next steps for ESA to take. \"It means we can do even more science now if everything goes positively over the next few days,\" Taylor said. But he warned it was early days as only a limited amount of contact had been established. It's just pinged us a short signal. Things look good - better than expected. Things look promising, but we can't see much more. This is just housekeeping - there's no science going on yet. It's a waiting game.\" The Rosetta team was unable to determine precisely where the lander touched down on the comet after it bounced twice on the icy surface when its anchoring system failed. Studies of images taken by the Rosetta orbiter revealed the probe had crossed a large depression before coming to rest at an angle, close to the wall of a crater or cliff. Data from one of the probe's instruments suggested it was on a \"landing strip\" on the comet's smaller lobe measuring 350 metres by 30 metres. When analysing the latest status data, ESA said it became clear that Philae must also have been awake earlier. With more than 2,000 people involved in its development, the Rosetta mission is one of the most complex and ambitious ever undertaken and the first to orbit and land on a comet. It was launched to aid understanding of the evolution of the solar system. The comet's makeup reflects that of a cloud of gas out of which the sun itself was formed more than 4.6bn years ago.

Next September, the European Space Agency will crash Philae's mothership Rosetta into the icy dust ball, but as gently as possible. The dramatic act will bring the mission to an abrupt end - and give Rosetta's wealth of sensors and instruments their closest view of the comet yet. \"The crash landing gives us the best scientific end-of-mission that we can hope for,\" says Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. The collision will be emotional for the scientists, some of whom have worked on the mission since its inception in 1993. \"There will be a lot of tears,\" says Taylor. Launched in 2004, the Rosetta orbiter caught up with the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko ten years later as the rock was travelling from deep in space towards the Sun - and dropped Philae onto the surface a few months later, on 12 November. Scientists have not heard from Philae since July, and don't know if they will do so again, but Rosetta's operations to survey the comet from orbit are in full swing. However, the orbiter can't keep up this work indefinitely. Funding for the mission runs out in September 2016 - and by that time 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will be well on its way back out into deep space, where the solar-powered orbiter will receive too little sunlight to function. Discussions about what to do with Rosetta when that happens have continued for more than a year. Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo says that, ideally, Rosetta would hibernate while the comet remains in deep space, then be resurrected when 67P again approaches the Sun in 4 or 5 years' time. But the cold of deep space would probably damage the craft, Accomazzo says; others fear that fuel and other resources would run out. Moreover, many of the mission's principal investigators (PIs) began their work more than 20 years ago and \"there's no point putting an old experiment with old PIs into hibernation\", jokes Kathrin Altwegg, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern. Crash-landing Rosetta emerged as the preferred option last year, but only now are orbiter navigators and operators working out how to go about it. Rosetta's closest encounter with the comet so far was from 8 kilometres above the surface, when it dispatched Philae. The current thinking sees Rosetta spiral down to a similar distance next August before creeping ever closer in elliptical orbits and crashing in September, says mission manager Patrick Martin - but that could still change. Although Philae sent back some data during its descent, Rosetta has more powerful - and more varied - sensors and instruments. The orbiter will also descend much more slowly than Philae did, allowing it to gather more data and better pictures. Once it gets to 4 kilometres, for example, Rosetta should be able to distinguish between the gases emerging from each of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes to determine whether the regions vary in composition, says Altwegg, who leads the team behind ROSINA (the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis). That could shed light on the environments in which each was formed. Rosetta's cameras will get their best-resolution shots of the comet's surface yet - less than 1 centimetre per pixel once the craft is within 500 metres of the surface, adds Holger Sierks, PI for Rosetta's OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System). This will allow researchers to look at surface properties and link these to comet activity that Rosetta has observed from orbit. Over and out: How far into the descent Rosetta will be able to send data back to mission control will depend on whether engineers can design the final trajectory such that the craft crashes on the side of the comet that faces Earth. Navigating while close to the comet will be difficult because the body's gravitational field is uneven, but spacecraft-operations manager Sylvain Lodiot hopes that the orbiter will transmit until the very end. The crash will definitely be a hard stop to the mission, he says, however gentle the landing. Designed to manoeuvre in orbit, once Rosetta is on the comet's surface it will no longer be able to point its antenna to communicate with Earth. Similarly, it will not be able to angle its solar array, so it will lose power, says Lodiot. \"Once we touch, hit or crash, whatever you want to call it, it's game over.\" Before then, though, the mission still has much to accomplish. As the comet approached the Sun, it heated up, with vaporizing ice causing more and more gas and dust to stream from its surface. Rosetta had to retreat into a wider orbit to stop the dust from confusing its navigation system. But now that the comet is speeding away from the Sun, mission scientists are relishing the opportunity to steer Rosetta back in. Priorities will then be to get images that would enable comparisons of the comet before and after its swing around the Sun, as well as a close-up of the southern hemisphere, which was largely in darkness until May and will disappear back out of view in March. Rosetta will also resume listening out for Philae. Given the huge public interest in anything to do with the lander, Rosetta's finale will make for a fitting end to the story, adds Altwegg. \"This way Rosetta gets to live happily ever after on the comet with Philae.\"", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/527016a"}, {"title": "ESA's Rosetta space probe will end its life by crash landing on Comet 67P", "date": "2015-11-17", "content": "The Rosetta spacecraft will likely end its life next September with a spectacular weeks-long descent toward Comet Chury, climaxing as the three-ton piece of machinery attempts an improvised landing on the spinning ball of ice and rock. \"It's very simple. As soon as there's contact, it is game over, it's finished,\" spacecraft operations manager Sylvain Lodiot told DW. \"Rosetta is not designed to land, so as soon as there's contact with the comet, there won't be any communication anymore. That's the end of the mission.\" In the weeks prior to final impact, Rosetta will orbit Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko at distances never before attempted. \"We will attempt to go to distances of below one kilometer to the surface,\" Lodiot said. Doing so presents a particular challenge, since the lopsided shape of the spinning comet means its gravity field is non-uniform. This will cause huge perturbations in Rosetta's trajectory as the space probe nears the comet. It will also cause Rosetta's \"height\" to change as the comet moves. During the descent, Rosetta's 12 remaining onboard instruments will continue to collect information. The 13th, the Philae lander, is already on the comet. The other instruments include remote sensing, imagery, gas and dust analysis to atomic force microscopes as well as a plasma consortium, which measures the plasma and interaction with the sun and solar wind. \"You could imagine that the Rosina instrument would maybe discover new traces of gases around the comet,\" Lodiot said.

The strange shape of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, which the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has been studying for more than a year, arose from the long-ago collision of two separate, slow-moving comets, researchers say. \"How the comet got its curious shape has been a major question since we first saw it,\" Holger Sierks, of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"Now, thanks to this detailed study, we can say with certainty that it is a 'contact binary,'\" added Sierks, who serves as the principal investigator of Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, the main camera system for the mission. ## Two separate onions When Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P in August 2014, scientists noted the icy object's distinctive, two-lobe shape, similar to that of a rubber ducky toy. Two main hypotheses emerged - that a single comet had eroded to form the connecting \"neck,\" or that two comets had merged. The latter theory has been proposed for the formation of other bi-lobed comets. Matteo Massironi, of the University of Padova in Italy, led a team that identified more than 100 terraces on the surface of the comet, along with parallel layers of material in exposed walls and pits. The scientists then developed a 3D-shape model of the comet to determine the directions of the terraces' slopes and visualize how they extended below the surface. \"It is clear from the images that both lobes have an outer envelope of material organized in distinct layers, and we think these extend for several hundred meters below the surface,\" Massironi said in the same statement. \"You can imagine the layering a bit like an onion, except in this case we are considering two separate onions of differing size that have grown independently before fusing together.\" It soon became clear that the features were coherently oriented around the comet's lobes, extending to a depth of around 2,100 feet. \"This was the first clue that the two lobes are independent, reinforced by the observation that the layers are inclined in opposite directions close to the comet's neck,\" Massironi said. The scientists then studied the relationship between the local gravityand the orientations of the various features. The team computed the strength and direction of the gravity at the location of each layer. In one case, they modeled the comet as a single body with a center, while in another they worked with two separate merging comets. They found that the orientation of the layers and the direction of the local gravity were closer to forming right angles in the model with two comets rather than a single one. \"This points to the layered envelopes in the comet's head and body forming independently before the two objects merged later,\" Massironi said. \"It must have been a low-speed collision in order to preserve such ordered strata to the depths our data imply.\" The structural similaritiesthroughout the comet suggest that the precursor comets formed through similar accretion processes. The layering observed on other comets during previous missions suggest that they, too, went through a similar formation history, the researchers said. ## Erosion still important Although erosion didn't create the narrow neck of Comet 67P, the team pointed out that it plays a role in how the comet continues to evolve. Local variations in the surface most likely formed as a result of ice turning directly into gas, a process called sublimation. The frozen gases embedded in the layers of the comet are not necessarily distributed evenly through its body. \"This result adds to our growing knowledge of the comet - how it formed and its evolution,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor said in the same statement. \" Rosetta will continue to observe the comet for another year, to get the maximum amount of information on this celestial body and its place in the history of our solar system.\" Massironi presented the results at the 2015 European Planetary Science Congress, which was held from Sept. 27 through Oct. 2 in Nantes, France.

Next September, the European Space Agency will crash Philae's mothership Rosetta into the icy dust ball, but as gently as possible. The dramatic act will bring the mission to an abrupt end - and give Rosetta's wealth of sensors and instruments their closest view of the comet yet. \"The crash landing gives us the best scientific end-of-mission that we can hope for,\" says Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. The collision will be emotional for the scientists, some of whom have worked on the mission since its inception in 1993. \"There will be a lot of tears,\" says Taylor. Launched in 2004, the Rosetta orbiter caught up with the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko ten years later as the rock was travelling from deep in space towards the Sun - and dropped Philae onto the surface a few months later, on 12 November. Scientists have not heard from Philae since July, and don't know if they will do so again, but Rosetta's operations to survey the comet from orbit are in full swing. However, the orbiter can't keep up this work indefinitely. Funding for the mission runs out in September 2016 - and by that time 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will be well on its way back out into deep space, where the solar-powered orbiter will receive too little sunlight to function. Discussions about what to do with Rosetta when that happens have continued for more than a year. Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo says that, ideally, Rosetta would hibernate while the comet remains in deep space, then be resurrected when 67P again approaches the Sun in 4 or 5 years' time. But the cold of deep space would probably damage the craft, Accomazzo says; others fear that fuel and other resources would run out. Moreover, many of the mission's principal investigators (PIs) began their work more than 20 years ago and \"there's no point putting an old experiment with old PIs into hibernation\", jokes Kathrin Altwegg, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern. Crash-landing Rosetta emerged as the preferred option last year, but only now are orbiter navigators and operators working out how to go about it. Rosetta's closest encounter with the comet so far was from 8 kilometres above the surface, when it dispatched Philae. The current thinking sees Rosetta spiral down to a similar distance next August before creeping ever closer in elliptical orbits and crashing in September, says mission manager Patrick Martin - but that could still change. Although Philae sent back some data during its descent, Rosetta has more powerful - and more varied - sensors and instruments. The orbiter will also descend much more slowly than Philae did, allowing it to gather more data and better pictures. Once it gets to 4 kilometres, for example, Rosetta should be able to distinguish between the gases emerging from each of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes to determine whether the regions vary in composition, says Altwegg, who leads the team behind ROSINA (the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis). That could shed light on the environments in which each was formed. Rosetta's cameras will get their best-resolution shots of the comet's surface yet - less than 1 centimetre per pixel once the craft is within 500 metres of the surface, adds Holger Sierks, PI for Rosetta's OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System). This will allow researchers to look at surface properties and link these to comet activity that Rosetta has observed from orbit. Over and out: How far into the descent Rosetta will be able to send data back to mission control will depend on whether engineers can design the final trajectory such that the craft crashes on the side of the comet that faces Earth. Navigating while close to the comet will be difficult because the body's gravitational field is uneven, but spacecraft-operations manager Sylvain Lodiot hopes that the orbiter will transmit until the very end. The crash will definitely be a hard stop to the mission, he says, however gentle the landing. Designed to manoeuvre in orbit, once Rosetta is on the comet's surface it will no longer be able to point its antenna to communicate with Earth. Similarly, it will not be able to angle its solar array, so it will lose power, says Lodiot. \"Once we touch, hit or crash, whatever you want to call it, it's game over.\" Before then, though, the mission still has much to accomplish. As the comet approached the Sun, it heated up, with vaporizing ice causing more and more gas and dust to stream from its surface. Rosetta had to retreat into a wider orbit to stop the dust from confusing its navigation system. But now that the comet is speeding away from the Sun, mission scientists are relishing the opportunity to steer Rosetta back in. Priorities will then be to get images that would enable comparisons of the comet before and after its swing around the Sun, as well as a close-up of the southern hemisphere, which was largely in darkness until May and will disappear back out of view in March. Rosetta will also resume listening out for Philae. Given the huge public interest in anything to do with the lander, Rosetta's finale will make for a fitting end to the story, adds Altwegg. \"This way Rosetta gets to live happily ever after on the comet with Philae.\"", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/527016a"}, {"title": "ESA's Rosetta space probe will end its life by crash landing on Comet 67P", "date": "2015-11-17", "content": "The Rosetta spacecraft will likely end its life next September with a spectacular weeks-long descent toward Comet Chury, climaxing as the three-ton piece of machinery attempts an improvised landing on the spinning ball of ice and rock. \"It's very simple.

This is because as comets fly towards the Sun, they are exposed to warm temperatures that cause surface ice to sublimate, or transform directly from solid to gas, 'Los Angeles Times' reported. What remains are materials similar to rocks, sand and ash on Earth, researchers said. Data collected by Rosetta's Visible Infrared and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer showed that the water ice grains in the Imhotep region came in two different sizes. Some of the grains were tiny, just tens of micrometres across which were probably formed as a result of the comet's 12-hour rotation. As this region of the comet turns away from the Sun, the temperature drops low enough for water ice to condense out of the coma and onto the nucleus, creating a thin layer of frost, researchers said. During the 'day' on the comet surface, temperatures increase and the water evaporates back into the coma. VIRTIS also detected evidence of this frost-like surface ice in the neck region of the comet. The findings were published in the journal Nature.

The strange shape of Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, which the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has been studying for more than a year, arose from the long-ago collision of two separate, slow-moving comets, researchers say. \"How the comet got its curious shape has been a major question since we first saw it,\" Holger Sierks, of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, said in a statement. \"Now, thanks to this detailed study, we can say with certainty that it is a 'contact binary,'\" added Sierks, who serves as the principal investigator of Rosetta's Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System, the main camera system for the mission. ## Two separate onions When Rosetta arrived at Comet 67P in August 2014, scientists noted the icy object's distinctive, two-lobe shape, similar to that of a rubber ducky toy. Two main hypotheses emerged - that a single comet had eroded to form the connecting \"neck,\" or that two comets had merged. The latter theory has been proposed for the formation of other bi-lobed comets. Matteo Massironi, of the University of Padova in Italy, led a team that identified more than 100 terraces on the surface of the comet, along with parallel layers of material in exposed walls and pits. The scientists then developed a 3D-shape model of the comet to determine the directions of the terraces' slopes and visualize how they extended below the surface. \"It is clear from the images that both lobes have an outer envelope of material organized in distinct layers, and we think these extend for several hundred meters below the surface,\" Massironi said in the same statement. \"You can imagine the layering a bit like an onion, except in this case we are considering two separate onions of differing size that have grown independently before fusing together.\" It soon became clear that the features were coherently oriented around the comet's lobes, extending to a depth of around 2,100 feet. \"This was the first clue that the two lobes are independent, reinforced by the observation that the layers are inclined in opposite directions close to the comet's neck,\" Massironi said. The scientists then studied the relationship between the local gravityand the orientations of the various features. The team computed the strength and direction of the gravity at the location of each layer. In one case, they modeled the comet as a single body with a center, while in another they worked with two separate merging comets. They found that the orientation of the layers and the direction of the local gravity were closer to forming right angles in the model with two comets rather than a single one. \"This points to the layered envelopes in the comet's head and body forming independently before the two objects merged later,\" Massironi said. \"It must have been a low-speed collision in order to preserve such ordered strata to the depths our data imply.\" The structural similaritiesthroughout the comet suggest that the precursor comets formed through similar accretion processes. The layering observed on other comets during previous missions suggest that they, too, went through a similar formation history, the researchers said. ## Erosion still important Although erosion didn't create the narrow neck of Comet 67P, the team pointed out that it plays a role in how the comet continues to evolve. Local variations in the surface most likely formed as a result of ice turning directly into gas, a process called sublimation. The frozen gases embedded in the layers of the comet are not necessarily distributed evenly through its body. \"This result adds to our growing knowledge of the comet - how it formed and its evolution,\" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor said in the same statement. \" Rosetta will continue to observe the comet for another year, to get the maximum amount of information on this celestial body and its place in the history of our solar system.\" Massironi presented the results at the 2015 European Planetary Science Congress, which was held from Sept. 27 through Oct. 2 in Nantes, France. The study was also published online late last month in the journal Nature.

Next September, the European Space Agency will crash Philae's mothership Rosetta into the icy dust ball, but as gently as possible. The dramatic act will bring the mission to an abrupt end - and give Rosetta's wealth of sensors and instruments their closest view of the comet yet. \"The crash landing gives us the best scientific end-of-mission that we can hope for,\" says Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. The collision will be emotional for the scientists, some of whom have worked on the mission since its inception in 1993. \"There will be a lot of tears,\" says Taylor. Launched in 2004, the Rosetta orbiter caught up with the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko ten years later as the rock was travelling from deep in space towards the Sun - and dropped Philae onto the surface a few months later, on 12 November. Scientists have not heard from Philae since July, and don't know if they will do so again, but Rosetta's operations to survey the comet from orbit are in full swing. However, the orbiter can't keep up this work indefinitely. Funding for the mission runs out in September 2016 - and by that time 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will be well on its way back out into deep space, where the solar-powered orbiter will receive too little sunlight to function. Discussions about what to do with Rosetta when that happens have continued for more than a year. Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo says that, ideally, Rosetta would hibernate while the comet remains in deep space, then be resurrected when 67P again approaches the Sun in 4 or 5 years' time. But the cold of deep space would probably damage the craft, Accomazzo says; others fear that fuel and other resources would run out. Moreover, many of the mission's principal investigators (PIs) began their work more than 20 years ago and \"there's no point putting an old experiment with old PIs into hibernation\", jokes Kathrin Altwegg, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern. Crash-landing Rosetta emerged as the preferred option last year, but only now are orbiter navigators and operators working out how to go about it. Rosetta's closest encounter with the comet so far was from 8 kilometres above the surface, when it dispatched Philae. The current thinking sees Rosetta spiral down to a similar distance next August before creeping ever closer in elliptical orbits and crashing in September, says mission manager Patrick Martin - but that could still change. Although Philae sent back some data during its descent, Rosetta has more powerful - and more varied - sensors and instruments. The orbiter will also descend much more slowly than Philae did, allowing it to gather more data and better pictures. Once it gets to 4 kilometres, for example, Rosetta should be able to distinguish between the gases emerging from each of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes to determine whether the regions vary in composition, says Altwegg, who leads the team behind ROSINA (the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis). That could shed light on the environments in which each was formed. Rosetta's cameras will get their best-resolution shots of the comet's surface yet - less than 1 centimetre per pixel once the craft is within 500 metres of the surface, adds Holger Sierks, PI for Rosetta's OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System). This will allow researchers to look at surface properties and link these to comet activity that Rosetta has observed from orbit. Over and out: How far into the descent Rosetta will be able to send data back to mission control will depend on whether engineers can design the final trajectory such that the craft crashes on the side of the comet that faces Earth. Navigating while close to the comet will be difficult because the body's gravitational field is uneven, but spacecraft-operations manager Sylvain Lodiot hopes that the orbiter will transmit until the very end. The crash will definitely be a hard stop to the mission, he says, however gentle the landing. Designed to manoeuvre in orbit, once Rosetta is on the comet's surface it will no longer be able to point its antenna to communicate with Earth. Similarly, it will not be able to angle its solar array, so it will lose power, says Lodiot. \"Once we touch, hit or crash, whatever you want to call it, it's game over.\" Before then, though, the mission still has much to accomplish. As the comet approached the Sun, it heated up, with vaporizing ice causing more and more gas and dust to stream from its surface. Rosetta had to retreat into a wider orbit to stop the dust from confusing its navigation system. But now that the comet is speeding away from the Sun, mission scientists are relishing the opportunity to steer Rosetta back in. Priorities will then be to get images that would enable comparisons of the comet before and after its swing around the Sun, as well as a close-up of the southern hemisphere, which was largely in darkness until May and will disappear back out of view in March. Rosetta will also resume listening out for Philae. Given the huge public interest in anything to do with the lander, Rosetta's finale will make for a fitting end to the story, adds Altwegg. \"This way Rosetta gets to live happily ever after on the comet with Philae.\"", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/527016a"}, {"title": "ESA's Rosetta space probe will end its life by crash landing on Comet 67P", "date": "2015-11-17", "content": "The Rosetta spacecraft will likely end its life next September with a spectacular weeks-long descent toward Comet Chury, climaxing as the three-ton piece of machinery attempts an improvised landing on the spinning ball of ice and rock. \"It's very simple.

That's the end of the mission.\" In the weeks prior to final impact, Rosetta will orbit Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko at distances never before attempted. \"We will attempt to go to distances of below one kilometer to the surface,\" Lodiot said. Doing so presents a particular challenge, since the lopsided shape of the spinning comet means its gravity field is non-uniform. This will cause huge perturbations in Rosetta's trajectory as the space probe nears the comet. It will also cause Rosetta's \"height\" to change as the comet moves. During the descent, Rosetta's 12 remaining onboard instruments will continue to collect information. The 13th, the Philae lander, is already on the comet. The other instruments include remote sensing, imagery, gas and dust analysis to atomic force microscopes as well as a plasma consortium, which measures the plasma and interaction with the sun and solar wind. \"You could imagine that the Rosina instrument would maybe discover new traces of gases around the comet,\" Lodiot said. But he acknowledges that what will likely attract the most attention next September are the potential close-up photographs of the comet. In total, the Rosetta team considered three options for terminating the life of the Rosetta space probe: \"Do nothing,\" crash it into Comet Chury, or a third option that proved unfeasible and that would have involved putting the spacecraft into hibernation mode as Comet Chury's elliptical orbit took it on a multi-year voyage away from the sun's energy-giving light. The Rosetta spacecraft released the Philae lander onto Comet 67P last November, after a ten-year flight that took it 500 million kilometers away from Earth. It was the first ever soft-landing on a comet. The lander has since lost power, come back to life and then lost power again. The Rosetta mission is the first to rendezvous with a comet, to accompany that comet as it orbits the sun, and to deploy a lander on its surface.

Images taken from Rosetta at a distance of 2.7 km showed Philae wedged into a dark crack on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the ESA said on Monday. Philae landed on the comet in November 2014 in what was considered a remarkable feat of precision space travel but the metre-sized, 100 kg probe bounced several times before getting stuck against a cliff wall. Scientists could tell its approximate whereabouts on the comet thanks to radio ranging data but not its precise location. This year they gave up hope of restoring contact with the probe. While Philae did not have as much time as was hoped for experiments, information it has collected is reshaping thinking about comets and the project has helped in designing future missions. \"This wonderful news means that we now have the missing 'ground-truth' information needed to put Philae's three days of science into proper context, now that we know where that ground actually is,\" ESA's Rosetta project scientist, Matt Taylor, said in a statement.

In images taken just three days ago by a camera on board the Rosetta space probe, the lander can be seen nestled in a dark crack on the comet's surface, with two of its three legs sticking out. \"For many people it is a huge emotional closure, but for the scientists it is incredibly important because it now tells us where the measurements were taken that we made with Philae back in 2014 - that context is everything,\" said Mark McCaughrean, senior scientific adviser at the European Space Agency. About the size of a washing machine and featuring a host of scientific instruments, ESA's lander was released from the Rosetta space probe on 12 November 2014, touching down on the rubber-duck shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a nail-biting, seven-hour descent. At the time the comet was 320m miles from Earth, and this was the first time a manmade object had landed on a comet. But there was a snag. Philae's two harpoons, which were supposed to anchor the lander, did not fire and Philae bounced across the surface of the comet. The lander finally came to rest near a cliff, but the shady location meant that, except for a brief interlude in mid-2015, its solar panels were unable to catch the sun's rays.

Spacecraft Crash-Lands on Comet in Epic Mission Finale", "date": "2016-09-30", "content": "For the last two years, the Rosetta spacecraft has danced around a comet. Today, it finally made contact with the icy body - and sent its last signal. The European Space Agency's Rosetta probe ended its historic mission with a controlled descent to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko early this morning. Scientists here at the European Space Operations Centre received the confirmation of landing from the spacecraft at about 1:19 p.m. local time. \"I can announce the full success of this historic descent,\" said Patrick Martin, Rosetta mission manager, as he declared mission operations ended. \"Farewell Rosetta, you've done the job. That was pure science at its best.\" Comets are primitive cosmic objects, left over from the time our solar system was just starting to take shape 4.6 billion years ago. Exploring the structure, composition and activity of these icy bodies could shed light on the evolution of our solar system, and help scientists write a more comprehensive history of how the building blocks of life were first delivered to Earth. Previous robotic expeditions have made close encounters with comets. NASA's Stardust mission even captured dust from the cloud around Comet Wild 2 and returned the sample to Earth in 2006. But Rosetta was the first to orbit a comet, the first to follow one around the sun and the first to send a probe to thesurface of a comet's nucleus. Today's landing marks the end of an ambitious 1.3-billion-euro mission that spanned more than a decade. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in March 2004, and after a 10-year cruise through the inner solar system covering a distance of 4 billion miles, it rendezvoused with Comet 67P in August 2014. Three months later, Rosetta deployed its surface probe Philae. But instead of anchoring to the comet's surface as planned, Philae bounced twice before coming to a stop against a cliff face in the Abydos region. Rosetta only spotted the final resting place of Philae earlier this month. First observed in 1969, the 2.5-mile-wide Comet 67P circles the sun every 6.5 years between the orbits of Earth and Jupiter. Right now the comet is heading back out toward the orbit of Jupiter, and Rosetta, which is solar- powered, wouldn't have enough energy to keep up, so the mission had to come to an end. The spacecraft will stop sending data as soon as it touches down, meaning mission scientists won't know if it tumbles or bounces like Philae did after it lands. ESA has already released the final images that Rosetta collected on its way down to the comet's surface. \"It's really great,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, as he presented some of the probe's final views. \"It'' exciting. It's working like a charm.\" Comet 67P is very porous with low gravity, so Rosetta's landing likely looked more like a slow-motion collision than a violent crash. The spacecraft executed its final maneuver around midnight local time yesterday and began a 14-hour, 12-mile drop to the comet's surface. ESA officials had calculated that its speed upon impact would be about walking pace, or 2 mph. The controlled impact was designed to give ESA scientists a closer look at surface features they had only spied from afar. \"We got pretty close to the comet recently with the orbits we were doing,\" Matt Taylor, Rosetta project scientist with ESA, told Space.com. \"We got within about 2 kilometers 1.2 miles from the surface. But this plummet into the surface gets us in below 2 kilometers. It gets us within the acceleration region, where the comet coma grows and starts being thrown off.\" The death dive was also an opportunity for Rosetta's suite of instruments to take measurements as it passes through the layer where the phase transition occurs between ice and gas. Rosetta's final resting place is a smooth patch in the so-called Ma'at region on the \"head\" of the rubber duck-shaped comet. This particular spot has a number of dust-spewing pits - some 330 feet across and 165 feet deep - that scientists wanted Rosetta's instruments to observe before the mission ended. The walls of these pits appear dotted with \"goosebumps\" that could be signatures of early comet building blocks known as cometesimals. The mission has already produced a number of surprising discoveries - that the Comet 67P has big grains of water ice on its surface, molecular oxygen in its coma, diverse landscapes and a fluffy core, just to name a few. But Rosetta scientists still have reams of data to pore over. So, even with today's finale, the work isn't over. \"We have 80,000 images to look at,\" Mohamed El-Maarry, a postdoctoral researcher with Rosetta's OSIRIS team, from the University of Bern in Switzerland, told reporters yesterday. \"It's going to keep us busy for years to come.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/34254-rosetta-crash-lands-on-comet-mission-ends.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta scientists find key ingredients for life in comet", "date": "2016-05-28", "content": "Organic compounds that are ingredients for life had previously been found in dust on the surface of the comet, which the Rosetta probe has been orbiting for nearly two years. But the finding of the amino acid glycine in the fuzzy atmosphere around the comet is a major discovery because it is commonly found in proteins. Phosphorous has also now been detected - a vital element of all living organisms because it is a key component of DNA and cell membranes, where it transports chemical energy for metabolism. The planets, including Earth, were bombarded with comets and asteroids in the early days of the Solar System, 3.8 billion years ago. Scars can still be seen as craters on the Moon, but Earth's have been eroded away. Scientists say the latest findings suggest the ingredients of life may have formed within interstellar, icy dust grains before becoming bound up in comets. The Solar System is thought to be surrounded by a vast reservoir of billions of comets. Rosetta's project scientist Matt Taylor said: \"The multitude of organic molecules already identified by Rosetta, now joined by the exciting confirmation of fundamental ingredients like glycine and phosphorous, confirms our idea that comets have the potential to deliver key molecules for prebiotic chemistry. \"Demonstrating that comets are reservoirs of primitive material in the Solar System and vessels that could have transported these vital ingredients to Earth, is one of the key goals of the Rosetta mission, and we are delighted with this result.\" However, a note of caution about the findings has been sounded by astrobiologists. Leading authority Dr Lewis Dartnell, a research fellow at the Space Research Centre, University of Leicester, told Skymania: \"My main feeling is that it's risky to conflate finding organic molecules in comets with 'life on Earth was delivered from space'. \"Firstly, the fact that astrochemistry produces organic molecules which then become incorporated into comets doesn't necessarily mean that such extraterrestrial compounds were involved in the origin of life on Earth. If the ISM can produce organics, there is likely to have been a far greater repertoire created in the warm watery, chemistry-friendly, oceans of the primordial Earth. \"Organics in comets/meteorites tells you more about the ease of carbon chemistry than the source of organics for the origin of life on our planet. But more importantly, I think, there is a huge difference between prebiotic compounds like amino acids and delivery of life itself. Cells are unimaginably more complex than a pool of monomers like amino acids and nucleobases.\"", "url": "https://www.skymania.com/wp/rosetta-scientists-find-key-ingredients-for-life-in-comet/"}, {"title": "Rosetta Comet Probe Bounces Back from Glitch", "date": "2016-06-03", "content": "The comet-studying Rosetta spacecraft has bounced back from a glitch that incapacitated it over the weekend, European Space Agency officials said. Rosetta - which has been orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko since August 2014 - went into a protective \"safe mode\" on Saturday, apparently because the spacecraft couldn't lock onto distant target stars and orient itself properly. \"We lost contact with the spacecraft on Saturday for nearly 24 hours,\" Patrick Martin, ESA's Rosetta mission manager, said in an update. \"Preliminary analysis by our flight dynamics team suggests that the star trackers locked onto a false star - that is, they were confused by comet dust close to the comet, as has been experienced before in the mission.\" The team eventually managed to reconnect with Rosetta, stabilize the spacecraft and get its science instruments back up and running. \"It was an extremely dramatic weekend,\" Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same update. Rosetta's star trackers use an autonomous star-pattern-recognition function to manage the probe's orientation. When in the correct position, Rosetta can send and receive signals to and from ground stations on Earth. Comet 67P isn't just a rock in space; it constantly spouts dust and gas that remain in a cloud around the icy object. Although the shedding material reached its peak when 67P passed closest to the sun in August 2015, plenty of material remains, and Rosetta can occasionally mistake the debris for stars. That's what apparently happened over the weekend, when the spacecraft was just 3 miles from the surface of the comet. Rosetta went dark, and its science instruments automatically switched off. Mission team members immediately got to work trying to recover the silent probe. Ground stations in Australia and Spain reallocated time originally allotted for ESA's Mars Express orbiter to help the recovery. \"After we lost contact, we sent commands 'in the blind,' which successfully tackled the hung-star-tracker issue and brought the spacecraft back into three-axis stabilized safe mode, and we now have contact with the spacecraft again,\" Lodiot said. Rosetta's handlers were able to start moving the spacecraft into a planned 19-mile orbit around the comet on Wednesday. The final orbital correction maneuver associated with this move should take place late Friday evening, ESA officials said. ESA plans to end Rosetta's mission with a descent onto the surface of 67P on Sept. 30. The spacecraft's path will only grow more challenging in the lead-up to this grand finale as Rosetta descends closer and closer and the debris cloud gets denser, ESA officials said. \"The last six weeks of the mission will be far more challenging for flight dynamics than deploying the Philae lander to the surface was in November 2014,\" Lodiot said. During the Sept. 30 impact, Rosetta's star tracker will not be part of the spacecraft's orbital-control program. But that doesn't mean there won't be other issues. \"It is always possible that we could get another safe mode when flying close to the comet like this,\" Lodiot said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/33073-rosetta-comet-probe-recovers-glitch.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft Heads To Its Final Destination", "date": "2016-07-21", "content": "All good things must come to an end.

Rosetta has observed Comet 67P in a number of ways from a variety of different vantage points over the past 24 months, as you can see in this video animation. \"The spacecraft has performed daring close flybys and made distant excursions to sample gas, dust and plasma at a range of distances, giving unparalleled insight into the processes that operate at the comet and how it interacts with its environment as it hurtles through space,\" European Space Agency officials wrote in a statement today. \"Rosetta has mapped the comet's curious shape and given us awe-inspiring views from near and far, spotting changes in its surface features and watching as jets of gas and dust stream out in to space - sometimes unexpectedly as sudden outbursts,\" they added.

But Rosetta was the first to orbit a comet, the first to follow one around the sun and the first to send a probe to thesurface of a comet's nucleus. Today's landing marks the end of an ambitious 1.3-billion-euro mission that spanned more than a decade. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in March 2004, and after a 10-year cruise through the inner solar system covering a distance of 4 billion miles, it rendezvoused with Comet 67P in August 2014. Three months later, Rosetta deployed its surface probe Philae. But instead of anchoring to the comet's surface as planned, Philae bounced twice before coming to a stop against a cliff face in the Abydos region. Rosetta only spotted the final resting place of Philae earlier this month. First observed in 1969, the 2.5-mile-wide Comet 67P circles the sun every 6.5 years between the orbits of Earth and Jupiter. Right now the comet is heading back out toward the orbit of Jupiter, and Rosetta, which is solar- powered, wouldn't have enough energy to keep up, so the mission had to come to an end. The spacecraft will stop sending data as soon as it touches down, meaning mission scientists won't know if it tumbles or bounces like Philae did after it lands.

The spacecraft executed its final maneuver around midnight local time yesterday and began a 14-hour, 12-mile drop to the comet's surface. ESA officials had calculated that its speed upon impact would be about walking pace, or 2 mph. The controlled impact was designed to give ESA scientists a closer look at surface features they had only spied from afar. \"We got pretty close to the comet recently with the orbits we were doing,\" Matt Taylor, Rosetta project scientist with ESA, told Space.com. \"We got within about 2 kilometers 1.2 miles from the surface.

Citizens the world over were engaged by the astronomical achievement, and now ESA and NASA are eager to learn as much as possible about the critically important celestial body of ice. Using statistical analysis and scientific computing, astronomers at Western University have charted a path that most likely pinpoints the very origins of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is vital information in discovering what kind of material it is made from and just how long it has been present in our solar system. Mattia Galiazzo, a postdoctoral fellow in Western's Department of Physics & Astronomy, has just presented his findings at the joint 48th annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society and 11th annual European Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, California. Galiazzo collaborated on the findings with solar system expert Paul Wiegert from Western's Centre for Planetary Science & Space Exploration. \"These results come from computations of the comet's orbit from the present to the past, which is computationally difficult due to the chaosity of the orbit caused by close encounters with Jupiter,\" says Galiazzo. \"Thus the details are obscure but we can establish a dynamical pathway from its current orbit back to the Kuiper belt.\" Galiazzo and Wiegert think that 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is relatively new to the inner parts of our solar system, having only arrived about 10,000 years ago. Prior to this time, the comet would have been inactive in frozen storage far from the Sun. Previous studies show that similar comets - known as Jupiter Family comets - historically stay in the inner parts of our solar system for 12,000 years, therefore recognising comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as a member of the Jupiter Family makes sense. The majority of the Jupiter Family comets are thought to come from the Kuiper belt - a ring-shaped accumulation of comets, asteroids and other space bodies in the solar system beyond the known planets - and Galiazzo and Wiegert believe, based on initial analysis of their investigation, that this is the case for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as well. Their analysis shows that, in transit, the comet likely spent millions of years in the scattering disc, a distant portion of the Kuiper belt, at about twice the distance of Neptune - our solar system's most distant known planet. This distant origin for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko implies it would be made from primordial material, meaning minerals that existed in their current form since before Earth was formed.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/10/18/astronomers-predict-possible-birthplace-of-rosetta-probed-comet-67p/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta Comet Probe Bounces Back from Glitch", "date": "2016-06-03", "content": "The comet-studying Rosetta spacecraft has bounced back from a glitch that incapacitated it over the weekend, European Space Agency officials said. Rosetta - which has been orbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko since August 2014 - went into a protective \"safe mode\" on Saturday, apparently because the spacecraft couldn't lock onto distant target stars and orient itself properly. \"We lost contact with the spacecraft on Saturday for nearly 24 hours,\" Patrick Martin, ESA's Rosetta mission manager, said in an update. \"Preliminary analysis by our flight dynamics team suggests that the star trackers locked onto a false star - that is, they were confused by comet dust close to the comet, as has been experienced before in the mission.\" The team eventually managed to reconnect with Rosetta, stabilize the spacecraft and get its science instruments back up and running. \"It was an extremely dramatic weekend,\" Sylvain Lodiot, ESA's Rosetta spacecraft operations manager, said in the same update. Rosetta's star trackers use an autonomous star-pattern-recognition function to manage the probe's orientation. When in the correct position, Rosetta can send and receive signals to and from ground stations on Earth. Comet 67P isn't just a rock in space; it constantly spouts dust and gas that remain in a cloud around the icy object. Although the shedding material reached its peak when 67P passed closest to the sun in August 2015, plenty of material remains, and Rosetta can occasionally mistake the debris for stars. That's what apparently happened over the weekend, when the spacecraft was just 3 miles from the surface of the comet. Rosetta went dark, and its science instruments automatically switched off. Mission team members immediately got to work trying to recover the silent probe. Ground stations in Australia and Spain reallocated time originally allotted for ESA's Mars Express orbiter to help the recovery. \"After we lost contact, we sent commands 'in the blind,' which successfully tackled the hung-star-tracker issue and brought the spacecraft back into three-axis stabilized safe mode, and we now have contact with the spacecraft again,\" Lodiot said. Rosetta's handlers were able to start moving the spacecraft into a planned 19-mile orbit around the comet on Wednesday. The final orbital correction maneuver associated with this move should take place late Friday evening, ESA officials said. ESA plans to end Rosetta's mission with a descent onto the surface of 67P on Sept. 30. The spacecraft's path will only grow more challenging in the lead-up to this grand finale as Rosetta descends closer and closer and the debris cloud gets denser, ESA officials said. \"The last six weeks of the mission will be far more challenging for flight dynamics than deploying the Philae lander to the surface was in November 2014,\" Lodiot said. During the Sept. 30 impact, Rosetta's star tracker will not be part of the spacecraft's orbital-control program. But that doesn't mean there won't be other issues. \"It is always possible that we could get another safe mode when flying close to the comet like this,\" Lodiot said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/33073-rosetta-comet-probe-recovers-glitch.html"}, {"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft Heads To Its Final Destination", "date": "2016-07-21", "content": "All good things must come to an end.

On Aug. 5, 2014, Rosetta became the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet when it arrived at an icy wanderer known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta has observed Comet 67P in a number of ways from a variety of different vantage points over the past 24 months, as you can see in this video animation. \"The spacecraft has performed daring close flybys and made distant excursions to sample gas, dust and plasma at a range of distances, giving unparalleled insight into the processes that operate at the comet and how it interacts with its environment as it hurtles through space,\" European Space Agency officials wrote in a statement today. \"Rosetta has mapped the comet's curious shape and given us awe-inspiring views from near and far, spotting changes in its surface features and watching as jets of gas and dust stream out in to space - sometimes unexpectedly as sudden outbursts,\" they added. The Rosetta mothership also carried a washing-machine-size lander called Philae, which touched down on Comet 67P on Nov. 12, 2014, after two unplanned and anxiety-inducing bounces. This image, captured by Europe's Rosetta spacecraft on Aug. 6, 2016, shows some of the complex and varied topography of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Philae operated for about 60 hours on the 2.5-mile-wide comet's surface, then went into an extended hibernation period before being officially powered down last month. The Rosetta orbiter will soon follow Philae onto the comet's surface, and into oblivion. Comet 67P is zooming away from the sun, and Rosetta's solar panels soon won't be able to gather enough light to power the craft and its instruments. So, on Sept. 30, Rosetta will end its life with a controlled impact onto 67P's surface. Rosetta launched in March 2004, then took a long and looping trip through the solar system before finally reaching Comet 67P a decade later.

Images taken from Rosetta at a distance of 2.7 km showed Philae wedged into a dark crack on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the ESA said on Monday. Philae landed on the comet in November 2014 in what was considered a remarkable feat of precision space travel but the metre-sized, 100 kg probe bounced several times before getting stuck against a cliff wall. Scientists could tell its approximate whereabouts on the comet thanks to radio ranging data but not its precise location. This year they gave up hope of restoring contact with the probe. While Philae did not have as much time as was hoped for experiments, information it has collected is reshaping thinking about comets and the project has helped in designing future missions. \"This wonderful news means that we now have the missing 'ground-truth' information needed to put Philae's three days of science into proper context, now that we know where that ground actually is,\" ESA's Rosetta project scientist, Matt Taylor, said in a statement.

In images taken just three days ago by a camera on board the Rosetta space probe, the lander can be seen nestled in a dark crack on the comet's surface, with two of its three legs sticking out. \"For many people it is a huge emotional closure, but for the scientists it is incredibly important because it now tells us where the measurements were taken that we made with Philae back in 2014 - that context is everything,\" said Mark McCaughrean, senior scientific adviser at the European Space Agency. About the size of a washing machine and featuring a host of scientific instruments, ESA's lander was released from the Rosetta space probe on 12 November 2014, touching down on the rubber-duck shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a nail-biting, seven-hour descent. At the time the comet was 320m miles from Earth, and this was the first time a manmade object had landed on a comet. But there was a snag. Philae's two harpoons, which were supposed to anchor the lander, did not fire and Philae bounced across the surface of the comet. The lander finally came to rest near a cliff, but the shady location meant that, except for a brief interlude in mid-2015, its solar panels were unable to catch the sun's rays. Despite the bumpy ride, the lander was able to send back valuable data before its batteries ran out, offering insights into the comet's make-up and properties of its surface. While researchers were able to narrow down its location to a few tens of metres, its precise location remained a mystery, until now. Philae has been found - now every ounce of science can be wrung out of itRead more \"We had some images from further away that looked a bit like the lander, but we really needed this unambiguous image ,\" said Matt Taylor, the ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"We needed that to say 'yes, it is definitely Philae.'\" News of the discovery, said Taylor, reached him late at night over the weekend. \"It is a typical thing with Rosetta, things seem to occur at the weekends and usually on Sunday.\" The discovery of the lander's location, he said, would help scientists to interpret information that it gathered before its batteries ran out. \"It allows us to go back to the data that Philae took to put it into context a little bit more,\" he said. Among such measurements, are data collected by the Consert instrument, which fired radio signals between the lander and the Rosetta orbiter to probe the internal make-up of the comet. \"Having the precise location of the lander allows you to refine those measurements and get much better resolution from those,\" said Taylor. \"It provides us with the ground truth.\" The news comes just weeks after communication with the lander was severed. In July scientists said farewell to Philae after deeming it to be in a state of \"eternal hibernation\". The voice of the lander tweeted: \"It's time for me to say goodbye.\" The Rosetta mission itself is shortly to come to an end, with the probe due to be set on a collision course with the comet later this month. \"What we are doing at the moment is actually more complicated than when we deployed Philae itself,\" said Taylor, adding that Rosetta was being put in ever-closer orbits around the comet, yielding new data about 67P's low atmosphere. Finding Philae, he says, was a timely discovery. \"I think it is a nice prelude for the end of the mission,\" said Taylor. \"It's bloody exciting.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/05/lost-philae-lander-found-as-rosetta-mission-draws-to-a-close-comet-67p"}, {"title": "European Rosetta spacecraft poised for comet crash landing", "date": "2016-09-29", "content": "The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft closed in Thursday for a deliberate crash landing on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Friday, a slow-motion kamikaze plunge to bring the enormously successful mission to an end after more than two years of unprecedented close-range observations. Flying in tandem with the comet some 356 million miles from the sun, Rosetta and its quarry are now moving beyond the range where the spacecraft's solar panels can generate enough energy to power all of the probe's instruments and subsystems. \"We're going farther and farther away from the sun,\" said Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta operations manager for ESA. \"Already now on the instrument side, we're doing power sharing because there's not enough power to maintain all the instruments active at the same time. In a few weeks, we won't have enough power to operate the spacecraft. If we did nothing, at some point the spacecraft would just switch off.\" Instead, mission managers decided to move Rosetta in for a descent to the surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko where it will forever rest within a half mile or so of the small Philae lander it dropped off in November 2014.

Mattia Galiazzo, a postdoctoral fellow in Western's Department of Physics & Astronomy, has just presented his findings at the joint 48th annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society and 11th annual European Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, California. Galiazzo collaborated on the findings with solar system expert Paul Wiegert from Western's Centre for Planetary Science & Space Exploration. \"These results come from computations of the comet's orbit from the present to the past, which is computationally difficult due to the chaosity of the orbit caused by close encounters with Jupiter,\" says Galiazzo. \"Thus the details are obscure but we can establish a dynamical pathway from its current orbit back to the Kuiper belt.\" Galiazzo and Wiegert think that 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is relatively new to the inner parts of our solar system, having only arrived about 10,000 years ago. Prior to this time, the comet would have been inactive in frozen storage far from the Sun. Previous studies show that similar comets - known as Jupiter Family comets - historically stay in the inner parts of our solar system for 12,000 years, therefore recognising comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as a member of the Jupiter Family makes sense. The majority of the Jupiter Family comets are thought to come from the Kuiper belt - a ring-shaped accumulation of comets, asteroids and other space bodies in the solar system beyond the known planets - and Galiazzo and Wiegert believe, based on initial analysis of their investigation, that this is the case for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as well. Their analysis shows that, in transit, the comet likely spent millions of years in the scattering disc, a distant portion of the Kuiper belt, at about twice the distance of Neptune - our solar system's most distant known planet. This distant origin for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko implies it would be made from primordial material, meaning minerals that existed in their current form since before Earth was formed.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/10/18/astronomers-predict-possible-birthplace-of-rosetta-probed-comet-67p/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta Spacecraft Heads To Its Final Destination", "date": "2016-07-21", "content": "All good things must come to an end.

Flying in tandem with the comet some 356 million miles from the sun, Rosetta and its quarry are now moving beyond the range where the spacecraft's solar panels can generate enough energy to power all of the probe's instruments and subsystems. \"We're going farther and farther away from the sun,\" said Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta operations manager for ESA. \"Already now on the instrument side, we're doing power sharing because there's not enough power to maintain all the instruments active at the same time. In a few weeks, we won't have enough power to operate the spacecraft. If we did nothing, at some point the spacecraft would just switch off.\" Instead, mission managers decided to move Rosetta in for a descent to the surface of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko where it will forever rest within a half mile or so of the small Philae lander it dropped off in November 2014. Designed to anchor itself in the comet's icy crust, Philae famously bounced off, bounced again and ended up, two hours later, on its side in what its camera showed was a heavily shadowed, extremely rocky area near what appeared to be the side of a cliff.

Confirmation of the end of the mission arrived at ESA's European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, at 4:19 a.m. PDT with the loss of signal upon impact. The final descent gave Rosetta the opportunity to study the comet's gas, dust and plasma environment very close to its surface, as well as take very high- resolution images. The final image was taken from an altitude of 66 feet above the comet's surface by the spacecraft's OSIRIS wide-angle camera on Sept. 30. The initial report of 167 feet, or 51 meters, was based on the predicted impact time. Now that the time has been confirmed, and following additional information and timeline reconstruction, the estimated distance has been updated. Analysis is ongoing. The image scale is about two-tenths of an inch per pixel. The image measures about 9 feet across. The decision to end the mission on the surface is a result of Rosetta and the comet heading out beyond the orbit of Jupiter again. Farther from the sun than Rosetta had ever journeyed before, there would be little power to operate the craft. Mission operators were also faced with an imminent month-long period when the sun is close to the line-of-sight between Earth and Rosetta, meaning communications with the craft would have become increasingly more difficult. The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission was launched in 2004 and arrived at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Aug. 6, 2014. It is the first mission in history to rendezvous with a comet and escort it as it orbits the sun. On Nov. 4, 2014, a smaller lander name Philae, which had been deployed from the Rosetta mothership, touched down on the comet and bounced several times before finally alighting on the surface. Philae obtained the first images taken from a comet's surface and sent back valuable scientific data for several days. U.S. contributions aboard the Rosetta spacecraft are the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter ; the Alice spectrograph; the Ion and Electron Sensor, part of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium Suite; and the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer electronics package for the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion Neutral Analysis. They are part of a suite of 11 total science instruments aboard Rosetta. Comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed. Rosetta is the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. Observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in the formation of planets. Rosetta is an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA. Rosetta's Philae lander is provided by a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center, Cologne; Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottingen; French National Space Agency, Paris; and the Italian Space Agency, Rome. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, a division of Caltech, manages the U.S. contribution of the Rosetta mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL also built the MIRO and hosts its principal investigator, Mark Hofstadter. The Southwest Research Institute, developed the Rosetta orbiter's IES and Alice instruments and hosts their principal investigators, James Burch and Alan Stern.

Spacecraft Crash-Lands on Comet in Epic Mission Finale", "date": "2016-09-30", "content": "For the last two years, the Rosetta spacecraft has danced around a comet. Today, it finally made contact with the icy body - and sent its last signal. The European Space Agency's Rosetta probe ended its historic mission with a controlled descent to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko early this morning. Scientists here at the European Space Operations Centre received the confirmation of landing from the spacecraft at about 1:19 p.m. local time. \"I can announce the full success of this historic descent,\" said Patrick Martin, Rosetta mission manager, as he declared mission operations ended. \"Farewell Rosetta, you've done the job. That was pure science at its best.\" Comets are primitive cosmic objects, left over from the time our solar system was just starting to take shape 4.6 billion years ago. Exploring the structure, composition and activity of these icy bodies could shed light on the evolution of our solar system, and help scientists write a more comprehensive history of how the building blocks of life were first delivered to Earth. Previous robotic expeditions have made close encounters with comets. NASA's Stardust mission even captured dust from the cloud around Comet Wild 2 and returned the sample to Earth in 2006. But Rosetta was the first to orbit a comet, the first to follow one around the sun and the first to send a probe to thesurface of a comet's nucleus. Today's landing marks the end of an ambitious 1.3-billion-euro mission that spanned more than a decade. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in March 2004, and after a 10-year cruise through the inner solar system covering a distance of 4 billion miles, it rendezvoused with Comet 67P in August 2014. Three months later, Rosetta deployed its surface probe Philae. But instead of anchoring to the comet's surface as planned, Philae bounced twice before coming to a stop against a cliff face in the Abydos region. Rosetta only spotted the final resting place of Philae earlier this month. First observed in 1969, the 2.5-mile-wide Comet 67P circles the sun every 6.5 years between the orbits of Earth and Jupiter. Right now the comet is heading back out toward the orbit of Jupiter, and Rosetta, which is solar- powered, wouldn't have enough energy to keep up, so the mission had to come to an end. The spacecraft will stop sending data as soon as it touches down, meaning mission scientists won't know if it tumbles or bounces like Philae did after it lands. ESA has already released the final images that Rosetta collected on its way down to the comet's surface. \"It's really great,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, as he presented some of the probe's final views. \"It'' exciting. It's working like a charm.\" Comet 67P is very porous with low gravity, so Rosetta's landing likely looked more like a slow-motion collision than a violent crash. The spacecraft executed its final maneuver around midnight local time yesterday and began a 14-hour, 12-mile drop to the comet's surface. ESA officials had calculated that its speed upon impact would be about walking pace, or 2 mph. The controlled impact was designed to give ESA scientists a closer look at surface features they had only spied from afar. \"We got pretty close to the comet recently with the orbits we were doing,\" Matt Taylor, Rosetta project scientist with ESA, told Space.com. \"We got within about 2 kilometers 1.2 miles from the surface. But this plummet into the surface gets us in below 2 kilometers. It gets us within the acceleration region, where the comet coma grows and starts being thrown off.\" The death dive was also an opportunity for Rosetta's suite of instruments to take measurements as it passes through the layer where the phase transition occurs between ice and gas. Rosetta's final resting place is a smooth patch in the so-called Ma'at region on the \"head\" of the rubber duck-shaped comet. This particular spot has a number of dust-spewing pits - some 330 feet across and 165 feet deep - that scientists wanted Rosetta's instruments to observe before the mission ended. The walls of these pits appear dotted with \"goosebumps\" that could be signatures of early comet building blocks known as cometesimals. The mission has already produced a number of surprising discoveries - that the Comet 67P has big grains of water ice on its surface, molecular oxygen in its coma, diverse landscapes and a fluffy core, just to name a few. But Rosetta scientists still have reams of data to pore over. So, even with today's finale, the work isn't over. \"We have 80,000 images to look at,\" Mohamed El-Maarry, a postdoctoral researcher with Rosetta's OSIRIS team, from the University of Bern in Switzerland, told reporters yesterday. \"It's going to keep us busy for years to come.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/34254-rosetta-crash-lands-on-comet-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "Astronomers predict possible birthplace of Rosetta-probed comet 67P", "date": "2016-10-18", "content": "When the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft successfully touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 30 September 2016, the news was shared globally via Twitter in dozens of languages.

Finding Philae, he says, was a timely discovery. \"I think it is a nice prelude for the end of the mission,\" said Taylor. \"It's bloody exciting.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/05/lost-philae-lander-found-as-rosetta-mission-draws-to-a-close-comet-67p"}, {"title": "European Rosetta spacecraft poised for comet crash landing", "date": "2016-09-29", "content": "The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft closed in Thursday for a deliberate crash landing on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Friday, a slow-motion kamikaze plunge to bring the enormously successful mission to an end after more than two years of unprecedented close-range observations. Flying in tandem with the comet some 356 million miles from the sun, Rosetta and its quarry are now moving beyond the range where the spacecraft's solar panels can generate enough energy to power all of the probe's instruments and subsystems. \"We're going farther and farther away from the sun,\" said Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta operations manager for ESA. \"Already now on the instrument side, we're doing power sharing because there's not enough power to maintain all the instruments active at the same time.

Confirmation of the end of the mission arrived at ESA's European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, at 4:19 a.m. PDT with the loss of signal upon impact. The final descent gave Rosetta the opportunity to study the comet's gas, dust and plasma environment very close to its surface, as well as take very high- resolution images. The final image was taken from an altitude of 66 feet above the comet's surface by the spacecraft's OSIRIS wide-angle camera on Sept. 30. The initial report of 167 feet, or 51 meters, was based on the predicted impact time. Now that the time has been confirmed, and following additional information and timeline reconstruction, the estimated distance has been updated. Analysis is ongoing. The image scale is about two-tenths of an inch per pixel. The image measures about 9 feet across. The decision to end the mission on the surface is a result of Rosetta and the comet heading out beyond the orbit of Jupiter again. Farther from the sun than Rosetta had ever journeyed before, there would be little power to operate the craft. Mission operators were also faced with an imminent month-long period when the sun is close to the line-of-sight between Earth and Rosetta, meaning communications with the craft would have become increasingly more difficult. The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission was launched in 2004 and arrived at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Aug. 6, 2014. It is the first mission in history to rendezvous with a comet and escort it as it orbits the sun. On Nov. 4, 2014, a smaller lander name Philae, which had been deployed from the Rosetta mothership, touched down on the comet and bounced several times before finally alighting on the surface. Philae obtained the first images taken from a comet's surface and sent back valuable scientific data for several days. U.S. contributions aboard the Rosetta spacecraft are the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter ; the Alice spectrograph; the Ion and Electron Sensor, part of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium Suite; and the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer electronics package for the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion Neutral Analysis. They are part of a suite of 11 total science instruments aboard Rosetta. Comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed. Rosetta is the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. Observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in the formation of planets. Rosetta is an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA. Rosetta's Philae lander is provided by a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center, Cologne; Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottingen; French National Space Agency, Paris; and the Italian Space Agency, Rome. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, a division of Caltech, manages the U.S. contribution of the Rosetta mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. JPL also built the MIRO and hosts its principal investigator, Mark Hofstadter. The Southwest Research Institute, developed the Rosetta orbiter's IES and Alice instruments and hosts their principal investigators, James Burch and Alan Stern.

Spacecraft Crash-Lands on Comet in Epic Mission Finale", "date": "2016-09-30", "content": "For the last two years, the Rosetta spacecraft has danced around a comet. Today, it finally made contact with the icy body - and sent its last signal. The European Space Agency's Rosetta probe ended its historic mission with a controlled descent to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko early this morning. Scientists here at the European Space Operations Centre received the confirmation of landing from the spacecraft at about 1:19 p.m. local time. \"I can announce the full success of this historic descent,\" said Patrick Martin, Rosetta mission manager, as he declared mission operations ended. \"Farewell Rosetta, you've done the job. That was pure science at its best.\" Comets are primitive cosmic objects, left over from the time our solar system was just starting to take shape 4.6 billion years ago. Exploring the structure, composition and activity of these icy bodies could shed light on the evolution of our solar system, and help scientists write a more comprehensive history of how the building blocks of life were first delivered to Earth. Previous robotic expeditions have made close encounters with comets. NASA's Stardust mission even captured dust from the cloud around Comet Wild 2 and returned the sample to Earth in 2006. But Rosetta was the first to orbit a comet, the first to follow one around the sun and the first to send a probe to thesurface of a comet's nucleus. Today's landing marks the end of an ambitious 1.3-billion-euro mission that spanned more than a decade. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in March 2004, and after a 10-year cruise through the inner solar system covering a distance of 4 billion miles, it rendezvoused with Comet 67P in August 2014. Three months later, Rosetta deployed its surface probe Philae. But instead of anchoring to the comet's surface as planned, Philae bounced twice before coming to a stop against a cliff face in the Abydos region. Rosetta only spotted the final resting place of Philae earlier this month. First observed in 1969, the 2.5-mile-wide Comet 67P circles the sun every 6.5 years between the orbits of Earth and Jupiter. Right now the comet is heading back out toward the orbit of Jupiter, and Rosetta, which is solar- powered, wouldn't have enough energy to keep up, so the mission had to come to an end. The spacecraft will stop sending data as soon as it touches down, meaning mission scientists won't know if it tumbles or bounces like Philae did after it lands. ESA has already released the final images that Rosetta collected on its way down to the comet's surface. \"It's really great,\" said Holger Sierks, the principal investigator for Rosetta's OSIRIS camera, as he presented some of the probe's final views. \"It'' exciting. It's working like a charm.\" Comet 67P is very porous with low gravity, so Rosetta's landing likely looked more like a slow-motion collision than a violent crash. The spacecraft executed its final maneuver around midnight local time yesterday and began a 14-hour, 12-mile drop to the comet's surface. ESA officials had calculated that its speed upon impact would be about walking pace, or 2 mph. The controlled impact was designed to give ESA scientists a closer look at surface features they had only spied from afar. \"We got pretty close to the comet recently with the orbits we were doing,\" Matt Taylor, Rosetta project scientist with ESA, told Space.com. \"We got within about 2 kilometers 1.2 miles from the surface. But this plummet into the surface gets us in below 2 kilometers. It gets us within the acceleration region, where the comet coma grows and starts being thrown off.\" The death dive was also an opportunity for Rosetta's suite of instruments to take measurements as it passes through the layer where the phase transition occurs between ice and gas. Rosetta's final resting place is a smooth patch in the so-called Ma'at region on the \"head\" of the rubber duck-shaped comet. This particular spot has a number of dust-spewing pits - some 330 feet across and 165 feet deep - that scientists wanted Rosetta's instruments to observe before the mission ended. The walls of these pits appear dotted with \"goosebumps\" that could be signatures of early comet building blocks known as cometesimals. The mission has already produced a number of surprising discoveries - that the Comet 67P has big grains of water ice on its surface, molecular oxygen in its coma, diverse landscapes and a fluffy core, just to name a few. But Rosetta scientists still have reams of data to pore over. So, even with today's finale, the work isn't over. \"We have 80,000 images to look at,\" Mohamed El-Maarry, a postdoctoral researcher with Rosetta's OSIRIS team, from the University of Bern in Switzerland, told reporters yesterday. \"It's going to keep us busy for years to come.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/34254-rosetta-crash-lands-on-comet-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "Astronomers predict possible birthplace of Rosetta-probed comet 67P", "date": "2016-10-18", "content": "When the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft successfully touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 30 September 2016, the news was shared globally via Twitter in dozens of languages. Citizens the world over were engaged by the astronomical achievement, and now ESA and NASA are eager to learn as much as possible about the critically important celestial body of ice. Using statistical analysis and scientific computing, astronomers at Western University have charted a path that most likely pinpoints the very origins of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is vital information in discovering what kind of material it is made from and just how long it has been present in our solar system. Mattia Galiazzo, a postdoctoral fellow in Western's Department of Physics & Astronomy, has just presented his findings at the joint 48th annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society and 11th annual European Planetary Science Congress in Pasadena, California. Galiazzo collaborated on the findings with solar system expert Paul Wiegert from Western's Centre for Planetary Science & Space Exploration. \"These results come from computations of the comet's orbit from the present to the past, which is computationally difficult due to the chaosity of the orbit caused by close encounters with Jupiter,\" says Galiazzo. \"Thus the details are obscure but we can establish a dynamical pathway from its current orbit back to the Kuiper belt.\" Galiazzo and Wiegert think that 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is relatively new to the inner parts of our solar system, having only arrived about 10,000 years ago. Prior to this time, the comet would have been inactive in frozen storage far from the Sun. Previous studies show that similar comets - known as Jupiter Family comets - historically stay in the inner parts of our solar system for 12,000 years, therefore recognising comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as a member of the Jupiter Family makes sense. The majority of the Jupiter Family comets are thought to come from the Kuiper belt - a ring-shaped accumulation of comets, asteroids and other space bodies in the solar system beyond the known planets - and Galiazzo and Wiegert believe, based on initial analysis of their investigation, that this is the case for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as well. Their analysis shows that, in transit, the comet likely spent millions of years in the scattering disc, a distant portion of the Kuiper belt, at about twice the distance of Neptune - our solar system's most distant known planet. This distant origin for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko implies it would be made from primordial material, meaning minerals that existed in their current form since before Earth was formed.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2016/10/18/astronomers-predict-possible-birthplace-of-rosetta-probed-comet-67p/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Rosetta's Missing Philae Probe Found in Dark Crack on Comet", "date": "2016-09-05", "content": "High-resolution cameras on the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft have found space probe Philae, which landed on a comet nearly two years ago only to lose power because its solar-driven batteries were in the shade. Images taken from Rosetta at a distance of 2.7 km showed Philae wedged into a dark crack on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the ESA said on Monday. Philae landed on the comet in November 2014 in what was considered a remarkable feat of precision space travel but the metre-sized, 100 kg probe bounced several times before getting stuck against a cliff wall. Scientists could tell its approximate whereabouts on the comet thanks to radio ranging data but not its precise location. This year they gave up hope of restoring contact with the probe. While Philae did not have as much time as was hoped for experiments, information it has collected is reshaping thinking about comets and the project has helped in designing future missions. \"This wonderful news means that we now have the missing 'ground-truth' information needed to put Philae's three days of science into proper context, now that we know where that ground actually is,\" ESA's Rosetta project scientist, Matt Taylor, said in a statement.

In images taken just three days ago by a camera on board the Rosetta space probe, the lander can be seen nestled in a dark crack on the comet's surface, with two of its three legs sticking out. \"For many people it is a huge emotional closure, but for the scientists it is incredibly important because it now tells us where the measurements were taken that we made with Philae back in 2014 - that context is everything,\" said Mark McCaughrean, senior scientific adviser at the European Space Agency. About the size of a washing machine and featuring a host of scientific instruments, ESA's lander was released from the Rosetta space probe on 12 November 2014, touching down on the rubber-duck shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a nail-biting, seven-hour descent. At the time the comet was 320m miles from Earth, and this was the first time a manmade object had landed on a comet. But there was a snag. Philae's two harpoons, which were supposed to anchor the lander, did not fire and Philae bounced across the surface of the comet. The lander finally came to rest near a cliff, but the shady location meant that, except for a brief interlude in mid-2015, its solar panels were unable to catch the sun's rays. Despite the bumpy ride, the lander was able to send back valuable data before its batteries ran out, offering insights into the comet's make-up and properties of its surface. While researchers were able to narrow down its location to a few tens of metres, its precise location remained a mystery, until now. Philae has been found - now every ounce of science can be wrung out of itRead more \"We had some images from further away that looked a bit like the lander, but we really needed this unambiguous image ,\" said Matt Taylor, the ESA's Rosetta project scientist. \"We needed that to say 'yes, it is definitely Philae.'\" News of the discovery, said Taylor, reached him late at night over the weekend. \"It is a typical thing with Rosetta, things seem to occur at the weekends and usually on Sunday.\" The discovery of the lander's location, he said, would help scientists to interpret information that it gathered before its batteries ran out. \"It allows us to go back to the data that Philae took to put it into context a little bit more,\" he said. Among such measurements, are data collected by the Consert instrument, which fired radio signals between the lander and the Rosetta orbiter to probe the internal make-up of the comet. \"Having the precise location of the lander allows you to refine those measurements and get much better resolution from those,\" said Taylor. \"It provides us with the ground truth.\" The news comes just weeks after communication with the lander was severed. In July scientists said farewell to Philae after deeming it to be in a state of \"eternal hibernation\".

Prior to this time, the comet would have been inactive in frozen storage far from the Sun. Previous studies show that similar comets - known as Jupiter Family comets - historically stay in the inner parts of our solar system for 12,000 years, therefore recognising comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as a member of the Jupiter Family makes sense. The majority of the Jupiter Family comets are thought to come from the Kuiper belt - a ring-shaped accumulation of comets, asteroids and other space bodies in the solar system beyond the known planets - and Galiazzo and Wiegert believe, based on initial analysis of their investigation, that this is the case for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as well. Their analysis shows that, in transit, the comet likely spent millions of years in the scattering disc, a distant portion of the Kuiper belt, at about twice the distance of Neptune - our solar system's most distant known planet.

It's grainy and a little out of focus, but this is the last image captured by Rosetta as it barreled toward the surface of Comet 67P last September. While the probe's OSIRIS camera was not designed to operate so close to the surface, engineers in Gottengen, Germany, were able to reconstruct a previously hidden image showing the unmistakable frozen, rocky surface right before impact. \"The last complete image transmitted from Rosetta was the final one that we saw arriving back on Earth in one piece moments before the touchdown at Sais ,\" said principal investigator Holger Sierks. Pioneering science: But to transmit images back to Earth, Rosetta has to compress them into data packets. The data for this unexpected picture was split into six packets, only three of which were fully transmitted. Only receiving half of the image data made it harder for systems back on Earth to ID what Rosetta was sending home. \"Later, we found a few telemetry packets on our server and thought, wow, that could be another image,\" Sierks added. With the European Space Agency taking lead, the Rosetta spacecraft was first launched back in 2004. It would spending a decade chasing the comet through the solar system before deploying its Philae lander to its surface in November 2014. Among the rich scientific data gathered by Rosetta's sister lander was the dramatic discovery of 16 \"carbon and nitrogen-rich\" organic compounds, supporting the theory that the building blocks of life could have been brought to Earth by comets. In September 2016, ESA controllers decided to end the mission when they determined the craft's solar panels were ineffective because Rosetta was so far away. Never designed to land on the comet, scientists opted to try a controlled descent and impact in the hopes of carrying out pioneering science right to the end. The aim: to find out more about lumpy structures - so-called \"goosebumps\" - which they believe may be the original pieces of material that bonded together forming the comet's body when the solar system was still in its infancy. Rosetta's legacy: After a 13-year odyssey in space, Rosetta had returned a treasure trove of groundbreaking data about the comet's surface and its chemical composition, securing its legacy as one of the most successful missions of all time. Astronomer Dan Brown, a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, spoke to CNN at the conclusion of the mission last year, describing it as an \"astonishing\" engineering feat. \"The Rosetta mission has helped us gain an insight into the activity of comets, how comets were created and to some extent if they could have been the source for water on our early Earth,\" he said last year. \"The presence of complex molecules, some of which previously unknown to exist on comets, still allows comets to be a possible source of introducing complex molecules and enable the formation of life on Earth.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/world/rosetta-probe-final-photo/index.html"}, {"title": "Surprise! Scientists Recover Rosetta Spacecraft's Last Photo of Comet 67P", "date": "2017-09-29", "content": "Nearly a year after the Rosetta spacecraft intentionally crashed into a comet, the mission's scientists have discovered a new surprise: the very last image Rosetta took before its cosmic demise. The European Space Agency launched Rosetta in 2004 on a mission to explore Comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko. It took 10 years for the spacecraft to chase down the comet, after which it spent two years orbiting the icy space rock. Rosetta's mission came to an end on Sept. 30, 2016, when it plopped down onto the surface of the comet it had studied for years. During its 14-hour descent, the spacecraft's imaging system, OSIRIS, took plenty of pictures of Comet 67P until the very last minute. Rosetta's final photo, however, didn't quite make it through to mission control back on Earth, as the transmission was interrupted halfway through, ESA officials said in a statement. With only half the data for the image, ESA's automatic processing software was unable to generate an image. But Rosetta scientists found a way to outsmart this software and reconstruct the image from that fragmented data. \"The last complete image transmitted from Rosetta was the final one that we saw arriving back on Earth in one piece moments before the touchdown,\" Holger Sierks, principal investigator for the OSIRIS camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, said in the statement. \"Later, we found a few telemetry packets on our server and thought, 'Wow, that could be another image,'\" Sierks added. ESA released the new image Thursday. The reconstructed photo was taken right before Rosetta collided with the comet, when it was about 65 feet above the surface, and the view spans about 3 feet. Though the image is a bit blurry, it offers a detailed look at the comet's rocky surface. Rosetta didn't take any photos of Comet 67P after it hit the comet. Even though it was falling at a speed of only about 2 mph, the controlled impact was rough enough to shut down the spacecraft. Even if Rosetta had survived the impact, it wouldn't have stayed alive much longer. ESA scientists chose to crash it into the comet, knowing that the solar-powered spacecraft would not have enough energy to survive the trek back out into the solar system, where Comet 67P is now heading.", "url": "https://www.space.com/38322-surprise-scientists-recover-rosetta-s-last-photo-of-comet-67p.html"}]}]
