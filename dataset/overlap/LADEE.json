Achieving this milestone means the LADEE observatory is one step closer to launching its 2013 mission to explore the lunar environment. The LADEE propulsion system, built by Space Systems/Loral, Palo Alto, Calif., features a commercially-proven technology. The propulsion system is a variant of the mission critical capabilities used for many years on geostationary satellites to provide television, radio, broadband internet, meteorology and other services. The LADEE team now has most of the flight hardware components available, and has entered the spacecraft's integration phase. During this phase, the LADEE team will attach hardware components to the various parts of the spacecraft structure, starting with the top radiator panel. This panel contains most of the spacecraft's active electronic systems, except the propulsion system. As each component is attached, it is tested to verify it was connected and works properly. So far, the team has attached a harness for the electrical wiring and a component to power up the spacecraft, and is preparing to attach the flight battery. Strength testing of the modular common bus sections - the main super-structure of the spacecraft - built by Vanguard Space Technologies, San Diego, Calif., is about to begin. The bus will be fitted with models of all of the components, so that it can be tested to ensure it is strong enough to handle the rigors of launch. When all of the components of the radiator panel have been integrated and tested, then the panel will be attached to the main structure, along with the integrated propulsion system to complete the spacecraft. While the spacecraft is being completed, the science teams will finish work on the LADEE instruments. After the team has a completed the spacecraft and instruments, they all will come together and form the LADEE observatory.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2012-04-ladee-closer-exploration-lunar-environment.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's LADEE Spacecraft Gets Final Science Instrument Installed", "date": "2012-10-25", "content": "Engineers at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., have installed the third and final science instrument that will fly onboard NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE).

LLCD will demonstrate laser communications from lunar orbit to Earth at six times the rate of the best modern-day advanced radio communication systems. \"The successful testing and integration of LLCD to LADEE is a major accomplishment,\" said Donald Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"It demonstrates that this new technology is robust and ready for space.

The successful completion of this phase of testing means NASA engineers are confident that LADEE will be able to operate in the harsh conditions of space. Previous mechanical tests - including acoustic, vibration and shock - confirmed the LADEE Observatory is able to withstand the loud, shaking launch conditions the spacecraft must endure to reach orbit. Now that the TVAC tests are complete, engineers will test LADEE's radio communication system to ensure it is compatible with NASA's Near-Earth and Deep Space Communication Networks. To perform these communications tests, equipment will be brought to NASA Ames and connected to the spacecraft to exercise the communications modes that will be used during the mission. It is important to test the LADEE communications system with both communication networks prior to launch, so that the Mission Operations Team at NASA Ames can prepare for the initial contact with the spacecraft. After LADEE separates from the upper stage of the Minotaur V launch vehicle, the spacecraft will power on. At that time, the Mission Operations Team at NASA Ames will use the Near-Earth Space network to make initial contact with LADEE. After initial contact, the team will establish positive control of the spacecraft so that they can maneuver LADEE into a phasing orbit that will take it to the moon. LADEE will loop around Earth to gradually raise its orbit and position so that it can fire its engines and enter lunar orbit. During the trajectory maneuvers on its way to the moon, LADEE will transmit to NASA's Deep Space Network ground stations located around the globe.

That mission will demonstrate the long-term viability of laser communication from a geostationary relay satellite to Earth. In a geostationary orbit the spacecraft orbits at the same speed as Earth, which allows it to maintain the same position in the sky. Engineers believe that future space missions will be able to use laser communication technology with its low mass and power requirements, to provide increased data quantity for real-time communication and 3-D high-definition video. For example, using S-band communications aboard the LADEE spacecraft would take 639 hours to download an average-length HD movie. Using LLCD technology that time would be reduced to less than eight minutes.

LADEE took a rather unusual approach in its transit of the Moon. Launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, the spacecraft made three increasingly-larger laps around Earthbefore getting close enough to enter into Lunar orbit. These three\"phasing orbits\" of Earth allowed the spacecraft to gain velocity for the trans-Lunar injection, which occurred at perigee of the third orbit,, at which point LADEE's engine fired to increase the altitude of its apogee to within the Moon's sphere of influence.\" After a long coast phase, Lunar orbit insertion (LOI) occurred using another three-minute engine burn. Two further burns are planned, tentatively on October 9 and October 12, to position LADEE into a circular obit around the moon's equator. There, it will begin its nominally 100-day mission to use instruments aboard the spacecraft to study the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity. LADEE, the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated and tested at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., was launched aboard a Minotaur V rocket. The Minotaur V, provided by the U.S. Air Force, was a repurposed three-stage Peacekeeper Missile to which Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va., added two additional stages and new avionics and guidance software. Aerojet Rocketdyne built the SR119 Peacekeeper second stage solid rocket motor that helped launch LADEE into an Earth-centric trajectory. Explained Warren Yasuhara, Aerojet Rocketdyne's Vice President of Space Systems, \"From the crewed Apollo vehicle to the orbiters of Lunar Prospector and LADEE, Aerojet Rocketdyne provides propulsion and power for lunar exploration. LADEE is designed to characterize the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment-an important study in preparation for returning astronauts to the Moon.\" The roughly $280 LADEE mission, initially announced as part of NASA's FY2009 budget, has three major science goals: Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the tenuous lunar exosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at tens of kilometers above the surface were sodium glow or dust. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. The science payload consists of: Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), that will perform in situ measurements of exospheric species. The instrument has heritage from the SAM instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. UV-Vis Spectrometer (UVS), that will measure both the dust and exosphere. The instrument has heritage from the UV-Vis spectrometer on the LCROSS mission. Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), that will directly measure dust. The instrument has heritage from instruments on Galileo, Ulysses and Cassini. LADEE also carries a technology demonstration payload for testing an optical communication system. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) will use a laser to transmit and receive data as pulses of light, much the same as data is transferred in a fiber optic cable, to three ground stations. This method of communication has the potential to provide five times the current data return, as compared to radio frequency communication, from both LADEE and future missions.

After a month-long journey, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft - designed to probe the moon's thin atmosphere and lunar dust - performed an engine burn on Sunday (Oct. 6) that took it into orbit around the moon. While the current U.S. government shutdown has all but halted work at NASA, operations for the $280 million mission are not affected because LADEE is in a critical phase, Rachel Hoover, a spokesperson at NASA's Ames Research Center in California told Spaceflight Now before the shutdown. NASA's federal shutdown plan has furloughed most of the agency's 18,000 employees, but does allow the agency to watch over spacecraft in flight like LADEE and the International Space Station. Before arriving in lunar orbit, the LADEE spacecraft (the name is pronounced \"laddie\") made three elliptical orbits around the Earth, moving into a higher orbit on each pass around the planet. Once its orbit was high enough, the moon's gravity took over and LADEE performed its big burn to transfer to lunar orbit, mission managers have said. LADEE now needs to perform two more lunar orbit insertion maneuvers before the probe's approximately month-long checkout phase can begin. The probe's next burn is scheduled for Oct. 9 and the third is scheduled for Oct. 12, which will lower it to an altitude of 155 miles (250 kilometers). During the checkout period, scientists will test out LADEE's laser-communications demonstration. The experiment used laser technology to send large amounts of data back to Earth. The laser communication model could allow spacecraft to send 3D information, high-definition video and other data back to ground controllers, scientists have said. Once LADEE's commissioning phase is finished, the probe will begin 100 days of science designed to probe the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere and a moon dust mystery dating back to the Apollo program. Apollo astronauts saw streamers of light on the horizon before sunrise on the moon. LADEE's instrumentation will help scientists understand what could have caused the glow. NASA officials wrote in a facts sheet: \"Was lunar dust, electrically charged by solar ultraviolet light, responsible for the pre-sunrise horizon glow that the Apollo astronauts saw?\" LADEE will also investigate the moon's extremely thin atmosphere. Called a surface boundary exosphere, the lunar atmosphere represents the most common kind of atmosphere in the solar system. Some planets (like Mercury), moons and even certain large asteroids play host to these kinds of atmospheres, making LADEE's research wide reaching. \"It's a class of atmosphere we actually don't know that much about, so it turns out that the moon actually is a really convenient place to go and learn about this very common type of atmosphere,\" Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist, said before the probe's Sept. 6 launch.

We originally captured with a periselene altitude near 560 km but our periselene has now been lowered to an altitude of ~235 km by Earth perturbations in the Post-LOI-1 24 hr orbit. The planned periselene of the commissioning orbit was 250 km, however the small (<1%) underperformance of LOI-1 caused aposelene to be slightly higher, and thus we got slightly more Earth perturbations than we nominally planned for. The result of this is that we got a bit of free lowering from the Earth, which we'll take! (Since we plan to go lower than 250 km anyway). So the current plan is to drop the aposelene to 250 and perform commissioning there in the 235 x 250 km orbit.

It also has demonstrated an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the spacecraft currently orbiting the moon. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for space communications and navigation (SCaN) in Washington. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Since NASA first ventured into space, it has relied on radio frequency (RF) communication. However, RF is reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity continues to increase. The development and deployment of laser communications will enable NASA to extend communication capabilities such as increased image resolution and 3-D video transmission from deep space. \"The goal of LLCD is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"This unique ability developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory has incredible application possibilities.\" LLCD is a short-duration experiment and the precursor to NASA's long-duration demonstration, the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD).

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "LADEE Ready for Launch", "date": "2013-08-31", "content": "Engineers from NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have successfully completed launch preparation activities for NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) observatory, which has been encapsulated into the nose-cone of the Minotaur V rocket at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. LADEE now is ready to launch when the window opens on Sept. 6, 2013. After safely arriving at NASA Wallops in June, the LADEE observatory went through final preparations and close-outs, which included checking the spacecraft's alignment after its cross-country shipment, checking the propulsion system for leaks, inspecting and repairing solar panels, and final electrical tests. After all of the activities were completed, it was time to start some of the scarier more challenging portions of the launch preparations: spin testing and fueling. To make sure that the spacecraft is perfectly balanced for flight, engineers mount it onto a spin table and rotate it at high speeds, approximately one revolution per second. The team measures any offsets during the spinning, and then adds small weights to the spacecraft to balance it. Once the spacecraft was balanced dry, we then loaded the propulsion tanks with fuel, oxidizer, and pressurant. The spin testing was performed again \"wet,\" or with fuel, in order to see if the balance changed with the full fuel tanks. The final wet spin balance went very well. The next step was to lift the LADEE spacecraft onto the fifth stage - or the top - of the rocket, and then spin that whole stack in order to balance it for when the fifth stage burns during the ascent. Before and after this spin balancing, various explosive charges were installed onto the spacecraft and fifth stage, which will be used during flight to enable the propulsion system and remove the cover of one of the science instruments. The combination of propellents, explosives, and spinning made all of this activity pretty challenging. After all of that was accomplished, engineers mounted the LADEE observatory onto the fifth stage rocket motor and encapsulated it in the nose-cone - or fairing - of the United States Air Force's Minotaur V launch vehicle, operated by Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va. It was then hooked up to an environmental control system that will keep clean, dry, cool gas flowing into the fairing. After everything was ready, the combined LADEE and fifth stage motor in the fairing was moved from the clean room it had lived in all summer, out to the launch pad, and lifted on top of the rocket stack, with the first through fourth stages already in place.

S. Peter Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Center in California, which developed the spacecraft, told reporters he's confident everything will be working properly in the next few days. LADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said. But the computer automatically shut the wheels down, apparently because of excess current. He speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast. Worden stressed there is no rush to \"get these bugs ironed out.\" The LADEE spacecraft, which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust, soared aboard an unmanned Minotaur rocket a little before midnight from Virginia's Eastern Shore. \"Godspeed on your journey to the moon, LADEE,\" Launch Control said.

An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., provided the ride from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. LADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on Oct. 6. Scientists want to learn the composition of the moon's ever-so-delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time. Another puzzle, dating back decades, is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface. The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE. The 844-pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices. \"There's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars,\" that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Apollo astronauts saw streamers of light on the horizon before sunrise on the moon. LADEE's instrumentation will help scientists understand what could have caused the glow. NASA officials wrote in a facts sheet: \"Was lunar dust, electrically charged by solar ultraviolet light, responsible for the pre-sunrise horizon glow that the Apollo astronauts saw?\" LADEE will also investigate the moon's extremely thin atmosphere. Called a surface boundary exosphere, the lunar atmosphere represents the most common kind of atmosphere in the solar system. Some planets (like Mercury), moons and even certain large asteroids play host to these kinds of atmospheres, making LADEE's research wide reaching. \"It's a class of atmosphere we actually don't know that much about, so it turns out that the moon actually is a really convenient place to go and learn about this very common type of atmosphere,\" Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist, said before the probe's Sept. 6 launch.

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude. LADEE was launched September 6 on a U.S. Air Force Minotaur V, an excess ballistic missile converted into a space launch vehicle.

LADEE now is ready to launch when the window opens on Sept. 6, 2013. After safely arriving at NASA Wallops in June, the LADEE observatory went through final preparations and close-outs, which included checking the spacecraft's alignment after its cross-country shipment, checking the propulsion system for leaks, inspecting and repairing solar panels, and final electrical tests. After all of the activities were completed, it was time to start some of the scarier more challenging portions of the launch preparations: spin testing and fueling. To make sure that the spacecraft is perfectly balanced for flight, engineers mount it onto a spin table and rotate it at high speeds, approximately one revolution per second. The team measures any offsets during the spinning, and then adds small weights to the spacecraft to balance it. Once the spacecraft was balanced dry, we then loaded the propulsion tanks with fuel, oxidizer, and pressurant. The spin testing was performed again \"wet,\" or with fuel, in order to see if the balance changed with the full fuel tanks. The final wet spin balance went very well. The next step was to lift the LADEE spacecraft onto the fifth stage - or the top - of the rocket, and then spin that whole stack in order to balance it for when the fifth stage burns during the ascent. Before and after this spin balancing, various explosive charges were installed onto the spacecraft and fifth stage, which will be used during flight to enable the propulsion system and remove the cover of one of the science instruments. The combination of propellents, explosives, and spinning made all of this activity pretty challenging. After all of that was accomplished, engineers mounted the LADEE observatory onto the fifth stage rocket motor and encapsulated it in the nose-cone - or fairing - of the United States Air Force's Minotaur V launch vehicle, operated by Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va. It was then hooked up to an environmental control system that will keep clean, dry, cool gas flowing into the fairing. After everything was ready, the combined LADEE and fifth stage motor in the fairing was moved from the clean room it had lived in all summer, out to the launch pad, and lifted on top of the rocket stack, with the first through fourth stages already in place.

LADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said. But the computer automatically shut the wheels down, apparently because of excess current. He speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast. Worden stressed there is no rush to \"get these bugs ironed out.\" The LADEE spacecraft, which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust, soared aboard an unmanned Minotaur rocket a little before midnight from Virginia's Eastern Shore. \"Godspeed on your journey to the moon, LADEE,\" Launch Control said.

An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., provided the ride from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. LADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on Oct. 6. Scientists want to learn the composition of the moon's ever-so-delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time. Another puzzle, dating back decades, is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface. The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE. The 844-pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices. \"There's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars,\" that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.

LADEE took a rather unusual approach in its transit of the Moon. Launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, the spacecraft made three increasingly-larger laps around Earthbefore getting close enough to enter into Lunar orbit. These three\"phasing orbits\" of Earth allowed the spacecraft to gain velocity for the trans-Lunar injection, which occurred at perigee of the third orbit,, at which point LADEE's engine fired to increase the altitude of its apogee to within the Moon's sphere of influence.\" After a long coast phase, Lunar orbit insertion (LOI) occurred using another three-minute engine burn.

Explained Warren Yasuhara, Aerojet Rocketdyne's Vice President of Space Systems, \"From the crewed Apollo vehicle to the orbiters of Lunar Prospector and LADEE, Aerojet Rocketdyne provides propulsion and power for lunar exploration. LADEE is designed to characterize the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment-an important study in preparation for returning astronauts to the Moon.\" The roughly $280 LADEE mission, initially announced as part of NASA's FY2009 budget, has three major science goals: Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the tenuous lunar exosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at tens of kilometers above the surface were sodium glow or dust. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. The science payload consists of: Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), that will perform in situ measurements of exospheric species. The instrument has heritage from the SAM instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. UV-Vis Spectrometer (UVS), that will measure both the dust and exosphere. The instrument has heritage from the UV-Vis spectrometer on the LCROSS mission. Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), that will directly measure dust. The instrument has heritage from instruments on Galileo, Ulysses and Cassini. LADEE also carries a technology demonstration payload for testing an optical communication system. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) will use a laser to transmit and receive data as pulses of light, much the same as data is transferred in a fiber optic cable, to three ground stations.

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude. LADEE was launched September 6 on a U.S. Air Force Minotaur V, an excess ballistic missile converted into a space launch vehicle. LADEE is the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested at Ames.

Hosted aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer known as LADEE, for its ride to lunar orbit, the LLCD was designed to confirm laser communication capabilities from a distance of almost a quarter-of-a-million miles. In addition to demonstrating record-breaking data download and upload speeds to the moon at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps, respectively, LLCD also showed that it could operate as well as any NASA radio system. \"Throughout our testing we did not see anything that would prevent the operational use of this technology in the immediate future,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus. Operationally, LLCD demonstrated the ability to download data from the LADEE spacecraft itself. \"We were able to download LADEE's entire stored science and spacecraft data [1 gigabyte] in less than five minutes, which was only limited to our 40 Mbps connection to that data within LADEE\" said Cornwell. Using LADEE's onboard radio system would take several days to complete a download of the same stored data. Additionally, LLCD was to prove the integrity of laser technology to send not only error-free data but also uncorrupted commands and telemetry or monitoring messages to and from the spacecraft over the laser link. LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future.

According to the space agency, the LLCD mission proved that laser communications are practical at a distance of a quarter of a million miles and that such a system could perform as well, if not better, than any NASA radio system. The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect.

LADEE now is ready to launch when the window opens on Sept. 6, 2013. After safely arriving at NASA Wallops in June, the LADEE observatory went through final preparations and close-outs, which included checking the spacecraft's alignment after its cross-country shipment, checking the propulsion system for leaks, inspecting and repairing solar panels, and final electrical tests. After all of the activities were completed, it was time to start some of the scarier more challenging portions of the launch preparations: spin testing and fueling. To make sure that the spacecraft is perfectly balanced for flight, engineers mount it onto a spin table and rotate it at high speeds, approximately one revolution per second. The team measures any offsets during the spinning, and then adds small weights to the spacecraft to balance it. Once the spacecraft was balanced dry, we then loaded the propulsion tanks with fuel, oxidizer, and pressurant. The spin testing was performed again \"wet,\" or with fuel, in order to see if the balance changed with the full fuel tanks. The final wet spin balance went very well. The next step was to lift the LADEE spacecraft onto the fifth stage - or the top - of the rocket, and then spin that whole stack in order to balance it for when the fifth stage burns during the ascent. Before and after this spin balancing, various explosive charges were installed onto the spacecraft and fifth stage, which will be used during flight to enable the propulsion system and remove the cover of one of the science instruments. The combination of propellents, explosives, and spinning made all of this activity pretty challenging. After all of that was accomplished, engineers mounted the LADEE observatory onto the fifth stage rocket motor and encapsulated it in the nose-cone - or fairing - of the United States Air Force's Minotaur V launch vehicle, operated by Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va. It was then hooked up to an environmental control system that will keep clean, dry, cool gas flowing into the fairing. After everything was ready, the combined LADEE and fifth stage motor in the fairing was moved from the clean room it had lived in all summer, out to the launch pad, and lifted on top of the rocket stack, with the first through fourth stages already in place.

LADEE took a rather unusual approach in its transit of the Moon. Launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, the spacecraft made three increasingly-larger laps around Earthbefore getting close enough to enter into Lunar orbit. These three\"phasing orbits\" of Earth allowed the spacecraft to gain velocity for the trans-Lunar injection, which occurred at perigee of the third orbit,, at which point LADEE's engine fired to increase the altitude of its apogee to within the Moon's sphere of influence.\" After a long coast phase, Lunar orbit insertion (LOI) occurred using another three-minute engine burn.

LADEE is designed to characterize the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment-an important study in preparation for returning astronauts to the Moon.\" The roughly $280 LADEE mission, initially announced as part of NASA's FY2009 budget, has three major science goals: Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the tenuous lunar exosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at tens of kilometers above the surface were sodium glow or dust. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. The science payload consists of: Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), that will perform in situ measurements of exospheric species. The instrument has heritage from the SAM instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. UV-Vis Spectrometer (UVS), that will measure both the dust and exosphere. The instrument has heritage from the UV-Vis spectrometer on the LCROSS mission. Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), that will directly measure dust.

During the checkout period, scientists will test out LADEE's laser-communications demonstration. The experiment used laser technology to send large amounts of data back to Earth. The laser communication model could allow spacecraft to send 3D information, high-definition video and other data back to ground controllers, scientists have said. Once LADEE's commissioning phase is finished, the probe will begin 100 days of science designed to probe the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere and a moon dust mystery dating back to the Apollo program. Apollo astronauts saw streamers of light on the horizon before sunrise on the moon. LADEE's instrumentation will help scientists understand what could have caused the glow. NASA officials wrote in a facts sheet: \"Was lunar dust, electrically charged by solar ultraviolet light, responsible for the pre-sunrise horizon glow that the Apollo astronauts saw?\" LADEE will also investigate the moon's extremely thin atmosphere. Called a surface boundary exosphere, the lunar atmosphere represents the most common kind of atmosphere in the solar system. Some planets (like Mercury), moons and even certain large asteroids play host to these kinds of atmospheres, making LADEE's research wide reaching. \"It's a class of atmosphere we actually don't know that much about, so it turns out that the moon actually is a really convenient place to go and learn about this very common type of atmosphere,\" Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist, said before the probe's Sept. 6 launch.

The planned periselene of the commissioning orbit was 250 km, however the small (<1%) underperformance of LOI-1 caused aposelene to be slightly higher, and thus we got slightly more Earth perturbations than we nominally planned for. The result of this is that we got a bit of free lowering from the Earth, which we'll take! (Since we plan to go lower than 250 km anyway). So the current plan is to drop the aposelene to 250 and perform commissioning there in the 235 x 250 km orbit.

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude. LADEE was launched September 6 on a U.S. Air Force Minotaur V, an excess ballistic missile converted into a space launch vehicle.

In addition to demonstrating record-breaking data download and upload speeds to the moon at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps, respectively, LLCD also showed that it could operate as well as any NASA radio system. \"Throughout our testing we did not see anything that would prevent the operational use of this technology in the immediate future,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus. Operationally, LLCD demonstrated the ability to download data from the LADEE spacecraft itself. \"We were able to download LADEE's entire stored science and spacecraft data [1 gigabyte] in less than five minutes, which was only limited to our 40 Mbps connection to that data within LADEE\" said Cornwell. Using LADEE's onboard radio system would take several days to complete a download of the same stored data. Additionally, LLCD was to prove the integrity of laser technology to send not only error-free data but also uncorrupted commands and telemetry or monitoring messages to and from the spacecraft over the laser link. LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future.

According to the space agency, the LLCD mission proved that laser communications are practical at a distance of a quarter of a million miles and that such a system could perform as well, if not better, than any NASA radio system. The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect.

The extension provides an opportunity for the satellite to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of very low-altitude data to help scientists unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., where the mission was designed, built, tested and its day-to-day operations are managed. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" The small, car-sized robotic probe launched Sept. 6, 2013, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Va., and has been orbiting the moon since Oct. 6. On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

LADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said.

The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE. The 844-pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices. \"There's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars,\" that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Despite the partial federal government shutdown that idled an estimated 97 percent of the NASA workforce, sufficient \"excepted\" engineers and technicians at the NASA Ames Research Center and the Goddard Space Flight Center were permitted to continue guiding LADEE as planned. LADEE took a rather unusual approach in its transit of the Moon. Launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, the spacecraft made three increasingly-larger laps around Earthbefore getting close enough to enter into Lunar orbit. These three\"phasing orbits\" of Earth allowed the spacecraft to gain velocity for the trans-Lunar injection, which occurred at perigee of the third orbit,, at which point LADEE's engine fired to increase the altitude of its apogee to within the Moon's sphere of influence.\" After a long coast phase, Lunar orbit insertion (LOI) occurred using another three-minute engine burn. Two further burns are planned, tentatively on October 9 and October 12, to position LADEE into a circular obit around the moon's equator. There, it will begin its nominally 100-day mission to use instruments aboard the spacecraft to study the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity. LADEE, the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated and tested at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., was launched aboard a Minotaur V rocket. The Minotaur V, provided by the U.S. Air Force, was a repurposed three-stage Peacekeeper Missile to which Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va., added two additional stages and new avionics and guidance software. Aerojet Rocketdyne built the SR119 Peacekeeper second stage solid rocket motor that helped launch LADEE into an Earth-centric trajectory. Explained Warren Yasuhara, Aerojet Rocketdyne's Vice President of Space Systems, \"From the crewed Apollo vehicle to the orbiters of Lunar Prospector and LADEE, Aerojet Rocketdyne provides propulsion and power for lunar exploration. LADEE is designed to characterize the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment-an important study in preparation for returning astronauts to the Moon.\" The roughly $280 LADEE mission, initially announced as part of NASA's FY2009 budget, has three major science goals: Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the tenuous lunar exosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at tens of kilometers above the surface were sodium glow or dust. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. The science payload consists of: Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), that will perform in situ measurements of exospheric species. The instrument has heritage from the SAM instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. UV-Vis Spectrometer (UVS), that will measure both the dust and exosphere. The instrument has heritage from the UV-Vis spectrometer on the LCROSS mission. Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), that will directly measure dust. The instrument has heritage from instruments on Galileo, Ulysses and Cassini. LADEE also carries a technology demonstration payload for testing an optical communication system. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) will use a laser to transmit and receive data as pulses of light, much the same as data is transferred in a fiber optic cable, to three ground stations. This method of communication has the potential to provide five times the current data return, as compared to radio frequency communication, from both LADEE and future missions. The technology is a direct predecessor to NASA's Laser Communication Data Relay (LCDR) satellite due to launch in 2017.

While the current U.S. government shutdown has all but halted work at NASA, operations for the $280 million mission are not affected because LADEE is in a critical phase, Rachel Hoover, a spokesperson at NASA's Ames Research Center in California told Spaceflight Now before the shutdown. NASA's federal shutdown plan has furloughed most of the agency's 18,000 employees, but does allow the agency to watch over spacecraft in flight like LADEE and the International Space Station. Before arriving in lunar orbit, the LADEE spacecraft (the name is pronounced \"laddie\") made three elliptical orbits around the Earth, moving into a higher orbit on each pass around the planet. Once its orbit was high enough, the moon's gravity took over and LADEE performed its big burn to transfer to lunar orbit, mission managers have said. LADEE now needs to perform two more lunar orbit insertion maneuvers before the probe's approximately month-long checkout phase can begin. The probe's next burn is scheduled for Oct. 9 and the third is scheduled for Oct. 12, which will lower it to an altitude of 155 miles (250 kilometers). During the checkout period, scientists will test out LADEE's laser-communications demonstration. The experiment used laser technology to send large amounts of data back to Earth. The laser communication model could allow spacecraft to send 3D information, high-definition video and other data back to ground controllers, scientists have said. Once LADEE's commissioning phase is finished, the probe will begin 100 days of science designed to probe the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere and a moon dust mystery dating back to the Apollo program. Apollo astronauts saw streamers of light on the horizon before sunrise on the moon. LADEE's instrumentation will help scientists understand what could have caused the glow. NASA officials wrote in a facts sheet: \"Was lunar dust, electrically charged by solar ultraviolet light, responsible for the pre-sunrise horizon glow that the Apollo astronauts saw?\" LADEE will also investigate the moon's extremely thin atmosphere. Called a surface boundary exosphere, the lunar atmosphere represents the most common kind of atmosphere in the solar system. Some planets (like Mercury), moons and even certain large asteroids play host to these kinds of atmospheres, making LADEE's research wide reaching. \"It's a class of atmosphere we actually don't know that much about, so it turns out that the moon actually is a really convenient place to go and learn about this very common type of atmosphere,\" Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist, said before the probe's Sept. 6 launch.

The planned periselene of the commissioning orbit was 250 km, however the small (<1%) underperformance of LOI-1 caused aposelene to be slightly higher, and thus we got slightly more Earth perturbations than we nominally planned for. The result of this is that we got a bit of free lowering from the Earth, which we'll take! (Since we plan to go lower than 250 km anyway). So the current plan is to drop the aposelene to 250 and perform commissioning there in the 235 x 250 km orbit.

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude.

Hosted aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer known as LADEE, for its ride to lunar orbit, the LLCD was designed to confirm laser communication capabilities from a distance of almost a quarter-of-a-million miles. In addition to demonstrating record-breaking data download and upload speeds to the moon at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps, respectively, LLCD also showed that it could operate as well as any NASA radio system. \"Throughout our testing we did not see anything that would prevent the operational use of this technology in the immediate future,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus. Operationally, LLCD demonstrated the ability to download data from the LADEE spacecraft itself. \"We were able to download LADEE's entire stored science and spacecraft data [1 gigabyte] in less than five minutes, which was only limited to our 40 Mbps connection to that data within LADEE\" said Cornwell. Using LADEE's onboard radio system would take several days to complete a download of the same stored data. Additionally, LLCD was to prove the integrity of laser technology to send not only error-free data but also uncorrupted commands and telemetry or monitoring messages to and from the spacecraft over the laser link. LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future.

The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect.

The extension provides an opportunity for the satellite to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of very low-altitude data to help scientists unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., where the mission was designed, built, tested and its day-to-day operations are managed. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" The small, car-sized robotic probe launched Sept. 6, 2013, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Va., and has been orbiting the moon since Oct. 6. On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

This follows a first-ever high-bandwidth laser communication which took place from the Moon to the Earth. It also included continued atmospheric analyses, and a tricky snapshot by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), another spacecraft working to further the scientific understanding of our nearest celestial neighbor. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center, in a statement released by NASA. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" This extension translates into the eventual end of the spacecraft's mission to be pushed back to around April 21, allowing for more time for the satellite to study the Moon's atmosphere. LADEE arrived at the Moon on Oct. 6, 2013, one month after being launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Sept. 6, 2013. When LADEE's mission comes to an end, it will purposely fall to the Moon's surface. Along the way it will continue to collect data from dust samples and send the information back to Earth, and its impact will hopefully be observed by LRO thanks to a recent encounter helping to increase these odds.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013.

LADEE took a rather unusual approach in its transit of the Moon. Launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, the spacecraft made three increasingly-larger laps around Earthbefore getting close enough to enter into Lunar orbit. These three\"phasing orbits\" of Earth allowed the spacecraft to gain velocity for the trans-Lunar injection, which occurred at perigee of the third orbit,, at which point LADEE's engine fired to increase the altitude of its apogee to within the Moon's sphere of influence.\" After a long coast phase, Lunar orbit insertion (LOI) occurred using another three-minute engine burn. Two further burns are planned, tentatively on October 9 and October 12, to position LADEE into a circular obit around the moon's equator. There, it will begin its nominally 100-day mission to use instruments aboard the spacecraft to study the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity. LADEE, the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated and tested at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., was launched aboard a Minotaur V rocket. The Minotaur V, provided by the U.S. Air Force, was a repurposed three-stage Peacekeeper Missile to which Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Va., added two additional stages and new avionics and guidance software. Aerojet Rocketdyne built the SR119 Peacekeeper second stage solid rocket motor that helped launch LADEE into an Earth-centric trajectory. Explained Warren Yasuhara, Aerojet Rocketdyne's Vice President of Space Systems, \"From the crewed Apollo vehicle to the orbiters of Lunar Prospector and LADEE, Aerojet Rocketdyne provides propulsion and power for lunar exploration. LADEE is designed to characterize the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment-an important study in preparation for returning astronauts to the Moon.\" The roughly $280 LADEE mission, initially announced as part of NASA's FY2009 budget, has three major science goals: Determine the global density, composition, and time variability of the tenuous lunar exosphere before it is perturbed by further human activity. Determine if the Apollo astronaut sightings of diffuse emission at tens of kilometers above the surface were sodium glow or dust. Document the dust impactor environment (size-frequency) to help guide design engineering for the outpost and also future robotic missions. The science payload consists of: Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), that will perform in situ measurements of exospheric species. The instrument has heritage from the SAM instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory. UV-Vis Spectrometer (UVS), that will measure both the dust and exosphere. The instrument has heritage from the UV-Vis spectrometer on the LCROSS mission. Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), that will directly measure dust. The instrument has heritage from instruments on Galileo, Ulysses and Cassini. LADEE also carries a technology demonstration payload for testing an optical communication system. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) will use a laser to transmit and receive data as pulses of light, much the same as data is transferred in a fiber optic cable, to three ground stations. This method of communication has the potential to provide five times the current data return, as compared to radio frequency communication, from both LADEE and future missions.

NASA's federal shutdown plan has furloughed most of the agency's 18,000 employees, but does allow the agency to watch over spacecraft in flight like LADEE and the International Space Station. Before arriving in lunar orbit, the LADEE spacecraft (the name is pronounced \"laddie\") made three elliptical orbits around the Earth, moving into a higher orbit on each pass around the planet. Once its orbit was high enough, the moon's gravity took over and LADEE performed its big burn to transfer to lunar orbit, mission managers have said. LADEE now needs to perform two more lunar orbit insertion maneuvers before the probe's approximately month-long checkout phase can begin. The probe's next burn is scheduled for Oct. 9 and the third is scheduled for Oct. 12, which will lower it to an altitude of 155 miles (250 kilometers). During the checkout period, scientists will test out LADEE's laser-communications demonstration. The experiment used laser technology to send large amounts of data back to Earth. The laser communication model could allow spacecraft to send 3D information, high-definition video and other data back to ground controllers, scientists have said. Once LADEE's commissioning phase is finished, the probe will begin 100 days of science designed to probe the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere and a moon dust mystery dating back to the Apollo program. Apollo astronauts saw streamers of light on the horizon before sunrise on the moon. LADEE's instrumentation will help scientists understand what could have caused the glow. NASA officials wrote in a facts sheet: \"Was lunar dust, electrically charged by solar ultraviolet light, responsible for the pre-sunrise horizon glow that the Apollo astronauts saw?\" LADEE will also investigate the moon's extremely thin atmosphere. Called a surface boundary exosphere, the lunar atmosphere represents the most common kind of atmosphere in the solar system. Some planets (like Mercury), moons and even certain large asteroids play host to these kinds of atmospheres, making LADEE's research wide reaching. \"It's a class of atmosphere we actually don't know that much about, so it turns out that the moon actually is a really convenient place to go and learn about this very common type of atmosphere,\" Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist, said before the probe's Sept. 6 launch.

With the spacecraft safely settled into its observation orbit, the mission science team is busy testing and calibrating its instruments. This U.S. mission was designed to characterize the lunar \"atmosphere\" - the extremely tenuous zone of gases that vary in time in the space above the Moon. Technically called an exosphere, this region contains extremely low concentrations of a variety of elements and compounds, of varied origins and a largely unknown life cycle. LADEE is designed to monitor and characterize these species, with the goal of identifying the process and sources of the gases and how they vary with time. Initially a precursor to human lunar return, LADEE was selected for development early in 2008, as we wanted to understand the lunar exosphere before the lunar environment was contaminated by humans. The LADEE spacecraft is designed to observe the Moon in its natural, pristine state. However, the very act of going to the Moon inadvertently (though briefly) modifies the lunar atmosphere. When a spacecraft arrives at the Moon, it uses its on-board rocket engines to brake into lunar orbit or to descend to the surface. These rockets spew large quantities of exhaust gas into space and as the vehicles get captured into the Moon's gravity field, so too does this exhaust product. From estimates drawn on the Apollo landings, the rocket exhaust expended from each Lunar Module temporarily doubled the total mass of the natural lunar atmosphere. This artificial addition of gases eventually dissipates, driven off by solar interactions and other complex effects. In time, the Moon resumes its normal state of near-vacuum. The creation of a temporary artificial atmosphere created by rocket effluent and its subsequent dissipation is imperfectly understood, except to the extent that we know that it happens. The one-month \"commissioning phase\" that the LADEE mission is currently experiencing was largely designed to ensure that the exhaust from the orbital braking burn of the spacecraft (and subsequent low-rate out-gassing from the spacecraft) is largely complete. We want to measure the Moon's environment, not the products of the craft that brought us there. But the U.S. will not be the only one conducting a mission at the Moon for the next few months. The long-planned Chinese robotic mission Chang'E 3 is scheduled for launch to the Moon in early December. Their lander mission will place a fairly large (1200 kg) spacecraft on Sinus Iridum in the northwestern quadrant of the near side, deliver a small roving vehicle and examine and measure the properties of the lunar surface over the course of several months. But before it begins its surface mission, the Chang'E 3 spacecraft will burn roughly 2600 kg of rocket fuel in the vicinity of the Moon's exosphere. I have not seen any documentation on the fuel this spacecraft will use, but it is highly likely that it will be the chemicals unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; H2NN(CH3)2) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). These propellants are widely used in spacecraft because they are liquid at room temperature and can be easily stored in tanks for long periods of time (a requirement for long-duration spaceflight to destinations beyond low Earth orbit). When UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide are burned in a rocket engine, they produce a variety of exhaust gases; the dominant combustion products are water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a few trace species, including hydrogen (H2) and hydroxyl (OH). Expelled by a rocket nozzle, these gases rapidly expand in all directions in the vacuum of space. Because most of the burn occurs after the spacecraft has been \"captured\" by the gravity of the Moon, this rocket exhaust is also captured by the Moon. Thus, exhaust from an orbital or a landing vehicle becomes (temporarily) part of the lunar atmosphere. If you're thinking that this \"rude\" addition of alien gases will mess up the very delicate phenomena that LADEE was designed to map and measure, you're correct - it does. You might even expect the scientists of the LADEE team would be very upset at this disruption of their carefully planned measurement strategy. But you would be wrong. This problem is actually an opportunity. The coincidence of Chang'E 3 arriving at the Moon after LADEE has begun observations has developed into a serendipitous occurrence for lunar science. Because we don't understand very well how exospheric gases are added to and removed from the Moon, what has landed in our laps is an unplanned (but controlled) experiment. A known quantity of gases - of known composition - will be added to the lunar atmosphere at a precisely known time, in a precisely known place. One could have not designed a better experiment to measure how this addition of material is distributed, how its distribution evolves over time, and how these expelled gases dissipate into cislunar space. Even better, LADEE will have almost a full month to monitor and characterize the lunar atmosphere before Chang'E arrives, thus allowing us to first observe the \"natural\" Moon and then the \"contaminated\" Moon and how the lunar atmosphere recovers from its defilement. None of this was prearranged - the Chinese schedule their missions on the basis of their own time-table and programmatic needs (just as NASA's lunar goals have changed over the last 5 years). But because of a fortuitous alignment of schedules, we have a unique opportunity to observe in real time how the Moon works. Hopefully, the Chinese will provide us with detailed mass numbers of their spacecraft and exactly what variety of fuel it carries, but even if they don't, physics dictates a certain mass and volume of the exhaust gas and its composition will be measured by LADEE (allowing us to know the type of fuel used). China's December lander mission to the Moon will provide our U.S. mission with a welcome bit of \"traffic exhaust,\" giving scientists the opportunity to learn more from LADEE than we'd originally envisioned.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131205051522/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/10/unplanned-but-controlled-experiments-the-role-of-serendipity/"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude. LADEE was launched September 6 on a U.S. Air Force Minotaur V, an excess ballistic missile converted into a space launch vehicle. LADEE is the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested at Ames. It also was the first probe launched beyond Earth orbit from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on the Virginia coast.", "url": "https://www.lpi.usra.edu/features/ladee/112713/"}, {"title": "Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration Reveals Bright Future For Space Communication", "date": "2013-12-24", "content": "The completion of the 30-day Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration or LLCD mission has revealed that the possibility of expanding broadband capabilities in space using laser communications is as bright as expected. Hosted aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer known as LADEE, for its ride to lunar orbit, the LLCD was designed to confirm laser communication capabilities from a distance of almost a quarter-of-a-million miles. In addition to demonstrating record-breaking data download and upload speeds to the moon at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps, respectively, LLCD also showed that it could operate as well as any NASA radio system. \"Throughout our testing we did not see anything that would prevent the operational use of this technology in the immediate future,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus. Operationally, LLCD demonstrated the ability to download data from the LADEE spacecraft itself. \"We were able to download LADEE's entire stored science and spacecraft data [1 gigabyte] in less than five minutes, which was only limited to our 40 Mbps connection to that data within LADEE\" said Cornwell. Using LADEE's onboard radio system would take several days to complete a download of the same stored data. Additionally, LLCD was to prove the integrity of laser technology to send not only error-free data but also uncorrupted commands and telemetry or monitoring messages to and from the spacecraft over the laser link. LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future. The same technology that has vastly upgraded our broadband connections on Earth could be expanding communications possibilities for NASA in the not-too-distant future.", "url": "https://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1113034994/lunar-laser-communication-demonstration-reveals-bright-future-for-space-communication-122413/"}, {"title": "NASA's LLCD tests confirm laser communication capabilities in space", "date": "2013-12-27", "content": "This week, NASA released the results of its Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration's (LLCD) 30-day test carried out by its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) that is currently in orbit around the Moon. According to the space agency, the LLCD mission proved that laser communications are practical at a distance of a quarter of a million miles and that such a system could perform as well, if not better, than any NASA radio system. The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect.

The spacecraft is now expected to impact the lunar surface on or around April 21, 2014, depending on the final trajectory. The extension provides an opportunity for the satellite to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of very low-altitude data to help scientists unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., where the mission was designed, built, tested and its day-to-day operations are managed. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" The small, car-sized robotic probe launched Sept. 6, 2013, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Va., and has been orbiting the moon since Oct. 6. On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA Spacecraft Begins Collecting Lunar Atmosphere Data", "date": "2013-11-27", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is ready to begin collecting science data about the Moon. On November 20, the spacecraft successfully entered its planned orbit around the Moon's equator - a unique position allowing the small probe to make frequent passes from lunar day to lunar night. This will provide a full scope of the changes and processes occurring within the Moon's tenuous atmosphere. LADEE now orbits the Moon about every 2 hours at an altitude of 8 to 37 miles (12 to 60 kilometers) above the Moon's surface. For about 100 days, the spacecraft will gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determine whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. \"A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our lunar neighbor will help researchers understand other small bodies in the solar system, such as asteroids, Mercury, and the moons of outer planets,\" said Sarah Noble, LADEE program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists also will be able to study the conditions in the atmosphere during lunar sunrise and sunset, where previous crewed and robotic missions detected a mysterious glow of rays and streamers reaching high into the lunar sky. On November 20, flight controllers in the LADEE Mission Operations Center at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, confirmed LADEE performed a crucial burn of its orbit control system to lower the spacecraft into its optimal position to enable science collection. Mission managers will continuously monitor the spacecraft's altitude and make adjustments as necessary. \"Due to the lumpiness of the Moon's gravitational field, LADEE's orbit requires significant maintenance activity with maneuvers taking place as often as every three to five days, or as infrequently as once every two weeks,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. \"LADEE will perform regular orbital maintenance maneuvers to keep the spacecraft's altitude within a safe range above the surface that maximizes the science return.\" In addition to science instruments, the spacecraft carried the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration, NASA's first high-data-rate laser communication system. It is designed to enable satellite communication at rates similar to those of high-speed fiber optic networks on Earth. The system was tested successfully during the commissioning phase of the mission, while LADEE was still at a higher altitude. LADEE was launched September 6 on a U.S. Air Force Minotaur V, an excess ballistic missile converted into a space launch vehicle. LADEE is the first spacecraft designed, developed, built, integrated, and tested at Ames. It also was the first probe launched beyond Earth orbit from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on the Virginia coast.", "url": "https://www.lpi.usra.edu/features/ladee/112713/"}, {"title": "Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration Reveals Bright Future For Space Communication", "date": "2013-12-24", "content": "The completion of the 30-day Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration or LLCD mission has revealed that the possibility of expanding broadband capabilities in space using laser communications is as bright as expected. Hosted aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer known as LADEE, for its ride to lunar orbit, the LLCD was designed to confirm laser communication capabilities from a distance of almost a quarter-of-a-million miles. In addition to demonstrating record-breaking data download and upload speeds to the moon at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and 20 Mbps, respectively, LLCD also showed that it could operate as well as any NASA radio system. \"Throughout our testing we did not see anything that would prevent the operational use of this technology in the immediate future,\" said Don Cornwell, LLCD mission manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus. Operationally, LLCD demonstrated the ability to download data from the LADEE spacecraft itself. \"We were able to download LADEE's entire stored science and spacecraft data [1 gigabyte] in less than five minutes, which was only limited to our 40 Mbps connection to that data within LADEE\" said Cornwell. Using LADEE's onboard radio system would take several days to complete a download of the same stored data. Additionally, LLCD was to prove the integrity of laser technology to send not only error-free data but also uncorrupted commands and telemetry or monitoring messages to and from the spacecraft over the laser link. LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future. The same technology that has vastly upgraded our broadband connections on Earth could be expanding communications possibilities for NASA in the not-too-distant future.", "url": "https://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1113034994/lunar-laser-communication-demonstration-reveals-bright-future-for-space-communication-122413/"}, {"title": "NASA's LLCD tests confirm laser communication capabilities in space", "date": "2013-12-27", "content": "This week, NASA released the results of its Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration's (LLCD) 30-day test carried out by its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) that is currently in orbit around the Moon. According to the space agency, the LLCD mission proved that laser communications are practical at a distance of a quarter of a million miles and that such a system could perform as well, if not better, than any NASA radio system. The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect. The space agency was even surprised that light clouds weren't an obstacle.

The spacecraft is now expected to impact the lunar surface on or around April 21, 2014, depending on the final trajectory. The extension provides an opportunity for the satellite to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of very low-altitude data to help scientists unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., where the mission was designed, built, tested and its day-to-day operations are managed. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" The small, car-sized robotic probe launched Sept. 6, 2013, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Va., and has been orbiting the moon since Oct. 6. On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}, {"title": "LASP instrument aboard NASA lunar mission set to impact moon", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "At the conclusion of a highly successful 130-day mission, the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is planned to impact the surface of the moon on April 21, 2014. LADEE carries the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX), which is the latest in a series of dust detectors designed and built at LASP. LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface. Any material that remained is likely buried in shallow craters. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" said Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" In early April, the spacecraft was commanded to carry out maneuvers that would lower its closest approach to the lunar surface. The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury. The small probe also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15, making it through the low temperatures and battery drain it experienced when out of direct sunlight. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.space.com/25551-nasa-moon-probe-crash-ladee-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Study of Moon's Atmosphere Ends With Planned Crash", "date": "2014-04-18", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected. At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim - they suspect they even know which crater rim - but that has not been confirmed yet. The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17.

For example, LLCD demonstrated error-free communications during broad daylight, including operating when the moon was to within three degrees of the sun as seen from Earth. LLCD also demonstrated error-free communications when the moon was low on the horizon, less than 4 degrees, as seen from the ground station, which also demonstrated that wind and atmospheric turbulence did not significantly impact the system. LLCD was even able to communicate through thin clouds, an unexpected bonus.

LLCD also demonstrated the ability to \"hand-off\" the laser connection from one ground station to another, just as a cellphone does a hand-off from one cell tower to another. An additional achievement was the ability to operate LLCD without using LADEE's radio at all. \"We were able to program LADEE to awaken the LLCD space terminal and have it automatically point and communicate to the ground station at a specific time without radio commands. This demonstrates that this technology could serve as the primary communications system for future NASA missions,\" said Cornwell. The ability of LLCD to send and receive high definition video was proven with a message from NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, completing the trip to the moon and back with only a few seconds of delay. \"Administrator Bolden's message demonstrates NASA's support for advancing this technology for both space and Earth applications,\" said Cornwell. \"It also allowed the LLCD team to showcase the quality and fidelity of our HD video transmissions over our laser communication link to and from the moon.\" Cornwell acknowledged that the LLCD mission is another great example of NASA partnerships with outside organizations to advance unproven technologies. He credits the work of Don Boroson and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) in Lexington, Mass., for developing and operating both the space and ground laser communications terminals for LLCD. \"We could not have made such great strides without the work of our partners at MIT/LL,\" Cornwell said. \"Their years of work and knowledge produced a communications system that far exceeded our expectation.\" NASA's follow-on mission for laser communications will be the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LRCD). Also managed at Goddard, LCRD will demonstrate continuous laser relay communication capabilities at over one billion bits per second between two Earth stations using a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. The system also will support communications with Earth-orbiting satellites. More importantly, LCRD will demonstrate this operational capability for as long as five years, thus building more confidence in the reliability of this laser technology. \"We are very encouraged by the results of LLCD,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) in Washington, which sponsored the mission. \"From where I sit, the future looks very bright for laser communications.\" So it appears NASA could be making the next paradigm shift in communications in the not too distant future. The same technology that has vastly upgraded our broadband connections on Earth could be expanding communications possibilities for NASA in the not-too-distant future.", "url": "https://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1113034994/lunar-laser-communication-demonstration-reveals-bright-future-for-space-communication-122413/"}, {"title": "NASA's LLCD tests confirm laser communication capabilities in space", "date": "2013-12-27", "content": "This week, NASA released the results of its Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration's (LLCD) 30-day test carried out by its Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) that is currently in orbit around the Moon. According to the space agency, the LLCD mission proved that laser communications are practical at a distance of a quarter of a million miles and that such a system could perform as well, if not better, than any NASA radio system. The LLCD is a demonstration of the practicality of using broadband lasers for deep space communications with download speeds orders of magnitude greater than conventional radio communications. With the ability to download data to Earth at 622 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload at 20 Mbps, the LLCD transmitted a record-breaking download on October 20 from lunar orbit using a pulsed laser beam that was picked up by the main LLCD ground station in New Mexico, which is one of three set up in the US and Spain. Lasers have inherent advantages over radio, not the least of which is that they have a much greater bandwidth capacity and their ability to produce a narrow, coherent beam means that they use less power over longer distances - a prime concern for spacecraft that often have to make do with power levels usually associated with incandescent bulbs. NASA says that the LLCD mission performed better than expected during its 30-day trial. The laser was able to communicate with the Earth stations in broad daylight and even when the Moon had less than four degrees of separation from the Sun. It also worked without error when the Moon was low on the horizon, forcing the laser to pass through a much thicker layer of atmosphere, with atmospheric turbulence having little effect. The space agency was even surprised that light clouds weren't an obstacle.

The spacecraft is now expected to impact the lunar surface on or around April 21, 2014, depending on the final trajectory. The extension provides an opportunity for the satellite to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of very low-altitude data to help scientists unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., where the mission was designed, built, tested and its day-to-day operations are managed. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" The small, car-sized robotic probe launched Sept. 6, 2013, from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Va., and has been orbiting the moon since Oct. 6. On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}, {"title": "LASP instrument aboard NASA lunar mission set to impact moon", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "At the conclusion of a highly successful 130-day mission, the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is planned to impact the surface of the moon on April 21, 2014. LADEE carries the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX), which is the latest in a series of dust detectors designed and built at LASP. LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface. Any material that remained is likely buried in shallow craters. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" said Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" In early April, the spacecraft was commanded to carry out maneuvers that would lower its closest approach to the lunar surface. The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury. The small probe also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15, making it through the low temperatures and battery drain it experienced when out of direct sunlight. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.space.com/25551-nasa-moon-probe-crash-ladee-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Study of Moon's Atmosphere Ends With Planned Crash", "date": "2014-04-18", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected. At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim - they suspect they even know which crater rim - but that has not been confirmed yet. The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17.

On Nov. 10, LADEE began gathering science data and on Nov. 20, the spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator at an altitude of eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface; a unique position that allows the spacecraft to frequently pass from lunar day to lunar night, approximately every two hours. This vantage provides data about the full scope of changes and processes occurring within the moon's tenuous atmosphere. \"The science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts,\" said Rick Elphic LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"One cool thing about this extension is that we plan to fly LADEE at only a few kilometers above the lunar surface. This will be much lower than we've been before.\" Using a set of three instruments, scientists are able to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere, collect and analyze samples of lunar dust particles in the atmosphere and hope to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow above the lunar horizon detected during several Apollo missions? Specifically, the Neutral Mass Spectrometer operates while pointing in different directions to look for atoms and molecules in the lunar atmosphere from a variety of sources, and has measured helium, neon, and argon-40; three noble gases. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer has peered over the lunar horizon to look for the glow of atoms, molecules and dust in the lunar atmosphere and has made measurements of atmospheric sodium and potassium at lunar sunset, sunrise and noon. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened and has measured the dust tossed up by a fairly steady \"rain\" of meteoroids on the lunar surface. LDEX occasionally sees an increase in dust impacts due to meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids, and \"dust bursts\" that may be due to LADEE flying through plumes kicked up from nearby meteoroid impacts. Detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets. LADEE was built using an Ames-developed Modular Common Spacecraft Bus architecture, a general purpose spacecraft design that allows NASA to develop, assemble and test multiple modules at the same time. The LADEE bus structure is made of a lightweight carbon composite with an unfueled mass of 547.2 pounds.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/ames/nasa-extends-moon-exploring-satellite-mission/"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: Milestones, Maneuvers and Moisture?", "date": "2014-01-31", "content": "On Sunday, Jan. 5, 2014, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) passed a milestone: 1,000 lunar orbits. The spacecraft has traveled more than 10.4 million miles (17.4 million kilometers) in its journey from Earth to the moon. LADEE continues to perform splendidly. And on Wednesday, Jan. 15, orbital colleague Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped LADEE's picture. Then in the evening of Sunday, Jan. 19, LADEE executed a near-perfect periapsis-raising maneuver, one of a series of maneuvers designed to maintain LADEE's science orbit within the desired altitude range. Without these maneuvers, LADEE's orbit would decay in a matter of days, resulting in premature impact on the lunar surface. Such is life when you fly low over the lunar tropics! Fortunately, LADEE's propulsion and guidance systems have performed exceptionally well. The LADEE science team continued to analyze data acquired at the exciting time of the Chang'e 3 landing on Dec. 14, 2013, and the remarkable feat of quickly deploying and operating its Yutu rover. Along with many others, we wondered why there was no obvious signature of the descent and landing in either gas or ejected dust, which LADEE is equipped to measure. The instrument teams had carefully planned activities to provide a \"before and after\" set of measurements, so we could see if anything had changed, even temporarily. At first glance, nothing stood out. Now, it seems, something may be emerging from the data after all - but the story is complicated. In studying their data from the time of the Chang'e 3 descent operations, the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) team at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder noted an increase in the recorded dust impact rate around the time of the landing. However, the rise preceded the landing time by many hours, suggesting a different origin. Indeed, as often happens in space exploration multiple events collided: the Geminid meteor shower coincided with this landing event and produced elevated dust counts before, during and after the landing period! The LDEX dust impacts are thought to be due to the ejecta, or spray, of particles that result when the Geminid meteoroids slam into the lunar surface. If LDEX did encounter any lunar soil particles thrown up by the final descent of Chang'e 3, they would have been lost in the background of Geminid-produced events. LDEX would have to be very lucky to see these blasted regolith grains, because the descent engine interaction with the landing site soil lasted only a few tens of seconds at most. It's quite likely that LADEE was simply not in the right place at the right time. But that's just part of the story. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., has been searching the data for exhaust species such as water (H2O), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO and CO2) as well as nitrogen (N2). They found there is a difference between what NMS observed before the Geminids shower and Chang'e 3 landing, and what was observed after. The results are very preliminary and require further study, but could be very exciting. Stay tuned! The Ultraviolet and Visible light Spectrometer (UVS) carried out a series of before/after observations looking for effects of both the landing and meteor showers. Analysis by the UVS team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., revealed an increase in sodium in the exosphere in connection with the Geminids, as well as evidence of increased light scattering due to dust. The UVS also has been monitoring emission lines of atomic oxygen, and has seen emissions that may indicate the presence of both iron and titanium in the lunar exosphere. As constituents of the lunar regolith, we expected these elements to contribute in minor amounts to the lunar exosphere, but they have never before been observed. All of this may say something important about both the persistence of a temporary lunar volatile exosphere and how species migrate across the lunar surface. One pathway for populating the lunar polar cold traps is via the moon's tenuous exosphere: water molecules may hop across the lunar surface, and some may randomly find their way to the polar cold traps. But the effectiveness of the transport process depends on the extent to which a molecule \"sticks\" to surface grains. Such molecular stickiness depends on multiple factors - many of them are still unknown. The Geminid effect and the Chang'e 3 landing may afford us an opportunity to determine how \"sticky\" the lunar surface is for hopping water. The LADEE science team continues to analyze the data from the Chang'e 3 landing, episodic meteoroid showers and repeating variations as the moon goes through its phases.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}, {"title": "LASP instrument aboard NASA lunar mission set to impact moon", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "At the conclusion of a highly successful 130-day mission, the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is planned to impact the surface of the moon on April 21, 2014. LADEE carries the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX), which is the latest in a series of dust detectors designed and built at LASP. LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface. Any material that remained is likely buried in shallow craters. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" said Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" In early April, the spacecraft was commanded to carry out maneuvers that would lower its closest approach to the lunar surface. The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury. The small probe also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15, making it through the low temperatures and battery drain it experienced when out of direct sunlight. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.space.com/25551-nasa-moon-probe-crash-ladee-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Study of Moon's Atmosphere Ends With Planned Crash", "date": "2014-04-18", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected. At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim - they suspect they even know which crater rim - but that has not been confirmed yet. The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17.

It also included continued atmospheric analyses, and a tricky snapshot by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), another spacecraft working to further the scientific understanding of our nearest celestial neighbor. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center, in a statement released by NASA. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" This extension translates into the eventual end of the spacecraft's mission to be pushed back to around April 21, allowing for more time for the satellite to study the Moon's atmosphere. LADEE arrived at the Moon on Oct. 6, 2013, one month after being launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Sept. 6, 2013. When LADEE's mission comes to an end, it will purposely fall to the Moon's surface. Along the way it will continue to collect data from dust samples and send the information back to Earth, and its impact will hopefully be observed by LRO thanks to a recent encounter helping to increase these odds.

NASA has announced that the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission will be granted a month long extension since the residual rocket fuel is more than anticipated due to the expertise of LADEE's navigation engineers. This is great news because it means LADEE's three research instruments will collect a big bonus of science measurements about the pristine lunar atmosphere and dust during an additional 28 days in an ultra tight low orbit skimming around the Moon. And the extension news follows closely on the heels of LADEE being photographed in lunar orbit for the first time by a powerful camera aboard NASA's five year old Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), her orbital NASA sister - detailed here. LADEE is currently flying around the moon's equator at altitudes ranging barely eight to 37 miles (12-60 kilometers) above the surface which crosses over from lunar day to lunar night approximately every two hours. During the extended mission lasting an additional full lunar cycle, LADEE will fly even lower to within a few miles (km) thereby allowing scientists an exceptional vantage point to unravel the mysteries of the moon's atmosphere. Just how low will LADEE fly? I asked Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We will be taking LADEE from its nominal 20 to 50 kilometer periapsis right down to the treetops - we want to get data from 5 kilometers or even less!\" Elphic told me. \"So far we've been keeping a healthy margin for spacecraft safety, but after the nominal mission is completed, we will relax those requirements in the interest of new science.\" With the measurements collected so far the science team has already established a baseline of data for the tenuous lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, and dust impacts, says NASA. Therefore the LADEE team is free to fly the spacecraft much lower than ever before. And why even go to lower altitudes? I asked Elphic. Basically because the team hopes to see changes in the particle density and composition. \"The density depends on the species. For instance, argon-40 is heavier than neon-20, and has a lower scale height. That means we should see a big increase in argon compared to neon.\" \"And we may see the heavier species for the first time at these really low altitudes.\" \"It's remotely possible we'll see krypton, for instance.\" \"But the real boon will be in the dust measurements.\" \"LDEX (The Lunar Dust Experiment) will be measuring dust densities very close to the surface, and we will see if something new shows up. Each time we've dropped our orbit down to lower altitudes, we've been surprised by new things,\" Elphic told Universe Today. The Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) instrument will measure the identity and abundances of the exospheres constituents, such as argon, neon and krypton. With the extension, LADEE is expected to continue capturing data in orbit until about April 21, 2014, depending on the usage of the declining on board fuel to feed its maneuvering thrusters. \"LADEE is investigating the moons tenuous exosphere, trace outgases like the sodium halo and lofted dust at the terminator,\" Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA HQ, told me earlier in an exclusive interview. \"The spacecraft has a mass spectrometer to identify the gases, a physical dust detector and an imager to look at scattered light from the dust. These processes also occur at asteroids.\" The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) recorded dust impacts as soon as its cover opened, says NASA and is also seeing occasional bursts of dust impacts caused by meteoroid showers, such as the Geminids. By studying the raised lunar dust, scientists also hope to solve a 40 year old mystery - Why did the Apollo astronauts and early unmanned landers see a glow of rays and streamers at the moon's horizon stretching high into the lunar sky. The science mission duration had initially been planned to last approximately 100 days and finish with a final impact on the Moon on about March 24th. And the team had told me before launch that an extension was rather unlikely since the spacecraft would be flying in such a very low science orbit of about 50 kilometers altitude above the moon that it will require considerable fuel to maintain. \"LADEE is limited by the amount of onboard fuel required to maintain orbit,\" Doug Voss, launch manager, Wallops, told me. So what accounts for the extension? Basically it's because of the expert navigation by NASA's engineers and the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V rocket and upper stages following the spectacular night time LADEE blastoff from NASA Wallops, VA, on Sept. 6, 2013 and subsequent insertion into lunar orbit. \"The launch vehicle performance and orbit capture burns using LADEE's onboard engines were extremely accurate, so the spacecraft had significant propellant remaining to enable extra science,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at NASA's Ames where the mission was designed, built, tested, in a NASA statement. \"This extension represents a tremendous increase in the amount of science data returned from the mission.\" \"LADEE launched with 134.5 kilograms of fuel. After the third lunar orbit insertion burn (LOI-3), 80% of our fuel had been consumed,\" said Dawn McIntosh, LADEE deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center, in an exclusive interview with Universe Today. \"Additional orbit-lowering maneuvers with the orbital control system (OCS) and reaction control system (RCS) of approximately 40 seconds were used to get LADEE into the science orbit. And LADEE's orbit capture was accomplished amidst the ridiculous US government shutdown with a skeleton crew. The spacecraft finally entered its planned two hour science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20. So LADEE's orbital lifetime depends entirely on the remaining quantity of rocket fuel. \"LADEE has about 20 kg of propellant remaining today,\" Butler Hine told Universe Today. The 844 pound (383 kg) robot explorer is the size of a couch and was assembled at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., and is a cooperative project with NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. The $280 million probe is built on a revolutionary 'modular common spacecraft bus', or body, that could dramatically cut the cost of exploring space and also be utilized on space probes to explore a wide variety of inviting targets in the solar system. \"LADEE is the first in a new class of interplanetary exploration missions,\" NASA Ames Center Director Pete Worden told me in an interview. \"It will study the pristine moon to study significant questions.\" \"This is probably our last best chance to study the pristine Moon before there is a lot of human activity there changing things.\" To date LADEE has traveled over 1 million miles and in excess of 1200 equatorial orbits around the Moon. LADEE is also searching for any changes caused to the exosphere and dust by the landing of China's maiden Chang'e-3 lander and Yutu moon rover in December 2013. Stay tuned here for Ken's continuing LADEE, Chang'e-3, Orion, Orbital Sciences, SpaceX, commercial space, Mars rover and more news.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/108940/nasa-extends-ladee-dust-explorer-for-bonus-lunar-science/"}, {"title": "NASA's LADEE Spacecraft Sends Back New Moon Images", "date": "2014-02-13", "content": "NASA's LADEE Mission (that's \"LAD-ee,\" not \"lady,\" short for Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer), managed by Ames Research Center in Mountain View, has sent back its first images from the moon.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}, {"title": "LASP instrument aboard NASA lunar mission set to impact moon", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "At the conclusion of a highly successful 130-day mission, the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is planned to impact the surface of the moon on April 21, 2014. LADEE carries the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX), which is the latest in a series of dust detectors designed and built at LASP. LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface. Any material that remained is likely buried in shallow craters. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" said Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" In early April, the spacecraft was commanded to carry out maneuvers that would lower its closest approach to the lunar surface. The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury. The small probe also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15, making it through the low temperatures and battery drain it experienced when out of direct sunlight. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.space.com/25551-nasa-moon-probe-crash-ladee-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Study of Moon's Atmosphere Ends With Planned Crash", "date": "2014-04-18", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected. At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim - they suspect they even know which crater rim - but that has not been confirmed yet. The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17. LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface. Any material that remained is likely buried in shallow craters. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" said Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at Ames. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area.

The spacecraft recently passed an important milestone in its mission by concluding its initial 100-day primary phase of observations earlier this month, while entering an 28-day extended mission phase. Contrary to the thick atmosphere that envelops the Earth, the Moon is better known for being an airless celestial body. Nevertheless, our natural satellite is surrounded by a tenuous atmospheric layer of its own, consisting of dust particles and trace amounts of various chemical elements, called the exosphere. Technically, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere around a planet or moon. It is not an abrupt boundary where the atmosphere suddenly stops, rather a gradual thinning out and merging with interplanetary space. In the case of the Earth, the exosphere begins at a height of more than 600 km above the ground, an altitude higher than that of the International Space Station and of every other mission that has taken place in low-Earth orbit for the past 40 years. On the other hand, and because of its lower gravity and mass, the Moon lacks the ability to have a stable, thick atmosphere like the Earth's. Thus, it is only surrounded by an atmosphere with a density less than one hundred trillionth that of the Earth's at sea level, which for all intents and purposes can be considered as a near-perfect vacuum. In the absence of any intermediate atmospheric layers, this ultra-thin layer extends all the way down to the lunar surface, which scientists call a \"surface boundary exosphere.\" \"Sometimes we get a little surprised when we start talking about a lunar atmosphere, for most of us were taught in school that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere,\" said Sarah Noble, program scientist for the mission at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., during a pre-launch press conference. \"It does, but it's very, very thin. It's so thin, that the individual molecules that make up the atmosphere never see each other. They don't interact, they don't collide. And the Moon is not the only example we have [for this type of atmosphere]. Mercury, a lot of the moons of the outer planets, as well as some of the larger asteroids in our Solar System, all have surface boundary exospheres [like the Moon]. It turns out to be the most common atmosphere we have and yet it's one that we don't really know much about. LADEE is a really great opportunity to go and learn not only about the Moon, but about many of the bodies in our Solar System.\" The source of this rarefied exosphere is thought to be a combination of outgassing of different chemical elements from the lunar surface, either coming from the interior of the Moon itself or through meteoric impacts on the surface and the constant bombardment of the Moon by the solar wind that flows through interplanetary space. Its composition had been studied in-situ for the first time during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The astronauts of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to land on the Moon in 1972, deployed a mass spectrometer on the lunar surface called the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, or LACE, which took measurements of the trace chemical elements of the lunar exosphere. The measurements made during Apollo showed that the atmosphere of the Moon had trace amounts of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, argon, and other small amounts of noble gases. The significant discovery in recent years of water ice deposits on the bottoms of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon's south pole by India's Chandrayaan spacecraft and NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, opened up the possibility for the existence of a lunar \"water cycle\" of sorts. As an alternative to the cometary impact hypothesis, scientists now theorise that water molecules might constantly be deposited on the lunar surface through a perpetual process of evaporation, condensation, and migration toward the deep craters of the polar regions, where water ice can be collected and preserved. To further investigate the conditions and intriguing dynamics of the Moon's tenuous atmosphere and dust environment near the lunar surface, the $280 million LADEE mission was designed by NASA in 2008 as a precursor for the extended manned lunar exploration missions that were conceived at the time as part of the agency's now-cancelled Constellation program. Launched on Sept. 6, 2013, LADEE reached the vicinity of the Moon a month later, following a slow cislunar cruise. Having entered lunar orbit on Oct. 6, the spacecraft spent the following 30 days going through a series of system and instrument tests during a commissioning and checkout phase, prior to the start of its primary science mission on Nov. 20. For the duration of its mission, LADEE was kept at a circular lunar orbit, with a periselene of 20 to 50 km and an aposelene of 75 to 150 km in order to investigate the atmospheric environment as close to the lunar surface as possible. Because of the Moon's highly irregular gravity field, which would cause LADEE's orbit to be degraded over time, the spacecraft had to perform powered Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers every week, so as to be kept at the altitude needed for its science mission. LADEE's science payload consists of three instruments: an Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer, or UVS, for determining the chemical composition of the lunar atmosphere; a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, or NMS, for measuring variations in the lunar atmosphere over multiple lunar orbits; and a Lunar Dust Experiment, or LDEX, for the collection and analysis of dust particles in the tenuous lunar atmopshere near the surface. During the 100-day primary mission phase, the UVS instrument onboard LADEE has acquired more than 700,000 spectra of the Moon's atmosphere, while the NMS has helped to identify the presence of certain chemical elements like argon-40, which had also been identified by the crews of the Apollo missions, as well as neon-20, potassium, and helium. Since arriving at lunar orbit in October 2013, the LDEX instrument has also recorded more than 11,000 collisions of dust particles on its sensors. Preliminary analysis of the science data gathered so far shows a periodic variation of sodium around the Moon, which seems to be tied to our natural satellite's orbit around the Earth. LADEE has measured a systematic increase in the presence of sodium during the waxing Moon and a following decrease when the Moon is waning. The spacecraft also found out that the flow of helium on the lunar surface, which is constantly replenished by solar wind particles, is interrupted whenever our natural satellite crosses the Earth's geomagnetic tail. \"Earth's magnetotail extends well beyond the orbit of the Moon and, once a month, the Moon orbits through it,\" says Tim Stubbs, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the Moon is full, it is inside the magnetotail. The Moon enters the magnetotail three days before it is full and takes about six days to cross and exit on the other side. This can have consequences ranging from lunar 'dust storms' to electrostatic discharges.\" During the time that the Moon crosses the Earth's magnetotail, the whole lunar night side receives a widespread negative electric charge, from the energetic particles coming off the Earth's magnetosphere. It is thought that this build-up of free electrons on the lunar night side can cause dust to float freely above the surface, even creating \"dust storms\" of particles migrating from the highly charged lunar night side to the lower-charged day side. This theory is backed up by photographic evidence from NASA's unmanned Surveyor 7 that landed near the edges of Tycho crater, at the southern highlands of the Moon's near side at 1968, but hasn't been confirmed. \"Apollo astronauts never landed on a full Moon and they never experienced the magnetotail,\" says Stubbs. Nevertheless, LADEE's LDEX instrument was able to map the variations of dust concentrations during the course of a lunar day. It has found that the layer of dust above the Moon is thicker near the surface, thinning out at increasing altitudes, while the bigger accumulation of dust occurs during the early lunar morning, when the Sun rises above the Moon. Interestingly, LADEE was unable to identify any trace elements of exhaust gases or ejected dust during the historic landing of China's Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover near Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, on Dec. 14, 2013. It was thought that the arrival of Chang'e 3 would disrupt the pristine condition of the lunar atmosphere and the dust environment near the surface. LADEE had the unique chance to obtain \"before\" and \"after\" measurements around the landing site. Yet it failed to detect any elevated levels of dust there. What it did detect was increased levels of dust impact rates, several hours before the actual landing itself. The timing of the elevated dust levels coincided with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower a day earlier, on Dec. 13. These observations from LADEE indicate that the landing of a spacecraft the size of Change 3s fails to produce any observable effects on the surrounding lunar environment. Science observations aside, LADEE also carried a technology demonstration payload, called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, or LLCD. Its goal was the demonstration of two-way broadband optical communications between the Earth and the Moon, using a pulsed infrared laser beam instead of radio waves. The spacecraft made history on Oct. 17, 2013, by achieving an error-free communication with Earth, with a downlink transmission rate of 622 Megabits per second and an uplink rate of 20 Mbps. NASA hopes that the success of the LLCD will lead to the development and use of similar broadband optical communication systems for future manned and robotic missions throughout the Solar System, allowing for the transmission of high-definition video streams through interplanetary distances. \"LLCD is the first step on our roadmap toward building the next generation of space communication capability,\" said Badri Younes, NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for space communications at NASA Headquarters. \"We are encouraged by the results of the demonstration to this point, and we are confident we are on the right path to introduce this new capability into operational service soon.\" Even before the successful conclusion of its primary mission, LADEE was granted an additional month of extended science operations through mid-April, due to the excellent performance of the spacecraft's propulsion system, which led to extra fuel reserves being available for the science team. During this extended period of observations, mission planners will program LADEE to make very close passes of the Moon at a lower orbit than that of the primary mission phase, allowing scientists to get even more precise measurements of the lunar atmosphere. This doesn't come without a big risk to the spacecraft, though, and all the dangers associated with flying at very low orbits. Assuming a successful outcome to its extended science phase, LADEE will be intentionally de-orbited and left to impact the lunar surface, thus putting an end to the mission. Despite all the exciting science conducted, maybe the most important result of the mission will be the realisation that our understanding of the Moon is far from complete, underscoring the need for a more permanent human and robotic presence there.", "url": "https://www.americaspace.com/2014/03/18/nasas-ladee-spacecraft-concludes-primary-mission-enters-extended-science-phase/"}, {"title": "LASP instrument aboard NASA lunar mission set to impact moon", "date": "2014-04-03", "content": "At the conclusion of a highly successful 130-day mission, the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is planned to impact the surface of the moon on April 21, 2014.

LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury.

The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17.

LADEE launched in early September 2013 and, after two months of orbital maneuvers and instrument commissioning, began investigating the tenuous atmosphere of the moon in order to characterize its density, composition, and variability. The LDEX instrument has recorded more than 11,000 impacts from lunar dust particles in an effort to determine the size, charge, and spatial distribution of dust grains lofted above the moon's surface. LASP scientist and CU-Boulder Physics professor Mih\u00e1ly Hor\u00e1nyi is principal investigator for the LDEX instrument. \"We have gotten beautiful data,\" said Hor\u00e1nyi. \"We discovered that a cloud of dust permanently engulfs the moon, and that the dust density dramatically increases toward its surface.\" The LADEE mission completed its primary 100-day science objective in March, but NASA approved a 28-day mission extension, allowing the spacecraft to gather an additional full lunar cycle worth of data from very low altitudes. The additional data, collected from within a few miles above the lunar surface, has given mission scientists an opportunity to observe changes in particle density and size distribution at a wider variety of altitudes. The anticipated April 21 impact will take place on the far side of the moon, opposite our view from Earth, and far from any of the historic Apollo exploration locations. Hor\u00e1nyi is also the principal investigator for the LASP-built Student Dust Counter (SDC) aboard NASA's New Horizons mission. New Horizons is scheduled to fly-by Pluto in July 2015 and then proceed on to undetermined objects in the Kuiper Belt, a massive region beyond the dwarf planet, which contains icy objects left over from the formation of the solar system. The SDC is the first student-built instrument ever to fly on a NASA planetary mission. In addition to the dust detectors onboard New Horizons and LADEE, LASP provided the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere mission.

LADEE lacked fuel to maintain a long-term lunar orbit or continue science operations and was intentionally sent into the lunar surface. The spacecraft's orbit naturally decayed following the mission's final low-altitude science phase. During impact, engineers believe the LADEE spacecraft, the size of a vending machine, broke apart, with most of the spacecraft's material heating up several hundred degrees - or even vaporizing - at the surface.

It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" In early April, the spacecraft was commanded to carry out maneuvers that would lower its closest approach to the lunar surface. The new orbit brought LADEE to altitudes below one mile (two kilometers) above the lunar surface. This is lower than most commercial airliners fly above Earth, enabling scientists to gather unprecedented science measurements. On April 11, LADEE performed a final maneuver to ensure a trajectory that caused the spacecraft to impact the far side of the moon, which is not in view of Earth or near any previous lunar mission landings. LADEE also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15. This demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to endure low temperatures and a drain on batteries as it, and the moon, passed through Earth's deep shadow. In the coming months, mission controllers will determine the exact time and location of LADEE's impact and work with the agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team to possibly capture an image of the impact site. Launched in June 2009, LRO provides data and detailed images of the lunar surface. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames. Launched in September 2013 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, LADEE began orbiting the moon Oct. 6 and gathering science data Nov. 10. The spacecraft entered its science orbit around the moon's equator on Nov. 20, and in March 2014, LADEE extended its mission operations following a highly successful 100-day primary science phase. LADEE also hosted NASA's first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. The Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) made history using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239,000 miles from the moon to the Earth at a record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits-per-second (Mbps). In addition, an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps was transmitted from the primary ground station in New Mexico to the Laser Communications Space Terminal aboard LADEE. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere. In addition, scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: Was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" A thorough understanding of the characteristics of our nearest celestial neighbor will help researchers understand other bodies in the solar system, such as large asteroids, Mercury and the moons of outer planets.

The space agency's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft (LADEE for short) made its planned crash into the lunar surface between 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT) and 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT) on April 18, after orbiting the moon since October 2013. Scientists expected the impact, predicting that LADEE would hit the far side of the moon on or before April 21 because the probe was running out of fuel - as intended. The impact itself was probably a violent event. NASA engineers think that the loveseat-sized probe broke apart as most of it heated up to several hundred degrees. It's even possible that some of the material from the spacecraft vaporized during the crash, NASA officials said in a statement. \"At the time of impact, LADEE was traveling at a speed of 3,600 miles per hour [5,800 km/h] - about three times the speed of a high-powered rifle bullet,\" Rick Elphic, LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said in a statement. \"There's nothing gentle about impact at these speeds - it's just a question of whether LADEE made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area. It will be interesting to see what kind of feature LADEE has created.\" NASA will use another probe still orbiting the moon to seek out LADEE's crash site and learn more about the impact. Scientists will use the space agency's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to snap a picture of the LADEE impact site. The site itself is not viewable from Earth, and it is far from any area where previous moon landings occurred, NASA officials said. Before its impact, LADEE dropped down to altitudes below 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) above the surface of the moon, allowing researchers to collect unprecedented data, NASA officials said. \"LADEE was a mission of firsts, achieving yet another first by successfully flying more than 100 orbits at extremely low altitudes,\" said Joan Salute, LADEE program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington. \"Although a risky decision, we're already seeing evidence that the risk was worth taking.\" The $280 million LADEE mission launched to space in September 2013 to investigate the moon's thin atmosphere and help scientists learn more about lunar dust. In particular, the spacecraft was designed to investigate a moon dust mystery that dates back to before the Apollo era. During the Apollo missions, some astronauts saw a glow on the horizon before sunrise as they orbited above the moon's surface. Earlier NASA probes also caught sight of that distinct glow. Scientists think that particles of dust lofted into the thin lunar atmosphere (called an exosphere) may have caused the glow; however, data collected by LADEE has not yet confirmed this theory. LADEE also helped scientists learn more about the moon's exosphere. Researchers think that exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in the solar system, so learning more about the lunar atmosphere could tell researchers more about other bodies in the solar system, like Mercury. The small probe also survived the total lunar eclipse on April 14 to 15, making it through the low temperatures and battery drain it experienced when out of direct sunlight. \"It's bittersweet knowing we have received the final transmission from the LADEE spacecraft after spending years building it in-house at Ames, and then being in constant contact as it circled the moon for the last several months,\" Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.space.com/25551-nasa-moon-probe-crash-ladee-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Study of Moon's Atmosphere Ends With Planned Crash", "date": "2014-04-18", "content": "NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft slammed into the moon early Friday morning, as planned, but a few days earlier than NASA officials expected. At about 12:30 a.m. Eastern time, radio signals from the spacecraft abruptly cut off just as it passed over to the far side of the moon. Mission managers believe that is the moment when it ran into a crater rim - they suspect they even know which crater rim - but that has not been confirmed yet. The crash brought to a successful end a six-month, $280 million study of the tenuous envelope of gases and dust surrounding the moon. With impact at 3,600 miles per hour, the vending-machine-size spacecraft, called Ladee (pronounced LAD-ee), broke up into pieces that heated up to hundreds of degrees and partly vaporized. \"It's just a question of whether Ladee made a localized craterlet on a hillside or scattered debris across a flat area,\" Richard C. Elphic, the project scientist, said in a NASA news release. Mission managers had expected that Ladee would stay in orbit until Monday. On April 11, the spacecraft fired its engine one last time to swoop in closer to sample the gas and dust at the very lowest parts of the lunar atmosphere. By design, the elliptical orbit was oriented to ensure that Ladee would crash on the far side of the moon, away from the historic Apollo landing sites. Unevenness in the strength of the moon's gravity jostled the elliptical orbit. Calculations indicated that Ladee would remain just above the surface on Friday and then rise again before another gravitational fluctuation would send it on a collision course early Monday morning. But with uncertainties about Ladee's exact position and the height of the lunar terrain, mission managers also said that the spacecraft could easily crash sooner. On Thursday night, Ladee dipped lower and lower on each successive orbit, and mission controllers scrambled to send remaining data to Earth. \"What you don't want to do is leave valuable science data on the spacecraft when you impact,\" Butler Hine, the project manager, said in an interview. The last data file was sent about a minute before the cutoff of the radio signal. Ladee, which launched in September and started orbiting the moon on Oct. 6, is not the only piece of spacecraft debris to arrive at the moon recently. In December 2012, two small NASA spacecraft measuring the moon's gravity similarly crashed after their maneuvering fuel ran out. Last December, the Chinese landed a small rover on the moon, but it malfunctioned a couple of months later. One of Ladee's interesting observations was of water in the atmosphere, very small amounts of about 100 molecules per cubic centimeter. \"Sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes none at all,\" Dr. Elphic said in an interview. \"We see it fairly sporadically.\" That could help explain how water traveled to the moon's poles and accumulated, over billions of years, as ice at the bottom of deep, perpetually dark craters. What Ladee did not solve was a four-decade-old mystery: The glowing light at the lunar horizon just before sunrise that some Apollo astronauts had reported seeing. The lunar atmosphere, just one-quadrillionth the density of Earth's, is too thin to scatter the light, so scientists thought perhaps enough dust had been lofted by electrostatic forces to do so. However, Ladee observed only minuscule amounts of dust, not enough to account for the glow. That might mean the dust conditions during Apollo were somehow different or that something else created the glow. \"Maybe that signature comes and goes, and we just didn't happen to be lucky about it,\" Dr. Elphic said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/science/space/nasa-lunar-explorer.html"}, {"title": "NASA Completes LADEE Mission with Planned Impact on Moon's Surface", "date": "2014-04-19", "content": "Ground controllers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., have confirmed that NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft impacted the surface of the moon, as planned, between 9:30 and 10:22 p.m. PDT Thursday, April 17.

The spacecraft was 2.37 m (7.8 ft) high and 1.85 m (6.1 ft) wide with a mass of 383 kg (844 lb) including the fuel. After expending most of its fuel during its successful exploration of the Moon the spacecraft had a mass of about only 248 kg (547 lb) when it impacted the surface. Originally LADEE was placed into a retrograde, near-equatorial orbit to study the Moon's surface bound exosphere and dust environment. Since the Apollo era of exploration several conflicting ideas and observations concerning the existence (or not) of near-surface and high altitude dust were debated, and thus one of LADEE's key science goals was to search for dust particles high above the surface (no dust was found). LADEE's engines were fired on 11 April 2014 to adjust the orbit in such a way as to guarantee a farside impact if the spacecraft did not survive the 15 April 2014 eclipse. There was a small worry that if the spacecraft failed during the eclipse and was uncontrollable, it might impact near one of the Apollo sites. Over the subsequent 7 days, the low point in LADEE's orbit decreased resulting in an impact on 18 April 2014. As it passed over the western limb as seen from the Earth, the spacecraft impacted the eastern rim of Sundman V crater (11.85\u00b0N, 266.75\u00b0E). The impact site (11.8494\u00b0N, 266.7507\u00b0E) is about 780 m from the crater rim with an altitude of about 2590 m, and was only about 295 meters north of its originally predicted location (based on tracking data). Like the LADEE spacecraft, the impact crater is small, <3 m in diameter, barely resolvable by the LROC NAC. Based on impact models, a crater of only about 1.8 m (6 ft) diameter is expected. The crater is very small because, as impacts go, LADEE had a low mass and a low density (0.43 g / cm3 vs. >3.0 g / cm3 for an ordinary chondrite meteorite), and was traveling at only a tenth the speed (1699 m/sec - 3800 mph) of an average asteroid. Because it is so small, the crater is hard to identify among the myriad of small fresh craters that dot the lunar surface. However, as images had been acquired of the impact region before the impact occurred, they could be compared with images acquired after the impact to identify the crater. Since NAC images are so large (250 megapixels) and the new crater is so small the LROC team coregistered the before and after images (called a temporal pair) and then divided the after image by the before image. In this manner any changes to the surface stick out like a beacon!

LADEE's engines fired April 11, 2014, to perform a final orbital maintenance maneuver and adjust to guarantee it would impact on the farside of the moon and away from the Apollo landing sites. Over a seven-day period, LADEE's orbit decreased and the spacecraft orbited very low to the surface and close to the walls of lunar craters and mountain ridges to give the team a chance to collect valuable science data. Finally, LADEE impacted the eastern rim of Sundman V crater on April 18. The impact site is about half a mile (780 meters) from the crater rim with an altitude of about 8,497 feet (2,590 meters) and was only about two tenths of a mile (300 meters) north of the location mission controllers predicted based on tracking data. The impact crater is small, less than ten feet (three meters) in diameter, barely resolvable by the LROC NAC. The crater is small because the spacecraft -- compared to most celestial impacts -- was not traveling very fast, approximately 3,800 miles per hour (1,699 meters per second) and had a low mass and a low density. The size of the impact crater made it hard to identify among the myriad of small fresh craters on the lunar surface. Images acquired of the impact region before the impact, were compared with images obtained after the impact to identify the crater. Since the NAC images are so large (250 mega-pixels) and the new crater is so small, the LROC team co-registered the before and after images (called a temporal pair) and then divided the before image by the after image. By doing this, changes to the surface become evident. The ejecta from the impact forms a triangular pattern primarily downrange to the west, extending about 656-984 feet (200-300 meters) from the impact site. There is also a small triangular area of ejecta up range but it extends only about 66-98 feet (20-30 meters).

Since the NAC images are so large (250 mega-pixels) and the new crater is so small, the LROC team co-registered the before and after images (called a temporal pair) and then divided the before image by the after image. By doing this, changes to the surface become evident. The ejecta from the impact forms a triangular pattern primarily downrange to the west, extending about 656-984 feet (200-300 meters) from the impact site. There is also a small triangular area of ejecta up range but it extends only about 66-98 feet (20-30 meters). The ejecta pattern is oriented northwest, consistent with the direction the spacecraft was traveling when it impacted the surface. \"I'm happy that the LROC team was able to confirm the LADEE impact point,\" said Butler Hine, LADEE project manager at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. \"It really helps the LADEE team to get closure and know exactly where the product of their hard work wound up.\" LADEE launched Sept. 6, 2013 from Pad 0B at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia. LADEE gathered detailed information about the structure and composition of the thin lunar atmosphere and determining whether dust is being lofted into the lunar sky. LRO launched September 18, 2009. LRO continues to bring the world astounding views of the lunar surface and a sizable collection of lunar data for research. LRO recently received a second two-year extended mission. Under the extended mission, LRO will study the seasonal volatile cycle; determine how many small meteorites are currently hitting the moon and their effects; characterize the structure of the lunar regolith; investigate the moon's interaction with the space environment; and reveal more about the lunar interior using observations of the moon's surface. \"With LRO, NASA will study our nearest celestial neighbor for at least two more years,\" said John Keller, LRO project scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"LRO continues to increase our understanding of the moon and its environment.\" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the LRO mission.

After more than six months of searching, NASA has finally spotted a crater on the moon that is unlike the rest. It was created by them. The crater was made by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft when it purposely impacted the far side of the moon on April 18, 2014. That was more than 6 months ago, and although they had a good idea of where the crater was, scientists had no photographic evidence to confirm their estimates, until now. The problem? Finding a small impact crater on the moon is kind of like finding a needle in a hay stack because the surface of the moon, especially the far side, is pockmarked with craters of all sizes. That's why it took NASA the better half of a year to discover LADEE's resting place, which is on the eastern rim of Sundman V crater - within 1000 feet from where the LADEE team had predicted!", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/where-nasa-crashed-ladee-into-moon-2014-10"}, {"title": "LADEE Project Scientist Update: December 2014", "date": "2014-12-17", "content": "It's been about a year since LADEE started its Science Mission Phase on Nov. 21, 2013, and successfully completed it on March 1, 2014. LADEE then went on to acquire low altitude data for another month and a half, before impacting the lunar surface as planned on April 18, 2014. With the science data acquisition completed, the science team worked hard over spring and summer to ready the instrument measurements and background information for submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS). The instrument teams finished off this task in September, 2014, a year after launch. Now planetary scientists everywhere can delve into the LADEE exosphere and dust datasets! The LADEE science team also has been busy analyzing the returned data, figuring out how the exosphere breathes and changes, and how the moon's tenuous dust shroud varies in time and space. The Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) discovered a low-density cloud of small dust particles over the part of the moon that faces the more-or-less steady rain of micrometeoroid particles onto the lunar surface. The Earth/moon system orbits the sun with an average speed of 30 km/sec (67,000 mph), and like bugs on a car windshield, the interplanetary micrometeoroid materials smack into the \"upstream\" side of the Earth and moon. On Earth these cause meteors, which burn up in the atmosphere, but with the almost negligible atmosphere on the moon, these particles smash into the surface with tremendous speed. Each particle impact sends a spray of ejecta up into the lunar sky; this process is continuous but really increases when the moon encounters a micrometeoroid stream. The flux of incoming particles can increase by factors of up to ten times the normal rates - we see these as meteor showers on Earth. On the moon, it's a very heavy rain of tiny, tiny rocks, and the spray of ejecta increases accordingly. LADEE saw these meteor shower dust particles several times during the mission. LADEE also looked for mysterious \"levitated\" dust, thought to be suspended by electric forces over the sunrise and sunset terminators. This mystery was prompted in part by astronaut sightings of a horizon glow seen from orbit. However, the spacecraft's instruments found no evidence of anything that could be seen by the human eye. However, LADEE's Ultraviolet/Visible Spectrometer (UVS) has detected a very weak glow in the anti-sunward direction, possibly due to a population of very small grains of lunar ejecta. Picture the moon as an extremely weak comet, throwing off this very tenuous cloud of tiny particles into a kind of tail stretching out behind, away from the sun. We have learned that the major gas species in the thin lunar atmosphere are three noble gases: helium, neon and argon. LADEE's neutral mass spectrometer (NMS) systematically measured these species, and we now know that helium and neon are supplied by the solar wind. The flux of doubly-ionized solar wind helium went up and down from day to day (as measured by LADEE's lunar companions, the two ARTEMIS spacecraft), and the NMS helium measurements tracked those changes. In fact, for helium it's easy come, easy go! The dayside lunar surface gets very hot, over 240 degrees Fahrenheit (117 degrees Celsius) at the equator near noon, and the helium atoms pick up this heat as they bounce across the surface. Some helium atoms move so fast as a result that they escape the moon completely and are lost. On daily time scales, the supply of helium provided by the solar wind is balanced by the loss of the escaping portion of helium. But when the moon's phase is full, it is located inside a protected region, the Earth's geomagnetic tail, where it is shielded from the solar wind. Here, the supply of solar wind helium is cut off. But the hot lunar dayside surface continues to drive the escape of some of the resident helium. Because of this ongoing loss process, and a temporary cutoff in supply, we see the density decrease with time. When the moon re-emerges into the solar wind, the supply is restored and the exosphere quickly recovers to equilibrium. Neon, delivered by the solar wind in very small quantities, generally cannot escape like helium does. It's too heavy and doesn't travel fast enough to leave the moon. And once there, like an unwelcome house guest, it sticks around. And sticks around. In fact, about the only way the neon leaves is when the sun's ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization: the neon atom loses an electron, and the resulting positively charged ion is swept away by the solar wind. But photoionization of neon takes a long time - over 200 days. So even though neon is a very minor solar wind constituent, the slow loss rate means it can build up to levels comparable to helium in the moon's atmosphere. The third lunar noble gas is argon, specifically, argon-40. This isotope comes from the decay of naturally occurring radioactive potassium-40, found in the rocks of all the terrestrial planets as a leftover from formation. As potassium-40 in the moon decays, the argon-40 product is able to diffuse and percolate up to the lunar surface, where it becomes part of the tenuous atmosphere. Lunar argon behaves differently from helium and neon; it condenses on the moon's cold nightside where temperatures drop below -280 degrees Fahrenheit (-173 Celsius). As the moon slowly rotates, and the condensed argon sees sunrise, temperatures rise and the atoms jump off the surface into the exosphere again. Some of these jumping argon atoms leap back into the cold nightside, and are re-trapped on the cold surface until sunrise occurs for that patch of real estate. But the moon's argon exhibits other interesting behavior. LADEE discovered that argon-40 creates a local bulge above an unusual part of the moon's surface, the region containing Mare Imbrium and Oceanus Procellarum. This happens to be the place where potassium-40 is most abundant on the surface, and there may be a connection between the atmospheric argon, the surface potassium and deep interior sources. UVS also monitored the two minor species sodium and potassium over the course of LADEE's mission. These observations show that sodium follows a monthly cycle, responding to passages through the geomagnetic tail. This suggests that the solar wind is one influence on releasing sodium from the surface into the exosphere, possibly through a process called \"sputtering.\" Sputtering occurs when a solar wind protons slam into lunar surface materials and deposit their energy there. The energy deposition process can knock other atoms, including sodium, out of these materials. UVS also found that exospheric sodium increases in density in response to meteoroid showers, possibly because these micrometeoroids are vaporizing lunar regolith grains. Sodium is one of the easiest species to liberate. Potassium exhibits a monthly variation as well, though slightly different from that of sodium. Other metal species may also be showing up in UVS data. Several external stimuli can affect the thin lunar atmosphere, among them solar wind sputtering, desorption by extreme ultraviolet photons, and micrometeoroid impact vaporization.

There's not enough neon to make the Moon visibly glow because the lunar atmosphere is extremely tenuous, about 100 trillion times less dense than Earth's atmosphere at sea level. A dense atmosphere like Earth's is relatively rare in our solar system because an object has to be sufficiently massive to have enough gravity to hold onto it. The behaviour of a dense atmosphere is driven by collisions between its atoms and molecules. However, the Moon's atmosphere is technically referred to as an exosphere because it's so thin, its atoms rarely collide. Exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in our solar system, so scientists are interested in learning more about them. \"It's critical to learn about the lunar exosphere before sustained human exploration substantially alters it,\" Benna said. Since the Moon's atmosphere is so thin, rocket exhaust and outgassing from spacecraft could easily change its composition. Most of the Moon's exosphere comes from the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically conducting gas blown from the surface of the sun into space at around a million miles per hour. Most of the solar wind is hydrogen and helium, but it contains many other elements in small amounts, including neon. All these elements impact the Moon, but only helium, neon, and argon are volatile enough to be returned back to space. The rest of the elements will stick indefinitely to the Moon's surface. The LADEE NMS instrument confirms that the Moon's exosphere is made up of mostly helium, argon, and neon. Their relative abundance is dependent on the time of day on the Moon - argon peaks at sunrise, with neon at 4 am and helium at 1 am. The instrument conducted systematic measurements of these gases for seven months, which allowed the team to understand how these gases are supplied to the exosphere, and how they are ultimately lost. While most of the lunar exosphere comes from the solar wind, NMS showed that some gas comes from lunar rocks.

A second surprising behaviour of argon was that the overall amount in the lunar exosphere was not constant over time. Instead, it increased and then decreased by about 25 percent during the course of the LADEE mission. According to Benna, this transient source of argon may be the result of enhanced outgassing from the surface that is triggered by tidal stress on the Moon. NMS also revealed an unexpected source of some of the helium in the lunar exosphere. \"About 20 percent of the helium is coming from the Moon itself, most likely as the result from the decay of radioactive thorium and uranium, also found in lunar rocks,\" said Benna.

So there may be a connection between the atmospheric argon, the surface potassium and deep interior sources.\" LADEE's measurements also revealed that argon abundance changed by about 25 percent over the course of the spacecraft's mission, possibly as a result of outgassing caused by the Earth's strong gravitational tug, researchers said. The new results, which were published May 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, should give scientists a better understanding of exospheres in general, and that of the moon in particular, researchers said. \"It's critical to learn about the lunar exosphere before sustained human exploration substantially alters it,\" Benna said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/30295-neon-found-on-moon.html"}, {"title": "NASA's LADEE Mission Shows the Force of Meteoroid Strikes on Lunar Exosphere", "date": "2015-12-18", "content": "NASA scientists have released new findings about the moon's tenuous exosphere - the thin layer of gas surrounding the moon that's one 25-trillionth the density of Earth's atmosphere. The data reveal, for the first time, that meteoroid strikes cause a predictable increase in the abundance of two key elements within the lunar exosphere. Physical processes such as meteoroid stream impacts, the bombardment of helium and hydrogen particles from the sun, thermal absorption, and space weathering constantly modify the moon's surface as they work within the lunar exosphere. NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, or LADEE, spacecraft observed an increase in exospheric gases when the rain of meteoroid impacts increases during a stream. These interplanetary grains can hit the lunar surface at speeds exceeding 21 miles (34 kilometers) per second, releasing immense heat, and vaporizing part of the soil and meteoroids themselves. Within this vapor are sodium and potassium gases. LADEE's Ultraviolet Visible Spectrometer (UVS) instrument measured levels of sodium and potassium around the moon every 12 hours for more than five months. These frequent readings revealed a dynamic rise of gas levels in the exosphere as meteor streams bombarded the moon, with the concentrations of both elements returning to normal background levels after the stream passed. Interestingly, the time it took to return to \"normal\" was dramatically different for the two gases, with potassium returning to its pre-shower state within days, while sodium took several months.

Our moon, icy moons within our solar system, the planet Mercury, asteroids and even Pluto are examples of small bodies with known exospheres that start from their surface - surface-boundary exospheres.
