On the other end of the line was someone from the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the nation's fleet of spy satellites. They had some spare, unused \"hardware\" to get rid of. Was NASA interested? So when John Grunsfeld, the physicist and former astronaut, walked into his office a year later to start his new job as NASA's associate administrator for space science, he discovered that his potential armada was a bit bigger than he knew. Sitting in a room in upstate New York were two telescopes the same size as the famed Hubble Space Telescope, but built to point down at the Earth, instead of up at the heavens. NASA, struggling to get human space exploration moving again, had spent the previous year trying to figure out how good these telescopes were and what, if anything, they could be used for. Working with a small band of astronomers for the past couple of months, Dr. Grunsfeld, famous as the Hubble telescope's in-orbit repairman, has now come up with a plan, which was presented to the public on Monday at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. It is to turn one of the telescopes loose on the cosmos, pointing in its rightful direction, outward, to investigate the mysterious dark energy that is speeding up the universe's expansion. If the plan succeeds - and Congress, the Office of Management and Budget and the Academy of Sciences have yet to sign on - it could shave hundreds of millions of dollars and several years off a quest that many scientists say is the most fundamental of our time and that NASA had said it could not undertake until 2024 at the earliest. \"This is a total game changer,\" said David N. Spergel of Princeton, who is co-chairman of a committee on astronomy and astrophysics for the National Academy of Sciences, which sets priorities for NASA and other agencies. Alan Dressler, of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who reported to the Academy committee on the scientific potential of a mission with the NRO-1 telescope, as astronomers are calling it, said he was \"really excited.\" He told the gathering, \"I think this is a tremendous opportunity for this community.\" For now, the two telescopes and some spare parts are still in their clean room at ITT Exelis, in Rochester. Michael Moore, who, as NASA's acting deputy director for astrophysics, took the original call last year, has been to see the telescopes several times. He called their optics \"astounding.\" Dr. Grunsfeld described the telescopes as \"bits and pieces\" in various stages of assembly, lacking a camera and other accouterments, like solar panels or pointing controls, of a spacecraft. \"We can't say what they were used for,\" he said. A spokeswoman for the National Reconnaissance Office, Loretta Desio, said, \"This is not something we're going to talk about,\" adding, \"We're hoping this becomes a NASA story.\" The two telescopes have a 94-inch-diameter primary mirror, just like Hubble, but are shorter in focal length, giving them a wider field of view: \"Stubby Hubbles,\" in the words of Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, adding, \"They were clearly designed to look down.\" Dr. Grunsfeld said his first reaction was that the telescopes would be a distraction. \"We were getting something very expensive to handle and store,\" he said. This spring he asked a small group of astronomers if one of the telescopes could be used as they were to study dark energy. The answer, he said, was: \"Don't change a thing. It's perfect.\" Astronomers have lobbied for a space mission to investigate dark energy ever since observations of the exploding stars known as supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, the discovery that won three American astronomers the Nobel Prize. The fate of the universe, as well as the nature of physics, scientists say, depends on the nature of this dark energy. But a decade of wrangling between agencies and astronomers over money and technical specifications had resulted in no consensus on a mission until 2010, when a committee of the National Academy of Sciences that was charged with determining astronomical priorities cobbled together a plan that would do the trick. In its report, \"New Worlds, New Horizons,\" the committee gave that mission the highest priority in space science for the next decade. The $1.5-billion project was called Wfirst, for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Among its virtues was that it would search for exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system. But NASA, hobbled by mismanagement of the James Webb Space Telescope, has said that it will have no money to launch Wfirst until 2024 or later, if all goes well. But, given a green light and some money, a mission with the repurposed telescope could be started in 2020. But, Mr. Moore added, \"We have no money.\" Building the telescope can amount to a quarter to a half of the cost of a space astrophysics mission, astronomers said. Dr. Moore estimated that having it already could save the nation $250 million. It gets better. The telescope's short length means its camera could have the wide field of view necessary to inspect large areas of the sky for supernovae. Even bigger advantages come, astronomers say, from the fact that the telescope's diameter, 94 inches, is twice as big as that contemplated for Wfirst, giving it four times the light-gathering power, from which a whole host of savings cascade. Instead of requiring an expensive launch to a solar orbit, the telescope can operate in geosynchronous Earth orbit, complete its survey of the sky four times faster, and download data to the Earth faster. Equipped with a coronagraph, which blocks light from the sun's disk to look for exoplanets, another of Wfirst's goals, the former spy telescope could see planets down to the size of Jupiter around other stars. If it sounds almost too good to be true, it might be, cautioned Adam Riess, one of the three dark energy Nobelists, who noted that a thorough estimate of the new mission's costs had not been done yet. But still, he said, \"When someone hands you a hand-me-down like that, you have to be excited,\" Dr Riess said. \"They're not sitting around at Walmart.\" Dr. Grunsfeld said the repurposing of the telescope for dark energy came at a personal cost. He had long dreamed that the Hubble, which he and the other astronaut servicing teams had said goodbye to forever in 2009, might be visited again and upgraded one more time to do the dark energy work. That dream, he admitted, was now dead. \"If for half the cost, you could turn this into a telescope, why would you do that?\" he said.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190904165335/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/science/space/repurposed-telescope-may-explore-secrets-of-dark-energy.html"}, {"title": "Twin US Spy Telescopes Could Further American Astronomy", "date": "2012-10-04", "content": "In the cavernous area of Building 1230, located at the ITT Exelis facility in Rochester, New York, there are two 2.4-meter telescopes, each as big as the Hubble Space Telescope and never flown, sitting on low pedestals.

The NRO bequeathed the telescopes to NASA because they were no longer needed. A science-definition team will embark to assess if these telescopes can be used in some fashion. They will announce their findings by April 2013 to the NASA administrator Charles Bolden. The initial idea is to outfit them to study dark energy, the phenomenon thought to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe. The most likely first use of the NRO telescopes is as an alternative to the proposed Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), the top-ranked mission in the 2010 astronomy decadal survey. Before the gift was announced, astronomers were aiming for a wide-field 1.3 m survey telescope to search for the imprint of dark energy, search for exoplanets, and study star-forming regions in the Milky Way. WFIRST isn't expected to fly until the mid 2020s; but with a telescope already in hand, the NRO version of WFIRST could conceivably be launched before the end of the decade. The NRO telescopes have a much wider field of view than Hubble, which is why they are suited for the WFIRST mission. They are perfect for spotting the thousands of supernovae and millions of galaxies needed to pin down the exact nature of dark energy. Newly released data also shows that the mirror is roughly as good as Hubble's. The supporting structure is made up of resin that can resist distortions caused by temperature changes and will keep the main mirror stable. Astronomers plan on using active control of the secondary mirror to adjust for any distortions due in the main mirror, further sharpening the telescope's optics. The telescope was produced to capture very stable images, which is crucial to \"weak lensing,\" a dark-energy technique that looks for subtle distortions in the shapes of the galaxies due to intervening matter. The telescope won't be ideal to study the most distant galaxies in the Universe, which are only visible in the infrared, since that would require a new system to cool the mirror. However, unlike the WFIRST instrument, the NRO is designed to work at room temperature and its larger mirror will have so much more light-gathering power that it will be able to spot many more faint objects nearer to hand. Using the NRO telescopes, which are worth $250 million each, could be quite costly. A recent estimate put the total project cost at $1.75 billion, whereas the WFIRST mission was expected to cost $1.5 billion. To take advantage of the extra light-gathering capability of the NRO telescope, some astronomers would like to add a coronagraph.

That study, which laid out a blueprint for ground- and space-based astronomy and astrophysics for the decade of the 2010's, rated WFIRST as the top-priority large-scale mission. NASA's current plans call for WFIRST to perform an extraordinarily broad set of scientific investigations: studying the newly-discovered phenomenon of dark energy, measuring the history of cosmic acceleration, completing the exoplanet census begun by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope and demonstrating technology for direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets. By performing these investigations, WFIRST will address three central questions posed by NASA's astrophysics science plan: How does the universe work? How did we get here? Are we alone?

Coupled with a to-be-developed coronagraph instrument, the capabilities of WFIRST would now include the possibility of directly imaging exoplanets. \"It was a fortuitous series of events,\" Gagosian notes. The 2.4-meter telescope is known as the Astrophysics-Focused Telescope Assets (AFTA), and thus the current mission concept has been dubbed \"WFIRST-AFTA.\" Objects of interest: Exoplanet detection is revolutionizing planetary science. The count is on and quickly trending upward regarding the existence of planet populations beyond our own solar system. There are now nearly 2,000 confirmed planets orbiting other stars, many of these charted by NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft, Kepler. But what is the occurrence rate of Earth-like habitable planets, circling around Sun-like stars? Indeed, finding habitable zone rocky planets strongly influences the design of future space-based, direct detection missions geared to find exoplanets elsewhere. One core scientific objective of WFIRST is to detect planets using a technique called \"microlensing.\" This innovative technique infers the presence of planets by observing the way the gravity of the planets affects the refraction of starlight. This is different from the \"transit\" technique used by the Kepler Space Telescope, and therefore WFRST is expected to find planets that Kepler cannot detect. Using microlensing, WFIRST will search the cold, outer regions of planetary systems throughout the galaxy. Scientists expect to detect planets with masses from 0.1 Earth to 10,000 Earths. A large percentage of the planets likely found would be \"super-Earths,\" with masses about 10 times that of Earth. Damping out starlight: Microlensing is not the only exoplanet-hunting technique that WFIRST will use. The optical performance of the large AFTA telescope has allowed NASA to add a coronagraph for direct imaging of exoplanets and debris disks. Using the coronagraph, WFIRST is expected to collect images of planets in other solar systems, and to study the composition of these planets' atmospheres. Work on WFIRST-AFTA is leveraging mature technology for flight readiness while harnessing cost control measures. There is a great \"bang for the buck\" value proposition in the mission. Additionally, WFIRST-AFTA is designed to be robotically serviceable. The coronagraph works by very precisely blocking the starlight that would otherwise swamp out the evidence of planets circling their home star. \"You are talking about a parent star that is more than a billion times brighter than the planet that's orbiting it,\" says Gagosian. \"In the coronagraph, we need to send photons of light where we want them and get rid of the photons that we don't want.\" The coronagraph's imperative to damp out starlight is extremely challenging, making use of different masking technologies, in addition to a deformable mirror that is computer controlled. But if it performs as designed, WFIRST's coronagraphic instrument will collect images and characterize the atmospheres of super-Earth planets and Neptune-like planets around nearby Sun-like stars. Maturity levels: Feng Zhao of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, the lead for the WFIRST coronagraph, says that the technology investment in the instrument stems from NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the space agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) working together. The funding of the coronagraph for WFIRST matures direct imaging technologies for future space telescope designs now being contemplated. The ability to \"mature technology\" at NASA is gauged in terms of high technology readiness levels, or TRLs -- a type of measurement system used to assess the development stage of a particular technology. \"The WFIRST coronagraph is definitely demonstrating new technology ... and is a giant step forward,\" Zhao points out. Down-selected by specialists from a number of candidate ideas, the high-tech coronagraph work is ongoing, with milestones being met in a step-by-step fashion. \"The coronagraph instrument is considered a technology demonstration,\" Zhao says. \"It will pave the technology path for future missions. This is a golden time to work on this challenging technology,\" he adds. Development progress: Zhao says the gap between the current coronagraph state of the art and what will someday be needed to characterize a truly Earth-like planet is large. So the best way to close that gap is to fly an intermediate-performance coronagraph instrument such as the one on WFIRST-AFTA. As the first high-contrast stellar coronagraph in space, Zhao said the effort is maturing the coronagraph to TRL. There are nine milestones to track the technology development progress along the way, he explains, since formulation of the coronagraph in early 2014. \"We're making good progress and I'm very proud of the dedicated and hardworking team from JPL and many other institutions,\" Zhao adds.

WFIRST-AFTA will revolutionize our understanding of the expansion of the universe, the birth and evolution of galaxies and the formation and atmospheric composition of exoplanets. \"First and foremost, I see WFIRST as a tremendously promising mission that will help us understand the physics and origins of our universe,\" Gagosian explains. The observatory, he points out, is also a great opportunity to demonstrate a technology that may allow future missions to discover telltale signs of life outside our solar system. \"We're going to be proving the technologies and the techniques that will be employed later, perhaps on a bigger mission that's specifically oriented around that purpose,\" Gagosian observes.

Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, told astronomers attending the 227th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society here Jan. 4 that the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope will enter its \"formulation phase,\" the beginning of NASA's project management process, in February after the proposed space telescope passed a mission concept review in December. That decision also comes after the passage of the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill in December that provided $90 million for WFIRST, far above NASA's request of $14 million. The report accompanying the bill adopted language approved by Senate appropriators in June directing NASA to move WFIRST into the formulation phase by early 2016. The increase is not the first time Congress has added funding for WFIRST. In fiscal year 2015, NASA requested $14 million but Congress appropriated $50 million. In 2014, Congress provided $56 million for WFIRST. The intent of those increases was to accelerate a mission that astronomers identified as the highest priority large mission in their latest decadal survey, published in 2010. NASA had previously stated it did not expect to formally start the WFIRST project until fiscal year 2017, when spending on JWST was projected to decline as it neared its 2018 launch. \"The Committee has accelerated this key mission recommended by the decadal survey and expects it to achieve overlap and scientific synergy with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope,\" the Senate report stated in June. NASA has been using the additional funding to perform technology development work, including for the mission's two key instruments: a wide field camera and a coronagraph that can be used to directly observe extrasolar planets. That work, Hertz said, has gone well. \"We have made every one of our milestones on schedule so far,\" he said of that work. \"We're making fabulous progress in keeping on that plan that will enable us to do WFIRST in the shortest possible period.\" One scientist involved in WFIRST endorsed that approach. \"This is really a good way to do a big mission like this,\" said Neil Gehrels of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center during a Jan. 5 conference session about the mission. \"We can lower the risks and figure out the technologies before we get a large army developing the mission.\" The baseline plan for the mission calls for the use of one of the 2.4-meter mirrors provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office in 2012. The spacecraft will operate at the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point for a prime mission of at least six years. NASA will not provide an official cost and schedule estimate for WFIRST until later in the project's development. In an October presentation to a National Academies committee, members of the WFIRST team estimated the mission's cost to be $2 billion to $2.3 billion based on the current baseline design. A notional schedule in that presentation showed the mission ready for launch in August 2024. NASA's astrophysics division overall received $730 million in the 2016 omnibus spending bill, $41.5 million above the administration's request when changes in accounting for education programs are included. However, the increase in WFIRST, as well as requirements in the bill to fully fund the Hubble Space Telescope and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, mean a shortfall of $36 million for other astrophysics programs. \"We will be needing to make adjustments across the rest of the astrophysics portfolio to realize a savings of $36 million,\" Hertz said. Details about how those cuts will be implemented will be included in the agency's operating plan, which Hertz said should be completed in about a month.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasas-next-major-space-telescope-project-officially-starts-in-february/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "WFIRST-AFTA: Groundbreaking Space Observatory to Image Exoplanets and Tackle a Universe of Questions", "date": "2015-10-20", "content": "We all want the ability to peer into the future.

But what is the occurrence rate of Earth-like habitable planets, circling around Sun-like stars? Indeed, finding habitable zone rocky planets strongly influences the design of future space-based, direct detection missions geared to find exoplanets elsewhere. One core scientific objective of WFIRST is to detect planets using a technique called \"microlensing.\" This innovative technique infers the presence of planets by observing the way the gravity of the planets affects the refraction of starlight. This is different from the \"transit\" technique used by the Kepler Space Telescope, and therefore WFRST is expected to find planets that Kepler cannot detect. Using microlensing, WFIRST will search the cold, outer regions of planetary systems throughout the galaxy. Scientists expect to detect planets with masses from 0.1 Earth to 10,000 Earths. A large percentage of the planets likely found would be \"super-Earths,\" with masses about 10 times that of Earth. Damping out starlight: Microlensing is not the only exoplanet-hunting technique that WFIRST will use. The optical performance of the large AFTA telescope has allowed NASA to add a coronagraph for direct imaging of exoplanets and debris disks. Using the coronagraph, WFIRST is expected to collect images of planets in other solar systems, and to study the composition of these planets' atmospheres. Work on WFIRST-AFTA is leveraging mature technology for flight readiness while harnessing cost control measures. There is a great \"bang for the buck\" value proposition in the mission. Additionally, WFIRST-AFTA is designed to be robotically serviceable. The coronagraph works by very precisely blocking the starlight that would otherwise swamp out the evidence of planets circling their home star. \"You are talking about a parent star that is more than a billion times brighter than the planet that's orbiting it,\" says Gagosian. \"In the coronagraph, we need to send photons of light where we want them and get rid of the photons that we don't want.\" The coronagraph's imperative to damp out starlight is extremely challenging, making use of different masking technologies, in addition to a deformable mirror that is computer controlled. But if it performs as designed, WFIRST's coronagraphic instrument will collect images and characterize the atmospheres of super-Earth planets and Neptune-like planets around nearby Sun-like stars. Maturity levels: Feng Zhao of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, the lead for the WFIRST coronagraph, says that the technology investment in the instrument stems from NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the space agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) working together. The funding of the coronagraph for WFIRST matures direct imaging technologies for future space telescope designs now being contemplated. The ability to \"mature technology\" at NASA is gauged in terms of high technology readiness levels, or TRLs -- a type of measurement system used to assess the development stage of a particular technology. \"The WFIRST coronagraph is definitely demonstrating new technology ... and is a giant step forward,\" Zhao points out. Down-selected by specialists from a number of candidate ideas, the high-tech coronagraph work is ongoing, with milestones being met in a step-by-step fashion. \"The coronagraph instrument is considered a technology demonstration,\" Zhao says. \"It will pave the technology path for future missions. This is a golden time to work on this challenging technology,\" he adds. Development progress: Zhao says the gap between the current coronagraph state of the art and what will someday be needed to characterize a truly Earth-like planet is large. So the best way to close that gap is to fly an intermediate-performance coronagraph instrument such as the one on WFIRST-AFTA. As the first high-contrast stellar coronagraph in space, Zhao said the effort is maturing the coronagraph to TRL. There are nine milestones to track the technology development progress along the way, he explains, since formulation of the coronagraph in early 2014. \"We're making good progress and I'm very proud of the dedicated and hardworking team from JPL and many other institutions,\" Zhao adds. Technologies and techniques: \"I am very pleased about the potential of WFIRST-AFTA to give the scientific community and the public a bounty of new knowledge.\" Gagosian says. WFIRST-AFTA will revolutionize our understanding of the expansion of the universe, the birth and evolution of galaxies and the formation and atmospheric composition of exoplanets. \"First and foremost, I see WFIRST as a tremendously promising mission that will help us understand the physics and origins of our universe,\" Gagosian explains. The observatory, he points out, is also a great opportunity to demonstrate a technology that may allow future missions to discover telltale signs of life outside our solar system. \"We're going to be proving the technologies and the techniques that will be employed later, perhaps on a bigger mission that's specifically oriented around that purpose,\" Gagosian observes. WFIRST-AFTA permits risk reduction to take on technologies in the future, Gagosian says. \"It's our job here to make sure that investments in this project and those missions that follow provide the greatest benefit to humankind's knowledge of the universe,\" he concludes.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/wfirst-afta-groundbreaking-space-observatory-to-image-exoplanets-and-tackle-a-universe-of"}, {"title": "NASA's Next Major Space Telescope Project Officially Starts in February", "date": "2016-01-06", "content": "NASA's next flagship astronomy mission after the James Webb Space Telescope will become a formal project in February thanks to increased funding and direction from Congress, even as the agency looks to make cuts elsewhere in its astrophysics program. Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, told astronomers attending the 227th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society here Jan. 4 that the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope will enter its \"formulation phase,\" the beginning of NASA's project management process, in February after the proposed space telescope passed a mission concept review in December. That decision also comes after the passage of the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill in December that provided $90 million for WFIRST, far above NASA's request of $14 million. The report accompanying the bill adopted language approved by Senate appropriators in June directing NASA to move WFIRST into the formulation phase by early 2016. The increase is not the first time Congress has added funding for WFIRST. In fiscal year 2015, NASA requested $14 million but Congress appropriated $50 million. In 2014, Congress provided $56 million for WFIRST. The intent of those increases was to accelerate a mission that astronomers identified as the highest priority large mission in their latest decadal survey, published in 2010. NASA had previously stated it did not expect to formally start the WFIRST project until fiscal year 2017, when spending on JWST was projected to decline as it neared its 2018 launch. \"The Committee has accelerated this key mission recommended by the decadal survey and expects it to achieve overlap and scientific synergy with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope,\" the Senate report stated in June. NASA has been using the additional funding to perform technology development work, including for the mission's two key instruments: a wide field camera and a coronagraph that can be used to directly observe extrasolar planets. That work, Hertz said, has gone well. \"We have made every one of our milestones on schedule so far,\" he said of that work. \"We're making fabulous progress in keeping on that plan that will enable us to do WFIRST in the shortest possible period.\" One scientist involved in WFIRST endorsed that approach. \"This is really a good way to do a big mission like this,\" said Neil Gehrels of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center during a Jan. 5 conference session about the mission. \"We can lower the risks and figure out the technologies before we get a large army developing the mission.\" The baseline plan for the mission calls for the use of one of the 2.4-meter mirrors provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office in 2012. The spacecraft will operate at the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point for a prime mission of at least six years. NASA will not provide an official cost and schedule estimate for WFIRST until later in the project's development. In an October presentation to a National Academies committee, members of the WFIRST team estimated the mission's cost to be $2 billion to $2.3 billion based on the current baseline design. A notional schedule in that presentation showed the mission ready for launch in August 2024. NASA's astrophysics division overall received $730 million in the 2016 omnibus spending bill, $41.5 million above the administration's request when changes in accounting for education programs are included. However, the increase in WFIRST, as well as requirements in the bill to fully fund the Hubble Space Telescope and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, mean a shortfall of $36 million for other astrophysics programs. \"We will be needing to make adjustments across the rest of the astrophysics portfolio to realize a savings of $36 million,\" Hertz said.

The WFIRST-EXPO team will evaluate guest investigator and guest observer projects to help maximize the scientific return of the WFIRST cosmological surveys and realize the full power of the telescope for extragalactic astronomy. The team, one of a dozen WFIRST science investigation teams, will receive $2.3 million to perform these studies over the next five years. Robertson leads the team of 11 astronomers, including world-wide experts in designing and executing space-based extragalactic survey programs, multi- object spectroscopic campaigns in optical and infrared wavelengths, and theoretical modeling of galaxy formation, exotic supernovae, and cosmic reionization.

In addition to surveys of deep space beyond our galaxy, WFIRST's sensitivity and wide field of view will enable a large-scale search for exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of millions of stars in the crowded central region of our galaxy. The survey will net thousands of new exoplanets, complementing the work started by NASA's Kepler mission and the upcoming work of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Other wide-field surveys will enable astronomers to track how dark energy and dark matter have affected the expansion of the universe over the past 10 billion years or more. By measuring the distances to thousands of supernovae, astronomers can map in detail how cosmic expansion has increased with time. WFIRST can also precisely measure the shapes, positions and distances of millions of galaxies to track the distribution and growth of cosmic structures. Coronagraph: The Coronagraph Instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres. Comparing this data across many worlds will allow scientists to better understand the origin and physics of their atmospheres and to search for chemical signs of environments suitable for life. \"In addition to its exciting capabilities for dark energy and exoplanets, WFIRST will provide a treasure trove of exquisite data for all astronomers,\" said Neil Gehrels, the WFIRST Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This mission will survey the universe to find the most interesting objects out there.\" The James Webb Space Telescope, planned to launch in 2018, will see deeper into space and further back in time than WFIRST.

The telescope's Wide Field Instrument will give it the ability to capture a single image with the depth and quality of Hubble but covering 100 times Hubble's field of view. WFIRST will also carry a Coronagraph Instrument designed to block the glare of individual stars and reveal the faint light of planets orbiting around them. \"The design work is already well advanced, and it is a really impressive telescope,\" Robertson said. \"Its camera is about 200 times larger than Hubble's, and this capability will enable astronomers around the world to use WFIRST to explore the deepest reaches of space over an area thousands of times larger than the size of the moon on the sky.\" Guest investigators will be able to conduct their own investigations using data from the surveys, while guest observers can propose additional survey projects for the telescope. The WFIRST-EXPO team will evaluate guest investigator and guest observer projects to help maximize the scientific return of the WFIRST cosmological surveys and realize the full power of the telescope for extragalactic astronomy. The team, one of a dozen WFIRST science investigation teams, will receive $2.3 million to perform these studies over the next five years. Robertson leads the team of 11 astronomers, including world-wide experts in designing and executing space-based extragalactic survey programs, multi- object spectroscopic campaigns in optical and infrared wavelengths, and theoretical modeling of galaxy formation, exotic supernovae, and cosmic reionization. They include Piero Madau and Stan Woosley at UC Santa Cruz; Dan Marrone and Daniel Stark at the University of Arizona; Risa Wechsler at Stanford University; Jenny Greene at Princeton University; Steven Furlanetto and Alice Shapley at UCLA; Henry Ferguson at the Space Science Telescope Institute; and Mark Dickinson at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. In addition to surveys of deep space beyond our galaxy, WFIRST's sensitivity and wide field of view will enable a large-scale search for exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of millions of stars in the crowded central region of our galaxy. The survey will net thousands of new exoplanets, complementing the work started by NASA's Kepler mission and the upcoming work of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Other wide-field surveys will enable astronomers to track how dark energy and dark matter have affected the expansion of the universe over the past 10 billion years or more. By measuring the distances to thousands of supernovae, astronomers can map in detail how cosmic expansion has increased with time. WFIRST can also precisely measure the shapes, positions and distances of millions of galaxies to track the distribution and growth of cosmic structures. Coronagraph: The Coronagraph Instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres. Comparing this data across many worlds will allow scientists to better understand the origin and physics of their atmospheres and to search for chemical signs of environments suitable for life. \"In addition to its exciting capabilities for dark energy and exoplanets, WFIRST will provide a treasure trove of exquisite data for all astronomers,\" said Neil Gehrels, the WFIRST Project Scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This mission will survey the universe to find the most interesting objects out there.\" The James Webb Space Telescope, planned to launch in 2018, will see deeper into space and further back in time than WFIRST. With its larger mirror, JWST will be able to observe much fainter galaxies, but its field of view is much smaller. \"JWST will conduct very deep observations of a small area, while WFIRST will cover large areas at the same depth as Hubble,\" Robertson said. \"If they overlap and JWST is still operational when WFIRST launches, it will be a very powerful combination.\" WFIRST is slated to launch in the mid-2020s. The project is managed at Goddard, with participation by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, and a science team with members from U.S. research institutions across the country.

With a view 100 times bigger than that of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, WFIRST will aid researchers in their efforts to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the cosmos. It also will discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life. NASA's Agency Program Management Council, which evaluates the agency's programs and projects on content, risk management, and performance, made the decision to move forward with the mission on Wednesday. \"WFIRST has the potential to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe, much the same way Hubble has,\" said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington. \"This mission uniquely combines the ability to discover and characterize planets beyond our own solar system with the sensitivity and optics to look wide and deep into the universe in a quest to unravel the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter.\" WFIRST is the agency's next major astrophysics observatory, following the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018. The observatory will survey large regions of the sky in near-infrared light to answer fundamental questions about the structure and evolution of the universe, and expand our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system - known as exoplanets. It will carry a Wide Field Instrument for surveys, and a Coronagraph Instrument designed to block the glare of individual stars and reveal the faint light of planets orbiting around them. By blocking the light of the host star, the Coronagraph Instrument will enable detailed measurements of the chemical makeup of planetary atmospheres. Comparing these data across many worlds will allow scientists to better understand the origin and physics of these atmospheres, and search for chemical signs of environments suitable for life. \"WFIRST is designed to address science areas identified as top priorities by the astronomical community,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's Astrophysics Division in Washington. \"The Wide-Field Instrument will give the telescope the ability to capture a single image with the depth and quality of Hubble, but covering 100 times the area. The coronagraph will provide revolutionary science, capturing the faint, but direct images of distant gaseous worlds and super-Earths.\" The telescope's sensitivity and wide view will enable a large-scale search for exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of millions of stars in the crowded central region of our galaxy. The survey will net thousands of new exoplanets similar in size and distance from their star as those in our own solar system, complementing the work started by NASA's Kepler mission and the upcoming work of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Employing multiple techniques, astronomers also will use WFIRST to track how dark energy and dark matter have affected the evolution of our universe. Dark energy is a mysterious, negative pressure that has been speeding up the expansion of the universe. Dark matter is invisible material that makes up most of the matter in our universe. By measuring the distances of thousands of supernovae, astronomers can map in detail how cosmic expansion has increased with time. WFIRST also can precisely measure the shapes, positions and distances of millions of galaxies to track the distribution and growth of cosmic structures, including galaxy clusters and the dark matter accompanying them. \"In addition to its exciting capabilities for dark energy and exoplanets, WFIRST will provide a treasure trove of exquisite data for all astronomers,\" said Neil Gehrels, WFIRST project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This mission will survey the universe to find the most interesting objects out there.\" WFIRST is slated to launch in the mid-2020s.

Recently, the National Academies conducted a midterm assessment of NASA's progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2010 Decadal Survey. The Midterm Assessment Report recognized the continued compelling science value of WFIRST, finding that, \"WFIRST [is] an ambitious and powerful facility that will significantly advance the scientific program envisioned by [the Decadal Survey], from the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars to the physics of the accelerating universe.\" The agency initiated the WFIRST project in 2016, beginning the formulation phase of the mission. Recognizing that cost growth in the planned WFIRST project could impact the balance of projects and research investigations across NASA's astrophysics portfolio, the Midterm Assessment Report recommended that prior to proceeding to the next phase of the WFIRST project, \"NASA should commission an independent technical, management, and cost assessment of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, including a quantitative assessment of the incremental cost of the coronagraph.\" NASA conducted an analogous independent review of the James Webb Space Telescope, but conducted it later in its development lifetime. That review resulted in a replan of the Webb development project in 2011, and the Webb project has remained within the replan cost and schedule ever since. \"NASA is a learning organization,\" said Zurbuchen. \"We are applying lessons we learned from Webb on WFIRST. \"By conducting this review now, we can define the best way forward for this mission and the astrophysics community at large, in accordance with the academy guidance.\" The review panel members will be senior engineers, scientists, and project managers mostly from outside NASA who are independent of the WFIRST project. NASA will begin the review process after filling the review panel membership during the next few weeks.

An instrument assembly the company is developing, if selected by NASA for production, will be the core of the primary scientific instrument aboard the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), whose mission aims to uncover hundreds of millions more galaxies and reveal the physics that shapes them. Scientists and engineers recently began work developing the Wide-Field Optical-Mechanical Assembly (WOMA) for WFIRST, NASA's newest astrophysics telescope program. WOMA comprises the major portion of scientific components on one of two instruments on the telescope. NASA chose Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center (ATC) in Palo Alto to advance from an earlier study into the formulation phase. WOMA uses similar approaches to the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which the ATC built as the primary optical instrument for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. \"Lockheed Martin scientists achieved groundbreaking results with NIRCam's precision and sensitivity,\" said Jeff Vanden Beukel, WOMA program manager at Lockheed Martin. \"There's no time to lose as we support a fast-paced schedule, and our experience with NIRCam's precision optics positions our WOMA design to be capable, producible and on budget.\" Scientists and engineers are collaborating to design optical systems, mechanisms, structure, electronics and thermal control components. Similar to NIRCam, the Wide-Field Instrument on WFIRST will be a powerful optical payload. However, WFIRST will have a massive focal plane array, 200 times larger than NIRCam, to capture what some liken to panoramic images of the star field. In addition to dark energy research, WOMA will also use microlensing to complete the census of known exoplanets. Microlensing takes advantage of brief distortions in space to reveal new planets around distant stars, and WFIRST's wide field of view will allow scientists to monitor 200 million stars every 15 minutes for more than a year. When NASA launches WFIRST, it will work in concert with other observatories to jointly research new places and forces in our universe.

In tests conducted at the High-Contrast Imaging Testbed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, in Pasadena, California - one of the world's most advanced testbeds of its kind - researchers created what they call a region of very deep contrast between a simulated star and its planet. They also demonstrated the ability to detect and analyze the planet's faint light over a relatively large portion of the visible to near-infrared wavelength band. An instrument developed by scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies, or PISCES - played an important role in the demonstration, showing that it could separate light of one or more Jupiter-sized exoplanets by their wavelength (color) and record the data at every position around a star. To appreciate the researchers' milestone, it's important to understand the challenge itself. The light from these planets is exceedingly faint - fainter than their host stars by a factor of 100 million or more, and from our perspective on Earth, these planets appear quite close to their stars. With a conventional imaging camera, the planet's light is lost in the glare of the star. However, with a coronagraph - a device that suppresses the glare and creates a dark zone around a star - the faint light of an exoplanet can be revealed. Working in concert with the coronagraph, an integral field spectrograph, or IFS, such as PISCES, would be able to separate the exoplanet's light by its wavelength and record the data, revealing details about the planet's physical properties, including the chemical composition and structure of its atmosphere. During the test, the Goddard-JPL team maintained a very deep contrast over 18 percent of the coronagraph's wavelength band - a record that bodes well for future missions like WFIRST, which has baselined a coronagraph and an IFS-type instrument on the mission. (To put this in perspective, the human eye can see the full visible spectrum of colors, from blue to red, which corresponds to a 50 percent bandpass. In comparison, a laser pointer has one single color, which is much smaller than one percent.) \"Achieving a contrast this deep over such a broad band has never been done before and was one of our goals. Ideally, we would like to observe the entire spectrum of the planet - in other words, see all its colors at once - but that's not yet possible with current coronagraphic technologies. Eighteen percent, as demonstrated by PISCES, is the current state of the art,\" said Goddard scientist and PISCES Instrument Scientist Michael McElwain. In comparison, JPL's laboratory coronagraph maintained the same level of dark contrast over 10 percent of the optical-wavelength bands before the commissioning of the table-top PISCES last year. \"We are not done yet and are still trying to get to higher contrasts, but the 100 million-to-one over 18 percent of the optical wavelength band is an important and significant milestone,\" said Maxime Rizzo, a postdoctoral student who is working with McElwain and his team to advance PISCES. \"With the increased bandpass, we can get many colors at once. This enables us to identify more molecules in the atmospheres and get a big picture.\" PISCES, which McElwain developed with funding from Goddard's Internal Research and Development program and the prestigious Nancy Grace Roman Technology Fellowship, separates light a little differently than more traditional spectrographs. As an IFS-type device, PISCES takes a coronagraphic image and samples it with a micro-lens array made up of more than 5,800 tiny glass segments no larger than the width of three human hairs. The micro-lens creates an array of \"spots\" that is then dispersed by a prism and finally re-imaged onto a detector. In practice, each micro-lens, or lenslet, isolates a small portion of the coronagraphic image, creating micro-spectra for the light that passes through each tiny lenslet. The multiple spectra then are combined into a data cube that scientists analyze. The IFS provides all the wavelength information simultaneously across the entire field of view. With more traditional imaging observations, scientists must cycle through the different wavelengths, which takes time and requires a mechanism to change the filters - requirements not desirable with an orbiting observatory that only has limited time to spend on a target. The optical system itself changes over time due to thermal and dynamic variations, further underscoring the need for simultaneous spectral observations. \"That's why WFIRST planners baselined the IFS-type spectrograph in the first place,\" Rizzo said. \"In this case, PISCES offered information over a full 18 percent of the bandpass, instead of the traditional 10 percent that had been demonstrated at JPL without an IFS. PISCES showed that it could enable more science.\" Even though the team demonstrated the deep contrast over a greater portion of the visible to near-infrared bandpass, and in doing so, raised the technology's readiness level, work remains, said Avi Mandell, the WFIRST IFS project scientist. \"The success has opened up all new starlight-suppression ideas that we want to test.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-team-passes-major-technological-milestone-for-characterizing-exoplanets"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Announces Independent Review Panel Members for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "date": "2017-06-23", "content": "NASA has convened an independent, external technical, management and cost review of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) at the recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Eighteen percent, as demonstrated by PISCES, is the current state of the art,\" said Goddard scientist and PISCES Instrument Scientist Michael McElwain. In comparison, JPL's laboratory coronagraph maintained the same level of dark contrast over 10 percent of the optical-wavelength bands before the commissioning of the table-top PISCES last year. \"We are not done yet and are still trying to get to higher contrasts, but the 100 million-to-one over 18 percent of the optical wavelength band is an important and significant milestone,\" said Maxime Rizzo, a postdoctoral student who is working with McElwain and his team to advance PISCES. \"With the increased bandpass, we can get many colors at once. This enables us to identify more molecules in the atmospheres and get a big picture.\" PISCES, which McElwain developed with funding from Goddard's Internal Research and Development program and the prestigious Nancy Grace Roman Technology Fellowship, separates light a little differently than more traditional spectrographs. As an IFS-type device, PISCES takes a coronagraphic image and samples it with a micro-lens array made up of more than 5,800 tiny glass segments no larger than the width of three human hairs. The micro-lens creates an array of \"spots\" that is then dispersed by a prism and finally re-imaged onto a detector. In practice, each micro-lens, or lenslet, isolates a small portion of the coronagraphic image, creating micro-spectra for the light that passes through each tiny lenslet. The multiple spectra then are combined into a data cube that scientists analyze. The IFS provides all the wavelength information simultaneously across the entire field of view. With more traditional imaging observations, scientists must cycle through the different wavelengths, which takes time and requires a mechanism to change the filters - requirements not desirable with an orbiting observatory that only has limited time to spend on a target. The optical system itself changes over time due to thermal and dynamic variations, further underscoring the need for simultaneous spectral observations. \"That's why WFIRST planners baselined the IFS-type spectrograph in the first place,\" Rizzo said. \"In this case, PISCES offered information over a full 18 percent of the bandpass, instead of the traditional 10 percent that had been demonstrated at JPL without an IFS. PISCES showed that it could enable more science.\" Even though the team demonstrated the deep contrast over a greater portion of the visible to near-infrared bandpass, and in doing so, raised the technology's readiness level, work remains, said Avi Mandell, the WFIRST IFS project scientist. \"The success has opened up all new starlight-suppression ideas that we want to test.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-team-passes-major-technological-milestone-for-characterizing-exoplanets"}, {"title": "NASA Receives Findings from WFIRST Independent Review Team", "date": "2017-10-20", "content": "NASA has received the report (33 MB PDF) from an independent, external review of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) project.

In tests conducted at the High-Contrast Imaging Testbed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL, in Pasadena, California - one of the world's most advanced testbeds of its kind - researchers created what they call a region of very deep contrast between a simulated star and its planet. They also demonstrated the ability to detect and analyze the planet's faint light over a relatively large portion of the visible to near-infrared wavelength band. An instrument developed by scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies, or PISCES - played an important role in the demonstration, showing that it could separate light of one or more Jupiter-sized exoplanets by their wavelength (color) and record the data at every position around a star. To appreciate the researchers' milestone, it's important to understand the challenge itself. The light from these planets is exceedingly faint - fainter than their host stars by a factor of 100 million or more, and from our perspective on Earth, these planets appear quite close to their stars. With a conventional imaging camera, the planet's light is lost in the glare of the star. However, with a coronagraph - a device that suppresses the glare and creates a dark zone around a star - the faint light of an exoplanet can be revealed. Working in concert with the coronagraph, an integral field spectrograph, or IFS, such as PISCES, would be able to separate the exoplanet's light by its wavelength and record the data, revealing details about the planet's physical properties, including the chemical composition and structure of its atmosphere. During the test, the Goddard-JPL team maintained a very deep contrast over 18 percent of the coronagraph's wavelength band - a record that bodes well for future missions like WFIRST, which has baselined a coronagraph and an IFS-type instrument on the mission. (To put this in perspective, the human eye can see the full visible spectrum of colors, from blue to red, which corresponds to a 50 percent bandpass. In comparison, a laser pointer has one single color, which is much smaller than one percent.) \"Achieving a contrast this deep over such a broad band has never been done before and was one of our goals. Ideally, we would like to observe the entire spectrum of the planet - in other words, see all its colors at once - but that's not yet possible with current coronagraphic technologies.

Scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will function as Hubble's wide-eyed cousin. While just as sensitive as Hubble's cameras, WFIRST's 300-megapixel Wide Field Instrument will image a sky area 100 times larger. This means a single WFIRST image will hold the equivalent detail of 100 pictures from Hubble. \"A picture from Hubble is a nice poster on the wall, while a WFIRST image will cover the entire wall of your house,\" said David Spergel, co-chair of the WFIRST science working group and the Charles A. Young professor of astronomy at Princeton University in New Jersey. The mission's wide field of view will allow it to generate never-before-seen big pictures of the universe, which will help astronomers explore some of the greatest mysteries of the cosmos, including why the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating. One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained pressure that currently makes up 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may have been changing over the history of the universe. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. WFIRST will have the power to test both of these ideas. To learn more about dark energy, WFIRST will use its powerful 2.4-meter mirror and Wide Field Instrument to do two things: map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos and measure how the universe has expanded over time. In the process, the mission will study galaxies across cosmic time, from the present back to when the universe was only half a billion years old, or about 4 percent of its current age. \"To understand how the universe evolved from a hot, uniform gas into stars, planets, and people, we need to study the beginnings of that process by looking at the early days of the universe,\" said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"We've learned much from other wide-area surveys, but WFIRST's will be the most sensitive and give us our farthest look back in time.\" WFIRST will do this through multiple observational strategies, including surveys of exploding stars called supernovae and galaxy clusters, and mapping out the distribution of galaxies in three dimensions. Measuring the brightness and distances of supernovae provided the first evidence for the presence of dark energy. WFIRST will extend these studies to greater distances to measure how dark energy's influence increased over time. WFIRST will measure precise distances to galaxy clusters to map how they grew over time. The mission will also pinpoint the distances to millions of galaxies by measuring how their light becomes redder at greater distances, a phenomenon called redshift. The farther off a galaxy is, the redder its light appears when we see it. Mapping out the 3-D positions of galaxies will allow astronomers to measure how the distribution of galaxies has changed over time, providing another measure of how dark energy has affected the cosmos. The Wide Field Instrument will also allow WFIRST to measure the matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon dictated by Einstein's relativity theory. Massive objects like galaxies curve space-time in a way that bends light passing near them, creating a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Using this magnifying glass effect, called weak gravitational lensing, WFIRST will paint a broad picture of how matter is structured throughout the universe, allowing scientists to put the governing physics of its assembly to the ultimate test. WFIRST can use this same light-bending phenomenon to study planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets. In a process called microlensing, a foreground star in our galaxy acts as the lens. When its motion randomly aligns with a distant background star, the lens magnifies, brightens and distorts the background star. As the lensing star drifts along in its orbit around the galaxy and the the alignment shifts, so does the apparent brightness of the star. The precise pattern of these changes can reveal planets orbiting the lensing star because the planets themselves serve as miniature gravitational lenses. Such alignments must be precise and last only hours. WFIRST's microlensing survey will monitor 100 million stars for hundreds of days and is expected to find about 2,500 planets, with significant numbers of rocky planets in and beyond the region where liquid water may exist. This planet-detection method is sensitive enough to find planets smaller than Mars, and will reveal planets orbiting their host stars at distances ranging from closer than Venus to beyond Pluto. These results will make WFIRST an ideal companion to missions like NASA's Kepler and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which are best suited to find larger planets orbiting closer to their host stars. Together, discoveries from these three missions will help complete the census of planets beyond our solar system, helping us learn how planets form and migrate into systems like our own. The combined data from these missions provide insight into planets in the critical area known as the habitable zone, the orbiting distance from a host star that would permit a planet's surface to harbor liquid water - and potentially life. WFIRST will also feature a coronagraph technology demonstration instrument designed to directly image exoplanets by blocking out a star's light, allowing the much fainter planets to be observed. As NASA's first advanced coronagraph in space, it will be 1,000 times more capable than any previously flown. This is a key step toward future direct imaging missions that will study truly Earth-like planets discovered nearby. The instrument will be able to image gas giant planets orbiting mature Sun-like stars, allowing scientists to study them in ways that haven't been possible before. Scientists are hoping to use the coronagraph to determine important properties about these planets, such as their atmospheric composition. WFIRST will serve as an important tool for the science community through its General Observer and archival data analysis programs. All WFIRST data will be publicly available immediately after processing and delivery to the archive. Also, by submitting proposals through the competitive program, scientists around the world will be able to use the observatory to study the cosmos in their own way, from the nearest exoplanets out to clusters of distant galaxies. The mission will complement other missions expected to operate in the next decade, notably the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019. Webb provides a detailed look at rare and interesting objects, while WFIRST will take a wide look at the universe. WFIRST will also complement new ground-based observatories such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) currently in development. By combining data from WFIRST and LSST, scientists will be able to view the universe in nine different wavelengths, data that will provide the most detailed wide-angle view of the universe to date. By pioneering an array of innovative technologies, WFIRST will serve as a multipurpose mission, furnishing a big picture of the universe and helping us answer some of the most profound questions in astrophysics, such as how the universe evolved into what we see today, its ultimate fate and whether we are alone. \"By building this telescope we're enabling a wealth of science and the capability to address those kinds of questions,\" Spergel said. \"It's deeply interesting not only to scientists, but anyone who looks up at the sky and wonders.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-s-next-major-telescope-to-see-the-big-picture-of-the-universe"}, {"title": "NASA's new telescope to see big picture of universe", "date": "2017-12-27", "content": "NASA is planning to launch a next-generation space telescope that will provide the largest picture of the universe ever seen, with the same depth and clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.

Rieke is co-chair of the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics, which monitors how the decadal survey's priorities are being implement by funding agencies. The WFIRST mission has steadily grown beyond its initial projected funding window, which prompted NASA to initiate an independent review of the project to find out why costs were swelling. Based on the findings of that review panel, in October the agency directed the mission planners to come up with a way to keep the mission within a lifetime-cost budget of $3.2 billion. The results of that evaluation are expected to be presented to NASA leadership in March. Jon Morse, former director of NASA's astrophysics division, told Space.com that the NASA science mission directorate \"would not have given programmatic direction to the WFIRST project last fall if SMD were planning to cancel the mission; this appears to have been dictated from outside the agency.\" Morse, now CEO of the BoldlyGo Institute, headed NASA's astrophysics division from 2007 to 2011, during the development of the WFIRST mission concept. He also served as a senior policy analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 2006 to 2007. The White House budget provides a $400 million overall increase in NASA's budget, but a $165 million cut for astrophysics. Planning numbers for WFIRST requested $302 million for the 2019 fiscal year, and upward of $400 million each year through 2022.

Across many metrics and departments, it was a bloodbath, gutting about $50 billion from agencies focused on science, health, food, arts, humanities, the environment, and education, among many others. But among the reductions was one murderous stroke to NASA: the elimination its flagship mission of the coming decade, WFIRST. The Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope was chosen by NASA to be the single most important astrophysics mission of the 2020s, and has been in the early planning stages for nearly 20 years. Countless astronomers and astrophysicists have spend their entire professional lives working to make this mission happen, and teach us things we'll never know, otherwise, about the Universe. Cancelling it is a decision that must be revoked, or NASA will cease to be the leading science and space agency for planet Earth. There are three major parts to NASA as an agency: Science, which encompasses the four major research area NASA is responsible for: astrophysics, planetary science, Earth science, and the study of the Sun. Exploration, which includes the development of exploration systems, research and development, and public/private partnerships within the commercial sector. And Space Operations, which focuses on astronauts and human-based activity in space, including spaceflight support, the International Space Station, and crewed experiments. Other components of NASA include aeronautics, space technology, education, as well as the construction, maintenance, operation, and management of both space centers and the agency. While it's disastrous for the agency to consider the loss of five of its Earth science missions and the elimination of its office of education, the loss of WFIRST would be an incomparable disaster for the agency. In short, it would declare that NASA no longer will be actively participating in furthering the development of science in these four arenas. If that seems like a bit of a bold declaration to you, you need to understand how NASA works, and what its purposes are. When most people think of NASA, they think of this: a literal moonshot. They think about a massive investment in new technologies, including rocketry, crewed spaceflight, exploration, and discovery. This may have been an accurate portrayal of NASA in the 1960s and early 1970s, but since the end of the Apollo program some 45 years ago, this is no longer what NASA looks like. The reason why NASA no longer looks like this is because we stopped investing in it. What was once a small fraction of NASA's budget is now all that's left. In its heyday, NASA made up nearly 5% of the federal budget. Today, it makes up less than 0.4%. What we're talking about cutting are already mere table scraps compared to what our once-thriving space program used to be. Despite these constraints and the enormous pressure to do so much with so little, NASA has remained synonymous with cutting-edge science and exploration of the great cosmic unknowns. Internally, the Science Mission Directorate, which oversees all four branches of NASA's science endeavors, has prioritized four different types of mission: Small missions: focused on a narrow problem in a particular discipline, these higher-risk, limited-budget missions are cost-effective ways to solve or address a scientific problem within the astrophysics community. An example is NASA's NICER mission, a small instrument launched to operate on board the ISS, tracking neutron stars and measuring their timing, interiors, and other properties. Medium missions: focusing on a larger problem with a mid-size budget, these missions are lower-risk and are focused on serving a wide swath of the science community, often providing the majority of data for a particular sub-field. NASA's TESS mission, launching next month, is a great example of a mid-size mission to serve the exoplanet community. Large missions: only low-risk, high-priority missions can be found here. A stunning example of the incredibly rich science that can come back from such a mission is NASA's New Horizons, which flew by Pluto in 2015 and is headed onto its next target, after teaching us more about Kuiper belt objects than we'd ever imagined we'd learn. Flagship missions: these are civilization-scale science missions of national or global importance. These missions are both the most expensive and the most rewarding, in terms of science and societal impact, of anything NASA does. The Hubble Space Telescope is the most well-known example of a flagship missions, having forever changed how we view the Universe. According to Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate of NASA: What we learn from these flagship missions is why we study the Universe. This is civilization-scale science... If we don't do this, we aren't NASA. This was a statement he made just last month at NASA's Town Hall at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting. WFIRST was selected as the #1 overall mission for the 2020s back in 2010; it's a mission that takes approximately 15 years to design, contract, execute, build, deliver, and launch. In terms of science, it planned to primarily serve a number of major communities within astronomy and astrophysics: supernova research, extragalactic astronomers, exoplanet researchers, studies of the galactic center, and wide-field studies that focus on gravitational lensing and properties of the cosmic web. The way it's poised to do this is by taking a telescope that's similar in optical properties to Hubble, but by outfitting it with all-new instruments optimized for a wide-field view of the Universe. Instead of being limited to a narrow slice of the Universe, WFIRST could image it just as deeply as Hubble, except 60 times as quickly. The \"WF\" stands for Wide-Field for a reason; the amount of Universe it can image is huge! And as a result, the amount we can learn about the Universe is huge as well. Some of our greatest existential questions would be answered by WFIRST. How does dark energy behave, for example? Does it evolve over time? Is it uniform in all directions? Do the results from supernovae, the cosmic web, and extragalactic signals all point to the same set of properties? WFIRST would answer all of these questions as no other mission, past, present, or even proposed, would be capable of. In 2010, the National Research Council's Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey made WFIRST the top priority recommendation in the large space mission category. They also made a recommendation that they add on significant capabilities for exoplanet studies, including a state-of-the-art coronagraph, and those are being implemented. By monitoring a large sample of stars in the Milky Way's center, WFIRST will allow us to detect, via subtle changes in brightness, the presence of exoplanets that NASA's Kepler could never have seen. We will learn how common Earth-like planets are around a wide variety of stars and over a very large range of orbital parameters. In addition, like all such flagship missions, including Hubble and James Webb, there will be a guest observer program. Not only will research in galactic, extragalactic, exoplanet, gravitational lensing, baryon acoustic oscillation and supernova sub-fields be considered, but any astrophysical topic that could take advantage of WFIRST's unique capabilities can propose. This is poised to be the leading observatory for a wide slew of purposes for not just a few years, but - like Hubble - potentially for decades. It was the top choice out of all the missions that the entire astronomy and astrophysics community proposed. It represented a huge effort in collaboration between groups with widely disparate interests and passions, and allowed cosmologists and exoplanet scientists to work together on putting together a mission that these non-overlapping communities could both benefit from. It included the possibility of a starshade, which would enable planet-finding and measurement to an unprecedented level.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/02/20/cancelling-wfirst-will-permanently-ruin-nasa/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Next Major Telescope to See the Big Picture of the Universe", "date": "2017-12-22", "content": "NASA is beginning to design its next big astrophysics mission, a space telescope that will provide the largest picture of the universe ever seen with the same depth and clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope. Scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will function as Hubble's wide-eyed cousin. While just as sensitive as Hubble's cameras, WFIRST's 300-megapixel Wide Field Instrument will image a sky area 100 times larger. This means a single WFIRST image will hold the equivalent detail of 100 pictures from Hubble. \"A picture from Hubble is a nice poster on the wall, while a WFIRST image will cover the entire wall of your house,\" said David Spergel, co-chair of the WFIRST science working group and the Charles A. Young professor of astronomy at Princeton University in New Jersey. The mission's wide field of view will allow it to generate never-before-seen big pictures of the universe, which will help astronomers explore some of the greatest mysteries of the cosmos, including why the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating. One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained pressure that currently makes up 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may have been changing over the history of the universe. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. WFIRST will have the power to test both of these ideas. To learn more about dark energy, WFIRST will use its powerful 2.4-meter mirror and Wide Field Instrument to do two things: map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos and measure how the universe has expanded over time. In the process, the mission will study galaxies across cosmic time, from the present back to when the universe was only half a billion years old, or about 4 percent of its current age. \"To understand how the universe evolved from a hot, uniform gas into stars, planets, and people, we need to study the beginnings of that process by looking at the early days of the universe,\" said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"We've learned much from other wide-area surveys, but WFIRST's will be the most sensitive and give us our farthest look back in time.\" WFIRST will do this through multiple observational strategies, including surveys of exploding stars called supernovae and galaxy clusters, and mapping out the distribution of galaxies in three dimensions. Measuring the brightness and distances of supernovae provided the first evidence for the presence of dark energy. WFIRST will extend these studies to greater distances to measure how dark energy's influence increased over time. WFIRST will measure precise distances to galaxy clusters to map how they grew over time. The mission will also pinpoint the distances to millions of galaxies by measuring how their light becomes redder at greater distances, a phenomenon called redshift. The farther off a galaxy is, the redder its light appears when we see it. Mapping out the 3-D positions of galaxies will allow astronomers to measure how the distribution of galaxies has changed over time, providing another measure of how dark energy has affected the cosmos. The Wide Field Instrument will also allow WFIRST to measure the matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon dictated by Einstein's relativity theory. Massive objects like galaxies curve space-time in a way that bends light passing near them, creating a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Using this magnifying glass effect, called weak gravitational lensing, WFIRST will paint a broad picture of how matter is structured throughout the universe, allowing scientists to put the governing physics of its assembly to the ultimate test. WFIRST can use this same light-bending phenomenon to study planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets. In a process called microlensing, a foreground star in our galaxy acts as the lens. When its motion randomly aligns with a distant background star, the lens magnifies, brightens and distorts the background star. As the lensing star drifts along in its orbit around the galaxy and the the alignment shifts, so does the apparent brightness of the star. The precise pattern of these changes can reveal planets orbiting the lensing star because the planets themselves serve as miniature gravitational lenses. Such alignments must be precise and last only hours. WFIRST's microlensing survey will monitor 100 million stars for hundreds of days and is expected to find about 2,500 planets, with significant numbers of rocky planets in and beyond the region where liquid water may exist. This planet-detection method is sensitive enough to find planets smaller than Mars, and will reveal planets orbiting their host stars at distances ranging from closer than Venus to beyond Pluto. These results will make WFIRST an ideal companion to missions like NASA's Kepler and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which are best suited to find larger planets orbiting closer to their host stars. Together, discoveries from these three missions will help complete the census of planets beyond our solar system, helping us learn how planets form and migrate into systems like our own. The combined data from these missions provide insight into planets in the critical area known as the habitable zone, the orbiting distance from a host star that would permit a planet's surface to harbor liquid water - and potentially life. WFIRST will also feature a coronagraph technology demonstration instrument designed to directly image exoplanets by blocking out a star's light, allowing the much fainter planets to be observed. As NASA's first advanced coronagraph in space, it will be 1,000 times more capable than any previously flown. This is a key step toward future direct imaging missions that will study truly Earth-like planets discovered nearby. The instrument will be able to image gas giant planets orbiting mature Sun-like stars, allowing scientists to study them in ways that haven't been possible before. Scientists are hoping to use the coronagraph to determine important properties about these planets, such as their atmospheric composition. WFIRST will serve as an important tool for the science community through its General Observer and archival data analysis programs. All WFIRST data will be publicly available immediately after processing and delivery to the archive. Also, by submitting proposals through the competitive program, scientists around the world will be able to use the observatory to study the cosmos in their own way, from the nearest exoplanets out to clusters of distant galaxies. The mission will complement other missions expected to operate in the next decade, notably the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019. Webb provides a detailed look at rare and interesting objects, while WFIRST will take a wide look at the universe. WFIRST will also complement new ground-based observatories such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) currently in development. By combining data from WFIRST and LSST, scientists will be able to view the universe in nine different wavelengths, data that will provide the most detailed wide-angle view of the universe to date. By pioneering an array of innovative technologies, WFIRST will serve as a multipurpose mission, furnishing a big picture of the universe and helping us answer some of the most profound questions in astrophysics, such as how the universe evolved into what we see today, its ultimate fate and whether we are alone. \"By building this telescope we're enabling a wealth of science and the capability to address those kinds of questions,\" Spergel said. \"It's deeply interesting not only to scientists, but anyone who looks up at the sky and wonders.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-s-next-major-telescope-to-see-the-big-picture-of-the-universe"}, {"title": "NASA's new telescope to see big picture of universe", "date": "2017-12-27", "content": "NASA is planning to launch a next-generation space telescope that will provide the largest picture of the universe ever seen, with the same depth and clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.

Cancelling it is a decision that must be revoked, or NASA will cease to be the leading science and space agency for planet Earth. There are three major parts to NASA as an agency: Science, which encompasses the four major research area NASA is responsible for: astrophysics, planetary science, Earth science, and the study of the Sun. Exploration, which includes the development of exploration systems, research and development, and public/private partnerships within the commercial sector. And Space Operations, which focuses on astronauts and human-based activity in space, including spaceflight support, the International Space Station, and crewed experiments. Other components of NASA include aeronautics, space technology, education, as well as the construction, maintenance, operation, and management of both space centers and the agency. While it's disastrous for the agency to consider the loss of five of its Earth science missions and the elimination of its office of education, the loss of WFIRST would be an incomparable disaster for the agency. In short, it would declare that NASA no longer will be actively participating in furthering the development of science in these four arenas. If that seems like a bit of a bold declaration to you, you need to understand how NASA works, and what its purposes are. When most people think of NASA, they think of this: a literal moonshot. They think about a massive investment in new technologies, including rocketry, crewed spaceflight, exploration, and discovery. This may have been an accurate portrayal of NASA in the 1960s and early 1970s, but since the end of the Apollo program some 45 years ago, this is no longer what NASA looks like. The reason why NASA no longer looks like this is because we stopped investing in it. What was once a small fraction of NASA's budget is now all that's left. In its heyday, NASA made up nearly 5% of the federal budget. Today, it makes up less than 0.4%. What we're talking about cutting are already mere table scraps compared to what our once-thriving space program used to be. Despite these constraints and the enormous pressure to do so much with so little, NASA has remained synonymous with cutting-edge science and exploration of the great cosmic unknowns. Internally, the Science Mission Directorate, which oversees all four branches of NASA's science endeavors, has prioritized four different types of mission: Small missions: focused on a narrow problem in a particular discipline, these higher-risk, limited-budget missions are cost-effective ways to solve or address a scientific problem within the astrophysics community. An example is NASA's NICER mission, a small instrument launched to operate on board the ISS, tracking neutron stars and measuring their timing, interiors, and other properties. Medium missions: focusing on a larger problem with a mid-size budget, these missions are lower-risk and are focused on serving a wide swath of the science community, often providing the majority of data for a particular sub-field. NASA's TESS mission, launching next month, is a great example of a mid-size mission to serve the exoplanet community. Large missions: only low-risk, high-priority missions can be found here. A stunning example of the incredibly rich science that can come back from such a mission is NASA's New Horizons, which flew by Pluto in 2015 and is headed onto its next target, after teaching us more about Kuiper belt objects than we'd ever imagined we'd learn. Flagship missions: these are civilization-scale science missions of national or global importance. These missions are both the most expensive and the most rewarding, in terms of science and societal impact, of anything NASA does. The Hubble Space Telescope is the most well-known example of a flagship missions, having forever changed how we view the Universe. According to Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate of NASA: What we learn from these flagship missions is why we study the Universe. This is civilization-scale science... If we don't do this, we aren't NASA. This was a statement he made just last month at NASA's Town Hall at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting. WFIRST was selected as the #1 overall mission for the 2020s back in 2010; it's a mission that takes approximately 15 years to design, contract, execute, build, deliver, and launch. In terms of science, it planned to primarily serve a number of major communities within astronomy and astrophysics: supernova research, extragalactic astronomers, exoplanet researchers, studies of the galactic center, and wide-field studies that focus on gravitational lensing and properties of the cosmic web. The way it's poised to do this is by taking a telescope that's similar in optical properties to Hubble, but by outfitting it with all-new instruments optimized for a wide-field view of the Universe. Instead of being limited to a narrow slice of the Universe, WFIRST could image it just as deeply as Hubble, except 60 times as quickly. The \"WF\" stands for Wide-Field for a reason; the amount of Universe it can image is huge! And as a result, the amount we can learn about the Universe is huge as well. Some of our greatest existential questions would be answered by WFIRST. How does dark energy behave, for example? Does it evolve over time? Is it uniform in all directions? Do the results from supernovae, the cosmic web, and extragalactic signals all point to the same set of properties? WFIRST would answer all of these questions as no other mission, past, present, or even proposed, would be capable of. In 2010, the National Research Council's Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey made WFIRST the top priority recommendation in the large space mission category. They also made a recommendation that they add on significant capabilities for exoplanet studies, including a state-of-the-art coronagraph, and those are being implemented. By monitoring a large sample of stars in the Milky Way's center, WFIRST will allow us to detect, via subtle changes in brightness, the presence of exoplanets that NASA's Kepler could never have seen. We will learn how common Earth-like planets are around a wide variety of stars and over a very large range of orbital parameters. In addition, like all such flagship missions, including Hubble and James Webb, there will be a guest observer program. Not only will research in galactic, extragalactic, exoplanet, gravitational lensing, baryon acoustic oscillation and supernova sub-fields be considered, but any astrophysical topic that could take advantage of WFIRST's unique capabilities can propose. This is poised to be the leading observatory for a wide slew of purposes for not just a few years, but - like Hubble - potentially for decades. It was the top choice out of all the missions that the entire astronomy and astrophysics community proposed. It represented a huge effort in collaboration between groups with widely disparate interests and passions, and allowed cosmologists and exoplanet scientists to work together on putting together a mission that these non-overlapping communities could both benefit from. It included the possibility of a starshade, which would enable planet-finding and measurement to an unprecedented level.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/02/20/cancelling-wfirst-will-permanently-ruin-nasa/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA may lose a major space telescope and space station funding", "date": "2018-02-12", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope would seek out dark matter signals NASA One of NASA's planned space telescopes is on the chopping block. President Trump just released his budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, and despite an overall increase of about $370 million over its 2018 budget, NASA is facing potential cuts. Among those are five Earth science missions, the agency's education office, and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Satellites for the Earth science missions were slated for elimination in last year's budget negotiations, though they ultimately remained funded. The WFIRST telescope, planned for launch in the mid-2020s, is intended to observe large areas of the sky to examine how dark matter and dark energy affect the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It also has instruments to find and take images of planets around other stars. Advertisement An independent review committee found the telescope couldn't be built with its original $2 billion budget, and would require significantly more money or major design changes. WFIRST has been competing for funding with the planet-hunting James Webb Space Telescope, which is cited as a reason for the cancellation. \"Developing another large space telescope immediately after completing the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope is not a priority for the Administration,\" the budget request stated. This proposal also includes plans to end NASA funding for the International Space Station in 2025, with a possibility of handing over its operation to commercial firms.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160964-nasa-may-lose-a-major-space-telescope-and-space-station-funding/"}, {"title": "Astronomers Will Fight to Save WFIRST Space Telescope from Being Axed", "date": "2018-02-15", "content": "Leaders of the American Astronomical Society released a statement today denouncing the proposed cancellation of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope in the White House budget proposal that was released this week. The AAS leadership also expressed its intention to rally support for the mission in Congress, where the final fiscal year 2019 budget will have to be approved. \"We cannot accept termination of WFIRST, which was the highest-priority space- astronomy mission in the most recent decadal survey,\" AAS President-elect Megan Donahue said in a statement from the society. \"And the proposed 10% reduction in NASA's astrophysics budget, amounting to nearly $1 billion over the next five years, will cripple US astronomy.\" The AAS is the \"major organization of professional astronomers in North America,\" according to the society's website, with a membership of about 7,000 people. On Twitter and in various news publications, individual scientists have already voiced their dismay at the mission's proposed cancellation, and the impact it would have on U.S. astrophysics. WFIRST would be NASA's next \"flagship\" mission, which refers to large missions with a wide range of science capabilities. It would follow missions like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in 2019. Its primary science objectives would be in the areas of cosmology, star and planet formation, and studies of planets around other stars. A significant portion of time would also be reserved for scientists to use the observatory for studies outside those topics. WFIRST received top ranking in the 2010 decadal survey, titled \" New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics .\" The decadal survey is a community-led report organized by the National Academies every 10 years that provides a roadmap for which missions or mission topics should be pursued by the community and supported by funding agencies. Compiling the report is a multiyear process that captures input from astronomers in various subfields as well as from funding agencies such as NASA and the National Science Foundation. \"These efforts to achieve community consensus on research priorities are vital to ensuring the maximum return on public and private investments in the astronomical sciences,\" AAS Executive Officer Kevin B. Marvel said in the statement. \"The cancellation of WFIRST would set a dangerous precedent and severely weaken a decadal-survey process that has established collective scientific priorities for a world-leading program for a half century. Such a move would also sacrifice US leadership in space-based dark energy, exoplanet, and survey astrophysics. We cannot allow such drastic damage to the field of astronomy, the impacts of which would be felt for more than a generation.\" The call to cancel WFIRST could be interpreted as a warning to the mission managers to keep the cost of the program on track, according to Marcia Rieke, an astronomy professor at the University of Arizona and the Seward Observatory, who spoke with Space.com for this article about what the WFIRST cancellation could mean for U.S. astrophysics. Rieke is co-chair of the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics, which monitors how the decadal survey's priorities are being implement by funding agencies. The WFIRST mission has steadily grown beyond its initial projected funding window, which prompted NASA to initiate an independent review of the project to find out why costs were swelling. Based on the findings of that review panel, in October the agency directed the mission planners to come up with a way to keep the mission within a lifetime-cost budget of $3.2 billion. The results of that evaluation are expected to be presented to NASA leadership in March. Jon Morse, former director of NASA's astrophysics division, told Space.com that the NASA science mission directorate \"would not have given programmatic direction to the WFIRST project last fall if SMD were planning to cancel the mission; this appears to have been dictated from outside the agency.\" Morse, now CEO of the BoldlyGo Institute, headed NASA's astrophysics division from 2007 to 2011, during the development of the WFIRST mission concept. He also served as a senior policy analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 2006 to 2007. The White House budget provides a $400 million overall increase in NASA's budget, but a $165 million cut for astrophysics. Planning numbers for WFIRST requested $302 million for the 2019 fiscal year, and upward of $400 million each year through 2022. If WFIRST is canceled, it will absorb the overall cut to astrophysics and leave about $137 million for other astrophysics research. But Morse told Space.com the proposed use of WFIRST funds to absorb the overall cut to astrophysics, \"steals the JWST budget wedge from Astrophysics for 'other agency priorities'; an outrageous proposal that kills the top priority in the astrophysics decadal survey and undermines future U.S. leadership in space astrophysics.\" Since 2008, NASA's astrophysics division's budget has been consistently below what it was in 2008, with the steepest reduction occurring in 2010. Meanwhile, every other science division has seen an overall rise in budgets, compared with 2008 levels. In the last three years, the astrophysics division has almost returned to 2008 levels, but the proposed FY19 budget would be a 15 percent reduction, compared with 2008. \"The community should make clear that WFIRST is crucial to future space astrophysics research and is entirely affordable if Astrophysics were provided the same kind of budgetary resources that other disciplines are receiving,\" Morse said. \"The Astrophysics budget should be $1.6 billion per year, not going backwards!\" It appears the AAS leadership is preparing to fight to save the mission. \"We look forward to working with Congress to restore funding for WFIRST and for NASA astrophysics overall,\" Donahue said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/39714-aas-responds-wfirst-proposed-cancellation.html"}, {"title": "Cancelling WFIRST Will Permanently Ruin NASA", "date": "2018-02-20", "content": "Last week, the White House released their plans for the 2018 fiscal year budget.

What is WFIRST? Short for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, WFIRST is a space telescope currently under development by NASA. It's been designed to research three key areas: exoplanets, dark matter/dark energy, and the formation of stars and planets. Unlike the space telescopes currently being proposed for launch in the mid-2030s, HabEx, Origins and Lynx, WFIRST is a relatively modest design. It will have the same size of mirror as Hubble at 2.4m, but add a number of incredible improvements that will help it spot exoplanets and probe the Universe in infrared, neither of which Hubble can do. How is WFIRST different to Hubble? A wide-angle lens on WFIRST will give it 100x the field of view of Hubble, essentially enabling it to map the Milky Way and other galaxies 100 times faster than Hubble. \"We want to know what kind of planetary systems there are,\" said Matthew Penny, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher in the Ohio State Department of Astronomy. \"To do that, you need to not just look where the obvious, easy things are. You need to look at everything.\" WFIRST will do that by conducting sensitive near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, essentially probing the 'invisible Universe'. How will WFIRST find exoplanets? Firstly, it will photograph them. WFIRST will be fitted with a coronagraph, an instrument that blocks out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects can be seen. Small, Earth-like planets orbiting close to their host stars should become visible, though the planets WFIRST is likely to find will be further from their stars than most planets found to date, according to Penny. The Kepler Space Telescope that found more than 2,600 planets outside our solar system, but ran out of fuel in October 2018. \"Kepler began the search by looking for planets that orbit their stars closer than the Earth is to our Sun,\" said Penny. \"WFIRST will complete it by finding planets with larger orbits.\" Secondly, to find planets orbiting stars thousands of light-years away from Earth WFIRST will use gravitational microlensing, a technique that relies on the gravity of stars and planets to bend and magnify the light coming from stars that pass behind them, from the telescope's point of view. Crucially, Penny's study predicts that WFIRST will find 100 exoplanets that could have the same or lower mass as Earth. \"WFIRST will allow us to find types of planets that we haven't seen before now,\" said Penny. NASA began its initial planning of WFIRST in May 2018, and it's due for launch in the mid-2020s.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2019/02/26/the-nasa-space-telescope-the-trump-administration-tried-to-kill-will-find-1400-new-planets/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Awards Optical Telescope Assembly for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope Mission", "date": "2018-12-01", "content": "NASA has awarded a contract to Harris Corporation of Rochester, New York, for the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) for the agency's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission.

A wide-angle lens on WFIRST will give it 100x the field of view of Hubble, essentially enabling it to map the Milky Way and other galaxies 100 times faster than Hubble. \"We want to know what kind of planetary systems there are,\" said Matthew Penny, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher in the Ohio State Department of Astronomy. \"To do that, you need to not just look where the obvious, easy things are. You need to look at everything.\" WFIRST will do that by conducting sensitive near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, essentially probing the 'invisible Universe'. How will WFIRST find exoplanets? Firstly, it will photograph them. WFIRST will be fitted with a coronagraph, an instrument that blocks out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects can be seen. Small, Earth-like planets orbiting close to their host stars should become visible, though the planets WFIRST is likely to find will be further from their stars than most planets found to date, according to Penny. The Kepler Space Telescope that found more than 2,600 planets outside our solar system, but ran out of fuel in October 2018. \"Kepler began the search by looking for planets that orbit their stars closer than the Earth is to our Sun,\" said Penny. \"WFIRST will complete it by finding planets with larger orbits.\" Secondly, to find planets orbiting stars thousands of light-years away from Earth WFIRST will use gravitational microlensing, a technique that relies on the gravity of stars and planets to bend and magnify the light coming from stars that pass behind them, from the telescope's point of view. Crucially, Penny's study predicts that WFIRST will find 100 exoplanets that could have the same or lower mass as Earth. \"WFIRST will allow us to find types of planets that we haven't seen before now,\" said Penny.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October.

What is WFIRST? Short for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, WFIRST is a space telescope currently under development by NASA. It's been designed to research three key areas: exoplanets, dark matter/dark energy, and the formation of stars and planets.

This is just one mystery NASA's forthcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission will tackle as it explores the distant cosmos. The spacecraft's giant camera, the Wide Field Instrument (WFI), will be fundamental to this exploration. The WFI has just passed its preliminary design review, an important milestone for the mission. It means the WFI successfully met the design, schedule and budget requirements to advance to the next phase of development, where the team will begin detailed design and fabrication of the flight hardware. \"This was an outstanding preliminary design review, providing a snapshot of the tremendous amount of engineering this team has accomplished in a short period of time,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The WFI team is well on their way down the path of building a world-class instrument for NASA's next great observatory.\" \"The preliminary design review is a vital step in the mission because it takes the engineering ideas and assesses them against stringent criteria to make sure they will perform as planned,\" said Goddard's Mary Walker, instrument manager for the WFI. \"This is where we find the things we need to tweak so WFIRST can advance to the next stage in its journey.\" Engineers will feed the results of the review into the next design iteration, preparing the instrument for an even more rigorous test - the critical design review, currently planned for June 2020. This will involve data from WFI engineering test units in simulated space environments, including testing at cryogenic temperatures. WFIRST is a next-generation space telescope that will survey the infrared universe from beyond the orbit of the Moon. Its two instruments are a technology demonstration called a coronagraph, and the WFI. The WFI features the same angular resolution as Hubble but with 100 times the field of view. Data it gathers will enable scientists to discover new and uniquely detailed information about planetary systems around other stars. The WFI will also map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos, which should ultimately allow scientists to discover the fate of the universe. The WFI is designed to detect faint infrared light from across the universe. Infrared light is observed at wavelengths longer than the human eye can detect. The expansion of the universe stretches light emitted by distant galaxies, causing visible or ultraviolet light to appear as infrared by the time it reaches us. Such distant galaxies are difficult to observe from the ground because Earth's atmosphere blocks some infrared wavelengths, and the upper atmosphere glows brightly enough to overwhelm light from these distant galaxies. By going into space and using a Hubble-size telescope, the WFI will be sensitive enough to detect infrared light from farther than any previous telescope. This will help scientists capture a new view of the universe that could help solve some of its biggest mysteries, one of which is how the universe became the way it is now. The WFI will allow scientists to peer very far back in time. Seeing the universe in its early stages will help scientists unravel how it expanded throughout its history. This will illuminate how the cosmos developed to its present condition, enabling scientists to predict how it will continue to evolve. \"We're going to try to discover the fate of the universe,\" said Goddard's Jeff Kruk, the WFIRST project scientist. \"The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and one of the things the Wide Field Instrument will help us figure out is if the acceleration is increasing or slowing down.\" One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained phenomenon that currently makes up about 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may be changing as the universe evolves. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. The WFI will test these ideas by measuring matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon called weak gravitational lensing. Massive objects like galaxies and clusters of galaxies curve space-time, bending the path traveled by light that passes nearby. This creates a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Viewing those distant galaxies will show how matter is structured throughout the universe and across time. All of the astronomical surveys that WFIRST will conduct rely on the WFI. An extremely stable optical structure is necessary to make the high-precision measurements with both the WFI and the coronagraph. Further ensuring stability, WFIRST will orbit the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2. At this special location over 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, gravitational forces balance to keep objects in steady orbits with very little assistance. The thermal stability of an observatory at L2 will provide a ten-fold improvement beyond Hubble in much of the data the WFI will gather. This degree of stability is impractical with observatories in low-Earth orbit, such as Hubble. With its large field of view, the WFI will provide a wealth of information in each image it takes. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to gather data, allowing scientists to conduct research that would otherwise be impractical. \"You could do most of the WFIRST science with Hubble, but it might take a thousand years,\" said Kruk. \"We don't want to wait that long.\" With the successful completion of the WFI's preliminary design review, the WFIRST mission is on target for its planned launch in the mid-2020s. Scientists will soon be able to explore some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos thanks to the WFI's wide field of view and precision optics.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/main-instrument-for-nasa-s-wfirst-mission-completes-milestone-review"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Trump budget has no room for the telescope that could find distant alien life", "date": "2019-03-13", "content": "For the second time in the past two years, the Trump administration has proposed canceling a planned space telescope that could help us search for life on distant exoplanets, unlock the mysteries of dark energy and explain the universe's other persistent puzzles.

But in 2018, Congress ultimately restored funding for Wfirst in the final budget that NASA is currently operating under, and which the President just recently signed into law. So, for now, the future of Wfirst remains in legislative limbo until Capitol Hill and the White House hash out a final budget. \"The cancellation of Wfirst would set a dangerous precedent and severely weaken a decadal-survey process that has established collective scientific priorities for a world-leading program for a half century,\" AAS executive officer Kevin Marvel said at the time in a release. \"We cannot allow such drastic damage to the field of astronomy, the impacts of which would be felt for more than a generation.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/trump-budget-meet-the-next-gen-space-telescope-the-president-wants-dead/"}, {"title": "WFIRST faces funding crunch", "date": "2019-03-28", "content": "A NASA astrophysics mission that avoided cancellation last year could still face budget problems if it evades another termination threat this year, agency officials warned this week. NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October. That would be followed by Key Decision Point C and formal mission confirmation, he said. \"It would be good to get the required funding to pull that off.\"", "url": "https://spacenews.com/wfirst-faces-funding-crunch/"}, {"title": "Main Instrument for NASA's WFIRST Mission Completes Milestone Review", "date": "2019-06-26", "content": "In order to know how the universe will end, we must know what has happened to it so far. This is just one mystery NASA's forthcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission will tackle as it explores the distant cosmos. The spacecraft's giant camera, the Wide Field Instrument (WFI), will be fundamental to this exploration. The WFI has just passed its preliminary design review, an important milestone for the mission. It means the WFI successfully met the design, schedule and budget requirements to advance to the next phase of development, where the team will begin detailed design and fabrication of the flight hardware. \"This was an outstanding preliminary design review, providing a snapshot of the tremendous amount of engineering this team has accomplished in a short period of time,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The WFI team is well on their way down the path of building a world-class instrument for NASA's next great observatory.\" \"The preliminary design review is a vital step in the mission because it takes the engineering ideas and assesses them against stringent criteria to make sure they will perform as planned,\" said Goddard's Mary Walker, instrument manager for the WFI. \"This is where we find the things we need to tweak so WFIRST can advance to the next stage in its journey.\" Engineers will feed the results of the review into the next design iteration, preparing the instrument for an even more rigorous test - the critical design review, currently planned for June 2020. This will involve data from WFI engineering test units in simulated space environments, including testing at cryogenic temperatures. WFIRST is a next-generation space telescope that will survey the infrared universe from beyond the orbit of the Moon. Its two instruments are a technology demonstration called a coronagraph, and the WFI. The WFI features the same angular resolution as Hubble but with 100 times the field of view. Data it gathers will enable scientists to discover new and uniquely detailed information about planetary systems around other stars. The WFI will also map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos, which should ultimately allow scientists to discover the fate of the universe. The WFI is designed to detect faint infrared light from across the universe. Infrared light is observed at wavelengths longer than the human eye can detect. The expansion of the universe stretches light emitted by distant galaxies, causing visible or ultraviolet light to appear as infrared by the time it reaches us. Such distant galaxies are difficult to observe from the ground because Earth's atmosphere blocks some infrared wavelengths, and the upper atmosphere glows brightly enough to overwhelm light from these distant galaxies. By going into space and using a Hubble-size telescope, the WFI will be sensitive enough to detect infrared light from farther than any previous telescope. This will help scientists capture a new view of the universe that could help solve some of its biggest mysteries, one of which is how the universe became the way it is now. The WFI will allow scientists to peer very far back in time. Seeing the universe in its early stages will help scientists unravel how it expanded throughout its history. This will illuminate how the cosmos developed to its present condition, enabling scientists to predict how it will continue to evolve. \"We're going to try to discover the fate of the universe,\" said Goddard's Jeff Kruk, the WFIRST project scientist. \"The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and one of the things the Wide Field Instrument will help us figure out is if the acceleration is increasing or slowing down.\" One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained phenomenon that currently makes up about 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may be changing as the universe evolves. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. The WFI will test these ideas by measuring matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon called weak gravitational lensing. Massive objects like galaxies and clusters of galaxies curve space-time, bending the path traveled by light that passes nearby. This creates a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Viewing those distant galaxies will show how matter is structured throughout the universe and across time. All of the astronomical surveys that WFIRST will conduct rely on the WFI. An extremely stable optical structure is necessary to make the high-precision measurements with both the WFI and the coronagraph. Further ensuring stability, WFIRST will orbit the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2. At this special location over 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, gravitational forces balance to keep objects in steady orbits with very little assistance. The thermal stability of an observatory at L2 will provide a ten-fold improvement beyond Hubble in much of the data the WFI will gather. This degree of stability is impractical with observatories in low-Earth orbit, such as Hubble. With its large field of view, the WFI will provide a wealth of information in each image it takes. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to gather data, allowing scientists to conduct research that would otherwise be impractical. \"You could do most of the WFIRST science with Hubble, but it might take a thousand years,\" said Kruk. \"We don't want to wait that long.\" With the successful completion of the WFI's preliminary design review, the WFIRST mission is on target for its planned launch in the mid-2020s. Scientists will soon be able to explore some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos thanks to the WFI's wide field of view and precision optics.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/main-instrument-for-nasa-s-wfirst-mission-completes-milestone-review"}, {"title": "Telescope for NASA's WFIRST Mission Advances to New Phase of Development", "date": "2019-08-28", "content": "The telescope for WFIRST has successfully passed its preliminary design review, a major milestone for the mission.

Whatever its nature, dark energy may hold the key to understanding the fate of the cosmos. In addition, the WFI will survey our own galaxy to further our understanding of what planets orbit other stars, using the telescope's ability to sense both smaller planets and more distant planets than any survey before (planets orbiting stars beyond our Sun are called \"exoplanets\"). This survey will help determine whether our solar system is common, unusual, or nearly unique in the galaxy.

Normally, that glare is overwhelming, blotting out any chance of seeing planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, said Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. A star's photons - particles of light - vastly overpower any light coming from an orbiting planet when they hit the telescope. \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet,\" Rhodes said. And WFIRST's coronagraph just completed a major milestone: a preliminary design review by NASA. That means the instrument has met all design, schedule and budget requirements, and can now proceed to the next phase: building hardware that will fly in space. It's one of a series of such reviews examining every facet of the mission, said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Every one of these reviews is comprehensive,\" Kruk said. \"We go over all aspects of the mission, to show that everything hangs together.\" The WFIRST mission's coronagraph is meant to demonstrate the power of increasingly advanced technology. As it captures light directly from large, gaseous exoplanets, and from disks of dust and gas surrounding other stars, it will point the way to technologies for even larger space telescopes. Future telescopes with even more sophisticated coronagraphs will be able to generate single pixel \"images\" of rocky planets the size of Earth. Then the light can be spread into a rainbow called a \"spectrum,\" revealing which gases are present in the planet's atmosphere - perhaps oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, and maybe even signs of life. \"With WFIRST we'll be able to get images and spectra of these large planets, with the goal of proving technologies that will be used in a future mission - to eventually look at small rocky planets that could have liquid water on their surfaces, or even signs of life, like our own,\" Rhodes said. In this way, WFIRST is a kind of pioneer. That's why NASA considers the coronagraph to be a \"technology demonstration.\" While it is likely to generate important scientific discoveries, its main job is to prove to the scientific community that complex coronagraphs really can work in space. \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown,\" Rhodes said. Why This Coronagraph Is Different: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit since 1990, is so far the only NASA astrophysics flagship mission to include coronagraphs - far simpler and less sophisticated versions than will fly on WFIRST. But by the time it launches in the mid 2020s, WFIRST will be the third such mission to include coronagraph technology. NASA's massive James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2021, will include a coronagraph with a sharpness of vision greater than Hubble's, but without the starlight suppression capability of WFIRST. \"WFIRST should be two or three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other coronagraph ever flown\" in its ability to distinguish a planet from its star, Rhodes said. \"There should be a chance for some really compelling science, even though it's just a tech demo.\" The two flexible mirrors inside the coronagraph are key components. As light that has traveled tens of light-years from an exoplanet enters the telescope, thousands of actuators move like pistons, changing the shape of the mirrors in real time. The flexing of these \"deformable mirrors\" compensates for tiny flaws and changes in the telescope's optics. Changes on the mirrors' surfaces are so precise they can compensate for errors smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. These mirrors, in tandem with high-tech \"masks,\" another major advance, squelch the star's diffraction - the bending of light waves around the edges of light-blocking elements inside the coronagraph. The result: blinding starlight is sharply dimmed, and faintly glowing, previously hidden planets appear. The star-dimming technology also could deliver the clearest-ever images of distant star systems' formative years - when they are still swaddled in disks of dust and gas as infant planets take shape inside. \"The debris disks we see today around other stars are brighter and more massive than what we have in our own solar system,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and instrument technologist for the WFIRST coronagraph. \"WFIRST's coronagraph instrument could study fainter, more diffuse disk material that's more like the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and other dust orbiting the Sun.\" That could yield deep insights into how our solar system formed. Kruk said the instrument's deformable mirrors and other advanced technology - known as \"active wavefront control\" - should mean a leap of 100 to 1,000 times the capability of previous coronagraphs. \"When you see an opportunity like this to really open new frontiers in a new field, you can't help but be excited by that,\" he said. Once the coronagraph technology is successfully demonstrated over the mission's first 18 months, WFIRST's coronagraph could become open to the scientific community. A \"Participating Scientist Program\" would invite a broader variety of observers to conduct experiments beyond the demonstration phase. The coronagraph's advancement through the design review milestone is part of a development schedule now moving at a fast clip. A giant camera that will also fly on the spacecraft, called the Wide-Field Instrument, cleared the same hurdle in June. It is considered the space telescope's main instrument. Rhodes likes to compare WFIRST to the history-making Mars Pathfinder mission. After landing on the Red Planet in 1997, the Pathfinder lander unleashed a small rover, named Sojourner, to trundle on its own around the landing site and examine nearby rocks. \"That was a tech demo,\" Rhodes said. \"The goal was to show that a rover works on Mars. But it went on to do some very interesting science during its lifetime. So we're hopeful the same is going to be true of WFIRST's coronagraph tech demo.\"", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1601/wfirst-space-telescope-fitted-for-starglasses/"}, {"title": "NASA's WFIRST Space Telescope Will Don Futuristic Sunglasses", "date": "2019-09-26", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a space observatory, currently in development by NASA for exoplanet detection and dark energy research.

This is just one mystery NASA's forthcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission will tackle as it explores the distant cosmos. The spacecraft's giant camera, the Wide Field Instrument (WFI), will be fundamental to this exploration. The WFI has just passed its preliminary design review, an important milestone for the mission. It means the WFI successfully met the design, schedule and budget requirements to advance to the next phase of development, where the team will begin detailed design and fabrication of the flight hardware. \"This was an outstanding preliminary design review, providing a snapshot of the tremendous amount of engineering this team has accomplished in a short period of time,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The WFI team is well on their way down the path of building a world-class instrument for NASA's next great observatory.\" \"The preliminary design review is a vital step in the mission because it takes the engineering ideas and assesses them against stringent criteria to make sure they will perform as planned,\" said Goddard's Mary Walker, instrument manager for the WFI. \"This is where we find the things we need to tweak so WFIRST can advance to the next stage in its journey.\" Engineers will feed the results of the review into the next design iteration, preparing the instrument for an even more rigorous test - the critical design review, currently planned for June 2020. This will involve data from WFI engineering test units in simulated space environments, including testing at cryogenic temperatures. WFIRST is a next-generation space telescope that will survey the infrared universe from beyond the orbit of the Moon. Its two instruments are a technology demonstration called a coronagraph, and the WFI. The WFI features the same angular resolution as Hubble but with 100 times the field of view. Data it gathers will enable scientists to discover new and uniquely detailed information about planetary systems around other stars. The WFI will also map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos, which should ultimately allow scientists to discover the fate of the universe. The WFI is designed to detect faint infrared light from across the universe. Infrared light is observed at wavelengths longer than the human eye can detect. The expansion of the universe stretches light emitted by distant galaxies, causing visible or ultraviolet light to appear as infrared by the time it reaches us. Such distant galaxies are difficult to observe from the ground because Earth's atmosphere blocks some infrared wavelengths, and the upper atmosphere glows brightly enough to overwhelm light from these distant galaxies. By going into space and using a Hubble-size telescope, the WFI will be sensitive enough to detect infrared light from farther than any previous telescope. This will help scientists capture a new view of the universe that could help solve some of its biggest mysteries, one of which is how the universe became the way it is now. The WFI will allow scientists to peer very far back in time. Seeing the universe in its early stages will help scientists unravel how it expanded throughout its history. This will illuminate how the cosmos developed to its present condition, enabling scientists to predict how it will continue to evolve. \"We're going to try to discover the fate of the universe,\" said Goddard's Jeff Kruk, the WFIRST project scientist. \"The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and one of the things the Wide Field Instrument will help us figure out is if the acceleration is increasing or slowing down.\" One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained phenomenon that currently makes up about 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may be changing as the universe evolves. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. The WFI will test these ideas by measuring matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon called weak gravitational lensing. Massive objects like galaxies and clusters of galaxies curve space-time, bending the path traveled by light that passes nearby. This creates a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Viewing those distant galaxies will show how matter is structured throughout the universe and across time. All of the astronomical surveys that WFIRST will conduct rely on the WFI. An extremely stable optical structure is necessary to make the high-precision measurements with both the WFI and the coronagraph. Further ensuring stability, WFIRST will orbit the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2. At this special location over 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, gravitational forces balance to keep objects in steady orbits with very little assistance. The thermal stability of an observatory at L2 will provide a ten-fold improvement beyond Hubble in much of the data the WFI will gather. This degree of stability is impractical with observatories in low-Earth orbit, such as Hubble. With its large field of view, the WFI will provide a wealth of information in each image it takes. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to gather data, allowing scientists to conduct research that would otherwise be impractical. \"You could do most of the WFIRST science with Hubble, but it might take a thousand years,\" said Kruk. \"We don't want to wait that long.\" With the successful completion of the WFI's preliminary design review, the WFIRST mission is on target for its planned launch in the mid-2020s. Scientists will soon be able to explore some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos thanks to the WFI's wide field of view and precision optics.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/main-instrument-for-nasa-s-wfirst-mission-completes-milestone-review"}, {"title": "Telescope for NASA's WFIRST Mission Advances to New Phase of Development", "date": "2019-08-28", "content": "The telescope for WFIRST has successfully passed its preliminary design review, a major milestone for the mission.

Each individual has helped ensure the telescope is technically sound, safe, and capable of carrying out compelling science,\" said Scott Smith, WFIRST telescope manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"It's exciting to picture our new telescope out in space, exploring the universe, and we look forward to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.\" WFIRST is leveraging existing hardware that was transferred to NASA, and the development is much further along at this point than it would be if the telescope had originated with WFIRST. While many of the inherited components are being modified or reconfigured to function as part of the final design, the telescope is already at a very advanced stage of design. WFIRST is a high-precision survey mission that will advance our understanding of fundamental physics. WFIRST is similar to other space telescopes, like Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope, in that it will detect infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes. Earth's atmosphere absorbs infrared light, which presents challenges for observatories on the ground. WFIRST has the advantage of flying in space, above the atmosphere. The WFIRST telescope will collect and focus light using a primary mirror that is 2.4 meters in diameter. While it's the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror, it is only one-fourth the weight, showcasing an impressive improvement in telescope technology. The mirror gathers light and sends it on to a pair of science instruments. The spacecraft's giant camera, the Wide Field Instrument (WFI), will enable astronomers to map the presence of mysterious dark matter, which is known only through its gravitational effects on normal matter. The WFI will also help scientists investigate the equally mysterious \"dark energy,\" which causes the universe's expansion to accelerate. Whatever its nature, dark energy may hold the key to understanding the fate of the cosmos. In addition, the WFI will survey our own galaxy to further our understanding of what planets orbit other stars, using the telescope's ability to sense both smaller planets and more distant planets than any survey before (planets orbiting stars beyond our Sun are called \"exoplanets\"). This survey will help determine whether our solar system is common, unusual, or nearly unique in the galaxy. The WFI will have the same resolution as Hubble, yet has a field of view that is 100 times greater, combining excellent image quality with the power to conduct large surveys that would take Hubble hundreds of years to complete. WFIRST's Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will directly image exoplanets by blocking out the light of their host stars. To date, astronomers have directly imaged only a small fraction of exoplanets, so WFIRST's advanced techniques will expand our inventory and enable us to learn more about them. Results from the CGI will provide the first opportunity to observe and characterize exoplanets similar to those in our solar system, located between three and 10 times Earth's distance from the Sun, or from about midway to Jupiter to about the distance of Saturn in our solar system. Studying the physical properties of exoplanets that are more similar to Earth will take us a step closer to discovering habitable planets. \"The science enabled by our telescope is extraordinary,\" said Goddard's Jeff Kruk, the WFIRST project scientist. \"We are asking, 'what is the fate of the universe?' by looking at how the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and we are asking, 'are we alone?' by looking for exoplanets in neighboring planetary systems.\" \"WFIRST will set out to address lofty questions and it is amazing to see our team come together with a robust technical solution to explore them,\" said Smith. \"I am grateful for all of our partners across the country that have contributed to mature this development, and I look forward to our future investigations in space with NASA's next flagship mission.\" The team at Harris Corporation in Rochester, New York, the prime contractor for the telescope, is making significant strides in modifying the preexisting hardware for the spacecraft. \"Both mirrors are actively being shaped to the unique optical requirements of the telescope,\" said Bill Gattle, president of Space Systems for L3Harris Technologies (Harris Corporation merged with L3 Technologies in July). \"We're very excited to be contributing to this world-class observatory and the groundbreaking science it will deliver.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/telescope-for-nasa-s-wfirst-mission-advances-to-new-phase-of-development"}, {"title": "WFIRST telescope passes preliminary design review", "date": "2019-08-30", "content": "On schedule to launch in the mid-2020s, NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope mission will help uncover some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October.

This is just one mystery NASA's forthcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission will tackle as it explores the distant cosmos. The spacecraft's giant camera, the Wide Field Instrument (WFI), will be fundamental to this exploration. The WFI has just passed its preliminary design review, an important milestone for the mission. It means the WFI successfully met the design, schedule and budget requirements to advance to the next phase of development, where the team will begin detailed design and fabrication of the flight hardware. \"This was an outstanding preliminary design review, providing a snapshot of the tremendous amount of engineering this team has accomplished in a short period of time,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The WFI team is well on their way down the path of building a world-class instrument for NASA's next great observatory.\" \"The preliminary design review is a vital step in the mission because it takes the engineering ideas and assesses them against stringent criteria to make sure they will perform as planned,\" said Goddard's Mary Walker, instrument manager for the WFI. \"This is where we find the things we need to tweak so WFIRST can advance to the next stage in its journey.\" Engineers will feed the results of the review into the next design iteration, preparing the instrument for an even more rigorous test - the critical design review, currently planned for June 2020. This will involve data from WFI engineering test units in simulated space environments, including testing at cryogenic temperatures. WFIRST is a next-generation space telescope that will survey the infrared universe from beyond the orbit of the Moon. Its two instruments are a technology demonstration called a coronagraph, and the WFI. The WFI features the same angular resolution as Hubble but with 100 times the field of view. Data it gathers will enable scientists to discover new and uniquely detailed information about planetary systems around other stars. The WFI will also map how matter is structured and distributed throughout the cosmos, which should ultimately allow scientists to discover the fate of the universe. The WFI is designed to detect faint infrared light from across the universe. Infrared light is observed at wavelengths longer than the human eye can detect. The expansion of the universe stretches light emitted by distant galaxies, causing visible or ultraviolet light to appear as infrared by the time it reaches us. Such distant galaxies are difficult to observe from the ground because Earth's atmosphere blocks some infrared wavelengths, and the upper atmosphere glows brightly enough to overwhelm light from these distant galaxies. By going into space and using a Hubble-size telescope, the WFI will be sensitive enough to detect infrared light from farther than any previous telescope. This will help scientists capture a new view of the universe that could help solve some of its biggest mysteries, one of which is how the universe became the way it is now. The WFI will allow scientists to peer very far back in time. Seeing the universe in its early stages will help scientists unravel how it expanded throughout its history. This will illuminate how the cosmos developed to its present condition, enabling scientists to predict how it will continue to evolve. \"We're going to try to discover the fate of the universe,\" said Goddard's Jeff Kruk, the WFIRST project scientist. \"The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and one of the things the Wide Field Instrument will help us figure out is if the acceleration is increasing or slowing down.\" One possible explanation for this speed-up is dark energy, an unexplained phenomenon that currently makes up about 68 percent of the total content of the cosmos and may be changing as the universe evolves. Another possibility is that this apparent cosmic acceleration points to the breakdown of Einstein's general theory of relativity across large swaths of the universe. The WFI will test these ideas by measuring matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon called weak gravitational lensing. Massive objects like galaxies and clusters of galaxies curve space-time, bending the path traveled by light that passes nearby. This creates a distorted, magnified view of far-off galaxies behind them. Viewing those distant galaxies will show how matter is structured throughout the universe and across time. All of the astronomical surveys that WFIRST will conduct rely on the WFI. An extremely stable optical structure is necessary to make the high-precision measurements with both the WFI and the coronagraph. Further ensuring stability, WFIRST will orbit the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2. At this special location over 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, gravitational forces balance to keep objects in steady orbits with very little assistance. The thermal stability of an observatory at L2 will provide a ten-fold improvement beyond Hubble in much of the data the WFI will gather. This degree of stability is impractical with observatories in low-Earth orbit, such as Hubble. With its large field of view, the WFI will provide a wealth of information in each image it takes. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to gather data, allowing scientists to conduct research that would otherwise be impractical. \"You could do most of the WFIRST science with Hubble, but it might take a thousand years,\" said Kruk. \"We don't want to wait that long.\" With the successful completion of the WFI's preliminary design review, the WFIRST mission is on target for its planned launch in the mid-2020s. Scientists will soon be able to explore some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos thanks to the WFI's wide field of view and precision optics.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/main-instrument-for-nasa-s-wfirst-mission-completes-milestone-review"}, {"title": "Telescope for NASA's WFIRST Mission Advances to New Phase of Development", "date": "2019-08-28", "content": "The telescope for WFIRST has successfully passed its preliminary design review, a major milestone for the mission.

This multi-layered technology, the coronagraph instrument, might more rightly be called \"starglasses\": a system of masks, prisms, detectors and even self- flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars - and reveal the planets in orbit around them. Normally, that glare is overwhelming, blotting out any chance of seeing planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, said Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. A star's photons - particles of light - vastly overpower any light coming from an orbiting planet when they hit the telescope. \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet,\" Rhodes said. And WFIRST's coronagraph just completed a major milestone: a preliminary design review by NASA. That means the instrument has met all design, schedule and budget requirements, and can now proceed to the next phase: building hardware that will fly in space. It's one of a series of such reviews examining every facet of the mission, said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Every one of these reviews is comprehensive,\" Kruk said. \"We go over all aspects of the mission, to show that everything hangs together.\" The WFIRST mission's coronagraph is meant to demonstrate the power of increasingly advanced technology. As it captures light directly from large, gaseous exoplanets, and from disks of dust and gas surrounding other stars, it will point the way to technologies for even larger space telescopes. Future telescopes with even more sophisticated coronagraphs will be able to generate single pixel \"images\" of rocky planets the size of Earth. Then the light can be spread into a rainbow called a \"spectrum,\" revealing which gases are present in the planet's atmosphere - perhaps oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, and maybe even signs of life. \"With WFIRST we'll be able to get images and spectra of these large planets, with the goal of proving technologies that will be used in a future mission - to eventually look at small rocky planets that could have liquid water on their surfaces, or even signs of life, like our own,\" Rhodes said. In this way, WFIRST is a kind of pioneer. That's why NASA considers the coronagraph to be a \"technology demonstration.\" While it is likely to generate important scientific discoveries, its main job is to prove to the scientific community that complex coronagraphs really can work in space. \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown,\" Rhodes said. Why This Coronagraph Is Different: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit since 1990, is so far the only NASA astrophysics flagship mission to include coronagraphs - far simpler and less sophisticated versions than will fly on WFIRST. But by the time it launches in the mid 2020s, WFIRST will be the third such mission to include coronagraph technology. NASA's massive James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2021, will include a coronagraph with a sharpness of vision greater than Hubble's, but without the starlight suppression capability of WFIRST. \"WFIRST should be two or three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other coronagraph ever flown\" in its ability to distinguish a planet from its star, Rhodes said. \"There should be a chance for some really compelling science, even though it's just a tech demo.\" The two flexible mirrors inside the coronagraph are key components. As light that has traveled tens of light-years from an exoplanet enters the telescope, thousands of actuators move like pistons, changing the shape of the mirrors in real time. The flexing of these \"deformable mirrors\" compensates for tiny flaws and changes in the telescope's optics. Changes on the mirrors' surfaces are so precise they can compensate for errors smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. These mirrors, in tandem with high-tech \"masks,\" another major advance, squelch the star's diffraction - the bending of light waves around the edges of light-blocking elements inside the coronagraph. The result: blinding starlight is sharply dimmed, and faintly glowing, previously hidden planets appear. The star-dimming technology also could deliver the clearest-ever images of distant star systems' formative years - when they are still swaddled in disks of dust and gas as infant planets take shape inside. \"The debris disks we see today around other stars are brighter and more massive than what we have in our own solar system,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and instrument technologist for the WFIRST coronagraph. \"WFIRST's coronagraph instrument could study fainter, more diffuse disk material that's more like the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and other dust orbiting the Sun.\" That could yield deep insights into how our solar system formed. Kruk said the instrument's deformable mirrors and other advanced technology - known as \"active wavefront control\" - should mean a leap of 100 to 1,000 times the capability of previous coronagraphs. \"When you see an opportunity like this to really open new frontiers in a new field, you can't help but be excited by that,\" he said. Once the coronagraph technology is successfully demonstrated over the mission's first 18 months, WFIRST's coronagraph could become open to the scientific community. A \"Participating Scientist Program\" would invite a broader variety of observers to conduct experiments beyond the demonstration phase. The coronagraph's advancement through the design review milestone is part of a development schedule now moving at a fast clip. A giant camera that will also fly on the spacecraft, called the Wide-Field Instrument, cleared the same hurdle in June. It is considered the space telescope's main instrument. Rhodes likes to compare WFIRST to the history-making Mars Pathfinder mission. After landing on the Red Planet in 1997, the Pathfinder lander unleashed a small rover, named Sojourner, to trundle on its own around the landing site and examine nearby rocks. \"That was a tech demo,\" Rhodes said. \"The goal was to show that a rover works on Mars. But it went on to do some very interesting science during its lifetime. So we're hopeful the same is going to be true of WFIRST's coronagraph tech demo.\"", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1601/wfirst-space-telescope-fitted-for-starglasses/"}, {"title": "NASA's WFIRST Space Telescope Will Don Futuristic Sunglasses", "date": "2019-09-26", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a space observatory, currently in development by NASA for exoplanet detection and dark energy research. The WFIRST is the successor to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope. SDSS is a low-powered telescope that can observe a wide region of space while Hubble is a high powered telescope that can observe a very small region but with much more clarity. WFIRST will have the ability to see space with the intricacy of Hubble with the observable region comparable to the SDSS. The WFIRST that will be launched in mid-2020s with some state-of-the-art 'sunglasses' known as the Coronagraph. The coronagraph instrument consists of multiple layers of masks, prisms, detectors and deformable mirrors to block the glare of stars that hides the planets in orbit around them. Normally, the glare makes it impossible to detect planets orbiting distant stars but a coronagraph will make possible. A simple coronagraph uses an opaque disc to block light from a star but that won't allow detection of exoplanets. The Coronagraph instrument creates destructive interference with the light from the star by using its multiple layers of components. The instrument thus allows the faint light from the planets to pass through, blocking the stars' light. Some noise from the star does pass through which increases if the amount of incident light is increased so deformable mirrors are used to minimize the noise. The shape of deformable mirrors is changed using many small pistons that act based on the light noise from the star.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020.

NASA announced Nov. 1 that the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) passed its preliminary design review (PDR), a major milestone in the development of the space-based observatory. That overall PDR came after similar reviews in recent months of various components of the spacecraft. Curiously, NASA did little to publicize the completion of the PDR, which is usually considered a major step forward for any spacecraft project. The mission issued a single tweet Nov. 1 about the completion of the review, but no formal press release or other statement about it. By contrast, the completion of the PDR for WFIRST's telescope, one element of the overall spacecraft, merited its own release in August. Michael New, deputy associate administrator for science in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told the National Academies' Space Studies Board at its fall meeting Nov. 6 that WFIRST passed the review \"with flying colors.\" He added that the work converting the telescope's 2.4-meter primary mirror, which NASA inherited from another government agency - most likely the National Reconnaissance Office - was going better than expected. WFIRST's low profile comes as it is caught in a budgetary tug-of-war between the White House and Congress. The administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request sought no funding for WFIRST, concluding funding was needed for the James Webb Space Telescope. The White House also sought no funding for WFIRST in fiscal year 2019, but Congress appropriated $312 million for the mission in its final spending bill. Both the House and Senate have moved to fund WFIRST in their respective fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills, but at different levels. The House bill offered $510.7 million for WFIRST, while the Senate bill provides $445.7 million. \"In either case, we would be able to continue and be successful with WFIRST,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, during an Oct. 29 meeting of the agency's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. He added, though, that the lower funding in the Senate bill could require NASA to stretch out the program, delaying its planned 2025 launch. \"But in one case, the project would have to adjust their plans, which might require an adjustment in the launch date and other commitments,\" he said. He added it was premature to discuss how much of a change, if any, would be needed until the fiscal year 2020 budget is finalized. The mission currently is on schedule for a launch in 2025, he said. \"We would like to stay on track, but if budget realities mean that we have to make slight replans, we'll just do that.\" WFIRST has support in the new NASA authorization bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators Nov. 6. The bill directs NASA to continue WFIRST within its current cost cap of $3.2 billion so that it can meet the objectives in the 2010 astrophysics decadal survey, whose top-ranked large mission was WFIRST. The next major step for WFIRST is a confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), where NASA makes formal cost and schedule commitments for the mission. Jeffrey Kruk, WFIRST project scientist, said at the Astrophysics Advisory Committee that the review should be completed in early February. Prior to the KDP-C review is the completion of the project's own cost and schedule assessments as well as two independent assessments, one by the Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission, and the other by a standing review board.

This multi-layered technology, the coronagraph instrument, might more rightly be called \"starglasses\": a system of masks, prisms, detectors and even self- flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars - and reveal the planets in orbit around them. Normally, that glare is overwhelming, blotting out any chance of seeing planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, said Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. A star's photons - particles of light - vastly overpower any light coming from an orbiting planet when they hit the telescope. \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet,\" Rhodes said. And WFIRST's coronagraph just completed a major milestone: a preliminary design review by NASA. That means the instrument has met all design, schedule and budget requirements, and can now proceed to the next phase: building hardware that will fly in space. It's one of a series of such reviews examining every facet of the mission, said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Every one of these reviews is comprehensive,\" Kruk said. \"We go over all aspects of the mission, to show that everything hangs together.\" The WFIRST mission's coronagraph is meant to demonstrate the power of increasingly advanced technology. As it captures light directly from large, gaseous exoplanets, and from disks of dust and gas surrounding other stars, it will point the way to technologies for even larger space telescopes. Future telescopes with even more sophisticated coronagraphs will be able to generate single pixel \"images\" of rocky planets the size of Earth. Then the light can be spread into a rainbow called a \"spectrum,\" revealing which gases are present in the planet's atmosphere - perhaps oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, and maybe even signs of life. \"With WFIRST we'll be able to get images and spectra of these large planets, with the goal of proving technologies that will be used in a future mission - to eventually look at small rocky planets that could have liquid water on their surfaces, or even signs of life, like our own,\" Rhodes said. In this way, WFIRST is a kind of pioneer. That's why NASA considers the coronagraph to be a \"technology demonstration.\" While it is likely to generate important scientific discoveries, its main job is to prove to the scientific community that complex coronagraphs really can work in space. \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown,\" Rhodes said. Why This Coronagraph Is Different: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit since 1990, is so far the only NASA astrophysics flagship mission to include coronagraphs - far simpler and less sophisticated versions than will fly on WFIRST. But by the time it launches in the mid 2020s, WFIRST will be the third such mission to include coronagraph technology. NASA's massive James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2021, will include a coronagraph with a sharpness of vision greater than Hubble's, but without the starlight suppression capability of WFIRST. \"WFIRST should be two or three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other coronagraph ever flown\" in its ability to distinguish a planet from its star, Rhodes said. \"There should be a chance for some really compelling science, even though it's just a tech demo.\" The two flexible mirrors inside the coronagraph are key components. As light that has traveled tens of light-years from an exoplanet enters the telescope, thousands of actuators move like pistons, changing the shape of the mirrors in real time. The flexing of these \"deformable mirrors\" compensates for tiny flaws and changes in the telescope's optics. Changes on the mirrors' surfaces are so precise they can compensate for errors smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. These mirrors, in tandem with high-tech \"masks,\" another major advance, squelch the star's diffraction - the bending of light waves around the edges of light-blocking elements inside the coronagraph. The result: blinding starlight is sharply dimmed, and faintly glowing, previously hidden planets appear. The star-dimming technology also could deliver the clearest-ever images of distant star systems' formative years - when they are still swaddled in disks of dust and gas as infant planets take shape inside. \"The debris disks we see today around other stars are brighter and more massive than what we have in our own solar system,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and instrument technologist for the WFIRST coronagraph. \"WFIRST's coronagraph instrument could study fainter, more diffuse disk material that's more like the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and other dust orbiting the Sun.\" That could yield deep insights into how our solar system formed. Kruk said the instrument's deformable mirrors and other advanced technology - known as \"active wavefront control\" - should mean a leap of 100 to 1,000 times the capability of previous coronagraphs. \"When you see an opportunity like this to really open new frontiers in a new field, you can't help but be excited by that,\" he said. Once the coronagraph technology is successfully demonstrated over the mission's first 18 months, WFIRST's coronagraph could become open to the scientific community. A \"Participating Scientist Program\" would invite a broader variety of observers to conduct experiments beyond the demonstration phase. The coronagraph's advancement through the design review milestone is part of a development schedule now moving at a fast clip. A giant camera that will also fly on the spacecraft, called the Wide-Field Instrument, cleared the same hurdle in June. It is considered the space telescope's main instrument. Rhodes likes to compare WFIRST to the history-making Mars Pathfinder mission. After landing on the Red Planet in 1997, the Pathfinder lander unleashed a small rover, named Sojourner, to trundle on its own around the landing site and examine nearby rocks. \"That was a tech demo,\" Rhodes said. \"The goal was to show that a rover works on Mars. But it went on to do some very interesting science during its lifetime. So we're hopeful the same is going to be true of WFIRST's coronagraph tech demo.\"", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1601/wfirst-space-telescope-fitted-for-starglasses/"}, {"title": "NASA's WFIRST Space Telescope Will Don Futuristic Sunglasses", "date": "2019-09-26", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a space observatory, currently in development by NASA for exoplanet detection and dark energy research. The WFIRST is the successor to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope. SDSS is a low-powered telescope that can observe a wide region of space while Hubble is a high powered telescope that can observe a very small region but with much more clarity. WFIRST will have the ability to see space with the intricacy of Hubble with the observable region comparable to the SDSS. The WFIRST that will be launched in mid-2020s with some state-of-the-art 'sunglasses' known as the Coronagraph. The coronagraph instrument consists of multiple layers of masks, prisms, detectors and deformable mirrors to block the glare of stars that hides the planets in orbit around them. Normally, the glare makes it impossible to detect planets orbiting distant stars but a coronagraph will make possible. A simple coronagraph uses an opaque disc to block light from a star but that won't allow detection of exoplanets. The Coronagraph instrument creates destructive interference with the light from the star by using its multiple layers of components. The instrument thus allows the faint light from the planets to pass through, blocking the stars' light. Some noise from the star does pass through which increases if the amount of incident light is increased so deformable mirrors are used to minimize the noise. The shape of deformable mirrors is changed using many small pistons that act based on the light noise from the star. Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the WFIRST at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California explained that, \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet.\" WFIRST development made major strides as the coronagraph just passed a preliminary design review by NASA.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October. That would be followed by Key Decision Point C and formal mission confirmation, he said. \"It would be good to get the required funding to pull that off.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/wfirst-faces-funding-crunch.html"}, {"title": "WFIRST passes preliminary design review", "date": "2019-11-11", "content": "A NASA space telescope recently completed a major review and is making good progress, project officials say, despite uncertainty about its funding. NASA announced Nov. 1 that the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) passed its preliminary design review (PDR), a major milestone in the development of the space-based observatory. That overall PDR came after similar reviews in recent months of various components of the spacecraft. Curiously, NASA did little to publicize the completion of the PDR, which is usually considered a major step forward for any spacecraft project. The mission issued a single tweet Nov. 1 about the completion of the review, but no formal press release or other statement about it. By contrast, the completion of the PDR for WFIRST's telescope, one element of the overall spacecraft, merited its own release in August. Michael New, deputy associate administrator for science in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told the National Academies' Space Studies Board at its fall meeting Nov. 6 that WFIRST passed the review \"with flying colors.\" He added that the work converting the telescope's 2.4-meter primary mirror, which NASA inherited from another government agency - most likely the National Reconnaissance Office - was going better than expected. WFIRST's low profile comes as it is caught in a budgetary tug-of-war between the White House and Congress. The administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request sought no funding for WFIRST, concluding funding was needed for the James Webb Space Telescope. The White House also sought no funding for WFIRST in fiscal year 2019, but Congress appropriated $312 million for the mission in its final spending bill. Both the House and Senate have moved to fund WFIRST in their respective fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills, but at different levels. The House bill offered $510.7 million for WFIRST, while the Senate bill provides $445.7 million. \"In either case, we would be able to continue and be successful with WFIRST,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, during an Oct. 29 meeting of the agency's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. He added, though, that the lower funding in the Senate bill could require NASA to stretch out the program, delaying its planned 2025 launch. \"But in one case, the project would have to adjust their plans, which might require an adjustment in the launch date and other commitments,\" he said. He added it was premature to discuss how much of a change, if any, would be needed until the fiscal year 2020 budget is finalized. The mission currently is on schedule for a launch in 2025, he said. \"We would like to stay on track, but if budget realities mean that we have to make slight replans, we'll just do that.\" WFIRST has support in the new NASA authorization bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators Nov. 6. The bill directs NASA to continue WFIRST within its current cost cap of $3.2 billion so that it can meet the objectives in the 2010 astrophysics decadal survey, whose top-ranked large mission was WFIRST. The next major step for WFIRST is a confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), where NASA makes formal cost and schedule commitments for the mission. Jeffrey Kruk, WFIRST project scientist, said at the Astrophysics Advisory Committee that the review should be completed in early February. Prior to the KDP-C review is the completion of the project's own cost and schedule assessments as well as two independent assessments, one by the Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission, and the other by a standing review board. A series of reviews both at Goddard and NASA Headquarters will follow from December to February, Kruk said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/wfirst-passes-preliminary-design-review/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Telescope for NASA's WFIRST Mission Advances to New Phase of Development", "date": "2019-08-28", "content": "The telescope for WFIRST has successfully passed its preliminary design review, a major milestone for the mission.

NASA's massive James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2021, will include a coronagraph with a sharpness of vision greater than Hubble's, but without the starlight suppression capability of WFIRST. \"WFIRST should be two or three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other coronagraph ever flown\" in its ability to distinguish a planet from its star, Rhodes said. \"There should be a chance for some really compelling science, even though it's just a tech demo.\" The two flexible mirrors inside the coronagraph are key components. As light that has traveled tens of light-years from an exoplanet enters the telescope, thousands of actuators move like pistons, changing the shape of the mirrors in real time. The flexing of these \"deformable mirrors\" compensates for tiny flaws and changes in the telescope's optics. Changes on the mirrors' surfaces are so precise they can compensate for errors smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. These mirrors, in tandem with high-tech \"masks,\" another major advance, squelch the star's diffraction - the bending of light waves around the edges of light-blocking elements inside the coronagraph. The result: blinding starlight is sharply dimmed, and faintly glowing, previously hidden planets appear. The star-dimming technology also could deliver the clearest-ever images of distant star systems' formative years - when they are still swaddled in disks of dust and gas as infant planets take shape inside. \"The debris disks we see today around other stars are brighter and more massive than what we have in our own solar system,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and instrument technologist for the WFIRST coronagraph. \"WFIRST's coronagraph instrument could study fainter, more diffuse disk material that's more like the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and other dust orbiting the Sun.\" That could yield deep insights into how our solar system formed. Kruk said the instrument's deformable mirrors and other advanced technology - known as \"active wavefront control\" - should mean a leap of 100 to 1,000 times the capability of previous coronagraphs. \"When you see an opportunity like this to really open new frontiers in a new field, you can't help but be excited by that,\" he said. Once the coronagraph technology is successfully demonstrated over the mission's first 18 months, WFIRST's coronagraph could become open to the scientific community. A \"Participating Scientist Program\" would invite a broader variety of observers to conduct experiments beyond the demonstration phase. The coronagraph's advancement through the design review milestone is part of a development schedule now moving at a fast clip. A giant camera that will also fly on the spacecraft, called the Wide-Field Instrument, cleared the same hurdle in June. It is considered the space telescope's main instrument. Rhodes likes to compare WFIRST to the history-making Mars Pathfinder mission. After landing on the Red Planet in 1997, the Pathfinder lander unleashed a small rover, named Sojourner, to trundle on its own around the landing site and examine nearby rocks. \"That was a tech demo,\" Rhodes said. \"The goal was to show that a rover works on Mars. But it went on to do some very interesting science during its lifetime. So we're hopeful the same is going to be true of WFIRST's coronagraph tech demo.\"", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1601/wfirst-space-telescope-fitted-for-starglasses/"}, {"title": "NASA's WFIRST Space Telescope Will Don Futuristic Sunglasses", "date": "2019-09-26", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a space observatory, currently in development by NASA for exoplanet detection and dark energy research. The WFIRST is the successor to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope. SDSS is a low-powered telescope that can observe a wide region of space while Hubble is a high powered telescope that can observe a very small region but with much more clarity. WFIRST will have the ability to see space with the intricacy of Hubble with the observable region comparable to the SDSS. The WFIRST that will be launched in mid-2020s with some state-of-the-art 'sunglasses' known as the Coronagraph. The coronagraph instrument consists of multiple layers of masks, prisms, detectors and deformable mirrors to block the glare of stars that hides the planets in orbit around them. Normally, the glare makes it impossible to detect planets orbiting distant stars but a coronagraph will make possible. A simple coronagraph uses an opaque disc to block light from a star but that won't allow detection of exoplanets. The Coronagraph instrument creates destructive interference with the light from the star by using its multiple layers of components. The instrument thus allows the faint light from the planets to pass through, blocking the stars' light. Some noise from the star does pass through which increases if the amount of incident light is increased so deformable mirrors are used to minimize the noise. The shape of deformable mirrors is changed using many small pistons that act based on the light noise from the star. Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the WFIRST at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California explained that, \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet.\" WFIRST development made major strides as the coronagraph just passed a preliminary design review by NASA. Rhodes said, \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown\" as the complex coronagraph is the first of its kind to function in space.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October. That would be followed by Key Decision Point C and formal mission confirmation, he said. \"It would be good to get the required funding to pull that off.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/wfirst-faces-funding-crunch.html"}, {"title": "WFIRST passes preliminary design review", "date": "2019-11-11", "content": "A NASA space telescope recently completed a major review and is making good progress, project officials say, despite uncertainty about its funding. NASA announced Nov. 1 that the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) passed its preliminary design review (PDR), a major milestone in the development of the space-based observatory. That overall PDR came after similar reviews in recent months of various components of the spacecraft. Curiously, NASA did little to publicize the completion of the PDR, which is usually considered a major step forward for any spacecraft project. The mission issued a single tweet Nov. 1 about the completion of the review, but no formal press release or other statement about it. By contrast, the completion of the PDR for WFIRST's telescope, one element of the overall spacecraft, merited its own release in August. Michael New, deputy associate administrator for science in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told the National Academies' Space Studies Board at its fall meeting Nov. 6 that WFIRST passed the review \"with flying colors.\" He added that the work converting the telescope's 2.4-meter primary mirror, which NASA inherited from another government agency - most likely the National Reconnaissance Office - was going better than expected. WFIRST's low profile comes as it is caught in a budgetary tug-of-war between the White House and Congress. The administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request sought no funding for WFIRST, concluding funding was needed for the James Webb Space Telescope. The White House also sought no funding for WFIRST in fiscal year 2019, but Congress appropriated $312 million for the mission in its final spending bill. Both the House and Senate have moved to fund WFIRST in their respective fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills, but at different levels. The House bill offered $510.7 million for WFIRST, while the Senate bill provides $445.7 million. \"In either case, we would be able to continue and be successful with WFIRST,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, during an Oct. 29 meeting of the agency's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. He added, though, that the lower funding in the Senate bill could require NASA to stretch out the program, delaying its planned 2025 launch. \"But in one case, the project would have to adjust their plans, which might require an adjustment in the launch date and other commitments,\" he said. He added it was premature to discuss how much of a change, if any, would be needed until the fiscal year 2020 budget is finalized. The mission currently is on schedule for a launch in 2025, he said. \"We would like to stay on track, but if budget realities mean that we have to make slight replans, we'll just do that.\" WFIRST has support in the new NASA authorization bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators Nov. 6. The bill directs NASA to continue WFIRST within its current cost cap of $3.2 billion so that it can meet the objectives in the 2010 astrophysics decadal survey, whose top-ranked large mission was WFIRST. The next major step for WFIRST is a confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), where NASA makes formal cost and schedule commitments for the mission. Jeffrey Kruk, WFIRST project scientist, said at the Astrophysics Advisory Committee that the review should be completed in early February. Prior to the KDP-C review is the completion of the project's own cost and schedule assessments as well as two independent assessments, one by the Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission, and the other by a standing review board. A series of reviews both at Goddard and NASA Headquarters will follow from December to February, Kruk said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/wfirst-passes-preliminary-design-review/"}, {"title": "Simulated Image Demonstrates the Power of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "date": "2020-01-06", "content": "Imagine a fleet of 100 Hubble Space Telescopes, deployed in a strategic space-invader-shaped array a million miles from Earth, scanning the universe at warp speed. With NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, this vision will (effectively) become reality. WFIRST will capture the equivalent of 100 high-resolution Hubble images in a single shot, imaging large areas of the sky 1,000 times faster than Hubble. In several months, WFIRST could survey as much of the sky in near-infrared light - in just as much detail - as Hubble has over its entire three decades. Elisa Quintana, WFIRST Deputy Project Scientist for Communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is confident that WFIRST will have the power to transform astrophysics. \"To answer fundamental questions like: How common are planets like those in our solar system? How do galaxies form, evolve, and interact? Exactly how - and why - has the universe's expansion rate changed over time? We need a tool that can give us both a broad and detailed view of the sky. WFIRST will be that tool.\" Although WFIRST has not yet opened its wide, keen eyes on the universe, astronomers are already running simulations to demonstrate what it will be able to see and plan their observations. This simulated image of a portion of our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31), provides a preview of the vast expanse and fine detail that can be covered with just a single pointing of WFIRST. Using information gleaned from hundreds of Hubble observations, the simulated image covers a swath roughly 34,000 light-years across, showcasing the red and infrared light of more than 50 million individual stars detectable with WFIRST. While it may appear to be a somewhat haphazard arrangement of 18 separate images, the simulation actually represents a single shot. Eighteen square detectors, 4096 by 4096 pixels each, make up WFIRST's Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and give the telescope its unique window into space. With each pointing, WFIRST will cover an area roughly 1\u2153 times that of the full Moon. By comparison, each individual infrared Hubble image covers an area less than 1% of the full Moon. The Advantages of Speed: WFIRST is designed to collect the big data needed to tackle essential questions across a wide range of topics, including dark energy, exoplanets, and general astrophysics spanning from our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the observable universe. Over its 5-year planned lifetime, WFIRST is expected to amass more than 20 petabytes of information on thousands of planets, billions of stars, millions of galaxies, and the fundamental forces that govern the cosmos. For astronomers like Ben Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle, who generated the simulated data set for this image, WFIRST will provide a valuable opportunity to understand large nearby objects like Andromeda, which are otherwise extremely time-consuming to image because they take up such a large portion of the sky. \"We have spent the last couple of decades getting images at high resolution in small parts of nearby galaxies. With Hubble you get these really tantalizing glimpses of very complex nearby systems. With WFIRST, all of a sudden you can cover the whole thing without spending lots of time,\" Williams said. The ability to image such a large area will provide astronomers with important context needed to understand how stars form and how galaxies change over time. Williams explained that with a wide field, \"you get the individual stars, you get the structures they live in, and the structures that surround them in their environment.\" Julianne Dalcanton of the University of Washington, who led the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program that the simulated data are based on, also believes that WFIRST's combination of ultra-telephoto and super-wide-angle capabilities will be ground-breaking. \"The PHAT survey of Andromeda was a tremendous investment of time, requiring careful justification and forethought. This new simulation shows how easy an equivalent observation could be for WFIRST.\" WFIRST could survey Andromeda nearly 1,500 times faster than Hubble, building a panorama of the main disk of the galaxy in just a few hours. WFIRST's extraordinary survey speed is a result of its wide field of view, its agility, and its orbit. Williams explained that by covering more area in one field and being able to switch fields more quickly, \"you're avoiding all those overheads that are associated with repointing the telescope so many times.\" In addition, WFIRST's orbit one million miles out will provide a view that is generally unobstructed by Earth. While Hubble is often able to collect data during only half of its low-Earth orbit 350 miles up, WFIRST will be able to observe more-or-less continuously. Major Survey Programs: Because it can collect so much detailed data so quickly, WFIRST is ideally suited for large surveys. A significant portion of the mission will be dedicated to monitoring hundreds of thousands of distant galaxies for supernova explosions, which can be used to study dark energy and the expansion of the universe. Another major program will involve mapping the shapes and distribution of galaxies in order to better understand how the universe - including galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy - has evolved over the past 13+ billion years. WFIRST will also play an important role in the census of exoplanets. By monitoring the brightness of billions of stars in the Milky Way, astronomers expect to catch thousands of microlensing events - slight increases in brightness that occur when a planet passes between the telescope and a distant star. WFIRST's ability to detect planets that are relatively small or far from their own stars - as well as rogue planets, which don't orbit any star at all - will help fill major gaps in our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. Although microlensing will not give us the ability to see exoplanets directly, WFIRST will also carry a coronagraph, a technology demonstration instrument designed to block enough of the blinding starlight to make direct imaging and characterization of orbiting planets possible. These large surveys are also expected to reveal the unexpected: strange, transient phenomena that have never before been observed. \"If you cover a lot of the sky, you're going to find those rare things,\" explained Williams. Open-Access Data: Further broadening its potential impact, all of the data collected by WFIRST will be non-proprietary and immediately available to the public. Dalcanton underscored the importance of this aspect of the mission: \"Thousands of minds from across the globe are going to be able to think about that data and come up with new ways to use it. It's hard to anticipate what the WFIRST data will unlock, but I do know that the more people we have looking at it, the greater the pace of discovery.\" Complementing Other Observatories: WFIRST's combination of talents will be a valuable complement to those of other observatories, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. \"With one hundred times the field of view of Hubble, and the ability to rapidly survey the sky, WFIRST will be an extremely powerful discovery tool,\" explained Karoline Gilbert, WFIRST Mission Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \"Webb, which is 100 times more sensitive and can see deeper into the infrared, will be able to observe the rare astronomical objects discovered by WFIRST in exquisite detail. Meanwhile, Hubble will continue to provide a unique view into the optical and ultraviolet light emitted by the objects that WFIRST discovers, and Webb follows up on.\" The simulated image is being presented at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii.", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1616/simulated-image-demonstrates-the-power-of-nasas-wide-field-infrared-survey-telescope/"}, {"title": "Final FY20 Appropriations: NASA", "date": "2020-01-24", "content": "Following last month's enactment of fiscal year 2020 appropriations, NASA's $21.5 billion budget is increasing by more than $1 billion, with the lion's share of the boost going to its human exploration program. The agency's Science Mission Directorate will see a more modest increase of 3%, bringing its budget to $7.14 billion. Much of the additional science funding will go toward higher spending on NASA's two flagship space telescope projects, the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Although the Trump administration had proposed cancelling WFIRST, Congress has decided to fully fund it in addition to covering the costs associated with JWST's recent launch delay. Other science missions are likewise receiving the funding they need to remain on track. This year's NASA appropriation was enacted through a package bill. An accompanying explanatory statement provides detailed funding direction and policy guidance on selected matters. Additional direction in the House and Senate reports on their original NASA spending bills will also apply, except where negated by language in the final statement. For summary tables, see the FYI Federal Science Budget Tracker. Astrophysics: The combined budget for NASA's Astrophysics Division and the separate JWST account is rising 16% to $1.73 billion. However, outside the increases specified for JWST and WFIRST, astrophysics funding is declining 10% to $796 million. Division Director Paul Hertz has said the level is \"adequate\" to proceed with the division's planned programs and projects. James Webb Space Telescope. Funding for JWST is increasing 39% to $423 million, covering part of the costs added to the project by a launch delay announced in 2018. NASA had planned to divert $70 million in fiscal year 2019 to smooth the absorption of those costs. However, Congress is now rescinding that amount and allocating it directly to JWST by funding the project at $70 million more than NASA's fiscal year 2020 request for it. JWST will need a similar level of funding in fiscal year 2021 before its budgetary requirements decline following its launch, which is still targeted for March 2021. Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Funding for WFIRST is climbing 64% to no less than $511 million, which is expected to be close to its peak level. Congress specifies that up to $65 million of the funding is for the mission's coronagraph technology demonstration. It also reiterates last year's direction that the mission should adhere to a $3.2 billion cost cap, which is at the bottom end of NASA's current cost estimates. The agency will establish a firm baseline cost and schedule commitment for WFIRST when the mission completes its confirmation review, expected to take place early this year. Research. Congress specifies that the division should spend the requested amount of $251 million on its Astrophysics Research program. The portions of the program that support technology development and research grants are currently in the middle of a multiyear funding ramp-up. Planetary Science: Funding for the Planetary Science Division is declining 2% to $2.71 billion this year, ending six straight years of growth that doubled the division's annual budget. Europa missions. Congress is continuing to support two missions to Jupiter's moon Europa, which is believed to harbor a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. Funding for the Europa Clipper, a multiple-flyby mission, is ramping up to $593 million from the $545 million Congress provided last year. Congress disregarded a request from NASA's inspector general to drop a requirement that the mission launch using the Space Launch System rocket NASA is still developing, though lawmakers did push the mission's required launch date back from 2023 to 2025. Congress likewise retained the SLS launch vehicle requirement for a follow-on lander mission and pushed its required launch date back from 2025 to 2027. In NASA's response last year to an internal audit dismissing the feasibility of a 2025 launch, the agency indicated it was not planning on launching a lander any earlier than 2030. In any case, Congress is not providing new funding for the lander this year. Per the House report, the project is expected to have sufficient funds remaining from last year's appropriation of $195 million to continue. Congress has also scaled back a House proposal to nearly double technology development funding for icy planetary surface exploration to $60 million, providing instead only $3 million more than the fiscal year 2018 level. Lunar missions. The budget for robotic lunar science missions is increasing from $218 million to as high as $300 million. That level meets NASA's initial request for lunar science as well as a supplemental request to fund a robotic rover that would support the Artemis crewed lunar exploration program. In October, NASA announced plans for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, with a projected launch readiness date of 2022. However, this month the agency postponed its procurement of delivery services for the rover, which are to be provided through NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA is planning on launching two smaller landers through the CLPS program in 2021 and has just announced their science and technology payloads. Planetary defense. The House and Senate reports specify level funding of $160 million for planetary defense missions. Within that amount, the explanatory statement specifies $36 million for work on the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission that NASA recently announced it is moving ahead with in lieu of the proposed NEOCam mission. NASA will manage the mission directly and projects it will launch in the mid-2020s and cost between $500 million and $600 million to develop. The objective is to expedite the behind-schedule search for asteroids and comets that could pose a risk of a devastating collision with Earth. The Senate report also directs NASA to study the prospect of adding a radio transmission capability to the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, citing in part the telescope's usefulness for characterizing near Earth objects. Earth Science: Funding for the Earth Science Division is increasing by 2% to $1.97 billion, continuing a recent trend of essentially flat funding. PACE. Funding for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem satellite is ramping down from $161 million to $131 million. Congress has consistently supported the mission despite the Trump administration's repeated proposals to cancel it. This past year, NASA gave the mission the green light to proceed into its advanced design and fabrication phase. It is expected to cost $890 million to develop. CLARREO Pathfinder. The Trump administration has also repeatedly sought to cancel CLARREO Pathfinder, an instrument for measuring solar radiation reflected from the Earth that is scheduled to be installed on the International Space Station in 2023. Its funding will ramp up from $18 million to $26 million this year. The project is expected to cost about $100 million altogether. Heliophysics: The Heliophysics Division budget is increasing 1% to $725 million. The explanatory statement and House report provide no further instructions for the division, leaving language in the Senate report as Congress' final direction. Solar Terrestrial Probes. Funding for the Solar Terrestrial Probe program is increasing from $100 million to $183 million, primarily reflecting the ramp up of work on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, which will study particles streaming to Earth from the edge of interstellar space. The mission has a cost cap of $492 million and is targeted for launch in 2024. Space weather. Funding for the Space Weather Science Applications program is increasing from $15 million to at least $20 million. Senate language states the funding is to \"support innovation in observational capabilities and advance research-to-operations, operations-to-research, and computational aspects of space weather mitigation.\" Other selected programs: Artemis. NASA's human exploration program is receiving a 19% budget increase that will go toward efforts associated with the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon in 2024. The budgets for NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew vehicle will receive boosts, and there is also new funding for a crewed lunar lander, albeit not so much as NASA had requested. The agency indicates its 2024 Moon landing goal remains unchanged, but the program's budgetary requirements are expected to increase further in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Satellite servicing and robotics. Congress notes that NASA is now planning on combining its Restore-L mission, which aims to refuel Landsat 7 in 2022, with a secondary payload called the SPace Infrastructure DExtrous Robot, which will demonstrate in-space robotic manufacturing capabilities. Accordingly, while maintaining the current $180 million budget for the Restore-L mission, Congress is adding $47 million to support SPIDER as well. Nuclear thermal propulsion. Funding for nuclear thermal propulsion R&D is increasing from about $100 million to $110 million, of which the amount specified for a demonstration project that would launch by 2024 is increasing from $70 million to no less than $80 million. STEM education and outreach. The budget for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement is increasing 9% to $120 million. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to eliminate the office, which funds student grants and outreach activities as well as grants that build research capacity in states that generally receive a lower share of federal research funding. The Science Mission Directorate's separate $45 million budget for STEM education activities will rise by at least $600,000 this year.

This multi-layered technology, the coronagraph instrument, might more rightly be called \"starglasses\": a system of masks, prisms, detectors and even self- flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars - and reveal the planets in orbit around them. Normally, that glare is overwhelming, blotting out any chance of seeing planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, said Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. A star's photons - particles of light - vastly overpower any light coming from an orbiting planet when they hit the telescope. \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet,\" Rhodes said. And WFIRST's coronagraph just completed a major milestone: a preliminary design review by NASA. That means the instrument has met all design, schedule and budget requirements, and can now proceed to the next phase: building hardware that will fly in space. It's one of a series of such reviews examining every facet of the mission, said WFIRST Project Scientist Jeffrey Kruk of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Every one of these reviews is comprehensive,\" Kruk said. \"We go over all aspects of the mission, to show that everything hangs together.\" The WFIRST mission's coronagraph is meant to demonstrate the power of increasingly advanced technology. As it captures light directly from large, gaseous exoplanets, and from disks of dust and gas surrounding other stars, it will point the way to technologies for even larger space telescopes. Future telescopes with even more sophisticated coronagraphs will be able to generate single pixel \"images\" of rocky planets the size of Earth. Then the light can be spread into a rainbow called a \"spectrum,\" revealing which gases are present in the planet's atmosphere - perhaps oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide, and maybe even signs of life. \"With WFIRST we'll be able to get images and spectra of these large planets, with the goal of proving technologies that will be used in a future mission - to eventually look at small rocky planets that could have liquid water on their surfaces, or even signs of life, like our own,\" Rhodes said. In this way, WFIRST is a kind of pioneer. That's why NASA considers the coronagraph to be a \"technology demonstration.\" While it is likely to generate important scientific discoveries, its main job is to prove to the scientific community that complex coronagraphs really can work in space. \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown,\" Rhodes said. Why This Coronagraph Is Different: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit since 1990, is so far the only NASA astrophysics flagship mission to include coronagraphs - far simpler and less sophisticated versions than will fly on WFIRST. But by the time it launches in the mid 2020s, WFIRST will be the third such mission to include coronagraph technology. NASA's massive James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2021, will include a coronagraph with a sharpness of vision greater than Hubble's, but without the starlight suppression capability of WFIRST. \"WFIRST should be two or three orders of magnitude more powerful than any other coronagraph ever flown\" in its ability to distinguish a planet from its star, Rhodes said. \"There should be a chance for some really compelling science, even though it's just a tech demo.\" The two flexible mirrors inside the coronagraph are key components. As light that has traveled tens of light-years from an exoplanet enters the telescope, thousands of actuators move like pistons, changing the shape of the mirrors in real time. The flexing of these \"deformable mirrors\" compensates for tiny flaws and changes in the telescope's optics. Changes on the mirrors' surfaces are so precise they can compensate for errors smaller than the width of a strand of DNA. These mirrors, in tandem with high-tech \"masks,\" another major advance, squelch the star's diffraction - the bending of light waves around the edges of light-blocking elements inside the coronagraph. The result: blinding starlight is sharply dimmed, and faintly glowing, previously hidden planets appear. The star-dimming technology also could deliver the clearest-ever images of distant star systems' formative years - when they are still swaddled in disks of dust and gas as infant planets take shape inside. \"The debris disks we see today around other stars are brighter and more massive than what we have in our own solar system,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and instrument technologist for the WFIRST coronagraph. \"WFIRST's coronagraph instrument could study fainter, more diffuse disk material that's more like the Main Asteroid Belt, the Kuiper Belt, and other dust orbiting the Sun.\" That could yield deep insights into how our solar system formed. Kruk said the instrument's deformable mirrors and other advanced technology - known as \"active wavefront control\" - should mean a leap of 100 to 1,000 times the capability of previous coronagraphs. \"When you see an opportunity like this to really open new frontiers in a new field, you can't help but be excited by that,\" he said. Once the coronagraph technology is successfully demonstrated over the mission's first 18 months, WFIRST's coronagraph could become open to the scientific community. A \"Participating Scientist Program\" would invite a broader variety of observers to conduct experiments beyond the demonstration phase. The coronagraph's advancement through the design review milestone is part of a development schedule now moving at a fast clip. A giant camera that will also fly on the spacecraft, called the Wide-Field Instrument, cleared the same hurdle in June. It is considered the space telescope's main instrument. Rhodes likes to compare WFIRST to the history-making Mars Pathfinder mission. After landing on the Red Planet in 1997, the Pathfinder lander unleashed a small rover, named Sojourner, to trundle on its own around the landing site and examine nearby rocks. \"That was a tech demo,\" Rhodes said. \"The goal was to show that a rover works on Mars. But it went on to do some very interesting science during its lifetime. So we're hopeful the same is going to be true of WFIRST's coronagraph tech demo.\"", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1601/wfirst-space-telescope-fitted-for-starglasses/"}, {"title": "NASA's WFIRST Space Telescope Will Don Futuristic Sunglasses", "date": "2019-09-26", "content": "The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a space observatory, currently in development by NASA for exoplanet detection and dark energy research. The WFIRST is the successor to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope. SDSS is a low-powered telescope that can observe a wide region of space while Hubble is a high powered telescope that can observe a very small region but with much more clarity. WFIRST will have the ability to see space with the intricacy of Hubble with the observable region comparable to the SDSS. The WFIRST that will be launched in mid-2020s with some state-of-the-art 'sunglasses' known as the Coronagraph. The coronagraph instrument consists of multiple layers of masks, prisms, detectors and deformable mirrors to block the glare of stars that hides the planets in orbit around them. Normally, the glare makes it impossible to detect planets orbiting distant stars but a coronagraph will make possible. A simple coronagraph uses an opaque disc to block light from a star but that won't allow detection of exoplanets. The Coronagraph instrument creates destructive interference with the light from the star by using its multiple layers of components. The instrument thus allows the faint light from the planets to pass through, blocking the stars' light. Some noise from the star does pass through which increases if the amount of incident light is increased so deformable mirrors are used to minimize the noise. The shape of deformable mirrors is changed using many small pistons that act based on the light noise from the star. Jason Rhodes, the project scientist for the WFIRST at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California explained that, \"What we're trying to do is cancel out a billion photons from the star for every one we capture from the planet.\" WFIRST development made major strides as the coronagraph just passed a preliminary design review by NASA. Rhodes said, \"This may be the most complicated astronomical instrument ever flown\" as the complex coronagraph is the first of its kind to function in space.

NASA's fiscal year 2020 budget request includes no funding for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the next large strategic, or flagship, astrophysics mission for the agency after the James Webb Space Telescope. NASA, in its request, said that it proposed cancelling the mission because of \"its significant cost and higher priorities within NASA, including completing the delayed James Webb Space Telescope.\" WFIRST was the top-ranked flagship mission in the latest astrophysics decadal survey, published in 2010. The spacecraft, featuring a 2.4-meter primary mirror provided to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, is designed to carry out research ranging from exoplanets to dark matter and dark energy. The mission, currently cost-capped at $3.2 billion, is scheduled for launch in 2025. At a March 27 hearing of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, chairman of the subcommittee, asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine about the proposed cancellation of WFIRST, noting the ability of WFIRST to work in concert with JWST. \"If one was built to work with the other, why is WFIRST considered for elimination?\" he asked. Bridenstine pointed out the cost and schedule overruns of JWST. \"We're now getting it back on track,\" he said. \"If James Webb isn't yet ready, preparing WFIRST right away is probably not the right approach.\" He emphasized the importance of having a portfolio of both large and smaller missions. He suggested WFIRST could be revived once JWST is launched. \"WFIRST will be a critical mission when James Webb is on orbit,\" he said. The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget request also proposed cancelling WFIRST. However, the final spending bill enacted in February ignored that request, providing the mission with $312 million for 2019. That funding, though, was less than what's needed to keep the mission on schedule, Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics mission, said in a March 26 presentation to the National Academies' Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The budget profile established for the mission at a project milestone known as Key Decision Point B estimated WFIRST needed $372 million in 2019 to stay within budget and schedule. \"This does mean that $60 million worth of work that they had been planning to do in FY '19 is being deferred into later years, which has an impact downstream,\" Hertz said. WFIRST is maintaining its $3.2 billion cost for now, he said, \"but the risk associated with making that target has changed.\" Should Congress reject the administration's proposal to terminate WFIRST, Hertz said the project will need even more funding in fiscal year 2020 to remain on schedule. \"We need $542 million in FY '20 to stay on track for delivering within our cost target,\" he said. That includes additional funding to catch up from the fiscal year 2019 shortfall. If Congress does fund WFIRST, but below the $542 million required to stay on schedule, Hertz said NASA has two options. \"We will have to choose between either blowing the cost target and having a larger run-out cost because we had to slow down, or descoping something significant\" from the mission, he said. In the latter case, the only significant thing that could be removed is the coronagraph, an instrument previously scaled back to a technology demonstration in order to fit the mission into the current $3.2 billion cost cap. That decision, if needed, would come when WFIRST reaches Key Decision Point C in early 2020. Despite the uncertain fiscal landscape, work on the mission continues. \"Over the last year, we got a lot of things in place,\" said Jamie Dunn, WFIRST project manager, at the committee meeting, including awarding contracts for key elements of the spacecraft. \"We're poised to make really good progress this year.\" A preliminary design review for the overall mission is scheduled for October. That would be followed by Key Decision Point C and formal mission confirmation, he said. \"It would be good to get the required funding to pull that off.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/wfirst-faces-funding-crunch.html"}, {"title": "WFIRST passes preliminary design review", "date": "2019-11-11", "content": "A NASA space telescope recently completed a major review and is making good progress, project officials say, despite uncertainty about its funding. NASA announced Nov. 1 that the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) passed its preliminary design review (PDR), a major milestone in the development of the space-based observatory. That overall PDR came after similar reviews in recent months of various components of the spacecraft. Curiously, NASA did little to publicize the completion of the PDR, which is usually considered a major step forward for any spacecraft project. The mission issued a single tweet Nov. 1 about the completion of the review, but no formal press release or other statement about it. By contrast, the completion of the PDR for WFIRST's telescope, one element of the overall spacecraft, merited its own release in August. Michael New, deputy associate administrator for science in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told the National Academies' Space Studies Board at its fall meeting Nov. 6 that WFIRST passed the review \"with flying colors.\" He added that the work converting the telescope's 2.4-meter primary mirror, which NASA inherited from another government agency - most likely the National Reconnaissance Office - was going better than expected. WFIRST's low profile comes as it is caught in a budgetary tug-of-war between the White House and Congress. The administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request sought no funding for WFIRST, concluding funding was needed for the James Webb Space Telescope. The White House also sought no funding for WFIRST in fiscal year 2019, but Congress appropriated $312 million for the mission in its final spending bill. Both the House and Senate have moved to fund WFIRST in their respective fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills, but at different levels. The House bill offered $510.7 million for WFIRST, while the Senate bill provides $445.7 million. \"In either case, we would be able to continue and be successful with WFIRST,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, during an Oct. 29 meeting of the agency's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. He added, though, that the lower funding in the Senate bill could require NASA to stretch out the program, delaying its planned 2025 launch. \"But in one case, the project would have to adjust their plans, which might require an adjustment in the launch date and other commitments,\" he said. He added it was premature to discuss how much of a change, if any, would be needed until the fiscal year 2020 budget is finalized. The mission currently is on schedule for a launch in 2025, he said. \"We would like to stay on track, but if budget realities mean that we have to make slight replans, we'll just do that.\" WFIRST has support in the new NASA authorization bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators Nov. 6. The bill directs NASA to continue WFIRST within its current cost cap of $3.2 billion so that it can meet the objectives in the 2010 astrophysics decadal survey, whose top-ranked large mission was WFIRST. The next major step for WFIRST is a confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), where NASA makes formal cost and schedule commitments for the mission. Jeffrey Kruk, WFIRST project scientist, said at the Astrophysics Advisory Committee that the review should be completed in early February. Prior to the KDP-C review is the completion of the project's own cost and schedule assessments as well as two independent assessments, one by the Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission, and the other by a standing review board. A series of reviews both at Goddard and NASA Headquarters will follow from December to February, Kruk said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/wfirst-passes-preliminary-design-review/"}, {"title": "Simulated Image Demonstrates the Power of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "date": "2020-01-06", "content": "Imagine a fleet of 100 Hubble Space Telescopes, deployed in a strategic space-invader-shaped array a million miles from Earth, scanning the universe at warp speed. With NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, this vision will (effectively) become reality. WFIRST will capture the equivalent of 100 high-resolution Hubble images in a single shot, imaging large areas of the sky 1,000 times faster than Hubble. In several months, WFIRST could survey as much of the sky in near-infrared light - in just as much detail - as Hubble has over its entire three decades. Elisa Quintana, WFIRST Deputy Project Scientist for Communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is confident that WFIRST will have the power to transform astrophysics. \"To answer fundamental questions like: How common are planets like those in our solar system? How do galaxies form, evolve, and interact? Exactly how - and why - has the universe's expansion rate changed over time? We need a tool that can give us both a broad and detailed view of the sky. WFIRST will be that tool.\" Although WFIRST has not yet opened its wide, keen eyes on the universe, astronomers are already running simulations to demonstrate what it will be able to see and plan their observations. This simulated image of a portion of our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31), provides a preview of the vast expanse and fine detail that can be covered with just a single pointing of WFIRST. Using information gleaned from hundreds of Hubble observations, the simulated image covers a swath roughly 34,000 light-years across, showcasing the red and infrared light of more than 50 million individual stars detectable with WFIRST. While it may appear to be a somewhat haphazard arrangement of 18 separate images, the simulation actually represents a single shot. Eighteen square detectors, 4096 by 4096 pixels each, make up WFIRST's Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and give the telescope its unique window into space. With each pointing, WFIRST will cover an area roughly 1\u2153 times that of the full Moon. By comparison, each individual infrared Hubble image covers an area less than 1% of the full Moon. The Advantages of Speed: WFIRST is designed to collect the big data needed to tackle essential questions across a wide range of topics, including dark energy, exoplanets, and general astrophysics spanning from our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the observable universe. Over its 5-year planned lifetime, WFIRST is expected to amass more than 20 petabytes of information on thousands of planets, billions of stars, millions of galaxies, and the fundamental forces that govern the cosmos. For astronomers like Ben Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle, who generated the simulated data set for this image, WFIRST will provide a valuable opportunity to understand large nearby objects like Andromeda, which are otherwise extremely time-consuming to image because they take up such a large portion of the sky. \"We have spent the last couple of decades getting images at high resolution in small parts of nearby galaxies. With Hubble you get these really tantalizing glimpses of very complex nearby systems. With WFIRST, all of a sudden you can cover the whole thing without spending lots of time,\" Williams said. The ability to image such a large area will provide astronomers with important context needed to understand how stars form and how galaxies change over time. Williams explained that with a wide field, \"you get the individual stars, you get the structures they live in, and the structures that surround them in their environment.\" Julianne Dalcanton of the University of Washington, who led the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program that the simulated data are based on, also believes that WFIRST's combination of ultra-telephoto and super-wide-angle capabilities will be ground-breaking. \"The PHAT survey of Andromeda was a tremendous investment of time, requiring careful justification and forethought. This new simulation shows how easy an equivalent observation could be for WFIRST.\" WFIRST could survey Andromeda nearly 1,500 times faster than Hubble, building a panorama of the main disk of the galaxy in just a few hours. WFIRST's extraordinary survey speed is a result of its wide field of view, its agility, and its orbit. Williams explained that by covering more area in one field and being able to switch fields more quickly, \"you're avoiding all those overheads that are associated with repointing the telescope so many times.\" In addition, WFIRST's orbit one million miles out will provide a view that is generally unobstructed by Earth. While Hubble is often able to collect data during only half of its low-Earth orbit 350 miles up, WFIRST will be able to observe more-or-less continuously. Major Survey Programs: Because it can collect so much detailed data so quickly, WFIRST is ideally suited for large surveys. A significant portion of the mission will be dedicated to monitoring hundreds of thousands of distant galaxies for supernova explosions, which can be used to study dark energy and the expansion of the universe. Another major program will involve mapping the shapes and distribution of galaxies in order to better understand how the universe - including galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy - has evolved over the past 13+ billion years. WFIRST will also play an important role in the census of exoplanets. By monitoring the brightness of billions of stars in the Milky Way, astronomers expect to catch thousands of microlensing events - slight increases in brightness that occur when a planet passes between the telescope and a distant star. WFIRST's ability to detect planets that are relatively small or far from their own stars - as well as rogue planets, which don't orbit any star at all - will help fill major gaps in our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. Although microlensing will not give us the ability to see exoplanets directly, WFIRST will also carry a coronagraph, a technology demonstration instrument designed to block enough of the blinding starlight to make direct imaging and characterization of orbiting planets possible. These large surveys are also expected to reveal the unexpected: strange, transient phenomena that have never before been observed. \"If you cover a lot of the sky, you're going to find those rare things,\" explained Williams. Open-Access Data: Further broadening its potential impact, all of the data collected by WFIRST will be non-proprietary and immediately available to the public. Dalcanton underscored the importance of this aspect of the mission: \"Thousands of minds from across the globe are going to be able to think about that data and come up with new ways to use it. It's hard to anticipate what the WFIRST data will unlock, but I do know that the more people we have looking at it, the greater the pace of discovery.\" Complementing Other Observatories: WFIRST's combination of talents will be a valuable complement to those of other observatories, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. \"With one hundred times the field of view of Hubble, and the ability to rapidly survey the sky, WFIRST will be an extremely powerful discovery tool,\" explained Karoline Gilbert, WFIRST Mission Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \"Webb, which is 100 times more sensitive and can see deeper into the infrared, will be able to observe the rare astronomical objects discovered by WFIRST in exquisite detail. Meanwhile, Hubble will continue to provide a unique view into the optical and ultraviolet light emitted by the objects that WFIRST discovers, and Webb follows up on.\" The simulated image is being presented at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii.", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1616/simulated-image-demonstrates-the-power-of-nasas-wide-field-infrared-survey-telescope/"}, {"title": "Final FY20 Appropriations: NASA", "date": "2020-01-24", "content": "Following last month's enactment of fiscal year 2020 appropriations, NASA's $21.5 billion budget is increasing by more than $1 billion, with the lion's share of the boost going to its human exploration program. The agency's Science Mission Directorate will see a more modest increase of 3%, bringing its budget to $7.14 billion. Much of the additional science funding will go toward higher spending on NASA's two flagship space telescope projects, the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Although the Trump administration had proposed cancelling WFIRST, Congress has decided to fully fund it in addition to covering the costs associated with JWST's recent launch delay. Other science missions are likewise receiving the funding they need to remain on track. This year's NASA appropriation was enacted through a package bill. An accompanying explanatory statement provides detailed funding direction and policy guidance on selected matters. Additional direction in the House and Senate reports on their original NASA spending bills will also apply, except where negated by language in the final statement. For summary tables, see the FYI Federal Science Budget Tracker. Astrophysics: The combined budget for NASA's Astrophysics Division and the separate JWST account is rising 16% to $1.73 billion. However, outside the increases specified for JWST and WFIRST, astrophysics funding is declining 10% to $796 million. Division Director Paul Hertz has said the level is \"adequate\" to proceed with the division's planned programs and projects. James Webb Space Telescope. Funding for JWST is increasing 39% to $423 million, covering part of the costs added to the project by a launch delay announced in 2018. NASA had planned to divert $70 million in fiscal year 2019 to smooth the absorption of those costs. However, Congress is now rescinding that amount and allocating it directly to JWST by funding the project at $70 million more than NASA's fiscal year 2020 request for it. JWST will need a similar level of funding in fiscal year 2021 before its budgetary requirements decline following its launch, which is still targeted for March 2021. Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Funding for WFIRST is climbing 64% to no less than $511 million, which is expected to be close to its peak level. Congress specifies that up to $65 million of the funding is for the mission's coronagraph technology demonstration. It also reiterates last year's direction that the mission should adhere to a $3.2 billion cost cap, which is at the bottom end of NASA's current cost estimates. The agency will establish a firm baseline cost and schedule commitment for WFIRST when the mission completes its confirmation review, expected to take place early this year. Research. Congress specifies that the division should spend the requested amount of $251 million on its Astrophysics Research program. The portions of the program that support technology development and research grants are currently in the middle of a multiyear funding ramp-up. Planetary Science: Funding for the Planetary Science Division is declining 2% to $2.71 billion this year, ending six straight years of growth that doubled the division's annual budget. Europa missions. Congress is continuing to support two missions to Jupiter's moon Europa, which is believed to harbor a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. Funding for the Europa Clipper, a multiple-flyby mission, is ramping up to $593 million from the $545 million Congress provided last year. Congress disregarded a request from NASA's inspector general to drop a requirement that the mission launch using the Space Launch System rocket NASA is still developing, though lawmakers did push the mission's required launch date back from 2023 to 2025. Congress likewise retained the SLS launch vehicle requirement for a follow-on lander mission and pushed its required launch date back from 2025 to 2027. In NASA's response last year to an internal audit dismissing the feasibility of a 2025 launch, the agency indicated it was not planning on launching a lander any earlier than 2030. In any case, Congress is not providing new funding for the lander this year. Per the House report, the project is expected to have sufficient funds remaining from last year's appropriation of $195 million to continue. Congress has also scaled back a House proposal to nearly double technology development funding for icy planetary surface exploration to $60 million, providing instead only $3 million more than the fiscal year 2018 level. Lunar missions. The budget for robotic lunar science missions is increasing from $218 million to as high as $300 million. That level meets NASA's initial request for lunar science as well as a supplemental request to fund a robotic rover that would support the Artemis crewed lunar exploration program. In October, NASA announced plans for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, with a projected launch readiness date of 2022. However, this month the agency postponed its procurement of delivery services for the rover, which are to be provided through NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA is planning on launching two smaller landers through the CLPS program in 2021 and has just announced their science and technology payloads. Planetary defense. The House and Senate reports specify level funding of $160 million for planetary defense missions. Within that amount, the explanatory statement specifies $36 million for work on the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission that NASA recently announced it is moving ahead with in lieu of the proposed NEOCam mission. NASA will manage the mission directly and projects it will launch in the mid-2020s and cost between $500 million and $600 million to develop. The objective is to expedite the behind-schedule search for asteroids and comets that could pose a risk of a devastating collision with Earth. The Senate report also directs NASA to study the prospect of adding a radio transmission capability to the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, citing in part the telescope's usefulness for characterizing near Earth objects. Earth Science: Funding for the Earth Science Division is increasing by 2% to $1.97 billion, continuing a recent trend of essentially flat funding. PACE. Funding for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem satellite is ramping down from $161 million to $131 million. Congress has consistently supported the mission despite the Trump administration's repeated proposals to cancel it. This past year, NASA gave the mission the green light to proceed into its advanced design and fabrication phase. It is expected to cost $890 million to develop. CLARREO Pathfinder. The Trump administration has also repeatedly sought to cancel CLARREO Pathfinder, an instrument for measuring solar radiation reflected from the Earth that is scheduled to be installed on the International Space Station in 2023. Its funding will ramp up from $18 million to $26 million this year. The project is expected to cost about $100 million altogether. Heliophysics: The Heliophysics Division budget is increasing 1% to $725 million. The explanatory statement and House report provide no further instructions for the division, leaving language in the Senate report as Congress' final direction. Solar Terrestrial Probes. Funding for the Solar Terrestrial Probe program is increasing from $100 million to $183 million, primarily reflecting the ramp up of work on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, which will study particles streaming to Earth from the edge of interstellar space. The mission has a cost cap of $492 million and is targeted for launch in 2024. Space weather. Funding for the Space Weather Science Applications program is increasing from $15 million to at least $20 million. Senate language states the funding is to \"support innovation in observational capabilities and advance research-to-operations, operations-to-research, and computational aspects of space weather mitigation.\" Other selected programs: Artemis. NASA's human exploration program is receiving a 19% budget increase that will go toward efforts associated with the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon in 2024. The budgets for NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew vehicle will receive boosts, and there is also new funding for a crewed lunar lander, albeit not so much as NASA had requested. The agency indicates its 2024 Moon landing goal remains unchanged, but the program's budgetary requirements are expected to increase further in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Satellite servicing and robotics. Congress notes that NASA is now planning on combining its Restore-L mission, which aims to refuel Landsat 7 in 2022, with a secondary payload called the SPace Infrastructure DExtrous Robot, which will demonstrate in-space robotic manufacturing capabilities. Accordingly, while maintaining the current $180 million budget for the Restore-L mission, Congress is adding $47 million to support SPIDER as well. Nuclear thermal propulsion. Funding for nuclear thermal propulsion R&D is increasing from about $100 million to $110 million, of which the amount specified for a demonstration project that would launch by 2024 is increasing from $70 million to no less than $80 million. STEM education and outreach. The budget for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement is increasing 9% to $120 million. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to eliminate the office, which funds student grants and outreach activities as well as grants that build research capacity in states that generally receive a lower share of federal research funding. The Science Mission Directorate's separate $45 million budget for STEM education activities will rise by at least $600,000 this year.

NASA announced Nov. 1 that the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) passed its preliminary design review (PDR), a major milestone in the development of the space-based observatory. That overall PDR came after similar reviews in recent months of various components of the spacecraft. Curiously, NASA did little to publicize the completion of the PDR, which is usually considered a major step forward for any spacecraft project. The mission issued a single tweet Nov. 1 about the completion of the review, but no formal press release or other statement about it. By contrast, the completion of the PDR for WFIRST's telescope, one element of the overall spacecraft, merited its own release in August. Michael New, deputy associate administrator for science in NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told the National Academies' Space Studies Board at its fall meeting Nov. 6 that WFIRST passed the review \"with flying colors.\" He added that the work converting the telescope's 2.4-meter primary mirror, which NASA inherited from another government agency - most likely the National Reconnaissance Office - was going better than expected. WFIRST's low profile comes as it is caught in a budgetary tug-of-war between the White House and Congress. The administration's fiscal year 2020 budget request sought no funding for WFIRST, concluding funding was needed for the James Webb Space Telescope. The White House also sought no funding for WFIRST in fiscal year 2019, but Congress appropriated $312 million for the mission in its final spending bill. Both the House and Senate have moved to fund WFIRST in their respective fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills, but at different levels. The House bill offered $510.7 million for WFIRST, while the Senate bill provides $445.7 million. \"In either case, we would be able to continue and be successful with WFIRST,\" said Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, during an Oct. 29 meeting of the agency's Astrophysics Advisory Committee. He added, though, that the lower funding in the Senate bill could require NASA to stretch out the program, delaying its planned 2025 launch. \"But in one case, the project would have to adjust their plans, which might require an adjustment in the launch date and other commitments,\" he said. He added it was premature to discuss how much of a change, if any, would be needed until the fiscal year 2020 budget is finalized. The mission currently is on schedule for a launch in 2025, he said. \"We would like to stay on track, but if budget realities mean that we have to make slight replans, we'll just do that.\" WFIRST has support in the new NASA authorization bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators Nov. 6. The bill directs NASA to continue WFIRST within its current cost cap of $3.2 billion so that it can meet the objectives in the 2010 astrophysics decadal survey, whose top-ranked large mission was WFIRST. The next major step for WFIRST is a confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), where NASA makes formal cost and schedule commitments for the mission. Jeffrey Kruk, WFIRST project scientist, said at the Astrophysics Advisory Committee that the review should be completed in early February. Prior to the KDP-C review is the completion of the project's own cost and schedule assessments as well as two independent assessments, one by the Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission, and the other by a standing review board. A series of reviews both at Goddard and NASA Headquarters will follow from December to February, Kruk said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/wfirst-passes-preliminary-design-review/"}, {"title": "Simulated Image Demonstrates the Power of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "date": "2020-01-06", "content": "Imagine a fleet of 100 Hubble Space Telescopes, deployed in a strategic space-invader-shaped array a million miles from Earth, scanning the universe at warp speed. With NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, this vision will (effectively) become reality. WFIRST will capture the equivalent of 100 high-resolution Hubble images in a single shot, imaging large areas of the sky 1,000 times faster than Hubble. In several months, WFIRST could survey as much of the sky in near-infrared light - in just as much detail - as Hubble has over its entire three decades. Elisa Quintana, WFIRST Deputy Project Scientist for Communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is confident that WFIRST will have the power to transform astrophysics. \"To answer fundamental questions like: How common are planets like those in our solar system? How do galaxies form, evolve, and interact? Exactly how - and why - has the universe's expansion rate changed over time? We need a tool that can give us both a broad and detailed view of the sky. WFIRST will be that tool.\" Although WFIRST has not yet opened its wide, keen eyes on the universe, astronomers are already running simulations to demonstrate what it will be able to see and plan their observations. This simulated image of a portion of our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31), provides a preview of the vast expanse and fine detail that can be covered with just a single pointing of WFIRST. Using information gleaned from hundreds of Hubble observations, the simulated image covers a swath roughly 34,000 light-years across, showcasing the red and infrared light of more than 50 million individual stars detectable with WFIRST. While it may appear to be a somewhat haphazard arrangement of 18 separate images, the simulation actually represents a single shot. Eighteen square detectors, 4096 by 4096 pixels each, make up WFIRST's Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and give the telescope its unique window into space. With each pointing, WFIRST will cover an area roughly 1\u2153 times that of the full Moon. By comparison, each individual infrared Hubble image covers an area less than 1% of the full Moon. The Advantages of Speed: WFIRST is designed to collect the big data needed to tackle essential questions across a wide range of topics, including dark energy, exoplanets, and general astrophysics spanning from our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the observable universe. Over its 5-year planned lifetime, WFIRST is expected to amass more than 20 petabytes of information on thousands of planets, billions of stars, millions of galaxies, and the fundamental forces that govern the cosmos. For astronomers like Ben Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle, who generated the simulated data set for this image, WFIRST will provide a valuable opportunity to understand large nearby objects like Andromeda, which are otherwise extremely time-consuming to image because they take up such a large portion of the sky. \"We have spent the last couple of decades getting images at high resolution in small parts of nearby galaxies. With Hubble you get these really tantalizing glimpses of very complex nearby systems. With WFIRST, all of a sudden you can cover the whole thing without spending lots of time,\" Williams said. The ability to image such a large area will provide astronomers with important context needed to understand how stars form and how galaxies change over time. Williams explained that with a wide field, \"you get the individual stars, you get the structures they live in, and the structures that surround them in their environment.\" Julianne Dalcanton of the University of Washington, who led the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program that the simulated data are based on, also believes that WFIRST's combination of ultra-telephoto and super-wide-angle capabilities will be ground-breaking. \"The PHAT survey of Andromeda was a tremendous investment of time, requiring careful justification and forethought. This new simulation shows how easy an equivalent observation could be for WFIRST.\" WFIRST could survey Andromeda nearly 1,500 times faster than Hubble, building a panorama of the main disk of the galaxy in just a few hours. WFIRST's extraordinary survey speed is a result of its wide field of view, its agility, and its orbit. Williams explained that by covering more area in one field and being able to switch fields more quickly, \"you're avoiding all those overheads that are associated with repointing the telescope so many times.\" In addition, WFIRST's orbit one million miles out will provide a view that is generally unobstructed by Earth. While Hubble is often able to collect data during only half of its low-Earth orbit 350 miles up, WFIRST will be able to observe more-or-less continuously. Major Survey Programs: Because it can collect so much detailed data so quickly, WFIRST is ideally suited for large surveys. A significant portion of the mission will be dedicated to monitoring hundreds of thousands of distant galaxies for supernova explosions, which can be used to study dark energy and the expansion of the universe. Another major program will involve mapping the shapes and distribution of galaxies in order to better understand how the universe - including galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy - has evolved over the past 13+ billion years. WFIRST will also play an important role in the census of exoplanets. By monitoring the brightness of billions of stars in the Milky Way, astronomers expect to catch thousands of microlensing events - slight increases in brightness that occur when a planet passes between the telescope and a distant star. WFIRST's ability to detect planets that are relatively small or far from their own stars - as well as rogue planets, which don't orbit any star at all - will help fill major gaps in our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. Although microlensing will not give us the ability to see exoplanets directly, WFIRST will also carry a coronagraph, a technology demonstration instrument designed to block enough of the blinding starlight to make direct imaging and characterization of orbiting planets possible. These large surveys are also expected to reveal the unexpected: strange, transient phenomena that have never before been observed. \"If you cover a lot of the sky, you're going to find those rare things,\" explained Williams. Open-Access Data: Further broadening its potential impact, all of the data collected by WFIRST will be non-proprietary and immediately available to the public. Dalcanton underscored the importance of this aspect of the mission: \"Thousands of minds from across the globe are going to be able to think about that data and come up with new ways to use it. It's hard to anticipate what the WFIRST data will unlock, but I do know that the more people we have looking at it, the greater the pace of discovery.\" Complementing Other Observatories: WFIRST's combination of talents will be a valuable complement to those of other observatories, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. \"With one hundred times the field of view of Hubble, and the ability to rapidly survey the sky, WFIRST will be an extremely powerful discovery tool,\" explained Karoline Gilbert, WFIRST Mission Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \"Webb, which is 100 times more sensitive and can see deeper into the infrared, will be able to observe the rare astronomical objects discovered by WFIRST in exquisite detail. Meanwhile, Hubble will continue to provide a unique view into the optical and ultraviolet light emitted by the objects that WFIRST discovers, and Webb follows up on.\" The simulated image is being presented at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii.", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1616/simulated-image-demonstrates-the-power-of-nasas-wide-field-infrared-survey-telescope/"}, {"title": "Final FY20 Appropriations: NASA", "date": "2020-01-24", "content": "Following last month's enactment of fiscal year 2020 appropriations, NASA's $21.5 billion budget is increasing by more than $1 billion, with the lion's share of the boost going to its human exploration program. The agency's Science Mission Directorate will see a more modest increase of 3%, bringing its budget to $7.14 billion. Much of the additional science funding will go toward higher spending on NASA's two flagship space telescope projects, the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Although the Trump administration had proposed cancelling WFIRST, Congress has decided to fully fund it in addition to covering the costs associated with JWST's recent launch delay. Other science missions are likewise receiving the funding they need to remain on track. This year's NASA appropriation was enacted through a package bill. An accompanying explanatory statement provides detailed funding direction and policy guidance on selected matters. Additional direction in the House and Senate reports on their original NASA spending bills will also apply, except where negated by language in the final statement. For summary tables, see the FYI Federal Science Budget Tracker. Astrophysics: The combined budget for NASA's Astrophysics Division and the separate JWST account is rising 16% to $1.73 billion. However, outside the increases specified for JWST and WFIRST, astrophysics funding is declining 10% to $796 million. Division Director Paul Hertz has said the level is \"adequate\" to proceed with the division's planned programs and projects. James Webb Space Telescope. Funding for JWST is increasing 39% to $423 million, covering part of the costs added to the project by a launch delay announced in 2018. NASA had planned to divert $70 million in fiscal year 2019 to smooth the absorption of those costs. However, Congress is now rescinding that amount and allocating it directly to JWST by funding the project at $70 million more than NASA's fiscal year 2020 request for it. JWST will need a similar level of funding in fiscal year 2021 before its budgetary requirements decline following its launch, which is still targeted for March 2021. Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Funding for WFIRST is climbing 64% to no less than $511 million, which is expected to be close to its peak level. Congress specifies that up to $65 million of the funding is for the mission's coronagraph technology demonstration. It also reiterates last year's direction that the mission should adhere to a $3.2 billion cost cap, which is at the bottom end of NASA's current cost estimates. The agency will establish a firm baseline cost and schedule commitment for WFIRST when the mission completes its confirmation review, expected to take place early this year. Research. Congress specifies that the division should spend the requested amount of $251 million on its Astrophysics Research program. The portions of the program that support technology development and research grants are currently in the middle of a multiyear funding ramp-up. Planetary Science: Funding for the Planetary Science Division is declining 2% to $2.71 billion this year, ending six straight years of growth that doubled the division's annual budget. Europa missions. Congress is continuing to support two missions to Jupiter's moon Europa, which is believed to harbor a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. Funding for the Europa Clipper, a multiple-flyby mission, is ramping up to $593 million from the $545 million Congress provided last year. Congress disregarded a request from NASA's inspector general to drop a requirement that the mission launch using the Space Launch System rocket NASA is still developing, though lawmakers did push the mission's required launch date back from 2023 to 2025. Congress likewise retained the SLS launch vehicle requirement for a follow-on lander mission and pushed its required launch date back from 2025 to 2027. In NASA's response last year to an internal audit dismissing the feasibility of a 2025 launch, the agency indicated it was not planning on launching a lander any earlier than 2030. In any case, Congress is not providing new funding for the lander this year. Per the House report, the project is expected to have sufficient funds remaining from last year's appropriation of $195 million to continue. Congress has also scaled back a House proposal to nearly double technology development funding for icy planetary surface exploration to $60 million, providing instead only $3 million more than the fiscal year 2018 level. Lunar missions. The budget for robotic lunar science missions is increasing from $218 million to as high as $300 million. That level meets NASA's initial request for lunar science as well as a supplemental request to fund a robotic rover that would support the Artemis crewed lunar exploration program. In October, NASA announced plans for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, with a projected launch readiness date of 2022. However, this month the agency postponed its procurement of delivery services for the rover, which are to be provided through NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA is planning on launching two smaller landers through the CLPS program in 2021 and has just announced their science and technology payloads. Planetary defense. The House and Senate reports specify level funding of $160 million for planetary defense missions. Within that amount, the explanatory statement specifies $36 million for work on the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission that NASA recently announced it is moving ahead with in lieu of the proposed NEOCam mission. NASA will manage the mission directly and projects it will launch in the mid-2020s and cost between $500 million and $600 million to develop. The objective is to expedite the behind-schedule search for asteroids and comets that could pose a risk of a devastating collision with Earth. The Senate report also directs NASA to study the prospect of adding a radio transmission capability to the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, citing in part the telescope's usefulness for characterizing near Earth objects. Earth Science: Funding for the Earth Science Division is increasing by 2% to $1.97 billion, continuing a recent trend of essentially flat funding. PACE. Funding for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem satellite is ramping down from $161 million to $131 million. Congress has consistently supported the mission despite the Trump administration's repeated proposals to cancel it. This past year, NASA gave the mission the green light to proceed into its advanced design and fabrication phase. It is expected to cost $890 million to develop. CLARREO Pathfinder. The Trump administration has also repeatedly sought to cancel CLARREO Pathfinder, an instrument for measuring solar radiation reflected from the Earth that is scheduled to be installed on the International Space Station in 2023. Its funding will ramp up from $18 million to $26 million this year. The project is expected to cost about $100 million altogether. Heliophysics: The Heliophysics Division budget is increasing 1% to $725 million. The explanatory statement and House report provide no further instructions for the division, leaving language in the Senate report as Congress' final direction. Solar Terrestrial Probes. Funding for the Solar Terrestrial Probe program is increasing from $100 million to $183 million, primarily reflecting the ramp up of work on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, which will study particles streaming to Earth from the edge of interstellar space. The mission has a cost cap of $492 million and is targeted for launch in 2024. Space weather. Funding for the Space Weather Science Applications program is increasing from $15 million to at least $20 million. Senate language states the funding is to \"support innovation in observational capabilities and advance research-to-operations, operations-to-research, and computational aspects of space weather mitigation.\" Other selected programs: Artemis. NASA's human exploration program is receiving a 19% budget increase that will go toward efforts associated with the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon in 2024. The budgets for NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew vehicle will receive boosts, and there is also new funding for a crewed lunar lander, albeit not so much as NASA had requested. The agency indicates its 2024 Moon landing goal remains unchanged, but the program's budgetary requirements are expected to increase further in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Satellite servicing and robotics. Congress notes that NASA is now planning on combining its Restore-L mission, which aims to refuel Landsat 7 in 2022, with a secondary payload called the SPace Infrastructure DExtrous Robot, which will demonstrate in-space robotic manufacturing capabilities. Accordingly, while maintaining the current $180 million budget for the Restore-L mission, Congress is adding $47 million to support SPIDER as well. Nuclear thermal propulsion. Funding for nuclear thermal propulsion R&D is increasing from about $100 million to $110 million, of which the amount specified for a demonstration project that would launch by 2024 is increasing from $70 million to no less than $80 million. STEM education and outreach. The budget for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement is increasing 9% to $120 million. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to eliminate the office, which funds student grants and outreach activities as well as grants that build research capacity in states that generally receive a lower share of federal research funding. The Science Mission Directorate's separate $45 million budget for STEM education activities will rise by at least $600,000 this year.

The mission recently passed \"a critical programmatic and technical milestone\" and is en route to starting hardware development and testing ahead of the telescope's planned launch in the mid-2020s, NASA said in a statement. But that would be the case only if funding persists to keep the telescope on track. The Trump administration's federal budget request for the 2021 fiscal year, issued last month, proposes terminating the telescope entirely to allow for funds to move forward on the James Webb Space Telescope, a flagship mission that would study the early universe. \"The administration is not ready to proceed with another multi-billion-dollar space telescope until Webb has been successfully launched and deployed,\" NASA said in the statement. Webb has been delayed numerous times for technical and budget reasons. While NASA said the mission is on track to leave Earth in 2021, in January 2020, the Government Accountability Office said there is only a 12% chance Webb will make its revised March 2021 launch date, and that's due to a very tight development schedule. The GAO warned that the launch could slip at least another three months, to July 2021. Cancellations of WFIRST were also proposed for the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. And in the first budget the Trump administration oversaw, for fiscal year 2018, the administration proposed cuts to the telescope's instrumentation to move it back under the mission cap of $3.2 billion. The fiscal 2021 budget is not finalized yet, as it is undergoing review by House and Senate representatives. Should WFIRST move forward, the mission will use a repurposed spy telescope with capabilities similar to those of the Hubble Space Telescope but with a viewing area about 100 times larger. The mission's scope includes hunting for exoplanets, seeking infrared signals in cosmic phenomena and creating panoramas of the sky. \"With the passage of this latest key milestone, the team will begin finalizing the WFIRST mission design by building engineering test units and models to ensure the design will hold up under the extreme conditions during launch and while in space,\" NASA said. The agency noted that the WFIRST program is funded until September 2020, reiterating its position that it will not launch another big telescope until Webb is ready for operations in space. WFIRST's development budget remains at $3.2 billion, NASA added, although other costs will bring the final tally up to $3.9 billion. These extra costs include five years of operations and science, as well as a technology demonstrator to image exoplanets.", "url": "https://www.space.com/wfirst-telescope-moves-forward-trump-budget-cut.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "WFIRST passes preliminary design review", "date": "2019-11-11", "content": "A NASA space telescope recently completed a major review and is making good progress, project officials say, despite uncertainty about its funding.

It's hard to anticipate what the WFIRST data will unlock, but I do know that the more people we have looking at it, the greater the pace of discovery.\" Complementing Other Observatories: WFIRST's combination of talents will be a valuable complement to those of other observatories, including Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope. \"With one hundred times the field of view of Hubble, and the ability to rapidly survey the sky, WFIRST will be an extremely powerful discovery tool,\" explained Karoline Gilbert, WFIRST Mission Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \"Webb, which is 100 times more sensitive and can see deeper into the infrared, will be able to observe the rare astronomical objects discovered by WFIRST in exquisite detail. Meanwhile, Hubble will continue to provide a unique view into the optical and ultraviolet light emitted by the objects that WFIRST discovers, and Webb follows up on.\" The simulated image is being presented at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii.", "url": "https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1616/simulated-image-demonstrates-the-power-of-nasas-wide-field-infrared-survey-telescope/"}, {"title": "Final FY20 Appropriations: NASA", "date": "2020-01-24", "content": "Following last month's enactment of fiscal year 2020 appropriations, NASA's $21.5 billion budget is increasing by more than $1 billion, with the lion's share of the boost going to its human exploration program. The agency's Science Mission Directorate will see a more modest increase of 3%, bringing its budget to $7.14 billion. Much of the additional science funding will go toward higher spending on NASA's two flagship space telescope projects, the James Webb Space Telescope and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Although the Trump administration had proposed cancelling WFIRST, Congress has decided to fully fund it in addition to covering the costs associated with JWST's recent launch delay. Other science missions are likewise receiving the funding they need to remain on track. This year's NASA appropriation was enacted through a package bill. An accompanying explanatory statement provides detailed funding direction and policy guidance on selected matters. Additional direction in the House and Senate reports on their original NASA spending bills will also apply, except where negated by language in the final statement. For summary tables, see the FYI Federal Science Budget Tracker. Astrophysics: The combined budget for NASA's Astrophysics Division and the separate JWST account is rising 16% to $1.73 billion. However, outside the increases specified for JWST and WFIRST, astrophysics funding is declining 10% to $796 million. Division Director Paul Hertz has said the level is \"adequate\" to proceed with the division's planned programs and projects. James Webb Space Telescope. Funding for JWST is increasing 39% to $423 million, covering part of the costs added to the project by a launch delay announced in 2018. NASA had planned to divert $70 million in fiscal year 2019 to smooth the absorption of those costs. However, Congress is now rescinding that amount and allocating it directly to JWST by funding the project at $70 million more than NASA's fiscal year 2020 request for it. JWST will need a similar level of funding in fiscal year 2021 before its budgetary requirements decline following its launch, which is still targeted for March 2021. Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Funding for WFIRST is climbing 64% to no less than $511 million, which is expected to be close to its peak level. Congress specifies that up to $65 million of the funding is for the mission's coronagraph technology demonstration. It also reiterates last year's direction that the mission should adhere to a $3.2 billion cost cap, which is at the bottom end of NASA's current cost estimates. The agency will establish a firm baseline cost and schedule commitment for WFIRST when the mission completes its confirmation review, expected to take place early this year. Research. Congress specifies that the division should spend the requested amount of $251 million on its Astrophysics Research program. The portions of the program that support technology development and research grants are currently in the middle of a multiyear funding ramp-up. Planetary Science: Funding for the Planetary Science Division is declining 2% to $2.71 billion this year, ending six straight years of growth that doubled the division's annual budget. Europa missions. Congress is continuing to support two missions to Jupiter's moon Europa, which is believed to harbor a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. Funding for the Europa Clipper, a multiple-flyby mission, is ramping up to $593 million from the $545 million Congress provided last year. Congress disregarded a request from NASA's inspector general to drop a requirement that the mission launch using the Space Launch System rocket NASA is still developing, though lawmakers did push the mission's required launch date back from 2023 to 2025. Congress likewise retained the SLS launch vehicle requirement for a follow-on lander mission and pushed its required launch date back from 2025 to 2027. In NASA's response last year to an internal audit dismissing the feasibility of a 2025 launch, the agency indicated it was not planning on launching a lander any earlier than 2030. In any case, Congress is not providing new funding for the lander this year. Per the House report, the project is expected to have sufficient funds remaining from last year's appropriation of $195 million to continue. Congress has also scaled back a House proposal to nearly double technology development funding for icy planetary surface exploration to $60 million, providing instead only $3 million more than the fiscal year 2018 level. Lunar missions. The budget for robotic lunar science missions is increasing from $218 million to as high as $300 million. That level meets NASA's initial request for lunar science as well as a supplemental request to fund a robotic rover that would support the Artemis crewed lunar exploration program. In October, NASA announced plans for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, with a projected launch readiness date of 2022. However, this month the agency postponed its procurement of delivery services for the rover, which are to be provided through NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA is planning on launching two smaller landers through the CLPS program in 2021 and has just announced their science and technology payloads. Planetary defense. The House and Senate reports specify level funding of $160 million for planetary defense missions. Within that amount, the explanatory statement specifies $36 million for work on the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission that NASA recently announced it is moving ahead with in lieu of the proposed NEOCam mission. NASA will manage the mission directly and projects it will launch in the mid-2020s and cost between $500 million and $600 million to develop. The objective is to expedite the behind-schedule search for asteroids and comets that could pose a risk of a devastating collision with Earth. The Senate report also directs NASA to study the prospect of adding a radio transmission capability to the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, citing in part the telescope's usefulness for characterizing near Earth objects. Earth Science: Funding for the Earth Science Division is increasing by 2% to $1.97 billion, continuing a recent trend of essentially flat funding. PACE. Funding for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem satellite is ramping down from $161 million to $131 million. Congress has consistently supported the mission despite the Trump administration's repeated proposals to cancel it. This past year, NASA gave the mission the green light to proceed into its advanced design and fabrication phase. It is expected to cost $890 million to develop. CLARREO Pathfinder. The Trump administration has also repeatedly sought to cancel CLARREO Pathfinder, an instrument for measuring solar radiation reflected from the Earth that is scheduled to be installed on the International Space Station in 2023. Its funding will ramp up from $18 million to $26 million this year. The project is expected to cost about $100 million altogether. Heliophysics: The Heliophysics Division budget is increasing 1% to $725 million. The explanatory statement and House report provide no further instructions for the division, leaving language in the Senate report as Congress' final direction. Solar Terrestrial Probes. Funding for the Solar Terrestrial Probe program is increasing from $100 million to $183 million, primarily reflecting the ramp up of work on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, which will study particles streaming to Earth from the edge of interstellar space. The mission has a cost cap of $492 million and is targeted for launch in 2024. Space weather. Funding for the Space Weather Science Applications program is increasing from $15 million to at least $20 million. Senate language states the funding is to \"support innovation in observational capabilities and advance research-to-operations, operations-to-research, and computational aspects of space weather mitigation.\" Other selected programs: Artemis. NASA's human exploration program is receiving a 19% budget increase that will go toward efforts associated with the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon in 2024. The budgets for NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew vehicle will receive boosts, and there is also new funding for a crewed lunar lander, albeit not so much as NASA had requested. The agency indicates its 2024 Moon landing goal remains unchanged, but the program's budgetary requirements are expected to increase further in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Satellite servicing and robotics. Congress notes that NASA is now planning on combining its Restore-L mission, which aims to refuel Landsat 7 in 2022, with a secondary payload called the SPace Infrastructure DExtrous Robot, which will demonstrate in-space robotic manufacturing capabilities. Accordingly, while maintaining the current $180 million budget for the Restore-L mission, Congress is adding $47 million to support SPIDER as well. Nuclear thermal propulsion. Funding for nuclear thermal propulsion R&D is increasing from about $100 million to $110 million, of which the amount specified for a demonstration project that would launch by 2024 is increasing from $70 million to no less than $80 million. STEM education and outreach. The budget for NASA's Office of STEM Engagement is increasing 9% to $120 million. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to eliminate the office, which funds student grants and outreach activities as well as grants that build research capacity in states that generally receive a lower share of federal research funding. The Science Mission Directorate's separate $45 million budget for STEM education activities will rise by at least $600,000 this year.

The mission recently passed \"a critical programmatic and technical milestone\" and is en route to starting hardware development and testing ahead of the telescope's planned launch in the mid-2020s, NASA said in a statement. But that would be the case only if funding persists to keep the telescope on track. The Trump administration's federal budget request for the 2021 fiscal year, issued last month, proposes terminating the telescope entirely to allow for funds to move forward on the James Webb Space Telescope, a flagship mission that would study the early universe. \"The administration is not ready to proceed with another multi-billion-dollar space telescope until Webb has been successfully launched and deployed,\" NASA said in the statement. Webb has been delayed numerous times for technical and budget reasons. While NASA said the mission is on track to leave Earth in 2021, in January 2020, the Government Accountability Office said there is only a 12% chance Webb will make its revised March 2021 launch date, and that's due to a very tight development schedule. The GAO warned that the launch could slip at least another three months, to July 2021. Cancellations of WFIRST were also proposed for the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. And in the first budget the Trump administration oversaw, for fiscal year 2018, the administration proposed cuts to the telescope's instrumentation to move it back under the mission cap of $3.2 billion. The fiscal 2021 budget is not finalized yet, as it is undergoing review by House and Senate representatives. Should WFIRST move forward, the mission will use a repurposed spy telescope with capabilities similar to those of the Hubble Space Telescope but with a viewing area about 100 times larger. The mission's scope includes hunting for exoplanets, seeking infrared signals in cosmic phenomena and creating panoramas of the sky. \"With the passage of this latest key milestone, the team will begin finalizing the WFIRST mission design by building engineering test units and models to ensure the design will hold up under the extreme conditions during launch and while in space,\" NASA said. The agency noted that the WFIRST program is funded until September 2020, reiterating its position that it will not launch another big telescope until Webb is ready for operations in space. WFIRST's development budget remains at $3.2 billion, NASA added, although other costs will bring the final tally up to $3.9 billion. These extra costs include five years of operations and science, as well as a technology demonstrator to image exoplanets.", "url": "https://www.space.com/wfirst-telescope-moves-forward-trump-budget-cut.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Simulated Image Demonstrates the Power of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "date": "2020-01-06", "content": "Imagine a fleet of 100 Hubble Space Telescopes, deployed in a strategic space-invader-shaped array a million miles from Earth, scanning the universe at warp speed. With NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, this vision will (effectively) become reality. WFIRST will capture the equivalent of 100 high-resolution Hubble images in a single shot, imaging large areas of the sky 1,000 times faster than Hubble. In several months, WFIRST could survey as much of the sky in near-infrared light - in just as much detail - as Hubble has over its entire three decades. Elisa Quintana, WFIRST Deputy Project Scientist for Communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is confident that WFIRST will have the power to transform astrophysics. \"To answer fundamental questions like: How common are planets like those in our solar system? How do galaxies form, evolve, and interact? Exactly how - and why - has the universe's expansion rate changed over time? We need a tool that can give us both a broad and detailed view of the sky. WFIRST will be that tool.\" Although WFIRST has not yet opened its wide, keen eyes on the universe, astronomers are already running simulations to demonstrate what it will be able to see and plan their observations. This simulated image of a portion of our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31), provides a preview of the vast expanse and fine detail that can be covered with just a single pointing of WFIRST. Using information gleaned from hundreds of Hubble observations, the simulated image covers a swath roughly 34,000 light-years across, showcasing the red and infrared light of more than 50 million individual stars detectable with WFIRST. While it may appear to be a somewhat haphazard arrangement of 18 separate images, the simulation actually represents a single shot. Eighteen square detectors, 4096 by 4096 pixels each, make up WFIRST's Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and give the telescope its unique window into space. With each pointing, WFIRST will cover an area roughly 1\u2153 times that of the full Moon. By comparison, each individual infrared Hubble image covers an area less than 1% of the full Moon. The Advantages of Speed: WFIRST is designed to collect the big data needed to tackle essential questions across a wide range of topics, including dark energy, exoplanets, and general astrophysics spanning from our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the observable universe. Over its 5-year planned lifetime, WFIRST is expected to amass more than 20 petabytes of information on thousands of planets, billions of stars, millions of galaxies, and the fundamental forces that govern the cosmos. For astronomers like Ben Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle, who generated the simulated data set for this image, WFIRST will provide a valuable opportunity to understand large nearby objects like Andromeda, which are otherwise extremely time-consuming to image because they take up such a large portion of the sky. \"We have spent the last couple of decades getting images at high resolution in small parts of nearby galaxies. With Hubble you get these really tantalizing glimpses of very complex nearby systems. With WFIRST, all of a sudden you can cover the whole thing without spending lots of time,\" Williams said. The ability to image such a large area will provide astronomers with important context needed to understand how stars form and how galaxies change over time. Williams explained that with a wide field, \"you get the individual stars, you get the structures they live in, and the structures that surround them in their environment.\" Julianne Dalcanton of the University of Washington, who led the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program that the simulated data are based on, also believes that WFIRST's combination of ultra-telephoto and super-wide-angle capabilities will be ground-breaking. \"The PHAT survey of Andromeda was a tremendous investment of time, requiring careful justification and forethought. This new simulation shows how easy an equivalent observation could be for WFIRST.\" WFIRST could survey Andromeda nearly 1,500 times faster than Hubble, building a panorama of the main disk of the galaxy in just a few hours. WFIRST's extraordinary survey speed is a result of its wide field of view, its agility, and its orbit. Williams explained that by covering more area in one field and being able to switch fields more quickly, \"you're avoiding all those overheads that are associated with repointing the telescope so many times.\" In addition, WFIRST's orbit one million miles out will provide a view that is generally unobstructed by Earth. While Hubble is often able to collect data during only half of its low-Earth orbit 350 miles up, WFIRST will be able to observe more-or-less continuously. Major Survey Programs: Because it can collect so much detailed data so quickly, WFIRST is ideally suited for large surveys. A significant portion of the mission will be dedicated to monitoring hundreds of thousands of distant galaxies for supernova explosions, which can be used to study dark energy and the expansion of the universe. Another major program will involve mapping the shapes and distribution of galaxies in order to better understand how the universe - including galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy - has evolved over the past 13+ billion years. WFIRST will also play an important role in the census of exoplanets. By monitoring the brightness of billions of stars in the Milky Way, astronomers expect to catch thousands of microlensing events - slight increases in brightness that occur when a planet passes between the telescope and a distant star. WFIRST's ability to detect planets that are relatively small or far from their own stars - as well as rogue planets, which don't orbit any star at all - will help fill major gaps in our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. Although microlensing will not give us the ability to see exoplanets directly, WFIRST will also carry a coronagraph, a technology demonstration instrument designed to block enough of the blinding starlight to make direct imaging and characterization of orbiting planets possible. These large surveys are also expected to reveal the unexpected: strange, transient phenomena that have never before been observed. \"If you cover a lot of the sky, you're going to find those rare things,\" explained Williams. Open-Access Data: Further broadening its potential impact, all of the data collected by WFIRST will be non-proprietary and immediately available to the public. Dalcanton underscored the importance of this aspect of the mission: \"Thousands of minds from across the globe are going to be able to think about that data and come up with new ways to use it.

The newly named Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, is set to launch in the mid-2020s. Dr. Roman is credited with making the Hubble Space Telescope a reality, leading to her nickname \"mother of Hubble.\" In the mid-1960s, she set up a committee of astronomers and engineers to envision a telescope that could accomplish important scientific goals. She convinced NASA and Congress that it was a priority to launch the most powerful space telescope the world had ever seen.

Thirty years ago, we couldn't even say for certain that exoplanets-planets around other stars-existed. Now, we know of more than 4,000, thanks in large part to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, which taught us that most stars in our galaxy have their own solar systems. Kepler found mostly large planets around dim stars. TESS, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is building on Kepler's survey work by hunting for smaller planets around brighter stars. Now it's time to complete the initial galactic exoplanet census by searching for even smaller, Earth-size, rocky worlds. NASA's tool to accomplish that is the Roman Space Telescope (RST), which will help us learn how unique our own solar system is, and bring us closer to finding an Earth-like planet that could support life as we know it. The Roman Space Telescope will launch in the mid-2020s on a five-year mission to survey 100 million stars and find 2,500 new exoplanets. Many will be rocky, Earth-size worlds. RST will also use a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph to directly image select planets, uncovering these worlds' compositions for the very first time. Only a handful of exoplanets have been imaged to date. Who is the Roman Space Telescope named after? Though originally referred to as the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), NASA renamed the mission in 2020 after Nancy Grace Roman, NASA's first chief astronomer. Roman, who died in 2018, set up a committee of astronomers and engineers in the 1960s to envision how in-space telescopes could revolutionize scientific research. Those efforts eventually led to the Hubble Space Telescope. What will the Roman Space Telescope do? The telescope will search for exoplanets using an extraordinary technique called microlensing. You can think of microlensing as Einstein's magnifying glass: planets, stars, and galaxies have such immense gravity fields, they can actually bend and magnify the light from other objects behind them, producing dramatic halos in space. When one star crosses in front of another as seen from Earth, the light from the background star is bent and magnified around the foreground star. If that foreground star has planets around it, it will bend and magnify the background starlight further, producing spikes in the amount of light we see from Earth. Scientists will examine survey images from RST to look for these microlensing events, allowing them to detect even small, rocky exoplanets. RST's camera is just as sensitive as the Hubble Space Telescope's, but with a field of view 100 times bigger. That means no matter what RST is looking at, it will be able to collect a lot more data at one time. RST will also examine certain individual stars using a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph. Because exoplanets are millions of times dimmer than their host stars, trying to image them directly is like taking a picture of a firefly next to a spotlight. A coronagraph blocks the host star's light, allowing us to see exoplanets directly. The Roman Space Telescope is also an astrophysics mission that will help scientists search for dark energy, a mysterious force that may be causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. RST will study dark energy by mapping the distribution of matter in the cosmos and measuring how the universe has expanded over time. The Roman Space Telescope will be able to detect some of the light wavelengths coming from the exoplanets it directly images. This will tell scientists more about the composition of the exoplanets' atmospheres. It will work best on Jupiter-size planets, meaning we probably won't be able to peer into the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. However, RST's coronagraph is specifically meant to test coronagraph technology for future missions. Scientists have proposed using giant star shades to block the light from stars so perfectly that we can directly image Earth-sized planets to look for signs of life.

Kepler found mostly large planets around dim stars. TESS, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is building on Kepler's survey work by hunting for smaller planets around brighter stars. Now it's time to complete the initial galactic exoplanet census by searching for even smaller, Earth-size, rocky worlds. NASA's tool to accomplish that is the Roman Space Telescope (RST), which will help us learn how unique our own solar system is, and bring us closer to finding an Earth-like planet that could support life as we know it. The Roman Space Telescope will launch in the mid-2020s on a five-year mission to survey 100 million stars and find 2,500 new exoplanets. Many will be rocky, Earth-size worlds. RST will also use a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph to directly image select planets, uncovering these worlds' compositions for the very first time. Only a handful of exoplanets have been imaged to date. Who is the Roman Space Telescope named after? Though originally referred to as the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), NASA renamed the mission in 2020 after Nancy Grace Roman, NASA's first chief astronomer. Roman, who died in 2018, set up a committee of astronomers and engineers in the 1960s to envision how in-space telescopes could revolutionize scientific research. Those efforts eventually led to the Hubble Space Telescope. What will the Roman Space Telescope do? The telescope will search for exoplanets using an extraordinary technique called microlensing. You can think of microlensing as Einstein's magnifying glass: planets, stars, and galaxies have such immense gravity fields, they can actually bend and magnify the light from other objects behind them, producing dramatic halos in space. When one star crosses in front of another as seen from Earth, the light from the background star is bent and magnified around the foreground star. If that foreground star has planets around it, it will bend and magnify the background starlight further, producing spikes in the amount of light we see from Earth. Scientists will examine survey images from RST to look for these microlensing events, allowing them to detect even small, rocky exoplanets. RST's camera is just as sensitive as the Hubble Space Telescope's, but with a field of view 100 times bigger. That means no matter what RST is looking at, it will be able to collect a lot more data at one time. RST will also examine certain individual stars using a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph. Because exoplanets are millions of times dimmer than their host stars, trying to image them directly is like taking a picture of a firefly next to a spotlight. A coronagraph blocks the host star's light, allowing us to see exoplanets directly. The Roman Space Telescope is also an astrophysics mission that will help scientists search for dark energy, a mysterious force that may be causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. RST will study dark energy by mapping the distribution of matter in the cosmos and measuring how the universe has expanded over time. The Roman Space Telescope will be able to detect some of the light wavelengths coming from the exoplanets it directly images. This will tell scientists more about the composition of the exoplanets' atmospheres. It will work best on Jupiter-size planets, meaning we probably won't be able to peer into the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. However, RST's coronagraph is specifically meant to test coronagraph technology for future missions. Scientists have proposed using giant star shades to block the light from stars so perfectly that we can directly image Earth-sized planets to look for signs of life.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope passed a key ground-system design review this month, according to NASA. Roman, as the telescope is called in short, relies on technology that was originally built for spy missions on Earth. Instead, after its launch in the mid-2020s, Roman will spy on exoplanets across the galaxy, as well as many other cosmic phenomena. Roman will be optimized for a kind of planetary survey called microlensing, which is an observational effect that happens when mass warps the fabric of space-time. At its most extreme, this kind of gravitational lensing is used to observe very massive objects such as galaxies or black holes. In miniature, however, microlensing creates enough \"warping\" in smaller stars and planets for planet- hunting. At this smaller scale, microlensing happens when one star aligns closely with a second star, from the vantage point of Earth. The star that is closer to our planet focuses and amplifies the light from the star that is further away, allowing scientists to see it in a little more detail than usual. Even planets that are orbiting the foreground star can magnify the star's light, creating a spike in brightness. Roman's microlensing capabilities will be coupled with a wide field of view that is 100 times larger than Hubble's, while capturing stars and planets with the same resolution as the famed telescope. NASA expects Roman to pick up more data than any of the agency's other astrophysics missions. Roman's efforts will build on other NASA missions optimized for planet- hunting, including the past Kepler mission that found thousands of exoplanets and the current Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite looking for Earth-like planets close to us. Hubble, while not designed for planet-hunting since it launched just when discoveries were beginning, has done plenty of exoplanet science as well. Numerous observatories on Earth have found their own planets or confirmed observations made by space telescopes, creating a larger community of exoplanet science that Roman will contribute to after its launch. \"With such a large number of stars and frequent observations, Roman's microlensing survey will see thousands of planetary events,\" Rachel Akeson, task lead for the Roman Science Support Center at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, said in a NASA statement. \"Each one will have a unique signature, which we can use to determine the planet's mass and distance from its star.\" Gathering the data is one challenge. Parsing and understanding the information for discoveries and \"lessons learned\" is another. The ground systems supporting Roman will rely on cloud-based remote services and advanced analytical tools to make sense of the enormous amounts of data the telescope collects: Roman's design calls for the telescope to watch hundreds of millions of stars every 15 minutes for several months at a stretch. Another notable change from previous flagship missions is the speed at which Roman's data will become public; NASA has promised to make all data available only days after observations are collected. \"Since scientists everywhere will have rapid access to the data, they will be able to quickly discover short-lived phenomena, such as supernova explosions. Detecting these phenomena quickly will allow other telescopes to perform follow-up observations,\" NASA added in the same statement. Exoplanets and supernovas are not the only things Roman will discover. It will hunt for brown dwarfs, which are \"failed stars\". Other expected astronomy targets include runaway stars and bizarre cosmic objects such as the neutron stars and black holes that are left behind when stars run out of fuel. Roman will also join other observatories in trying to figure out the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which is impossible to observe except through monitoring effects on other objects. Roman's observations will allow the telescope collect precise measurements from numerous galaxies, mapping the distribution and structure of regular matter and dark matter across the universe's history. Among other applications, Roman's work in dark energy and dark matter could help scientists understand why the universe is expanding, and why that expansion is accelerating as the universe gets bigger. That discovery of acceleration got an assist from Hubble in the 1990s, eventually leading to a Nobel Prize in 2011. Another Roman partnership with its predecessor will be follow up on Hubble's Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. This survey charted how galaxies develop over time ; Hubble took 21 days to gather the information, but Roman will only take half an hour to conduct a similar investigation. \"With its incredibly fast survey speeds, Roman will observe planets by the thousands, galaxies by the millions, and stars by the billions,\" Karoline Gilbert, mission scientist for the Roman Science Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the same NASA statement. \"These vast datasets will allow us to address cosmic mysteries that hint at new fundamental physics.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-roman-space-telescope-exoplanet-search.html"}, {"title": "\"Our Solar System May Be Unusual\": Rogue Planets Unveiled With NASA's Roman Space Telescope", "date": "2020-08-23", "content": "New simulations show that NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be able to reveal myriad rogue planets - freely floating bodies that drift through our galaxy untethered to a star. Studying these island worlds will help us understand more about how planetary systems form, evolve, and break apart. Astronomers discovered planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, in the 1990s. We quickly went from knowing of only our own planetary system to realizing that planets likely outnumber the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. Now, a team of scientists is finding ways to improve our understanding of planet demographics by searching for rogue worlds. \"As our view of the universe has expanded, we've realized that our solar system may be unusual,\" said Samson Johnson, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus who led the research effort. \"Roman will help us learn more about how we fit in the cosmic scheme of things by studying rogue planets.\" The findings, published in the Astronomical Journal, center on the Roman Space Telescope's ability to locate and characterize isolated planets. Astronomers have only tentatively discovered a few of these nomad worlds so far because they are so difficult to detect. Finding galactic nomads: Roman will find rogue planets by conducting a large microlensing survey. Gravitational lensing is an observational effect that occurs because the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time. The effect is extreme around very massive objects, like black holes and entire galaxies. Even solitary planets cause a detectable degree of warping, called microlensing. If a rogue planet aligns closely with a more distant star from our vantage point, the star's light will bend as it travels through the curved space-time around the planet. The result is that the planet acts like a natural magnifying glass, amplifying light from the background star. Astronomers see the effect as a spike in the star's brightness as the star and planet come into alignment. Measuring how the spike changes over time reveals clues to the rogue planet's mass. \"The microlensing signal from a rogue planet only lasts between a few hours and a couple of days and then is gone forever,\" said co-author Matthew Penny, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"This makes them difficult to observe from Earth, even with multiple telescopes. Roman is a game-changer for rogue planet searches.\" Microlensing offers the best way to systematically search for rogue planets - especially those with low masses. They don't shine like stars and are often very cool objects, emitting too little heat for infrared telescopes to see. These vagabond worlds are essentially invisible, but Roman will discover them indirectly thanks to their gravitational effects on the light of more distant stars. Lessons from cosmic castaways: Johnson and co-authors showed that Roman will be able to detect rogue planets with masses as small as Mars. Studying these planets will help narrow down competing models of planetary formation. The planet-building process can be chaotic, since smaller objects collide with one another and sometimes stick together to form larger bodies. It's similar to using a piece of playdough to pick up other pieces. But occasionally collisions and close encounters can be so violent that they fling a planet out of the gravitational grip of its parent star. Unless it manages to drag a moon along with it, the newly orphaned world is doomed to wander the galaxy alone. Rogue planets may also form in isolation from clouds of gas and dust, similar to how stars grow. A small cloud of gas and dust could collapse to form a central planet instead of a star, with moons instead of planets surrounding it. Roman will test planetary formation and evolution models that predict different numbers of these isolated worlds. Determining the abundance and masses of rogue planets will offer insight into the physics that drives their formation. The research team found that the mission will provide a rogue planet count that is at least 10 times more precise than current estimates, which range from tens of billions to trillions in our galaxy. These estimates mainly come from observations by ground-based telescopes. Since Roman will observe above the atmosphere, nearly a million miles away from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun, it will yield far superior microlensing results. In addition to providing a sharper view, Roman's perspective will allow it to stare at the same patch of sky continuously for months at a time. Johnson and his colleagues showed that Roman's microlensing survey will detect hundreds of rogue planets, even though it will search only a relatively narrow strip of the galaxy. Part of the study involved determining how to analyze the mission's future data to obtain a more accurate census. Scientists will be able to extrapolate from Roman's rogue planet count to estimate how common these objects are throughout the entire galaxy. \"The universe could be teeming with rogue planets and we wouldn't even know it,\" said Scott Gaudi, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and a co-author of the paper. \"We would never find out without undertaking a thorough, space-based microlensing survey like Roman is going to do.\" For more on this research, read Rogue Planets Could Outnumber the Stars .", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/our-solar-system-may-be-unusual-rogue-planets-unveiled-with-nasas-roman-space-telescope/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "WFIRST Telescope Named For 'Mother of Hubble' Nancy GRACE ROMAN", "date": "2020-05-20", "content": "Today, NASA announced that it is naming its next-generation space telescope, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, in honor of Dr. Nancy Grace Roman, NASA's first Chief Astronomer, who paved the way for space telescopes focused on the broader universe. The newly named Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, is set to launch in the mid-2020s. Dr. Roman is credited with making the Hubble Space Telescope a reality, leading to her nickname \"mother of Hubble.\" In the mid-1960s, she set up a committee of astronomers and engineers to envision a telescope that could accomplish important scientific goals. She convinced NASA and Congress that it was a priority to launch the most powerful space telescope the world had ever seen. She argued that, for the price of a movie ticket, each American could be given years of scientific discoveries. Her vision was realized when Hubble launched in 1990. Hubble turned out to be the most scientifically revolutionary space telescope of all time. STScI and the Roman Space Telescope: The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, is the science operations center for Hubble, and will house the science and mission operations centers for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. In 2019, NASA announced that STScI would serve as the science operations center for the Roman Space Telescope. In that role, the Institute will plan, schedule, and carry out observations, process and archive mission datasets, and engage and inform the astronomical community and the public. \"Dr. Nancy Grace Roman was an accomplished scientist and leader, as well as a staunch advocate of Hubble and NASA's other Great Observatories. She also strongly backed the creation of STScI. We thought of her as a colleague and friend, and were delighted to welcome her to the Institute for our annual spring science symposium in 2017,\" said STScI Director Kenneth Sembach. \"We are honored to be part of her continuing legacy. Our entire team stands ready to support the astronomical community and ensure that the Roman Space Telescope will achieve its full scientific potential,\" he added. All of the data collected by the Roman Space Telescope will be held in the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI and made immediately available for any investigation. Astronomers around the world will be able to mine data from these archives to conduct a broad range of studies, greatly increasing the impact of the mission. The observatory will collect an estimated 20 petabytes of data over its planned 5-year mission - the equivalent of a 40,000-year-long song in mp3 format. \"The Roman Space Telescope will bring big data to space astrophysics. The large and freely accessible data sets will inspire new ways of exploring the cosmos, advancing our understanding and presenting new mysteries,\" said STScI Deputy Director Nancy Levenson. The Science of the Roman Space Telescope: The Roman Space Telescope will have the same sensitivity and resolution as the Hubble Space Telescope, but will have a viewing area 100 times bigger than Hubble. Each single image from Roman will encompass an area of the sky that is larger than the size of the full Moon as seen from Earth. It will survey the sky in infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes. Infrared light provides a powerful tool for exploring the cosmos because it penetrates dust clouds that block visible and higher-energy light from view. The Roman Space Telescope will work in concert with the James Webb Space Telescope to yield greater insights than either telescope could achieve on its own. Its wide field of view will reveal diverse populations of astronomical objects and net a bounty of intriguing targets for Webb to follow up on with unprecedented sensitivity. Like Hubble and the other NASA Great Observatories, the Roman Space Telescope will contribute to advances across the field of astrophysics. It will image stars and gas in our own galaxy, measuring its structure, surveying the birthplaces of stars, and finding telltale signs of smaller galaxies torn apart by interactions with the Milky Way. It will investigate new dwarf planets, comets, and asteroids in our solar system. It will also image large clusters of galaxies, characterize the dark matter around them, and discover thousands of galaxies at very high redshifts, which will provide the tools to study how galaxies evolve over cosmic time. The Roman Space Telescope will deliver new insights into the history and structure of the universe, including the mysterious \"dark energy\" that is making space itself expand faster and faster. This powerful new observatory will also build on the broad foundation of work begun with Hubble and other observatories on planets outside our solar system. It will discover thousands of exoplanets using its wide-field camera and study the atmospheres of giant gaseous planets orbiting other stars with a sophisticated technology demonstration coronagraph. Ultimately the telescope that bears Dr. Nancy Grace Roman's name will allow researchers to do what she once said: TEST. \"If you enjoy puzzles, science or engineering may be the field for you, because scientific research and engineering is a continuous series of solving puzzles.\"", "url": "https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2020/news-2020-35"}, {"title": "NASA Renames Its WFIRST Hubble Telescope After Astronomer Nancy Grace Roman", "date": "2020-05-26", "content": "NASA has renamed its Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, a next-generation space telescope set to launch in 2025, in honour of Nancy Grace Roman, the US space agency's first chief astronomer, who paved the way for space telescopes focused on the broader universe. The newly named Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope - or Roman Space Telescope, for short - will investigate long-standing astronomical mysteries, such as the force behind the universe's expansion, and search for distant planets beyond our solar system, NASA said on Wednesday. Considered the \"mother\" of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which launched 30 years ago, Roman tirelessly advocated for new tools that would allow scientists to study the broader universe from space. She left behind a tremendous legacy in the scientific community when she died in 2018. \"It is because of Nancy Grace Roman's leadership and vision that NASA became a pioneer in astrophysics and launched Hubble, the world's most powerful and productive space telescope,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"I can think of no better name for WFIRST, which will be the successor to NASA's Hubble and Webb Telescopes.\" Who was Nancy Grace Roman? Born on May 16, 1925, in Nashville, Tennessee, Roman consistently persevered in the face of challenges that plagued many women of her generation interested in science. By seventh grade, she knew she wanted to be an astronomer. Despite being discouraged about going into science, Roman earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy from Swarthmore in 1946 and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1949. The head of Swarthmore College's physics department told her he usually dissuaded girls from majoring in physics, but thought that she \"might make it\". Knowing that her chances of achieving tenure at a university as a woman were slim at that time, she took a position at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and made strides in researching cosmic questions through radio waves. Roman came to NASA in 1959, just six months after the agency had been established. At that time, she served as the chief of astronomy and relativity in the Office of Space Science, managing astronomy-related programmes and grants. \"I knew that taking on this responsibility would mean that I could no longer do research, but the challenge of formulating a programme from scratch that I believed would influence astronomy for decades to come was too great to resist,\" she said in a NASA interview. This was a difficult era for women who wanted to advance in scientific research. While Roman said that men generally treated her equally at NASA, she also revealed in one interview that she had to use the prefix \"Dr.\" with her name because \"otherwise, I could not get past the secretaries.\" But she persisted in her vision to establish new ways to probe the secrets of the universe. Through Roman's leadership, NASA launched four Orbiting Astronomical Observatories between 1966 and 1972. While only two of the four were successful, they demonstrated the value of space-based astrophysics and represented the precursors to Hubble. Roman is credited with making the Hubble Space Telescope a reality. It turned out to be the most scientifically revolutionary space telescope of all time.

A small cloud of gas and dust could collapse to form a central planet instead of a star, with moons instead of planets surrounding it. Roman will test planetary formation and evolution models that predict different numbers of these isolated worlds. Determining the abundance and masses of rogue planets will offer insight into the physics that drives their formation. The research team found that the mission will provide a rogue planet count that is at least 10 times more precise than current estimates, which range from tens of billions to trillions in our galaxy. These estimates mainly come from observations by ground-based telescopes. Since Roman will observe above the atmosphere, nearly a million miles away from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun, it will yield far superior microlensing results. In addition to providing a sharper view, Roman's perspective will allow it to stare at the same patch of sky continuously for months at a time. Johnson and his colleagues showed that Roman's microlensing survey will detect hundreds of rogue planets, even though it will search only a relatively narrow strip of the galaxy. Part of the study involved determining how to analyze the mission's future data to obtain a more accurate census. Scientists will be able to extrapolate from Roman's rogue planet count to estimate how common these objects are throughout the entire galaxy. \"The universe could be teeming with rogue planets and we wouldn't even know it,\" said Scott Gaudi, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and a co-author of the paper. \"We would never find out without undertaking a thorough, space-based microlensing survey like Roman is going to do.\" For more on this research, read Rogue Planets Could Outnumber the Stars .", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/our-solar-system-may-be-unusual-rogue-planets-unveiled-with-nasas-roman-space-telescope/"}, {"title": "Primary Mirror for NASA's Roman Space Telescope Completed", "date": "2020-09-03", "content": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's primary mirror, which will collect and focus light from cosmic objects near and far, has been completed. Using this mirror, Roman will capture stunning space vistas with a field of view 100 times greater than Hubble images. \"Achieving this milestone is very exciting,\" said Scott Smith, Roman telescope manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it's especially true in our current challenging environment. Everyone plays a role in collecting that first image and answering inspiring questions.\" Roman will peer through dust and across vast stretches of space and time to study the universe using infrared light, which human eyes can't see. The amount of detail these observations will reveal is directly related to the size of the telescope's mirror, since a larger surface gathers more light and measures finer features. Roman's primary mirror is 7.9 feet (2.4 meters) across. While it's the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror, it is less than one-fourth the weight. Roman's mirror weighs only 410 pounds (186 kilograms) thanks to major improvements in technology. The primary mirror, in concert with other optics, will send light to Roman's two science instruments - the Wide Field Instrument and Coronagraph Instrument. The first is essentially a giant 300-megapixel camera that provides the same sharp resolution as Hubble across nearly 100 times the field of view. Using this instrument, scientists will be able to map the structure and distribution of invisible dark matter, study planetary systems around other stars, and explore how the universe evolved to its present state. The coronagraph demonstrates technology that blocks out the glare of stars and allows astronomers to directly image planets in orbit around them. If the coronagraph technology performs as anticipated, it will see planets that are almost a billion times fainter than their host star and enable detailed studies of giant planets around other suns. Roman will observe from a vantage point about 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun. Roman's barrel-like shape will help block out unwanted light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and the spacecraft's distant location will help keep the instruments cool, ensuring that it will be able to detect faint infrared signals. Because it will experience a range of temperatures between manufacture and testing on Earth and operations in space, the primary mirror is made of a specialty ultralow-expansion glass. Most materials expand and contract when temperatures change, but if the primary mirror changed shape it would distort the images from the telescope. Roman's mirror and its support structure are designed to reduce flexing, which will preserve the quality of its observations. Development of the mirror is much further along than it would typically be at this stage since the mission leverages a mirror that was transferred to NASA from the National Reconnaissance Office. The team modified the mirror's shape and surface to meet Roman's science objectives. The newly resurfaced mirror sports a layer of silver less than 400 nanometers thick - about 200 times thinner than a human hair. The silver coating was specifically chosen for Roman because of how well it reflects near-infrared light. By contrast, Hubble's mirror is coated with layers of aluminum and magnesium fluoride to optimize visible and ultraviolet light reflectivity. Likewise, the James Webb Space Telescope's mirrors have a gold coating to suit its longer wavelength infrared observations. Roman's mirror is so finely polished that the average bump on its surface is only 1.2 nanometers tall - more than twice as smooth as the mission requires. If the mirror were scaled to be Earth's size, these bumps would be just a quarter of an inch high. \"The mirror was precisely finished to the Roman Space Telescope's optical prescription,\" said Bonnie Patterson, program manager at L3Harris Technologies in Rochester, New York. \"Since it's so much smoother than required, it will provide even greater scientific benefit than originally planned.\" Next, the mirror will be mounted for additional testing at L3Harris. It has already been extensively tested at both cold and ambient temperatures. The new tests will be done with the mirror attached to its support structure. \"Roman's primary mirror is complete, yet our work isn't over,\" said Smith. \"We're excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal.\" The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is managed at Goddard, with participation by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, and a science team comprising scientists from research institutions across the United States.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/primary-mirror-for-nasas-roman-space-telescope-completed"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Roman Space Telescope, investigating dark energy and dark matter", "date": "2020-07-31", "content": "Why do we need the Roman Space Telescope? Thirty years ago, we couldn't even say for certain that exoplanets-planets around other stars-existed. Now, we know of more than 4,000, thanks in large part to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, which taught us that most stars in our galaxy have their own solar systems. Kepler found mostly large planets around dim stars. TESS, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is building on Kepler's survey work by hunting for smaller planets around brighter stars. Now it's time to complete the initial galactic exoplanet census by searching for even smaller, Earth-size, rocky worlds. NASA's tool to accomplish that is the Roman Space Telescope (RST), which will help us learn how unique our own solar system is, and bring us closer to finding an Earth-like planet that could support life as we know it. The Roman Space Telescope will launch in the mid-2020s on a five-year mission to survey 100 million stars and find 2,500 new exoplanets. Many will be rocky, Earth-size worlds. RST will also use a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph to directly image select planets, uncovering these worlds' compositions for the very first time. Only a handful of exoplanets have been imaged to date. Who is the Roman Space Telescope named after? Though originally referred to as the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), NASA renamed the mission in 2020 after Nancy Grace Roman, NASA's first chief astronomer. Roman, who died in 2018, set up a committee of astronomers and engineers in the 1960s to envision how in-space telescopes could revolutionize scientific research. Those efforts eventually led to the Hubble Space Telescope. What will the Roman Space Telescope do? The telescope will search for exoplanets using an extraordinary technique called microlensing. You can think of microlensing as Einstein's magnifying glass: planets, stars, and galaxies have such immense gravity fields, they can actually bend and magnify the light from other objects behind them, producing dramatic halos in space. When one star crosses in front of another as seen from Earth, the light from the background star is bent and magnified around the foreground star. If that foreground star has planets around it, it will bend and magnify the background starlight further, producing spikes in the amount of light we see from Earth. Scientists will examine survey images from RST to look for these microlensing events, allowing them to detect even small, rocky exoplanets. RST's camera is just as sensitive as the Hubble Space Telescope's, but with a field of view 100 times bigger. That means no matter what RST is looking at, it will be able to collect a lot more data at one time. RST will also examine certain individual stars using a light-blocking disc called a coronagraph. Because exoplanets are millions of times dimmer than their host stars, trying to image them directly is like taking a picture of a firefly next to a spotlight. A coronagraph blocks the host star's light, allowing us to see exoplanets directly. The Roman Space Telescope is also an astrophysics mission that will help scientists search for dark energy, a mysterious force that may be causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. RST will study dark energy by mapping the distribution of matter in the cosmos and measuring how the universe has expanded over time. The Roman Space Telescope will be able to detect some of the light wavelengths coming from the exoplanets it directly images. This will tell scientists more about the composition of the exoplanets' atmospheres. It will work best on Jupiter-size planets, meaning we probably won't be able to peer into the atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. However, RST's coronagraph is specifically meant to test coronagraph technology for future missions. Scientists have proposed using giant star shades to block the light from stars so perfectly that we can directly image Earth-sized planets to look for signs of life.

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope passed a key ground-system design review this month, according to NASA. Roman, as the telescope is called in short, relies on technology that was originally built for spy missions on Earth. Instead, after its launch in the mid-2020s, Roman will spy on exoplanets across the galaxy, as well as many other cosmic phenomena. Roman will be optimized for a kind of planetary survey called microlensing, which is an observational effect that happens when mass warps the fabric of space-time. At its most extreme, this kind of gravitational lensing is used to observe very massive objects such as galaxies or black holes. In miniature, however, microlensing creates enough \"warping\" in smaller stars and planets for planet- hunting. At this smaller scale, microlensing happens when one star aligns closely with a second star, from the vantage point of Earth. The star that is closer to our planet focuses and amplifies the light from the star that is further away, allowing scientists to see it in a little more detail than usual. Even planets that are orbiting the foreground star can magnify the star's light, creating a spike in brightness. Roman's microlensing capabilities will be coupled with a wide field of view that is 100 times larger than Hubble's, while capturing stars and planets with the same resolution as the famed telescope. NASA expects Roman to pick up more data than any of the agency's other astrophysics missions. Roman's efforts will build on other NASA missions optimized for planet- hunting, including the past Kepler mission that found thousands of exoplanets and the current Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite looking for Earth-like planets close to us. Hubble, while not designed for planet-hunting since it launched just when discoveries were beginning, has done plenty of exoplanet science as well. Numerous observatories on Earth have found their own planets or confirmed observations made by space telescopes, creating a larger community of exoplanet science that Roman will contribute to after its launch. \"With such a large number of stars and frequent observations, Roman's microlensing survey will see thousands of planetary events,\" Rachel Akeson, task lead for the Roman Science Support Center at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, said in a NASA statement. \"Each one will have a unique signature, which we can use to determine the planet's mass and distance from its star.\" Gathering the data is one challenge. Parsing and understanding the information for discoveries and \"lessons learned\" is another. The ground systems supporting Roman will rely on cloud-based remote services and advanced analytical tools to make sense of the enormous amounts of data the telescope collects: Roman's design calls for the telescope to watch hundreds of millions of stars every 15 minutes for several months at a stretch. Another notable change from previous flagship missions is the speed at which Roman's data will become public; NASA has promised to make all data available only days after observations are collected. \"Since scientists everywhere will have rapid access to the data, they will be able to quickly discover short-lived phenomena, such as supernova explosions. Detecting these phenomena quickly will allow other telescopes to perform follow-up observations,\" NASA added in the same statement. Exoplanets and supernovas are not the only things Roman will discover. It will hunt for brown dwarfs, which are \"failed stars\". Other expected astronomy targets include runaway stars and bizarre cosmic objects such as the neutron stars and black holes that are left behind when stars run out of fuel. Roman will also join other observatories in trying to figure out the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which is impossible to observe except through monitoring effects on other objects. Roman's observations will allow the telescope collect precise measurements from numerous galaxies, mapping the distribution and structure of regular matter and dark matter across the universe's history. Among other applications, Roman's work in dark energy and dark matter could help scientists understand why the universe is expanding, and why that expansion is accelerating as the universe gets bigger. That discovery of acceleration got an assist from Hubble in the 1990s, eventually leading to a Nobel Prize in 2011. Another Roman partnership with its predecessor will be follow up on Hubble's Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. This survey charted how galaxies develop over time ; Hubble took 21 days to gather the information, but Roman will only take half an hour to conduct a similar investigation. \"With its incredibly fast survey speeds, Roman will observe planets by the thousands, galaxies by the millions, and stars by the billions,\" Karoline Gilbert, mission scientist for the Roman Science Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the same NASA statement. \"These vast datasets will allow us to address cosmic mysteries that hint at new fundamental physics.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-roman-space-telescope-exoplanet-search.html"}, {"title": "\"Our Solar System May Be Unusual\": Rogue Planets Unveiled With NASA's Roman Space Telescope", "date": "2020-08-23", "content": "New simulations show that NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be able to reveal myriad rogue planets - freely floating bodies that drift through our galaxy untethered to a star. Studying these island worlds will help us understand more about how planetary systems form, evolve, and break apart. Astronomers discovered planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, in the 1990s. We quickly went from knowing of only our own planetary system to realizing that planets likely outnumber the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. Now, a team of scientists is finding ways to improve our understanding of planet demographics by searching for rogue worlds. \"As our view of the universe has expanded, we've realized that our solar system may be unusual,\" said Samson Johnson, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus who led the research effort. \"Roman will help us learn more about how we fit in the cosmic scheme of things by studying rogue planets.\" The findings, published in the Astronomical Journal, center on the Roman Space Telescope's ability to locate and characterize isolated planets. Astronomers have only tentatively discovered a few of these nomad worlds so far because they are so difficult to detect. Finding galactic nomads: Roman will find rogue planets by conducting a large microlensing survey. Gravitational lensing is an observational effect that occurs because the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time. The effect is extreme around very massive objects, like black holes and entire galaxies. Even solitary planets cause a detectable degree of warping, called microlensing. If a rogue planet aligns closely with a more distant star from our vantage point, the star's light will bend as it travels through the curved space-time around the planet. The result is that the planet acts like a natural magnifying glass, amplifying light from the background star. Astronomers see the effect as a spike in the star's brightness as the star and planet come into alignment. Measuring how the spike changes over time reveals clues to the rogue planet's mass. \"The microlensing signal from a rogue planet only lasts between a few hours and a couple of days and then is gone forever,\" said co-author Matthew Penny, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"This makes them difficult to observe from Earth, even with multiple telescopes. Roman is a game-changer for rogue planet searches.\" Microlensing offers the best way to systematically search for rogue planets - especially those with low masses. They don't shine like stars and are often very cool objects, emitting too little heat for infrared telescopes to see. These vagabond worlds are essentially invisible, but Roman will discover them indirectly thanks to their gravitational effects on the light of more distant stars. Lessons from cosmic castaways: Johnson and co-authors showed that Roman will be able to detect rogue planets with masses as small as Mars. Studying these planets will help narrow down competing models of planetary formation. The planet-building process can be chaotic, since smaller objects collide with one another and sometimes stick together to form larger bodies. It's similar to using a piece of playdough to pick up other pieces. But occasionally collisions and close encounters can be so violent that they fling a planet out of the gravitational grip of its parent star. Unless it manages to drag a moon along with it, the newly orphaned world is doomed to wander the galaxy alone. Rogue planets may also form in isolation from clouds of gas and dust, similar to how stars grow. A small cloud of gas and dust could collapse to form a central planet instead of a star, with moons instead of planets surrounding it. Roman will test planetary formation and evolution models that predict different numbers of these isolated worlds.

According to new simulations, Roman's observations could extend these measurements into an unprobed epoch between the universe's infancy and the present day. Studying the echoes from this era will help us trace the evolution of the universe and solve pressing cosmic conundrums. Sound waves from the nascent universe, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), left their imprint on the cosmos by influencing galaxy distribution. Researchers have explored this imprint back to when the universe was three billion years old, or roughly 20% of its current age of 13.8 billion years - the same epoch Roman's BAO studies are optimized to investigate. Now a team of scientists has demonstrated that the mission could peer even farther back in time to explore impressions left by BAOs. \"This isn't something you can study in a lab, so we created mock universes and ran simulations,\" said Siddharth Satpathy, who led the study. Now a machine-learning engineer at Cisco in San Francisco, he conducted this research while earning a doctorate in computational astrophysics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"We were excited to find that Roman will be powerful enough to study BAO remnants in the universe's youth,\" he added. The team's findings were published Sept. 11 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Hot plasma soup: For most of its first half-million years, the universe looked extremely different than it does today. Instead of being speckled with stars and galaxies, the cosmos was filled with a sea of plasma - charged particles - that formed a dense, almost uniform fluid. There were tiny fluctuations of about one part in 100,000. What few variations there were took the form of slightly denser kernels of matter, like a single ounce of cinnamon sprinkled into about 13,000 cups of cookie dough. Since the clumps had more mass, their gravity attracted additional material. It was so hot that particles couldn't stick together when they collided - they just bounced off each other. Alternating between the pull of gravity and this repelling effect created waves of pressure - sound - that propagated through the plasma. Over time, the universe cooled and particles combined to form neutral atoms. Because the particles stopped repelling each other, the waves ceased. Their traces, however, still linger, etched on the cosmos. Frozen echoes: When atoms formed, the ripples essentially froze in place, carrying within them a bit more matter than the average across the universe. With the repulsive pressure of the plasma gone, gravity became the dominant force. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, clumps from the plasma that once filled the universe slurped up more material to become stars. Their mutual gravity pulled stars together into groups, ultimately forming the galaxies we see today. And slightly more galaxies formed along the ripples than elsewhere. While the waves no longer propagated, the frozen ripples stretched as the universe expanded, increasing the distance between galaxies. By looking at how galaxies are spread out in different cosmic epochs, we can explore how the universe has expanded over time. \"BAOs have left their mark on the cosmos, but we haven't fully examined their traces,\" said co-author Rupert Croft, a professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University. \"By studying BAO impressions in an unprobed region, we can excavate cosmic fossils, which will allow us to unearth new information about the forces that have shaped the universe.\" Scientists have noticed a pattern in the way galaxies cluster together from measurements of the nearby universe. For any galaxy today, we are more likely to find another galaxy about 500 million light-years away than slightly nearer or farther. But looking farther out into space, to earlier cosmic times, means that this distance - the vestige of the frozen BAO ripples - will decrease. Roman will extend previous research by mapping the expansion of the universe to unprecedented detail. Satpathy and his team showed that Roman's surveys will be able to probe for BAO remnants five times farther than originally planned, back to when the universe was only about 600 million years old - just 4% of its current age. Learning more about the way the cosmos has expanded over time will allow scientists to explore dark energy - a mysterious pressure that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. Roman is optimized to survey the cosmos for BAO impressions across the middle of its current age because that's when scientists think dark energy transitioned from being a minor contributor to the contents of the universe to the most dominant force. But some theories hypothesize a bout of dark energy activity when the universe was much younger. Peering farther into the universe's past will help add pieces to the puzzle. \"We haven't extensively explored BAO imprints from when the universe was very young because we need an enormous sample of galaxies to do so,\" said Jason Rhodes, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. \"That's where Roman comes in. The mission has such a wide field of view that observations like this will become possible.\" Roman's High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey will measure accurate distances and positions for millions of galaxies. Scientists plan to analyze how their distribution varies with distance by creating a 3D map of the universe, which will help us decipher how dark energy has shaped the cosmos over time. Two additional Roman surveys will also study dark energy, and each technique will cross-check the others. The mission will provide important data to help scientists investigate, and possibly even foresee, the universe's fate.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-roman-space-telescope-to-uncover-echoes-of-the-universe-s-creation"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will send the hunt for exoplanets into warp speed", "date": "2020-08-04", "content": "A new NASA space observatory could push planet-hunting forward at warp speed by gathering data up to 500 times faster than the venerable Hubble Space Telescope does.

Roman will also join other observatories in trying to figure out the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which is impossible to observe except through monitoring effects on other objects. Roman's observations will allow the telescope collect precise measurements from numerous galaxies, mapping the distribution and structure of regular matter and dark matter across the universe's history. Among other applications, Roman's work in dark energy and dark matter could help scientists understand why the universe is expanding, and why that expansion is accelerating as the universe gets bigger. That discovery of acceleration got an assist from Hubble in the 1990s, eventually leading to a Nobel Prize in 2011. Another Roman partnership with its predecessor will be follow up on Hubble's Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. This survey charted how galaxies develop over time ; Hubble took 21 days to gather the information, but Roman will only take half an hour to conduct a similar investigation. \"With its incredibly fast survey speeds, Roman will observe planets by the thousands, galaxies by the millions, and stars by the billions,\" Karoline Gilbert, mission scientist for the Roman Science Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the same NASA statement. \"These vast datasets will allow us to address cosmic mysteries that hint at new fundamental physics.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-roman-space-telescope-exoplanet-search.html"}, {"title": "\"Our Solar System May Be Unusual\": Rogue Planets Unveiled With NASA's Roman Space Telescope", "date": "2020-08-23", "content": "New simulations show that NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be able to reveal myriad rogue planets - freely floating bodies that drift through our galaxy untethered to a star. Studying these island worlds will help us understand more about how planetary systems form, evolve, and break apart. Astronomers discovered planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, in the 1990s. We quickly went from knowing of only our own planetary system to realizing that planets likely outnumber the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. Now, a team of scientists is finding ways to improve our understanding of planet demographics by searching for rogue worlds. \"As our view of the universe has expanded, we've realized that our solar system may be unusual,\" said Samson Johnson, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus who led the research effort. \"Roman will help us learn more about how we fit in the cosmic scheme of things by studying rogue planets.\" The findings, published in the Astronomical Journal, center on the Roman Space Telescope's ability to locate and characterize isolated planets. Astronomers have only tentatively discovered a few of these nomad worlds so far because they are so difficult to detect. Finding galactic nomads: Roman will find rogue planets by conducting a large microlensing survey. Gravitational lensing is an observational effect that occurs because the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time. The effect is extreme around very massive objects, like black holes and entire galaxies. Even solitary planets cause a detectable degree of warping, called microlensing. If a rogue planet aligns closely with a more distant star from our vantage point, the star's light will bend as it travels through the curved space-time around the planet. The result is that the planet acts like a natural magnifying glass, amplifying light from the background star. Astronomers see the effect as a spike in the star's brightness as the star and planet come into alignment. Measuring how the spike changes over time reveals clues to the rogue planet's mass. \"The microlensing signal from a rogue planet only lasts between a few hours and a couple of days and then is gone forever,\" said co-author Matthew Penny, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"This makes them difficult to observe from Earth, even with multiple telescopes. Roman is a game-changer for rogue planet searches.\" Microlensing offers the best way to systematically search for rogue planets - especially those with low masses. They don't shine like stars and are often very cool objects, emitting too little heat for infrared telescopes to see. These vagabond worlds are essentially invisible, but Roman will discover them indirectly thanks to their gravitational effects on the light of more distant stars. Lessons from cosmic castaways: Johnson and co-authors showed that Roman will be able to detect rogue planets with masses as small as Mars. Studying these planets will help narrow down competing models of planetary formation. The planet-building process can be chaotic, since smaller objects collide with one another and sometimes stick together to form larger bodies. It's similar to using a piece of playdough to pick up other pieces. But occasionally collisions and close encounters can be so violent that they fling a planet out of the gravitational grip of its parent star. Unless it manages to drag a moon along with it, the newly orphaned world is doomed to wander the galaxy alone. Rogue planets may also form in isolation from clouds of gas and dust, similar to how stars grow. A small cloud of gas and dust could collapse to form a central planet instead of a star, with moons instead of planets surrounding it. Roman will test planetary formation and evolution models that predict different numbers of these isolated worlds. Determining the abundance and masses of rogue planets will offer insight into the physics that drives their formation. The research team found that the mission will provide a rogue planet count that is at least 10 times more precise than current estimates, which range from tens of billions to trillions in our galaxy. These estimates mainly come from observations by ground-based telescopes. Since Roman will observe above the atmosphere, nearly a million miles away from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun, it will yield far superior microlensing results. In addition to providing a sharper view, Roman's perspective will allow it to stare at the same patch of sky continuously for months at a time. Johnson and his colleagues showed that Roman's microlensing survey will detect hundreds of rogue planets, even though it will search only a relatively narrow strip of the galaxy. Part of the study involved determining how to analyze the mission's future data to obtain a more accurate census. Scientists will be able to extrapolate from Roman's rogue planet count to estimate how common these objects are throughout the entire galaxy. \"The universe could be teeming with rogue planets and we wouldn't even know it,\" said Scott Gaudi, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and a co-author of the paper. \"We would never find out without undertaking a thorough, space-based microlensing survey like Roman is going to do.\" For more on this research, read Rogue Planets Could Outnumber the Stars .", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/our-solar-system-may-be-unusual-rogue-planets-unveiled-with-nasas-roman-space-telescope/"}, {"title": "Primary Mirror for NASA's Roman Space Telescope Completed", "date": "2020-09-03", "content": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's primary mirror, which will collect and focus light from cosmic objects near and far, has been completed. Using this mirror, Roman will capture stunning space vistas with a field of view 100 times greater than Hubble images. \"Achieving this milestone is very exciting,\" said Scott Smith, Roman telescope manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it's especially true in our current challenging environment. Everyone plays a role in collecting that first image and answering inspiring questions.\" Roman will peer through dust and across vast stretches of space and time to study the universe using infrared light, which human eyes can't see. The amount of detail these observations will reveal is directly related to the size of the telescope's mirror, since a larger surface gathers more light and measures finer features. Roman's primary mirror is 7.9 feet (2.4 meters) across. While it's the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope's main mirror, it is less than one-fourth the weight. Roman's mirror weighs only 410 pounds (186 kilograms) thanks to major improvements in technology. The primary mirror, in concert with other optics, will send light to Roman's two science instruments - the Wide Field Instrument and Coronagraph Instrument. The first is essentially a giant 300-megapixel camera that provides the same sharp resolution as Hubble across nearly 100 times the field of view. Using this instrument, scientists will be able to map the structure and distribution of invisible dark matter, study planetary systems around other stars, and explore how the universe evolved to its present state. The coronagraph demonstrates technology that blocks out the glare of stars and allows astronomers to directly image planets in orbit around them. If the coronagraph technology performs as anticipated, it will see planets that are almost a billion times fainter than their host star and enable detailed studies of giant planets around other suns. Roman will observe from a vantage point about 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun. Roman's barrel-like shape will help block out unwanted light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and the spacecraft's distant location will help keep the instruments cool, ensuring that it will be able to detect faint infrared signals. Because it will experience a range of temperatures between manufacture and testing on Earth and operations in space, the primary mirror is made of a specialty ultralow-expansion glass. Most materials expand and contract when temperatures change, but if the primary mirror changed shape it would distort the images from the telescope. Roman's mirror and its support structure are designed to reduce flexing, which will preserve the quality of its observations. Development of the mirror is much further along than it would typically be at this stage since the mission leverages a mirror that was transferred to NASA from the National Reconnaissance Office. The team modified the mirror's shape and surface to meet Roman's science objectives. The newly resurfaced mirror sports a layer of silver less than 400 nanometers thick - about 200 times thinner than a human hair. The silver coating was specifically chosen for Roman because of how well it reflects near-infrared light. By contrast, Hubble's mirror is coated with layers of aluminum and magnesium fluoride to optimize visible and ultraviolet light reflectivity. Likewise, the James Webb Space Telescope's mirrors have a gold coating to suit its longer wavelength infrared observations. Roman's mirror is so finely polished that the average bump on its surface is only 1.2 nanometers tall - more than twice as smooth as the mission requires. If the mirror were scaled to be Earth's size, these bumps would be just a quarter of an inch high. \"The mirror was precisely finished to the Roman Space Telescope's optical prescription,\" said Bonnie Patterson, program manager at L3Harris Technologies in Rochester, New York. \"Since it's so much smoother than required, it will provide even greater scientific benefit than originally planned.\" Next, the mirror will be mounted for additional testing at L3Harris. It has already been extensively tested at both cold and ambient temperatures. The new tests will be done with the mirror attached to its support structure. \"Roman's primary mirror is complete, yet our work isn't over,\" said Smith. \"We're excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal.\" The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is managed at Goddard, with participation by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California, the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, and a science team comprising scientists from research institutions across the United States.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/primary-mirror-for-nasas-roman-space-telescope-completed"}, {"title": "NASA's Roman Space Telescope to Uncover Echoes of the Universe's Creation", "date": "2020-11-18", "content": "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will detect vestiges of sound waves that once rippled through the primordial cosmic sea. According to new simulations, Roman's observations could extend these measurements into an unprobed epoch between the universe's infancy and the present day. Studying the echoes from this era will help us trace the evolution of the universe and solve pressing cosmic conundrums. Sound waves from the nascent universe, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), left their imprint on the cosmos by influencing galaxy distribution. Researchers have explored this imprint back to when the universe was three billion years old, or roughly 20% of its current age of 13.8 billion years - the same epoch Roman's BAO studies are optimized to investigate. Now a team of scientists has demonstrated that the mission could peer even farther back in time to explore impressions left by BAOs. \"This isn't something you can study in a lab, so we created mock universes and ran simulations,\" said Siddharth Satpathy, who led the study. Now a machine-learning engineer at Cisco in San Francisco, he conducted this research while earning a doctorate in computational astrophysics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"We were excited to find that Roman will be powerful enough to study BAO remnants in the universe's youth,\" he added. The team's findings were published Sept. 11 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Hot plasma soup: For most of its first half-million years, the universe looked extremely different than it does today. Instead of being speckled with stars and galaxies, the cosmos was filled with a sea of plasma - charged particles - that formed a dense, almost uniform fluid. There were tiny fluctuations of about one part in 100,000. What few variations there were took the form of slightly denser kernels of matter, like a single ounce of cinnamon sprinkled into about 13,000 cups of cookie dough. Since the clumps had more mass, their gravity attracted additional material. It was so hot that particles couldn't stick together when they collided - they just bounced off each other. Alternating between the pull of gravity and this repelling effect created waves of pressure - sound - that propagated through the plasma. Over time, the universe cooled and particles combined to form neutral atoms. Because the particles stopped repelling each other, the waves ceased. Their traces, however, still linger, etched on the cosmos. Frozen echoes: When atoms formed, the ripples essentially froze in place, carrying within them a bit more matter than the average across the universe. With the repulsive pressure of the plasma gone, gravity became the dominant force. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, clumps from the plasma that once filled the universe slurped up more material to become stars. Their mutual gravity pulled stars together into groups, ultimately forming the galaxies we see today. And slightly more galaxies formed along the ripples than elsewhere. While the waves no longer propagated, the frozen ripples stretched as the universe expanded, increasing the distance between galaxies. By looking at how galaxies are spread out in different cosmic epochs, we can explore how the universe has expanded over time. \"BAOs have left their mark on the cosmos, but we haven't fully examined their traces,\" said co-author Rupert Croft, a professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University. \"By studying BAO impressions in an unprobed region, we can excavate cosmic fossils, which will allow us to unearth new information about the forces that have shaped the universe.\" Scientists have noticed a pattern in the way galaxies cluster together from measurements of the nearby universe. For any galaxy today, we are more likely to find another galaxy about 500 million light-years away than slightly nearer or farther. But looking farther out into space, to earlier cosmic times, means that this distance - the vestige of the frozen BAO ripples - will decrease. Roman will extend previous research by mapping the expansion of the universe to unprecedented detail. Satpathy and his team showed that Roman's surveys will be able to probe for BAO remnants five times farther than originally planned, back to when the universe was only about 600 million years old - just 4% of its current age. Learning more about the way the cosmos has expanded over time will allow scientists to explore dark energy - a mysterious pressure that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. Roman is optimized to survey the cosmos for BAO impressions across the middle of its current age because that's when scientists think dark energy transitioned from being a minor contributor to the contents of the universe to the most dominant force. But some theories hypothesize a bout of dark energy activity when the universe was much younger. Peering farther into the universe's past will help add pieces to the puzzle. \"We haven't extensively explored BAO imprints from when the universe was very young because we need an enormous sample of galaxies to do so,\" said Jason Rhodes, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. \"That's where Roman comes in.

According to new simulations, Roman's observations could extend these measurements into an unprobed epoch between the universe's infancy and the present day. Studying the echoes from this era will help us trace the evolution of the universe and solve pressing cosmic conundrums. Sound waves from the nascent universe, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), left their imprint on the cosmos by influencing galaxy distribution. Researchers have explored this imprint back to when the universe was three billion years old, or roughly 20% of its current age of 13.8 billion years - the same epoch Roman's BAO studies are optimized to investigate. Now a team of scientists has demonstrated that the mission could peer even farther back in time to explore impressions left by BAOs. \"This isn't something you can study in a lab, so we created mock universes and ran simulations,\" said Siddharth Satpathy, who led the study. Now a machine-learning engineer at Cisco in San Francisco, he conducted this research while earning a doctorate in computational astrophysics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"We were excited to find that Roman will be powerful enough to study BAO remnants in the universe's youth,\" he added. The team's findings were published Sept. 11 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Hot plasma soup: For most of its first half-million years, the universe looked extremely different than it does today. Instead of being speckled with stars and galaxies, the cosmos was filled with a sea of plasma - charged particles - that formed a dense, almost uniform fluid. There were tiny fluctuations of about one part in 100,000. What few variations there were took the form of slightly denser kernels of matter, like a single ounce of cinnamon sprinkled into about 13,000 cups of cookie dough. Since the clumps had more mass, their gravity attracted additional material. It was so hot that particles couldn't stick together when they collided - they just bounced off each other. Alternating between the pull of gravity and this repelling effect created waves of pressure - sound - that propagated through the plasma. Over time, the universe cooled and particles combined to form neutral atoms. Because the particles stopped repelling each other, the waves ceased. Their traces, however, still linger, etched on the cosmos. Frozen echoes: When atoms formed, the ripples essentially froze in place, carrying within them a bit more matter than the average across the universe. With the repulsive pressure of the plasma gone, gravity became the dominant force. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, clumps from the plasma that once filled the universe slurped up more material to become stars. Their mutual gravity pulled stars together into groups, ultimately forming the galaxies we see today. And slightly more galaxies formed along the ripples than elsewhere. While the waves no longer propagated, the frozen ripples stretched as the universe expanded, increasing the distance between galaxies. By looking at how galaxies are spread out in different cosmic epochs, we can explore how the universe has expanded over time. \"BAOs have left their mark on the cosmos, but we haven't fully examined their traces,\" said co-author Rupert Croft, a professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University. \"By studying BAO impressions in an unprobed region, we can excavate cosmic fossils, which will allow us to unearth new information about the forces that have shaped the universe.\" Scientists have noticed a pattern in the way galaxies cluster together from measurements of the nearby universe. For any galaxy today, we are more likely to find another galaxy about 500 million light-years away than slightly nearer or farther. But looking farther out into space, to earlier cosmic times, means that this distance - the vestige of the frozen BAO ripples - will decrease. Roman will extend previous research by mapping the expansion of the universe to unprecedented detail. Satpathy and his team showed that Roman's surveys will be able to probe for BAO remnants five times farther than originally planned, back to when the universe was only about 600 million years old - just 4% of its current age. Learning more about the way the cosmos has expanded over time will allow scientists to explore dark energy - a mysterious pressure that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. Roman is optimized to survey the cosmos for BAO impressions across the middle of its current age because that's when scientists think dark energy transitioned from being a minor contributor to the contents of the universe to the most dominant force. But some theories hypothesize a bout of dark energy activity when the universe was much younger. Peering farther into the universe's past will help add pieces to the puzzle. \"We haven't extensively explored BAO imprints from when the universe was very young because we need an enormous sample of galaxies to do so,\" said Jason Rhodes, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. \"That's where Roman comes in. The mission has such a wide field of view that observations like this will become possible.\" Roman's High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey will measure accurate distances and positions for millions of galaxies. Scientists plan to analyze how their distribution varies with distance by creating a 3D map of the universe, which will help us decipher how dark energy has shaped the cosmos over time. Two additional Roman surveys will also study dark energy, and each technique will cross-check the others. The mission will provide important data to help scientists investigate, and possibly even foresee, the universe's fate.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-roman-space-telescope-to-uncover-echoes-of-the-universe-s-creation"}, {"title": "Ball Aerospace Completes Critical Design Review of Roman Space Telescope Instrument", "date": "2021-03-09", "content": "Ball Aerospace, partnered with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, successfully completed the critical design review of the Wide Field Instrument, which will be the primary science instrument on NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, formerly known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. \"Now that we have passed this critical milestone, we will continue to work hand-in-hand with NASA as we move from the design phase and into building and integrating the instrument,\" said Dr. Makenzie Lystrup, vice president and general manager, Civil Space, Ball Aerospace. \"It's always exciting to get to the hardware build, and particularly in this case as WFI is the central science instrument on Roman.\" Ball and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center are working in a close partnership to develop the WFI.

On July 23, the Roman Space Telescope successfully completed the critical design review of the mission's ground systems, which are spread over multiple institutions including the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland; NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California. STScI will host the Science Operations Center (SOC) while Goddard will provide the Mission Operations Center and Caltech/IPAC will house the Science Support Center. The passing of the critical design review means the plan for science operations provides all the necessary science data processing and archiving capabilities. The mission will now proceed to the next phase: building and testing the newly designed systems that will enable planning and scheduling of Roman observations and managing the resulting data, anticipated to be over 20 petabytes (20,000,000 GB) within the first five years of operations. \"At STScI, we are really excited about the opportunities for discovery that Roman will bring. All areas of astrophysics will benefit,\" said STScI Deputy Director Nancy Levenson. \"We are developing novel tools and new ways of working so the global research community can make best use of the advanced capabilities of this survey-oriented, 'big data' space mission.\" \"A lot of work is required to reach this stage in any space mission, and our team faced the added challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful completion of the critical design review is a testament to all of their efforts,\" said Cristina Oliveira, SOC Deputy Head at STScI. In its role as Science Operations Center, STScI will plan, schedule, and carry out observations, process and archive mission datasets, and engage and inform the astronomical community and the public. STScI will collaborate closely with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission and will host the Mission Operations Center (MOC). The MOC is responsible for overall spacecraft operations and overseeing the data transmitted between the spacecraft and the ground. The collaboration also includes Caltech/IPAC, home of the Roman Science Support Center (SSC), which works with the other ground system elements to achieve the scientific and operational goals of Roman. The Science Support Center at Caltech/IPAC is tasked with issuing calls for Roman proposals to the general science community and managing the proposal process. It will also lead the Coronagraph Instrument observation planning and data products and provide a data analysis environment for the instrument and community team. In addition, it is responsible for community outreach for science related to exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system - and science enabled by spectroscopic observations. The SSC is also developing and operating science data pipelines to process data from the Wide Field Instrument spectroscopic modes and for exoplanet microlensing science. Goddard is developing the Wide Field Instrument to perform the major science surveys, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing the Coronagraph Instrument to perform exoplanet direct imaging observations. Expanding Our View: Roman will be able to capture an area over 100 times larger than Hubble in a single snapshot. This will give it the unique ability to do wide-field surveys at space-based resolution, which will be the observatory's primary operating mode. \"Unlike Hubble and Webb, Roman is a survey mission first and foremost,\" explained Acting SOC Mission Scientist John MacKenty of STScI. \"Our role is to help gather input from the astronomical community, make those surveys ready for the community to do science, and give the community the tools they need to do their research.\" Roman's surveys will generate mountains of data, creating new challenges for scientists seeking to analyze those data. As a result, STScI is spearheading the use of cloud-based computing for Roman data processing. \"Instead of sending the data to the astronomer, we're bringing the astronomer to the data,\" said SOC Mission Systems Engineer Chris Hanley of STScI. All of the data collected by the Roman Space Telescope will be accessible via the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at STScI. Those data will be publicly available within days of the observations - a first for a NASA astrophysics flagship mission. Since scientists everywhere will have rapid access to the data, they will be able to quickly discover and follow up on short-lived phenomena, such as supernova explosions. The Science of the Roman Space Telescope: Roman will enable new science in all areas of astrophysics. It can search for dwarf planets, comets, and asteroids in our solar system. It will image stars throughout our own galaxy to measure its structure and investigate its formation history. It will also survey the birthplaces of stars, giant nurseries of gas and dust which Roman's large field of view will be able to fully image at high resolution for the first time. By staring deeply at wide swaths of apparently blank sections of sky, Roman will image an unprecedented number of galaxies with high resolution. Roman will map the distribution of dark matter within large clusters of galaxies and discover thousands of galaxies at very high redshifts, which will provide the tools to study how galaxies change over cosmic time. Roman's surveys will deliver new insights into the history and structure of the universe, including the mysterious \"dark energy\" that is making space itself expand faster and faster. This powerful new observatory will also build on the broad foundation of work begun with Hubble and other observatories like Kepler/K2 and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) on planets outside our solar system. It will discover thousands of exoplanets using its wide-field camera. Its Coronagraph Instrument will conduct a technology demonstration and, depending on its performance, may provide studies of the atmospheres of giant gaseous planets orbiting other stars.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/ground-system-for-nasa-s-roman-space-telescope-moves-into-development"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Ball Aerospace Completes Critical Design Review of Roman Space Telescope Instrument", "date": "2021-03-09", "content": "Ball Aerospace, partnered with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, successfully completed the critical design review of the Wide Field Instrument, which will be the primary science instrument on NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, formerly known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. \"Now that we have passed this critical milestone, we will continue to work hand-in-hand with NASA as we move from the design phase and into building and integrating the instrument,\" said Dr. Makenzie Lystrup, vice president and general manager, Civil Space, Ball Aerospace. \"It's always exciting to get to the hardware build, and particularly in this case as WFI is the central science instrument on Roman.\" Ball and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center are working in a close partnership to develop the WFI. Ball's primary responsibility is the Opto-Mechanical Assembly, which includes the optical bench, thermal control system, precision mechanisms, optics, electronics, and the relative calibration system that provide the stable structural and thermal environment necessary for wide field, high-quality, infrared observations. Ball will integrate the Goddard- provided 302-megapixel focal plane subsystem into the instrument and host instrument level verification and environmental testing. The Roman Space Telescope is designed to unravel the secrets of dark energy, search for and image exoplanets, and explore many topics in infrared astrophysics. While its 2.4m telescope is the same size as Hubble's, the WFI enables a field of view 100 times greater than Hubble's at the same resolution. Ball's work with NASA on the Roman Space Telescope continues a relationship that spans nearly 60 years. Ball built seven science instruments for the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as the advanced optical technology and lightweight mirror system for the James Webb Space Telescope. Overall, Ball has played a role in all of NASA's Great Observatories - Compton Gamma Ray, Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-Ray Observatory, Spitzer Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. Roman Space Telescope continues that tradition. Powered by endlessly curious people with an unwavering mission focus, Ball Aerospace pioneers discoveries that enable our customers to perform beyond expectation and protect what matters most. We create innovative space solutions, enable more accurate weather forecasts, drive insightful observations of our planet, deliver actionable data and intelligence, and ensure those who defend our freedom go forward bravely and return home safely.", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ball-aerospace-completes-critical-design-review-of-roman-space-telescope-instrument-301243682.html"}, {"title": "Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope predicted to spot 1L transiting planets", "date": "2021-04-01", "content": "Astronomers expect NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to find one lakh planets using two different techniques as it surveys a wide range of stars in the Milky Way. Scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s, Roman will be one of NASA's most prolific planet hunters, the US space agency said on Wednesday. Roman will locate these potential new worlds, or exoplanets, by tracking the amount of light coming from distant stars over time. \"Gravitational Microlensing\": In a technique called gravitational microlensing, a spike in light signals that a planet may be present. On the other hand, if the light from a star dims periodically, it could be because there is a planet crossing the face of a star as it completes an orbit. This technique is called the transit method. By employing these two methods to find new worlds, astronomers will capture an unprecedented view of the composition and arrangement of planetary systems across our galaxy. \"Unique Observational Platform\": The mission will provide a unique observational platform for discovering the tiny changes in light required to find other worlds via microlensing. This detection method takes advantage of the gravitational light-bending effects of massive objects predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. It occurs when a foreground star, the lens, randomly aligns with a distant background star, the source, as seen from Earth. As the stars drift along in their orbits around the galaxy, the alignment shifts over days to weeks, changing the apparent brightness of the source star. The precise pattern of these changes provides astronomers with clues about the nature of the lensing star in the foreground, including the presence of planets around it. \"Microlensing Events\": Many of the stars Roman will already be looking at for the microlensing survey may harbour transiting planets. \"Microlensing events are rare and occur quickly, so you need to look at a lot of stars repeatedly and precisely measure brightness changes to detect them,\" said astrophysicist Benjamin Montet from University of New South Wales in Sydney. \"Those are exactly the same things you need to do to find transiting planets, so by creating a robust microlensing survey, Roman will produce a nice transit survey as well.\" In a paper published at IOPscience, Montet and his colleagues showed that Roman -- formerly known as WFIRST -- could catch more than 100,000 planets passing in front of, or transiting, their host stars. The transit approach to finding exoplanets has been wildly successful for NASA's Kepler and K2 missions, which have discovered about 2,800 confirmed planets to date, and is currently used by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Since Roman will find planets orbiting more distant, fainter stars, scientists will often have to rely on the mission's expansive data set to verify the planets.", "url": "https://ummid.com/news/2021/april/01.04.2021/nancy-grace-roman-space-telescope-predicted-to-spot-1l-transiting-planets.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Roman Space Telescope Selects 24 Flight-Quality Heat-Vision 'Eyes'", "date": "2021-06-09", "content": "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope team recently flight-certified all 24 of the detectors the mission needs.

These images will allow astronomers to explore a vast array of celestial objects and phenomena, bringing us closer to solving many pressing cosmic mysteries. \"As the telescope's eyes, Roman's detectors will enable all of the mission's science,\" said John Gygax, the focal plane system manager for the Roman Space Telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Now, based on our testing results, our team can confirm these infrared detectors meet all the requirements for Roman's purposes.\" Each detector has 16 million tiny pixels, providing the mission with exquisite image resolution. While 18 detectors will be incorporated into Roman's camera, another six will be reserved as flight-qualified spares. \"The heart of Roman's detectors are millions of mercury-cadmium-telluride photodiodes, which are sensors that convert light into an electrical current - one for each pixel,\" said Greg Mosby, a research astrophysicist at Goddard who is helping assess the performance of Roman's detectors. \"One of the reasons we chose this material is because by varying the amount of cadmium, we can tune the detector to have a specific cutoff wavelength. That allows us to focus more precisely on the wavelengths of light we're trying to see.\" To make the detectors, technicians at Teledyne Imaging Sensors in Camarillo, California built up the photodiodes on the base of the detector layer by layer. Then, they secured the detector to a silicon electronics board that will help process the light signals using indium - a soft metal that has roughly the same consistency as chewing gum. The pixels were glued down using a tiny drop of indium for each one. The drops were meticulously placed just 10 microns apart - about the width of a typical cotton fiber. If we scaled one of Roman's detectors up to be as long as an Olympic-size swimming pool, the indium blobs would be less than half an inch apart. This precise alignment ensures that each of the sensors will operate independently. \"The Roman team has spent years identifying an optimal recipe for the mission's detectors,\" Mosby said. \"It's gratifying to see the team's hard work pay off on this crucial technical aspect of the mission.

The Science of the Roman Space Telescope: Roman will enable new science in all areas of astrophysics. It can search for dwarf planets, comets, and asteroids in our solar system. It will image stars throughout our own galaxy to measure its structure and investigate its formation history. It will also survey the birthplaces of stars, giant nurseries of gas and dust which Roman's large field of view will be able to fully image at high resolution for the first time. By staring deeply at wide swaths of apparently blank sections of sky, Roman will image an unprecedented number of galaxies with high resolution. Roman will map the distribution of dark matter within large clusters of galaxies and discover thousands of galaxies at very high redshifts, which will provide the tools to study how galaxies change over cosmic time. Roman's surveys will deliver new insights into the history and structure of the universe, including the mysterious \"dark energy\" that is making space itself expand faster and faster. This powerful new observatory will also build on the broad foundation of work begun with Hubble and other observatories like Kepler/K2 and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) on planets outside our solar system.

When Roman launches in the mid-2020s, these devices will convert starlight into electrical signals, which will then be decoded into 300-megapixel images of large patches of the sky. These images will allow astronomers to explore a vast array of celestial objects and phenomena, bringing us closer to solving many pressing cosmic mysteries. \"As the telescope's eyes, Roman's detectors will enable all of the mission's science,\" said John Gygax, the focal plane system manager for the Roman Space Telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Now, based on our testing results, our team can confirm these infrared detectors meet all the requirements for Roman's purposes.\" Each detector has 16 million tiny pixels, providing the mission with exquisite image resolution. While 18 detectors will be incorporated into Roman's camera, another six will be reserved as flight-qualified spares. \"The heart of Roman's detectors are millions of mercury-cadmium-telluride photodiodes, which are sensors that convert light into an electrical current - one for each pixel,\" said Greg Mosby, a research astrophysicist at Goddard who is helping assess the performance of Roman's detectors. \"One of the reasons we chose this material is because by varying the amount of cadmium, we can tune the detector to have a specific cutoff wavelength. That allows us to focus more precisely on the wavelengths of light we're trying to see.\" To make the detectors, technicians at Teledyne Imaging Sensors in Camarillo, California built up the photodiodes on the base of the detector layer by layer. Then, they secured the detector to a silicon electronics board that will help process the light signals using indium - a soft metal that has roughly the same consistency as chewing gum. The pixels were glued down using a tiny drop of indium for each one. The drops were meticulously placed just 10 microns apart - about the width of a typical cotton fiber. If we scaled one of Roman's detectors up to be as long as an Olympic-size swimming pool, the indium blobs would be less than half an inch apart. This precise alignment ensures that each of the sensors will operate independently. \"The Roman team has spent years identifying an optimal recipe for the mission's detectors,\" Mosby said. \"It's gratifying to see the team's hard work pay off on this crucial technical aspect of the mission. We can't wait to see how the images from these detectors transform our understanding of the universe.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-roman-space-telescope-selects-24-flight-quality-heat-vision-eyes"}, {"title": "Ground System for NASA's Roman Space Telescope Moves into Development", "date": "2021-07-29", "content": "When it launches in the mid-2020s, NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will revolutionize astronomy by building on the science discoveries and technological leaps of the Hubble, Spitzer, and Webb space telescopes.

On July 23rd, the Roman Space Telescope successfully completed the critical design review of the mission's ground systems, which are spread over multiple institutions including the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland; NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California. STScI will host the Science Operations Center while Goddard will provide the Mission Operations Center and Caltech/IPAC will house the Science Support Center. The passing of the critical design review means the plan for science operations provides all the necessary data processing and archiving capabilities. The mission will now proceed to the next phase: building and testing the newly designed systems that will enable planning and scheduling of Roman observations and managing the resulting data, anticipated to be over 20 petabytes within the first five years of operations. \"At STScI, we are really excited about the opportunities for discovery that Roman will bring. All areas of astrophysics will benefit,\" said STScI deputy director Nancy Levenson. \"We are developing novel tools and new ways of working so the global research community can make best use of the advanced capabilities of this survey-oriented, 'big data' space mission.\" \"A lot of work is required to reach this stage in any space mission, and our team faced the added challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful completion of the critical design review is a testament to all of their efforts,\" said Cristina Oliveira, SOC deputy head at STScI. In its role as Science Operations Center, STScI will plan, schedule, and carry out observations, process and archive mission datasets, and engage and inform the astronomical community and the public. STScI will collaborate closely with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the mission and will host the Mission Operations Center. The MOC is responsible for overall spacecraft operations and overseeing the data transmitted between the spacecraft and the ground. The collaboration also includes Caltech/IPAC, home of the Roman Science Support Center, which works with the other ground system elements to achieve the scientific and operational goals of Roman. The Science Support Center at Caltech/IPAC is tasked with issuing calls for Roman proposals to the general science community and managing the proposal process. It will also lead the Coronagraph Instrument observation planning and data products, and provide a data analysis environment for the instrument and community team. In addition, it is responsible for community outreach for both exoplanet science and science enabled by spectroscopic observations. The SSC is also developing and operating science data pipelines to process data from the Wide Field Instrument spectroscopic modes and for exoplanet microlensing science. Goddard is developing the Wide Field Instrument to perform the major science surveys, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing the Coronagraph Instrument to perform exoplanet direct imaging observations. Expanding Our View: Roman will be able to capture an area over 100 times larger than Hubble in a single snapshot. This will give it the unique ability to do wide-field surveys at space-based resolution, which will be the observatory's primary operating mode. \"Unlike Hubble and Webb, Roman is a survey mission first and foremost,\" explained acting SOC mission scientist John MacKenty of STScI. \"Our role is to help gather input from the astronomical community, make those surveys ready for the community to do science, and give the community the tools they need to do their research.\" Roman's surveys will generate mountains of data, creating new challenges for scientists seeking to analyze those data. As a result, STScI is spearheading the use of cloud-based computing for Roman data processing. \"Instead of sending the data to the astronomer, we're bringing the astronomer to the data,\" said SOC mission systems engineer Chris Hanley of STScI. All of the data collected by the Roman Space Telescope will be accessible via the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI. Those data will be publicly available within days of the observations - a first for a NASA astrophysics flagship mission.

The mission aims to photograph worlds and dusty disks around nearby stars with detail up to a thousand times better than possible with other observatories. Roman will use its Coronagraph Instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and even self-flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars and reveal the planets in orbit around them - to demonstrate that direct imaging technologies can perform even better in space than they have with ground-based telescopes. \"We will be able to image worlds in visible light using the Roman Coronagraph,\" said Rob Zellem, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California who is co-leading the observation calibration plan for the instrument. JPL is building Roman's Coronagraph Instrument. \"Doing so from space will help us see smaller, older, and colder planets than direct imaging usually reveals, bringing us a giant leap closer to imaging planets like Earth.\" A home far away from home: Exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system - are so distant and dim relative to their host stars that they're practically invisible, even to powerful telescopes. That's why nearly all of the worlds discovered so far have been found indirectly through effects they have on their host stars. However, recent advancements in technology allow astronomers to actually take images of the reflected light from the planets themselves. Analyzing the colors of planetary atmospheres helps astronomers discover what the atmospheres are made of. This, in turn, can offer clues about the processes occurring on the imaged worlds that may affect their habitability. Since living things modify their environment in ways we might be able to detect, such as by producing oxygen or methane, scientists hope this research will pave the way for future missions that could reveal signs of life. If Roman's Coronagraph Instrument successfully completes its technology demonstration phase, its polarimetry mode will allow astronomers to image the disks around stars in polarized light, familiar to many as the reflected glare blocked by polarized sunglasses. Astronomers will use polarized images to study the dust grains that make up the disks around stars, including their sizes, shapes, and possibly mineral properties. Roman may even be able to reveal structures in the disks, such as gaps created by unseen planets. These measurements will complement existing data by probing fainter dust disks orbiting nearer to their host stars than other telescopes can see. Bridging the gap: Current direct imaging efforts are limited to enormous, bright planets. These worlds are typically super-Jupiters that are less than 100 million years old - so young that they glow brightly thanks to heat left over from their formation, which makes them detectable in infrared light. They also tend to be very far away from their host stars because it's easier to block the star's light and see planets in more distant orbits. The Roman Coronagraph could complement other telescopes' infrared observations by imaging young super-Jupiters in visible light for the first time, according to a study by a team of scientists. But astronomers would also like to directly image planets that are similar to our own one day - rocky, Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars within their habitable zones, the range of orbital distances where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. To do so, astronomers need to be able to see smaller, cooler, dimmer planets orbiting much closer to their host stars than current telescopes can. By photographing worlds in visible light, Roman will be able to image mature planets spanning ages up to several billion years - something that has never been done before. \"To image Earth-like planets, we'll need 10,000 times better performance than today's instruments provide,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and the instrument technologist for the Roman Coronagraph. \"The Coronagraph Instrument will perform several hundred times better than current instruments, so we will be able to see Jupiter-like planets that are more than 100 million times fainter than their host stars.\" A team of scientists recently simulated a promising target for Roman to image, called Upsilon Andromedae d. \"This gas giant exoplanet is slightly larger than Jupiter, orbits within a Sun-like star's habitable zone, and is relatively close to Earth - just 44 light-years away,\" said Prabal Saxena, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the lead author of a paper describing the results. \"What's really exciting is that Roman may be able to help us explore hazes and clouds in Upsilon Andromedae d's atmosphere and may even be able to act as a planetary thermometer by putting constraints on the planet's internal temperature!\" Opening a new frontier: The Coronagraph Instrument will contain several state-of-the-art components that have never flown aboard a space-based observatory before. For example, it will use specially designed coronagraph masks to block the glare from host stars but allow the light from dimmer, orbiting planets to filter through. These masks have innovative, complex shapes that block starlight more effectively than traditional masks. The Roman Coronagraph will also be equipped with deformable mirrors, which help counteract small imperfections that reduce image quality. These special mirrors will measure and subtract starlight in real time, and technicians on the ground can also send commands to the spacecraft to adjust them. This will help counteract effects like temperature changes, which can slightly alter the shape of the optics. Using this technology, Roman will observe planets so faint that special detectors will count individual photons of light as they arrive, seconds or even minutes apart. No other observatory has done this kind of imaging in visible light before, providing a vital step toward discovering habitable planets and possibly learning whether we are alone in the universe.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasas-roman-mission-could-snap-first-image-of-a-jupiter-like-world"}, {"title": "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could snap the first image of Jupiter-like world", "date": "2022-02-28", "content": "NASA's next Space Telescope is currently under construction and already has a mission in waiting, the capture of the first-ever image of a Jupiter-like world in the Upsilon Andromedae d, the space agency said in a recent post. The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope is still setting itself up to send us the first scientific image but that hasn't stopped NASA from working on its next space telescope, scheduled to be launched just five years from now. A Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIST), has been named Nancy Grace Roman to honor the contributions of NASA's first chief astronomer who is fondly remembered as the 'Mother of Hubble' Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: Currently used imaging techniques only allow for large and bright planets to be captured. Relatively young in their formation, these planets emit heat and revolve further away from their stars, and can be captured using infrared cameras by blocking the light from the star. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope or Roman Space Telescope for short is being designed to capture these images in visible light. To do so, it will use its onboard coronagraph instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and self-flexing mirrors that will block out the light from the stars. The specially designed masks on the instrument have innovative and complex shapes that allow light from dimmer orbiting objects to pass through. Its deformable mirrors will subtract starlight in real-time and can also be programmed remotely to counteract imperfections that reduce image quality. Researchers associated with the project believe that the chronograph instrument on the Roman Space Telescope will be several hundred times better than the ones we currently have and will enable us to see planets that are a million times fainter than the stars they orbit around. The Coronagraph is currently undergoing technology demonstration and if all goes well, it allow astronomers to image disks around the stars as well that help us better understand the dust grains, their sizes, shapes, and possibly even mineral composition. The promise to go beyond Jupiter: The team of researchers has already identified a promising target for the Space Telescope when launched, an exoplanet in Upsilon Andromedae d. The gas giant is much bigger than Jupiter and is only 44 light-years away from us. Interestingly, it is within its star's habitable zone. The detectors on the Roman Space Telescope are being designed to be able to detect even faint signals. These special detectors will be capable of measuring individual photons of light as they arrive. They might be separated by a few seconds or even minutes but the detectors will be capable of capturing them. Equipped with features that no other space observatory has been before, the Roman Space Telescope will also allow scientists to image smaller, older, and colder planets orbiting near their stars and which are likely to be more-Earth-like and support life. Like the James Webb Space Telescope, delays could be expected but it is definitely worth the wait.

Whereas HST and JWST focus on small regions of the universe with narrow field of view instruments, the Roman Space Telescope has a wide field of view, 100 times the field of view of Hubble. Roman's wide field of view, combined with the light gathering power of a 2.4-meter primary mirror, will settle essential questions in the areas of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. Roman will survey billions of galaxies and study thousands of exoplanets. Roman's wide field of view required a new generation of infrared detector developed by Teledyne Imaging Sensors in Camarillo, California. The infrared sensor chip assembly developed for Roman is the H4RG-10, 4,096 by 4,096 pixels, each pixel is 10 by 10 microns in size. Eighteen H4RG-10 SCAs are in the focal plane mosaic of Roman, totalling over 300 million pixels. This is by far the largest infrared focal plane ever made, for space or ground-based facilities. Teledyne was awarded a $23 million contract in 2018 to supply 24 flight quality SCAs; 18 for flight and 6 flight spares. Teledyne achieved a high level of contract execution: 28 flight quality SCAs have been delivered. All 28 SCAs exceed the specifications for quantum efficiency, low noise, and very low image persistence. The ability of Teledyne's infrared detectors to also detect visible wavelengths has enabled Roman's wide field of view instrument to increase the spectral bandwidth by 20%. Teledyne continued working throughout the pandemic, ensuring the infrared detectors were delivered before the dates needed for the Wide Field Instrument. In addition to the infrared arrays, Teledyne is producing the visible light detectors that will be used in the coronograph instrument of the Roman Space Telescope. \"Teledyne is proud to provide the high performance infrared detectors for the Roman Space Telescope,\" said Dr. John Auyeung, Teledyne's Director of Astronomy & Earth Observation and Program Manager for Roman SCA development and flight production. \"I have been fortunate to serve as the program manager for the infrared arrays supplied to Hubble, JWST, and Roman.

The mission aims to photograph worlds and dusty disks around nearby stars with detail up to a thousand times better than possible with other observatories. Roman will use its Coronagraph Instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and even self-flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars and reveal the planets in orbit around them - to demonstrate that direct imaging technologies can perform even better in space than they have with ground-based telescopes. \"We will be able to image worlds in visible light using the Roman Coronagraph,\" said Rob Zellem, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California who is co-leading the observation calibration plan for the instrument. JPL is building Roman's Coronagraph Instrument. \"Doing so from space will help us see smaller, older, and colder planets than direct imaging usually reveals, bringing us a giant leap closer to imaging planets like Earth.\" A home far away from home: Exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system - are so distant and dim relative to their host stars that they're practically invisible, even to powerful telescopes. That's why nearly all of the worlds discovered so far have been found indirectly through effects they have on their host stars. However, recent advancements in technology allow astronomers to actually take images of the reflected light from the planets themselves. Analyzing the colors of planetary atmospheres helps astronomers discover what the atmospheres are made of. This, in turn, can offer clues about the processes occurring on the imaged worlds that may affect their habitability. Since living things modify their environment in ways we might be able to detect, such as by producing oxygen or methane, scientists hope this research will pave the way for future missions that could reveal signs of life. If Roman's Coronagraph Instrument successfully completes its technology demonstration phase, its polarimetry mode will allow astronomers to image the disks around stars in polarized light, familiar to many as the reflected glare blocked by polarized sunglasses. Astronomers will use polarized images to study the dust grains that make up the disks around stars, including their sizes, shapes, and possibly mineral properties. Roman may even be able to reveal structures in the disks, such as gaps created by unseen planets. These measurements will complement existing data by probing fainter dust disks orbiting nearer to their host stars than other telescopes can see. Bridging the gap: Current direct imaging efforts are limited to enormous, bright planets. These worlds are typically super-Jupiters that are less than 100 million years old - so young that they glow brightly thanks to heat left over from their formation, which makes them detectable in infrared light. They also tend to be very far away from their host stars because it's easier to block the star's light and see planets in more distant orbits. The Roman Coronagraph could complement other telescopes' infrared observations by imaging young super-Jupiters in visible light for the first time, according to a study by a team of scientists. But astronomers would also like to directly image planets that are similar to our own one day - rocky, Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars within their habitable zones, the range of orbital distances where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. To do so, astronomers need to be able to see smaller, cooler, dimmer planets orbiting much closer to their host stars than current telescopes can. By photographing worlds in visible light, Roman will be able to image mature planets spanning ages up to several billion years - something that has never been done before. \"To image Earth-like planets, we'll need 10,000 times better performance than today's instruments provide,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and the instrument technologist for the Roman Coronagraph. \"The Coronagraph Instrument will perform several hundred times better than current instruments, so we will be able to see Jupiter-like planets that are more than 100 million times fainter than their host stars.\" A team of scientists recently simulated a promising target for Roman to image, called Upsilon Andromedae d. \"This gas giant exoplanet is slightly larger than Jupiter, orbits within a Sun-like star's habitable zone, and is relatively close to Earth - just 44 light-years away,\" said Prabal Saxena, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the lead author of a paper describing the results. \"What's really exciting is that Roman may be able to help us explore hazes and clouds in Upsilon Andromedae d's atmosphere and may even be able to act as a planetary thermometer by putting constraints on the planet's internal temperature!\" Opening a new frontier: The Coronagraph Instrument will contain several state-of-the-art components that have never flown aboard a space-based observatory before. For example, it will use specially designed coronagraph masks to block the glare from host stars but allow the light from dimmer, orbiting planets to filter through. These masks have innovative, complex shapes that block starlight more effectively than traditional masks. The Roman Coronagraph will also be equipped with deformable mirrors, which help counteract small imperfections that reduce image quality. These special mirrors will measure and subtract starlight in real time, and technicians on the ground can also send commands to the spacecraft to adjust them. This will help counteract effects like temperature changes, which can slightly alter the shape of the optics. Using this technology, Roman will observe planets so faint that special detectors will count individual photons of light as they arrive, seconds or even minutes apart.

A Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIST), has been named Nancy Grace Roman to honor the contributions of NASA's first chief astronomer who is fondly remembered as the 'Mother of Hubble' Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: Currently used imaging techniques only allow for large and bright planets to be captured. Relatively young in their formation, these planets emit heat and revolve further away from their stars, and can be captured using infrared cameras by blocking the light from the star. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope or Roman Space Telescope for short is being designed to capture these images in visible light. To do so, it will use its onboard coronagraph instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and self-flexing mirrors that will block out the light from the stars. The specially designed masks on the instrument have innovative and complex shapes that allow light from dimmer orbiting objects to pass through. Its deformable mirrors will subtract starlight in real-time and can also be programmed remotely to counteract imperfections that reduce image quality. Researchers associated with the project believe that the chronograph instrument on the Roman Space Telescope will be several hundred times better than the ones we currently have and will enable us to see planets that are a million times fainter than the stars they orbit around. The Coronagraph is currently undergoing technology demonstration and if all goes well, it allow astronomers to image disks around the stars as well that help us better understand the dust grains, their sizes, shapes, and possibly even mineral composition. The promise to go beyond Jupiter: The team of researchers has already identified a promising target for the Space Telescope when launched, an exoplanet in Upsilon Andromedae d. The gas giant is much bigger than Jupiter and is only 44 light-years away from us. Interestingly, it is within its star's habitable zone. The detectors on the Roman Space Telescope are being designed to be able to detect even faint signals. These special detectors will be capable of measuring individual photons of light as they arrive.

The coronagraph instrument will help scientists locate and identify exoplanets - planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. Matt Felt, the branch head for thermal technologies at SDL, said the instrument uses infrared cameras to detect these planets. To function at peak sensitivity, the infrared detectors must be cooled to about 161 degrees below zero. \"And to give you an idea of how cold that is. It's about 100 degrees colder than the coldest temperature that was measured up at Peter Sinks, up Logan Canyon,\" Felt said. The cryogenic thermal subsystem will draw heat away from the instrument using technology known as thermal straps. \"The thermal straps transfer heat from one location to another, without transferring any mechanical energy,\" Felt said. \"If you're connecting to a camera that's really precisely aligned, if you also transfer force into that camera, you can change its alignment.\" Felt said this technology was invented at SDL in the mid-90s. The cryogenic thermal subsystem for the Nancy Grace Telescope required further innovation. \"Each optical instrument in space typically has its own requirements.... And this was a challenging one too because they really pushed us on mass, we needed to keep our mass really low,\" Felt said. To conserve mass, SDL constructed thermal straps from sheets of pyrolytic graphite instead of metal. These sheets are about a third the width of a human hair and enable more heat transfer than metal thermal straps of the same size. \"There's a lot of fun things that can happen with those new materials.

Relatively young in their formation, these planets emit heat and revolve further away from their stars, and can be captured using infrared cameras by blocking the light from the star. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope or Roman Space Telescope for short is being designed to capture these images in visible light. To do so, it will use its onboard coronagraph instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and self-flexing mirrors that will block out the light from the stars. The specially designed masks on the instrument have innovative and complex shapes that allow light from dimmer orbiting objects to pass through. Its deformable mirrors will subtract starlight in real-time and can also be programmed remotely to counteract imperfections that reduce image quality. Researchers associated with the project believe that the chronograph instrument on the Roman Space Telescope will be several hundred times better than the ones we currently have and will enable us to see planets that are a million times fainter than the stars they orbit around. The Coronagraph is currently undergoing technology demonstration and if all goes well, it allow astronomers to image disks around the stars as well that help us better understand the dust grains, their sizes, shapes, and possibly even mineral composition. The promise to go beyond Jupiter: The team of researchers has already identified a promising target for the Space Telescope when launched, an exoplanet in Upsilon Andromedae d. The gas giant is much bigger than Jupiter and is only 44 light-years away from us. Interestingly, it is within its star's habitable zone. The detectors on the Roman Space Telescope are being designed to be able to detect even faint signals. These special detectors will be capable of measuring individual photons of light as they arrive. They might be separated by a few seconds or even minutes but the detectors will be capable of capturing them. Equipped with features that no other space observatory has been before, the Roman Space Telescope will also allow scientists to image smaller, older, and colder planets orbiting near their stars and which are likely to be more-Earth-like and support life. Like the James Webb Space Telescope, delays could be expected but it is definitely worth the wait.

The mission aims to photograph worlds and dusty disks around nearby stars with detail up to a thousand times better than possible with other observatories. Roman will use its Coronagraph Instrument - a system of masks, prisms, detectors, and even self-flexing mirrors built to block out the glare from distant stars and reveal the planets in orbit around them - to demonstrate that direct imaging technologies can perform even better in space than they have with ground-based telescopes. \"We will be able to image worlds in visible light using the Roman Coronagraph,\" said Rob Zellem, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California who is co-leading the observation calibration plan for the instrument. JPL is building Roman's Coronagraph Instrument. \"Doing so from space will help us see smaller, older, and colder planets than direct imaging usually reveals, bringing us a giant leap closer to imaging planets like Earth.\" A home far away from home: Exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system - are so distant and dim relative to their host stars that they're practically invisible, even to powerful telescopes. That's why nearly all of the worlds discovered so far have been found indirectly through effects they have on their host stars. However, recent advancements in technology allow astronomers to actually take images of the reflected light from the planets themselves. Analyzing the colors of planetary atmospheres helps astronomers discover what the atmospheres are made of. This, in turn, can offer clues about the processes occurring on the imaged worlds that may affect their habitability. Since living things modify their environment in ways we might be able to detect, such as by producing oxygen or methane, scientists hope this research will pave the way for future missions that could reveal signs of life. If Roman's Coronagraph Instrument successfully completes its technology demonstration phase, its polarimetry mode will allow astronomers to image the disks around stars in polarized light, familiar to many as the reflected glare blocked by polarized sunglasses. Astronomers will use polarized images to study the dust grains that make up the disks around stars, including their sizes, shapes, and possibly mineral properties. Roman may even be able to reveal structures in the disks, such as gaps created by unseen planets. These measurements will complement existing data by probing fainter dust disks orbiting nearer to their host stars than other telescopes can see. Bridging the gap: Current direct imaging efforts are limited to enormous, bright planets. These worlds are typically super-Jupiters that are less than 100 million years old - so young that they glow brightly thanks to heat left over from their formation, which makes them detectable in infrared light. They also tend to be very far away from their host stars because it's easier to block the star's light and see planets in more distant orbits. The Roman Coronagraph could complement other telescopes' infrared observations by imaging young super-Jupiters in visible light for the first time, according to a study by a team of scientists. But astronomers would also like to directly image planets that are similar to our own one day - rocky, Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars within their habitable zones, the range of orbital distances where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. To do so, astronomers need to be able to see smaller, cooler, dimmer planets orbiting much closer to their host stars than current telescopes can. By photographing worlds in visible light, Roman will be able to image mature planets spanning ages up to several billion years - something that has never been done before. \"To image Earth-like planets, we'll need 10,000 times better performance than today's instruments provide,\" said Vanessa Bailey, an astronomer at JPL and the instrument technologist for the Roman Coronagraph. \"The Coronagraph Instrument will perform several hundred times better than current instruments, so we will be able to see Jupiter-like planets that are more than 100 million times fainter than their host stars.\" A team of scientists recently simulated a promising target for Roman to image, called Upsilon Andromedae d. \"This gas giant exoplanet is slightly larger than Jupiter, orbits within a Sun-like star's habitable zone, and is relatively close to Earth - just 44 light-years away,\" said Prabal Saxena, an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the lead author of a paper describing the results. \"What's really exciting is that Roman may be able to help us explore hazes and clouds in Upsilon Andromedae d's atmosphere and may even be able to act as a planetary thermometer by putting constraints on the planet's internal temperature!\" Opening a new frontier: The Coronagraph Instrument will contain several state-of-the-art components that have never flown aboard a space-based observatory before. For example, it will use specially designed coronagraph masks to block the glare from host stars but allow the light from dimmer, orbiting planets to filter through. These masks have innovative, complex shapes that block starlight more effectively than traditional masks. The Roman Coronagraph will also be equipped with deformable mirrors, which help counteract small imperfections that reduce image quality. These special mirrors will measure and subtract starlight in real time, and technicians on the ground can also send commands to the spacecraft to adjust them. This will help counteract effects like temperature changes, which can slightly alter the shape of the optics. Using this technology, Roman will observe planets so faint that special detectors will count individual photons of light as they arrive, seconds or even minutes apart. No other observatory has done this kind of imaging in visible light before, providing a vital step toward discovering habitable planets and possibly learning whether we are alone in the universe.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasas-roman-mission-could-snap-first-image-of-a-jupiter-like-world"}, {"title": "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could snap the first image of Jupiter-like world", "date": "2022-02-28", "content": "NASA's next Space Telescope is currently under construction and already has a mission in waiting, the capture of the first-ever image of a Jupiter-like world in the Upsilon Andromedae d, the space agency said in a recent post.

To function at peak sensitivity, the infrared detectors must be cooled to about 161 degrees below zero. \"And to give you an idea of how cold that is. It's about 100 degrees colder than the coldest temperature that was measured up at Peter Sinks, up Logan Canyon,\" Felt said. The cryogenic thermal subsystem will draw heat away from the instrument using technology known as thermal straps. \"The thermal straps transfer heat from one location to another, without transferring any mechanical energy,\" Felt said. \"If you're connecting to a camera that's really precisely aligned, if you also transfer force into that camera, you can change its alignment.\" Felt said this technology was invented at SDL in the mid-90s. The cryogenic thermal subsystem for the Nancy Grace Telescope required further innovation. \"Each optical instrument in space typically has its own requirements.... And this was a challenging one too because they really pushed us on mass, we needed to keep our mass really low,\" Felt said. To conserve mass, SDL constructed thermal straps from sheets of pyrolytic graphite instead of metal. These sheets are about a third the width of a human hair and enable more heat transfer than metal thermal straps of the same size. \"There's a lot of fun things that can happen with those new materials. And it's neat to see the progress and development,\" Felt said.", "url": "https://www.upr.org/utah-news/2022-05-25/space-dynamics-lab-delivers-a-critical-space-telescope-component-to-nasa"}, {"title": "SpaceX Will Launch The New $3.2 Billion 'Roman' Space Telescope, Says NASA", "date": "2022-07-20", "content": "No sooner did the Webb telescope flash its spectacular first images across the world, do some science and even find time to get struck by something than NASA is planning the next space telescope. NASA announced today that it has contracted SpaceX to launch its new Roman Space Telescope. Now in development, it will go skywards between October 2026 and May 2027 from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX will make $255 million from the contract. What is the Roman Space Telescope? In some ways the Roman Space Telescope is a successor to Hubble, with a primary mirror measuring 2.4-meters-the same size as Hubble's. However, Roman will have a huge field of view, with its wide-angle lens able to see an area of the sky about 100 times larger than what Hubble can see. It's expected to cost between $3.2 billion and $3.9 billion. A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket will launch NASA's Roman Space Telescope in 2026/2027. What will the Roman Space Telescope do? Roman will undertake a \"Galactic Exoplanet Survey\" designed to find Earth-like exoplanets and also help astronomers understand how the universe expands. Its wide-angle lens will help it map the Milky Way and other galaxies 100 times faster than Hubble and allow astronomers to see the environments around galaxies in the early universe. It will be able to create Roman ultra-deep fields far more extensive than either the Hubble ultra-deep fields or even the first Webb deep field. It will also investigate dark matter and dark energy-modern astronomy's greatest mysteries-and look for Earth-like exoplanets. In fact, Roman is expected to find thousands of exoplanets, including more \"rogue\" planets than there are stars in the Milky Way -at least 100 billion! It will do that using an incredible technique called gravitational microlensing. What is microlensing? Microlensing is what Roman is all about-it's what makes it a unique and special space telescope. It will allow astronomers to find new types of exoplanets thousands of light years from Earth orbiting stars near the center of the Milky Way. The technique is similar to how Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity was proven during a total solar eclipse in 1919.

Putting it together will require a highly choreographed dance. Scientists have discovered more than 5,000 exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. As technologies for studying these worlds continue to advance, researchers may someday be able to search for signs of life on exoplanets that are similar in size, composition, and temperature to Earth. But to do that they'll need new tools, like those being tested on the Coronagraph Instrument on NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The instrument will block the light from each distant star it observes so that scientists can better see the planets around the star, and it will demonstrate technologies needed to eventually study potentially habitable planets with future missions. The Coronagraph Instrument team has already designed the cutting-edge instrument and built the components. Now they have to put the pieces together and run tests to make sure they operate as intended. \"It's like all the separate tributaries are finally coming together to form the river,\" said Jeff Oseas, product delivery manager for the Coronagraph Instrument's optical subsystem at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The process kicked off recently at JPL and will take more than a year. Once complete, the Coronagraph Instrument will be shipped to the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and incorporated into the Roman observatory. JPL engineer Gasia Bedrosian leads the assembly and testing process as the instrument's integration and test product delivery manager. She likes to say that while integration and testing are technically the last steps in building an instrument, they're actually part of the process from the beginning. In 2018, Bedrosian started working on a set of assembly plans for something that's never been built before. She and her team then spent another two years collaborating with various subject matter experts and project members to review and adjust the plan, ensuring all the pieces would come together on time and in the right order. The process will resemble a well-choreographed ballet that involves heavy duty cranes, lasers, and vacuum chambers the size of buses. Roughly the size and shape of a baby grand piano, the Coronagraph Instrument is composed of two main sections that will stack on top of each another: the optical bench and the instrument electronics pallet. The more delicate of the two is the optical bench, which contains 64 elements, such as mirrors and filters, designed to remove as much starlight as possible without suppressing the light from planets. This approach to finding and studying exoplanets is called direct imaging, and it is expected to be the best way to study the atmospheres and surface features of rocky worlds similar to Earth. Some of the optical components on the Coronagraph Instrument are so small they're barely visible to the naked eye. The pallet, or bottom layer, houses the electronics that receive instructions from the Roman spacecraft and return the Coronagraph Instrument's scientific data. The electronics also control the mechanical components on the optical bench as well as the instrument heaters. The optical bench will be stacked by crane atop the electronics pallet. Because the two layers have to be aligned with each other to within a fraction of a millimeter, the team will use lasers to get them positioned just right over the course of four days. Eye for Detail: Integration and testing teams will often use digital 3D models of the instrument to help make their plans, but nothing can compare to seeing the object in a real space. That's why the coronagraph team made use of an augmented reality headset that lets users see a virtual projection of a 3D object and the world around them. The headset is also used by the Mars Curiosity rover team to see in 3D the Martian terrain that the rover drives over. \"We learned a lot from that exercise,\" said Bedrosian. \"We could get a sense of how tight the access would be at certain points of integration by literally laying on the floor and getting visuals of under the instrument. It showed us when it would be beneficial to lift the entire instrument with a crane, or if we were going to need a specialized tool to do our work at that angle. It helped make a lot of our plans safer and simpler.\" Once assembled, the Coronagraph Instrument will undergo a series of tests, including almost a month of dynamical testing to simulate the rocket ride into space. It will then be put in a vacuum chamber that replicates the space environment to check that the hardware remains aligned and operating correctly. \"It's exciting to finally start putting all the pieces together,\" said Bedrosian. \"It's definitely a delayed gratification, because we've spent so long preparing. But now that we're here and my team members are talking about the hardware arriving, I can hear the excitement in their voices.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/assembly-begins-on-nasa-s-next-tool-to-study-exoplanets"}]}]
