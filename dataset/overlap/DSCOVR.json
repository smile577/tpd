[{"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "It's all systems go for NOAA's first space weather satellite", "date": "2013-06-23", "content": "NOAA's first space weather satellite, DSCOVR, has completed instrument validation and will go operational on July 27, when it will take over the role of monitoring potentially damaging space weather storms as they approach Earth. DSCOVR, which stands for Deep Space Climate Observatory, brings improved measurements and higher quality data than currently available, giving forecasters better information with which to issue critical space weather warnings and alerts. \"Even though the sun is 93 million miles away, activity on the surface of the sun can have significant impacts here on Earth,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. \"Severe space weather can disrupt power grids, marine and aviation navigation, satellite operations, GPS systems and communication technologies. DSCOVR will allow us to deliver more timely, accurate, and actionable geomagnetic storm warnings, giving people time to prevent damage and disruption of important technological systems.\" DSCOVR's primary space weather sensors are the Faraday Cup plasma sensor, which measures the speed, density and temperature of the solar wind, and a magnetometer, which measures the strength and direction of the solar wind magnetic field. Together, the instruments provide forecasters with the necessary information to issue geomagnetic storm warnings. Data from DSCOVR's instrumentation will provide better information to forecasters and allow existing and future forecast models to run more reliably. The improvements also will open new opportunities for researchers to better understand coronal mass ejections along with high-speed solar wind and shocks, and to find ways to improve space weather forecasting. DSCOVR data will be used in a new forecast model - the Geospace Model - due to come on line this year. The Geospace Model will enable forecasters to issue regional, short-term space weather forecasts for the first time, including predictions on the timing and strength of a solar storm that will impact Earth. Currently, the Space Weather Prediction Center issues a single forecast for the entire planet. DSCOVR replaces NASA's aging research satellite, the Advanced Composition Explorer, also known as ACE. DSCOVR was launched on February 11, 2015, and reached final orbit on June 8. It is located one million miles from Earth, where the gravitational influence of the sun and the Earth are in equilibrium. DSCOVR serves as a distant early-warning sentinel, like a tsunami buoy in space, to alert NOAA of incoming eruptions from the sun. Data from DSCOVR, which will be available to the public in real-time online, will allow forecasters to provide space weather warnings and alerts up to an hour before a surge of particles and magnetic field generated by solar storms hit Earth. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) provides forecast products and data to infrastructure operators and the general public through its email alert service to more than 47,000 subscribers. Owners or operators of potentially vulnerable technologies can then take steps to protect their equipment or services. SWPC, the nation's official source for space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and alerts, operates 24-hours a day, seven day a week from Boulder, Colo. SWPC is one of nine centers under NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction. NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources.

The spacecraft arrived Thursday, and engineers planned to unpack the satellite inside a clean room to prepare DSCOVR for launch. Workers will hand over the 1,256-pound (570-kilogram) satellite to SpaceX in January for attachment to the company's Falcon 9 launcher at Cape Canaveral's Complex 40 launch pad.

The satellite will be positioned at the L1 libration point a million miles away from Earth, where its instruments will monitor space weather and the solar wind for a planned five-year mission. A swarm of charged particles approaching Earth from the sun can interfere with transportation and electrical infrastructure. A report by the National Research Council in 2009 concluded a large solar storm impacting Earth could cost between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, and it could take up to a decade to recover from the event. \"We must always stay on top of developing solar storm activity and provide accurate, timely forecasts,\" said Mike Simpson, the DSCOVR program manager at NOAA. \"DSCOVR will extend our capability to do that.\" The spacecraft will serve as a sentinel to warn scientists on Earth of approaching solar storms, giving up to an hour of lead time to inform commercial airlines, electric utility operators, and communications and GPS users of a potential disruption. NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer - launched in 1997 and operating well beyond its design life - is currently the only spacecraft capable of supplying such warning to NOAA's space weather forecast team. \"The instruments on DSCOVR will improve upon what we have with ACE, as they will continue to operate even during severe space weather storms. The DSCOVR data will also be used to drive the next generation of space weather models, allowing forecasters to specify where on Earth the storm conditions will be at their worst,\" said Doug Biesecker, DSCOVR program scientist at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo. The DSCOVR spacecraft was originally developed for launch in the late 1990s for the Triana mission, a NASA-led project to study Earth's climate and how much solar energy was being absorbed and reflected by Earth. Named for the sailor who first spotted land on Columbus's 1492 voyage to the Americas, the Triana mission had its genesis in an initiative backed by former Vice President Al Gore, who in 1998 proposed launching a satellite on the space shuttle to record live around-the-clock imagery of Earth from deep space. NASA suspended work on the Triana mission in 2001, then canceled the project in 2005, citing the dwindling number of remaining shuttle flights and a lack of funding to refurbish and launch the satellite. NOAA saw a use for the Triana spacecraft, which NASA kept under climate-controlled storage at Goddard for seven years, when scientists noticed a potential gap in solar storm warnings as the ACE satellite outlived its planned lifetime. Engineers took the spacecraft out of storage and put it through testing and modifications for launch on unmanned rocket. DSCOVR still hosts the Earth science instruments originally planned for the Triana mission, including a camera to capture true color images of the full disk of Earth every two hours and a sensor to measure how much solar energy affects the planet's climate. NOAA is in charge of the mission and operating DSCOVR after liftoff, and NASA is overseeing preparations on the spacecraft.

Longer wait for DSCOVR: Sunday's launch delay means that SpaceX's payload, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR for short), will have to wait at least another day to reach space. The satellite, originally conceived as an Earth science mission in 1998 under the name Triana, has been waiting 17 years for its ride into space. In 1998, then-Vice President Al Gore (who attended Sunday's launch try) championed the Triana satellite as a way to beam live, constant views of Earth from space for scientific study and educational uses.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched into orbit at 6:03 p.m. EST carrying the Deep Space Climate Observatory, a satellite designed to serve as an early-warning system for potentially dangerous solar storms. SpaceX was initially schedule to deliver the satellite on Sunday, but a series of delays pushed the launch to today. Video of the SpaceX launch showed the rocket soaring serenely into the sunset sky above its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch site in Florida. After delivering the satellite to space, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage was initially expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a landing attempt on a SpaceX drone ship parked in the Atlantic. Representatives with the spaceflight company, however, decided not to attempt the drone ship landing due to bad weather in the ocean at the landing site. \"The Falcon takes flight! Propelling the Deep Space Climate Observatory on a million-mile journey to protect our planet Earth,\" explained NASA spokesman Mike Curie during launch commentary. \"A beautiful ascent.\" SpaceX did manage to bring the rocket stage back for a soft ocean landing Wednesday, as it has done during previous Falcon 9 launches, company founder and CEO Elon Musk said. \"Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather,\" Musk said via Twitter Wednesday. The company attempted to land a Falcon 9 rocket first stage on the ship last month, but the booster ran out of hydraulic fluid for its four grid steering fins. It ultimately reached the drone ship, but landed hard, crashing and exploding in a brilliant fireball. Musk christened the drone ship originally scheduled to be used for this landing try \"Just Read the Instructions\" after the sentient colony ship of the same name in the novels of science fiction author Iain M. Banks. DSCOVR finally reaches space: The DSCOVR satellite is a partnership of NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force and has been in the works for more than 10 years. The satellite was originally approved in 1998 under the name Triana as a NASA Earth science mission championed by then-Vice President Al Gore for its mission to beam live views of the sunlit of Earth for science and educational purposes. \"The constant ability to see the earth whole, fully sunlit every single day; the opportunity for every man, woman and child who lives on the Earth to see, if they wish, their own home in the context of the whole, can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the Earth,\" Gore said during a press event taped by Space.com partner Spaceflight Now in Florida before launch. But cost overruns and political debates (the satellite was sometimes called \"GoreSat\" by critics) led to the Triana project's cancellation in 2001. The completed satellite was placed in storage until 2009, when NOAA and NASA resurrected the spacecraft as a space weather sentry. \"It was inspiring to witness the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR),\" Gore wrote in a statement posted on his blog just after liftoff. \"DSCOVR has embarked on its mission to further our understanding of Earth and enable citizens and scientists alike to better understand the reality of the climate crisis and envision its solutions. DSCOVR will also give us a wonderful opportunity to see the beauty and fragility of our planet and, in doing so, remind us of the duty to protect our only home.\" Now, the $340 million DSCOVR should help create an early-alert system for space weather, letting NOAA scientists know when harmful space weather could put satellites in orbit or power grids on Earth in danger. The spacecraft is now heading to its far-off orbit, a point 1 million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth known as Lagrange 1 to begin its solar sentry mission. A space weather tsunami buoy: The sun can erupt with large coronal mass ejections - explosions of super-hot plasma that shoot out from the star during solar storms or flares. When aimed directly at Earth, charged particles from these eruptions could harm satellites and astronauts in space as well as systems on the planet. Solar wind can actually knock power grids offline and disrupt telecommunications and GPS when it forcefully impacts Earth's magnetic field, according to NASA. \"Occasionally the sun will have a large eruption of magnetic field and energetic particles and if that comes toward the Earth and collides with the Earth's magnetic field in the magnetosphere, that's when you could get disturbances that we call solar or geomagnetic storms,\" Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Office, said in a video on the DSCOVR mission. \"These geomagnetic storms can be very damaging to critical infrastructure on Earth such as power grids, aviation communication systems, satellites in orbit.\" Scientists hope that once DSCOVR reaches its L1 destination, the mission will be able to let officials on the ground know 15 to 60 minutes before a geomagnetic storm strikes. It will also serve as a backup for NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which has been monitoring the sun's solar weather activity since 1997 and is far beyond its original operational life. Berger said ACE was originally built as a research satellite, not as an operational space weather buoy in deep space. That is why DSCOVR is so vital, he added. \"We're really looking forward to having a true space weather satellite monitoring the sun from L1,\" Berger said just before launch. Solar storms that could disrupt the power grid are relatively few and far between. One of the biggest space weather-related events, dubbed the Carrington Event, happened in 1859. The huge storm lit telegraph lines on fire, and if a storm of that level occurred again without warning, it could upset computer systems and the power grid, according to NASA. DSCOVR won't just be used to monitor space weather. The satellite will also have some climate-monitoring duties, beaming back data about ozone and aerosol amounts, cloud height, ultraviolet radiation and other information gathered by its Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). The EPIC instrument - a carryover from the original Triana mission - will also be able to photograph the entire sunlit side of Earth from DSCOVR's point in orbit, according to NASA. Another science instrument, called the National Institute of Standards & Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR), will monitor Earth's radiation. DSCOVR's mission is scheduled to last two years, but the spacecraft does have enough fuel onboard for five years, NASA officials have said.

The rocket was geared up to send the observatory, also known as DSCOVR, on its trek to a vantage point a million miles from Earth - and then make a second try to land the rocket's first stage on an oceangoing platform. But with 12 minutes left on the countdown clock, the upper-level winds were judged to be too strong for the rocket to handle. DSCOVR's liftoff was scheduled for Sunday, but a problem with the Air Force's radar tracking system and a stretch of unfavorable weather forced a two-day delay. With Tuesday's scrub, liftoff was rescheduled for 6:03 p.m. ET Wednesday. The weather outlook called for a 90 percent chance of acceptable weather. Even before the launch was postponed, SpaceX founder Elon Musk expressed concern about Tuesday's conditions. \"Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral,\" Musk said in a tweet. \"Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes...\" Falcon 9: Recovering the rocket: Strong winds would have added to the challenge of landing the first stage on what Musk calls an \"autonomous spaceport drone ship,\" currently stationed in the Atlantic Ocean about 370 miles (600 kilometers) off the Florida coast. SpaceX tried a similar maneuver last month, after launching a Dragon cargo ship to the International Space Station, but it didn't quite work. A system of stabilizing grid fins ran out of hydraulic fluid just before landing. As a result, the rocket hit the deck off-kilter and exploded. This time around, the planned trajectory is more challenging. In a tweet, Musk said the rocket stage would encounter two times the force and four times the heat as it makes its descent. \"Plenty of hydraulic fluid, though,\" he added. It's not as if Musk didn't have enough on his mind: At the same time that SpaceX was counting down to the DSCOVR launch, it was also preparing for the splashdown of the returning Dragon spaceship, about an hour and a half later off the coast of Baja California in the Pacific. DSCOVR: 17 years in the making: Meanwhile, the scientists behind DSCOVR were looking forward to the start of a $340 million deep-space mission that has been 17 years in the making.

The latest delay for DSCOVR is a minor one in the long and tortured history of the satellite. The mission dates back to 1998, when then-Vice President Al Gore announced plans for a spacecraft called Triana that would provide constant imagery of the full disk of the Earth for scientific and educational purposes. Those original plans called for NASA to build and launch the spacecraft by the year 2000. Triana ran into opposition from some members of Congress, however, who criticized the mission's usefulness as well as its White House origins. A 1999 report by NASA's Office of Inspector General concluded that while Triana's science was peer reviewed, NASA had not subjected the overall mission to the usual level of scrutiny. The administration of President George W. Bush elected not to continue Triana, and placed the completed spacecraft in storage in November 2001. NASA, in cooperation with NOAA and the U.S. Air Force, resurrected the spacecraft as DSCOVR in 2009 with a new focus on solar observations.

Banks. DSCOVR finally reaches space: The DSCOVR satellite is a partnership of NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force and has been in the works for more than 10 years. The satellite was originally approved in 1998 under the name Triana as a NASA Earth science mission championed by then-Vice President Al Gore for its mission to beam live views of the sunlit of Earth for science and educational purposes. \"The constant ability to see the earth whole, fully sunlit every single day; the opportunity for every man, woman and child who lives on the Earth to see, if they wish, their own home in the context of the whole, can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the Earth,\" Gore said during a press event taped by Space.com partner Spaceflight Now in Florida before launch. But cost overruns and political debates (the satellite was sometimes called \"GoreSat\" by critics) led to the Triana project's cancellation in 2001. The completed satellite was placed in storage until 2009, when NOAA and NASA resurrected the spacecraft as a space weather sentry. \"It was inspiring to witness the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR),\" Gore wrote in a statement posted on his blog just after liftoff. \"DSCOVR has embarked on its mission to further our understanding of Earth and enable citizens and scientists alike to better understand the reality of the climate crisis and envision its solutions. DSCOVR will also give us a wonderful opportunity to see the beauty and fragility of our planet and, in doing so, remind us of the duty to protect our only home.\" Now, the $340 million DSCOVR should help create an early-alert system for space weather, letting NOAA scientists know when harmful space weather could put satellites in orbit or power grids on Earth in danger. The spacecraft is now heading to its far-off orbit, a point 1 million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth known as Lagrange 1 to begin its solar sentry mission. A space weather tsunami buoy: The sun can erupt with large coronal mass ejections - explosions of super-hot plasma that shoot out from the star during solar storms or flares. When aimed directly at Earth, charged particles from these eruptions could harm satellites and astronauts in space as well as systems on the planet. Solar wind can actually knock power grids offline and disrupt telecommunications and GPS when it forcefully impacts Earth's magnetic field, according to NASA. \"Occasionally the sun will have a large eruption of magnetic field and energetic particles and if that comes toward the Earth and collides with the Earth's magnetic field in the magnetosphere, that's when you could get disturbances that we call solar or geomagnetic storms,\" Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Office, said in a video on the DSCOVR mission. \"These geomagnetic storms can be very damaging to critical infrastructure on Earth such as power grids, aviation communication systems, satellites in orbit.\" Scientists hope that once DSCOVR reaches its L1 destination, the mission will be able to let officials on the ground know 15 to 60 minutes before a geomagnetic storm strikes. It will also serve as a backup for NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which has been monitoring the sun's solar weather activity since 1997 and is far beyond its original operational life. Berger said ACE was originally built as a research satellite, not as an operational space weather buoy in deep space. That is why DSCOVR is so vital, he added. \"We're really looking forward to having a true space weather satellite monitoring the sun from L1,\" Berger said just before launch. Solar storms that could disrupt the power grid are relatively few and far between. One of the biggest space weather-related events, dubbed the Carrington Event, happened in 1859. The huge storm lit telegraph lines on fire, and if a storm of that level occurred again without warning, it could upset computer systems and the power grid, according to NASA. DSCOVR won't just be used to monitor space weather. The satellite will also have some climate-monitoring duties, beaming back data about ozone and aerosol amounts, cloud height, ultraviolet radiation and other information gathered by its Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). The EPIC instrument - a carryover from the original Triana mission - will also be able to photograph the entire sunlit side of Earth from DSCOVR's point in orbit, according to NASA. Another science instrument, called the National Institute of Standards & Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR), will monitor Earth's radiation. DSCOVR's mission is scheduled to last two years, but the spacecraft does have enough fuel onboard for five years, NASA officials have said.

The satellite, then called Triana - and lampooned as \"GoreSat\" - was due to launch on the ill-fated space shuttle Columbia mission in 2003, but it was pulled from the manifest and put into storage after President George W Bush moved into the White House. A decade later, Triana was refurbished and reborn as the DSCOVR solar observatory. In addition to instruments to study the solar wind, it has two sensors for Earth science observations, such as tracking volcanic plumes from deep space, measuring ozone and monitoring droughts, flooding and fires.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was less than 3 minutes from launching the Deep Space Climate Observatory into the sunset sky above Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida when the radar issue forced the delay. The next chance to launch the satellite, and attempt an ambitious Falcon 9 rocket landing test, will be on Monday if the radar issue can be fixed in time. Liftoff would occur at 6:07 p.m. EST. \"Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow,\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter after the delay. Musk added that the radar delay will allow SpaceX to replace a problematic video transmitter on the Falcon 9 booster's first stage. If SpaceX is able to proceed on Monday, you can watch the Falcon 9 launch live online beginning at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), courtesy of NASA TV. John Insprucker, SpaceX's Falcon 9 product manager, said the Air Force's tracking radar is a vital safety system to make sure that rocket launches remain on course as they launch across its Eastern Range. Range safety officers use the radar to track rockets in flight in order to destroy the boosters if something goes wrong. \"It is required for range safety for the flight of the Falcon 9,\" Insprucker said in a SpaceX webcast. The upcoming Falcon 9 rocket landing test will be SpaceX's second attempt this year to return a booster to Earth as part of the company's reusable rocket technology program. A Jan. 10 rocket landing attempt returned the Falcon 9 stage to SpaceX's autonomous spaceport drone ship, but crashed and exploded after running out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins on the way down. SpaceX has loaded the Falcon 9 booster on this flight with more hydraulic fluid for the trip. Musk has also named the drone ship \"Just Follow the Instructions\" after the sentient colony ship dreamed up by science fiction author Iain M. Banks. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are named for the Millennium Falcon of \"Star Wars\" lore. Longer wait for DSCOVR: Sunday's launch delay means that SpaceX's payload, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR for short), will have to wait at least another day to reach space. The satellite, originally conceived as an Earth science mission in 1998 under the name Triana, has been waiting 17 years for its ride into space. In 1998, then-Vice President Al Gore (who attended Sunday's launch try) championed the Triana satellite as a way to beam live, constant views of Earth from space for scientific study and educational uses. But by 2001, the mission was scrapped, and the fully built satellite mothballed and placed in storage. \"Politics got in the way and the mission was canceled,\" Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida) told reporters before launch in an ad hoc interview with Gore posted online by Spaceflight Now. \"But fortunately some visionary folks from NASA and NOAA knew that this payload was so important that they kept it alive and in storage so that it could have additional instruments added to it.\" In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration teamed with NASA to resurrect Triana as DSCOVR mission. On Sunday, Gore seemed to take the latest delay in stride. \"DSCOVER launch delayed due to AF radar malfunction. May launch later this week,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"After 17 years, that's nothing.\" Today, the satellite is designed primary to serve as a space weather early-warning system stationed about 1 million miles from Earth at Lagrange 1, a point in space directly between the Earth and sun.

The $340 million mission will look for bursts of particles coming from the sun in the solar wind, giving forecasters warning of solar storms that could disrupt radio communications, electrical grids, satellite operations and air travel. The Deep Space Climate Observatory blasted off Feb. 11 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, beginning a journey to the L1 Lagrange point, a gravitationally-stable location a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, DSCOVR has deployed its power-generating solar panels and extended a mechanical boom holding the spacecraft's primary solar wind detector. DSCOVR arrived Sunday and entered a looping halo orbit around L1, where it will complete final instrument checks before entering service as soon as July. Once operational, DSCOVR will be the first U.S. weather satellite in deep space. NOAA expects the mission to last at least two years, and DSCOVR carries enough fuel to function for five years. The observatory's instruments will monitor the constant stream of the solar wind, providing notice of activity that could generate solar storms. \"DSCOVR will trigger early warnings whenever it detects a surge of energy that could cause a geomagnetic storm that could bring possible damaging impacts for Earth,\" said Stephen Volz, assistant administrator for NOAA's satellite and information service, in a statement. The mission had to wait nearly two decades since its inception after the project became tied up in political wrangling in Washington. First proposed by then-Vice President Al Gore in 1998, the mission was supposed to broadcast live views of Earth from a distant vista a million miles away for live streaming on the Internet. Gore believed the mission - which Gore named Triana after one of the sailors on Columbus's 1492 voyage to the new world - would raise awareness of environmental issues, and scientists developed instruments to collect data on the planet's climate. But Republican lawmakers decried the mission as Gore's pet project, and Congress ordered NASA to stop work on Triana in late 1999. The space agency transferred the nearly-complete satellite into storage in November 2001 after President George W. Bush took office. NASA formally canceled the mission in 2005 after renaming Triana as DSCOVR. The space agency said the spacecraft, which was originally designed to launch on the space shuttle, could not fit on one of the shuttle's remaining missions. NOAA took charge of the mission to replace NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design life. ACE supplies early warning data on brewing solar storms. The U.S. Air Force also signed on to the project, agreeing to pay $97 million for DSCOVR's launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Air Force will use the space weather data for military purposes. \"DSCOVR will serve as our tsunami buoy in space, if you will, giving forecasters up to an hour's warning of these huge magnetic eruptions from the sun that occasionally occur, called Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, before the mission's Feb. 11 launch. Berger's team will use DSCOVR data to produce space weather forecasts to better predict which areas of Earth could be impacted by a solar storm. DSCOVR was already fitted with the instruments to detect fluctuations in the intensity, direction, velocity and temperature of the solar wind. The satellite still has the camera and radiometer to take pictures of Earth and track the planet's energy budget. Scientists hope the Earth science payload, which is operated by NASA and is now considered a secondary objective behind DSCOVR's solar wind detection role, will help sort out how much of the sun's energy is reflected back into space. The data point could help researchers determine how much humans contribute to Earth's changing climate. The door to DSCOVR's Earth-viewing camera was expected to open some time after the satellite's arrival at L1. Its first views of Earth should be released in the coming weeks. The imager will take a full-color picture of the sunlit side of Earth every four-to-six hours, and NASA plans to post the imagery on a public website.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/08/dscovr-space-weather-sentinel-reaches-finish-line/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "SpaceX to attempt ocean landing again after DSCOVR satellite launch", "date": "2015-02-08", "content": "A SpaceX rocket was scheduled on Sunday to launch a US satellite from deep storage to deep space, where it will keep tabs on solar storms and image Earth from nearly 1 million miles away.

A decade later, Triana was refurbished and reborn as the DSCOVR solar observatory. In addition to instruments to study the solar wind, it has two sensors for Earth science observations, such as tracking volcanic plumes from deep space, measuring ozone and monitoring droughts, flooding and fires. The satellite also will take pictures of Earth that will be posted on the internet every 24 hours, fulfilling in part Gore's dream.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was less than 3 minutes from launching the Deep Space Climate Observatory into the sunset sky above Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida when the radar issue forced the delay. The next chance to launch the satellite, and attempt an ambitious Falcon 9 rocket landing test, will be on Monday if the radar issue can be fixed in time. Liftoff would occur at 6:07 p.m. EST. \"Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow,\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter after the delay. Musk added that the radar delay will allow SpaceX to replace a problematic video transmitter on the Falcon 9 booster's first stage. If SpaceX is able to proceed on Monday, you can watch the Falcon 9 launch live online beginning at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), courtesy of NASA TV. John Insprucker, SpaceX's Falcon 9 product manager, said the Air Force's tracking radar is a vital safety system to make sure that rocket launches remain on course as they launch across its Eastern Range. Range safety officers use the radar to track rockets in flight in order to destroy the boosters if something goes wrong. \"It is required for range safety for the flight of the Falcon 9,\" Insprucker said in a SpaceX webcast. The upcoming Falcon 9 rocket landing test will be SpaceX's second attempt this year to return a booster to Earth as part of the company's reusable rocket technology program. A Jan. 10 rocket landing attempt returned the Falcon 9 stage to SpaceX's autonomous spaceport drone ship, but crashed and exploded after running out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins on the way down. SpaceX has loaded the Falcon 9 booster on this flight with more hydraulic fluid for the trip. Musk has also named the drone ship \"Just Follow the Instructions\" after the sentient colony ship dreamed up by science fiction author Iain M. Banks. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are named for the Millennium Falcon of \"Star Wars\" lore. Longer wait for DSCOVR: Sunday's launch delay means that SpaceX's payload, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR for short), will have to wait at least another day to reach space. The satellite, originally conceived as an Earth science mission in 1998 under the name Triana, has been waiting 17 years for its ride into space. In 1998, then-Vice President Al Gore (who attended Sunday's launch try) championed the Triana satellite as a way to beam live, constant views of Earth from space for scientific study and educational uses. But by 2001, the mission was scrapped, and the fully built satellite mothballed and placed in storage. \"Politics got in the way and the mission was canceled,\" Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida) told reporters before launch in an ad hoc interview with Gore posted online by Spaceflight Now. \"But fortunately some visionary folks from NASA and NOAA knew that this payload was so important that they kept it alive and in storage so that it could have additional instruments added to it.\" In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration teamed with NASA to resurrect Triana as DSCOVR mission. On Sunday, Gore seemed to take the latest delay in stride. \"DSCOVER launch delayed due to AF radar malfunction. May launch later this week,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"After 17 years, that's nothing.\" Today, the satellite is designed primary to serve as a space weather early-warning system stationed about 1 million miles from Earth at Lagrange 1, a point in space directly between the Earth and sun. There, the satellite will be able to detect major solar storms that could interfere with aviation, navigation systems and power grids on Earth and give scientists up to a 60-minute lead on severe space weather events. The $340 million mission has a two-year primary lifespan, but could last up to five years depending on how much fuel it uses.", "url": "https://www.space.com/28490-spacex-dscovr-satellite-launch-delay.html"}, {"title": "SpaceX Launches DSCOVR Space Weather Satellite, But No Rocket Landing", "date": "2015-02-11", "content": "The third time was the charm for SpaceX Wednesday with the launch of a long-delayed space weather satellite on a million-mile trek into deep space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched into orbit at 6:03 p.m. EST carrying the Deep Space Climate Observatory, a satellite designed to serve as an early-warning system for potentially dangerous solar storms. SpaceX was initially schedule to deliver the satellite on Sunday, but a series of delays pushed the launch to today. Video of the SpaceX launch showed the rocket soaring serenely into the sunset sky above its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch site in Florida. After delivering the satellite to space, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage was initially expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a landing attempt on a SpaceX drone ship parked in the Atlantic. Representatives with the spaceflight company, however, decided not to attempt the drone ship landing due to bad weather in the ocean at the landing site. \"The Falcon takes flight! Propelling the Deep Space Climate Observatory on a million-mile journey to protect our planet Earth,\" explained NASA spokesman Mike Curie during launch commentary. \"A beautiful ascent.\" SpaceX did manage to bring the rocket stage back for a soft ocean landing Wednesday, as it has done during previous Falcon 9 launches, company founder and CEO Elon Musk said. \"Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather,\" Musk said via Twitter Wednesday. The company attempted to land a Falcon 9 rocket first stage on the ship last month, but the booster ran out of hydraulic fluid for its four grid steering fins. It ultimately reached the drone ship, but landed hard, crashing and exploding in a brilliant fireball. Musk christened the drone ship originally scheduled to be used for this landing try \"Just Read the Instructions\" after the sentient colony ship of the same name in the novels of science fiction author Iain M. Banks. DSCOVR finally reaches space: The DSCOVR satellite is a partnership of NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force and has been in the works for more than 10 years. The satellite was originally approved in 1998 under the name Triana as a NASA Earth science mission championed by then-Vice President Al Gore for its mission to beam live views of the sunlit of Earth for science and educational purposes. \"The constant ability to see the earth whole, fully sunlit every single day; the opportunity for every man, woman and child who lives on the Earth to see, if they wish, their own home in the context of the whole, can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the Earth,\" Gore said during a press event taped by Space.com partner Spaceflight Now in Florida before launch. But cost overruns and political debates (the satellite was sometimes called \"GoreSat\" by critics) led to the Triana project's cancellation in 2001. The completed satellite was placed in storage until 2009, when NOAA and NASA resurrected the spacecraft as a space weather sentry. \"It was inspiring to witness the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR),\" Gore wrote in a statement posted on his blog just after liftoff. \"DSCOVR has embarked on its mission to further our understanding of Earth and enable citizens and scientists alike to better understand the reality of the climate crisis and envision its solutions. DSCOVR will also give us a wonderful opportunity to see the beauty and fragility of our planet and, in doing so, remind us of the duty to protect our only home.\" Now, the $340 million DSCOVR should help create an early-alert system for space weather, letting NOAA scientists know when harmful space weather could put satellites in orbit or power grids on Earth in danger. The spacecraft is now heading to its far-off orbit, a point 1 million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth known as Lagrange 1 to begin its solar sentry mission. A space weather tsunami buoy: The sun can erupt with large coronal mass ejections - explosions of super-hot plasma that shoot out from the star during solar storms or flares. When aimed directly at Earth, charged particles from these eruptions could harm satellites and astronauts in space as well as systems on the planet. Solar wind can actually knock power grids offline and disrupt telecommunications and GPS when it forcefully impacts Earth's magnetic field, according to NASA. \"Occasionally the sun will have a large eruption of magnetic field and energetic particles and if that comes toward the Earth and collides with the Earth's magnetic field in the magnetosphere, that's when you could get disturbances that we call solar or geomagnetic storms,\" Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Office, said in a video on the DSCOVR mission. \"These geomagnetic storms can be very damaging to critical infrastructure on Earth such as power grids, aviation communication systems, satellites in orbit.\" Scientists hope that once DSCOVR reaches its L1 destination, the mission will be able to let officials on the ground know 15 to 60 minutes before a geomagnetic storm strikes. It will also serve as a backup for NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which has been monitoring the sun's solar weather activity since 1997 and is far beyond its original operational life. Berger said ACE was originally built as a research satellite, not as an operational space weather buoy in deep space. That is why DSCOVR is so vital, he added. \"We're really looking forward to having a true space weather satellite monitoring the sun from L1,\" Berger said just before launch. Solar storms that could disrupt the power grid are relatively few and far between. One of the biggest space weather-related events, dubbed the Carrington Event, happened in 1859. The huge storm lit telegraph lines on fire, and if a storm of that level occurred again without warning, it could upset computer systems and the power grid, according to NASA. DSCOVR won't just be used to monitor space weather. The satellite will also have some climate-monitoring duties, beaming back data about ozone and aerosol amounts, cloud height, ultraviolet radiation and other information gathered by its Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). The EPIC instrument - a carryover from the original Triana mission - will also be able to photograph the entire sunlit side of Earth from DSCOVR's point in orbit, according to NASA. Another science instrument, called the National Institute of Standards & Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR), will monitor Earth's radiation. DSCOVR's mission is scheduled to last two years, but the spacecraft does have enough fuel onboard for five years, NASA officials have said.

The rocket was geared up to send the observatory, also known as DSCOVR, on its trek to a vantage point a million miles from Earth - and then make a second try to land the rocket's first stage on an oceangoing platform. But with 12 minutes left on the countdown clock, the upper-level winds were judged to be too strong for the rocket to handle. DSCOVR's liftoff was scheduled for Sunday, but a problem with the Air Force's radar tracking system and a stretch of unfavorable weather forced a two-day delay. With Tuesday's scrub, liftoff was rescheduled for 6:03 p.m. ET Wednesday. The weather outlook called for a 90 percent chance of acceptable weather. Even before the launch was postponed, SpaceX founder Elon Musk expressed concern about Tuesday's conditions. \"Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral,\" Musk said in a tweet. \"Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes...\" Falcon 9: Recovering the rocket: Strong winds would have added to the challenge of landing the first stage on what Musk calls an \"autonomous spaceport drone ship,\" currently stationed in the Atlantic Ocean about 370 miles (600 kilometers) off the Florida coast. SpaceX tried a similar maneuver last month, after launching a Dragon cargo ship to the International Space Station, but it didn't quite work. A system of stabilizing grid fins ran out of hydraulic fluid just before landing. As a result, the rocket hit the deck off-kilter and exploded. This time around, the planned trajectory is more challenging. In a tweet, Musk said the rocket stage would encounter two times the force and four times the heat as it makes its descent. \"Plenty of hydraulic fluid, though,\" he added. It's not as if Musk didn't have enough on his mind: At the same time that SpaceX was counting down to the DSCOVR launch, it was also preparing for the splashdown of the returning Dragon spaceship, about an hour and a half later off the coast of Baja California in the Pacific. DSCOVR: 17 years in the making: Meanwhile, the scientists behind DSCOVR were looking forward to the start of a $340 million deep-space mission that has been 17 years in the making. The mission started out in 1998 as an idea of Vice President Al Gore's - to send a probe with a camera out to a stable gravitational point known as L1 to capture inspirational full-color, full-disk views of Earth.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacex-scrubs-falcon-9s-dscovr-launch-again-due-winds-n303966"}, {"title": "DSCOVR space weather sentinel reaches finish line", "date": "2015-06-08", "content": "A new space weather observatory launched in February has completed a four-month journey to an operating post a million miles from Earth, NOAA announced Monday. The $340 million mission will look for bursts of particles coming from the sun in the solar wind, giving forecasters warning of solar storms that could disrupt radio communications, electrical grids, satellite operations and air travel. The Deep Space Climate Observatory blasted off Feb. 11 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, beginning a journey to the L1 Lagrange point, a gravitationally-stable location a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, DSCOVR has deployed its power-generating solar panels and extended a mechanical boom holding the spacecraft's primary solar wind detector. DSCOVR arrived Sunday and entered a looping halo orbit around L1, where it will complete final instrument checks before entering service as soon as July. Once operational, DSCOVR will be the first U.S. weather satellite in deep space. NOAA expects the mission to last at least two years, and DSCOVR carries enough fuel to function for five years. The observatory's instruments will monitor the constant stream of the solar wind, providing notice of activity that could generate solar storms. \"DSCOVR will trigger early warnings whenever it detects a surge of energy that could cause a geomagnetic storm that could bring possible damaging impacts for Earth,\" said Stephen Volz, assistant administrator for NOAA's satellite and information service, in a statement.

Gore believed the mission - which Gore named Triana after one of the sailors on Columbus's 1492 voyage to the new world - would raise awareness of environmental issues, and scientists developed instruments to collect data on the planet's climate. But Republican lawmakers decried the mission as Gore's pet project, and Congress ordered NASA to stop work on Triana in late 1999. The space agency transferred the nearly-complete satellite into storage in November 2001 after President George W. Bush took office. NASA formally canceled the mission in 2005 after renaming Triana as DSCOVR. The space agency said the spacecraft, which was originally designed to launch on the space shuttle, could not fit on one of the shuttle's remaining missions. NOAA took charge of the mission to replace NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design life. ACE supplies early warning data on brewing solar storms. The U.S. Air Force also signed on to the project, agreeing to pay $97 million for DSCOVR's launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Air Force will use the space weather data for military purposes. \"DSCOVR will serve as our tsunami buoy in space, if you will, giving forecasters up to an hour's warning of these huge magnetic eruptions from the sun that occasionally occur, called Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, before the mission's Feb. 11 launch. Berger's team will use DSCOVR data to produce space weather forecasts to better predict which areas of Earth could be impacted by a solar storm. DSCOVR was already fitted with the instruments to detect fluctuations in the intensity, direction, velocity and temperature of the solar wind. The satellite still has the camera and radiometer to take pictures of Earth and track the planet's energy budget. Scientists hope the Earth science payload, which is operated by NASA and is now considered a secondary objective behind DSCOVR's solar wind detection role, will help sort out how much of the sun's energy is reflected back into space. The data point could help researchers determine how much humans contribute to Earth's changing climate. The door to DSCOVR's Earth-viewing camera was expected to open some time after the satellite's arrival at L1. Its first views of Earth should be released in the coming weeks.

In addition to space weather-monitoring instruments, DSCOVR is carrying two NASA Earth-observing instruments that will gather a range of measurements from ozone and aerosol amounts, to changes in Earth's radiation budget-the balance between incoming radiation (largely from the sun) and that which is reflected from Earth. This balance affects our climate. \"DSCOVR has reached its final orbit and will soon be ready to begin its mission of space weather monitoring for NOAA and Earth observing for NASA,\" said Al Vernacchio, DSCOVR project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.

In addition to space weather-monitoring instruments, DSCOVR is carrying two NASA Earth-observing instruments that will gather a range of measurements from ozone and aerosol amounts, to changes in Earth's radiation budget-the balance between incoming radiation (largely from the sun) and that which is reflected from Earth. This balance affects our climate. \"DSCOVR has reached its final orbit and will soon be ready to begin its mission of space weather monitoring for NOAA and Earth observing for NASA,\" said Al Vernacchio, DSCOVR project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo., will begin using data from DSCOVR in its space weather forecasts as soon as DSCOVR is deemed operational. The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NOAA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force provided the Space X Falcon 9 launch vehicle for the mission. NOAA will operate DSCOVR from its NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Md., and process the space weather data at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, Colo., one of NOAA's nine National Centers for Environmental Prediction. SWPC will distribute these data to users within the United States and around the world. The data will be archived at NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information.

The $340 million mission will look for bursts of particles coming from the sun in the solar wind, giving forecasters warning of solar storms that could disrupt radio communications, electrical grids, satellite operations and air travel. The Deep Space Climate Observatory blasted off Feb. 11 on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, beginning a journey to the L1 Lagrange point, a gravitationally-stable location a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. Since its launch from Cape Canaveral, DSCOVR has deployed its power-generating solar panels and extended a mechanical boom holding the spacecraft's primary solar wind detector. DSCOVR arrived Sunday and entered a looping halo orbit around L1, where it will complete final instrument checks before entering service as soon as July. Once operational, DSCOVR will be the first U.S. weather satellite in deep space. NOAA expects the mission to last at least two years, and DSCOVR carries enough fuel to function for five years. The observatory's instruments will monitor the constant stream of the solar wind, providing notice of activity that could generate solar storms. \"DSCOVR will trigger early warnings whenever it detects a surge of energy that could cause a geomagnetic storm that could bring possible damaging impacts for Earth,\" said Stephen Volz, assistant administrator for NOAA's satellite and information service, in a statement. The mission had to wait nearly two decades since its inception after the project became tied up in political wrangling in Washington. First proposed by then-Vice President Al Gore in 1998, the mission was supposed to broadcast live views of Earth from a distant vista a million miles away for live streaming on the Internet. Gore believed the mission - which Gore named Triana after one of the sailors on Columbus's 1492 voyage to the new world - would raise awareness of environmental issues, and scientists developed instruments to collect data on the planet's climate. But Republican lawmakers decried the mission as Gore's pet project, and Congress ordered NASA to stop work on Triana in late 1999. The space agency transferred the nearly-complete satellite into storage in November 2001 after President George W. Bush took office. NASA formally canceled the mission in 2005 after renaming Triana as DSCOVR. The space agency said the spacecraft, which was originally designed to launch on the space shuttle, could not fit on one of the shuttle's remaining missions. NOAA took charge of the mission to replace NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design life. ACE supplies early warning data on brewing solar storms. The U.S. Air Force also signed on to the project, agreeing to pay $97 million for DSCOVR's launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Air Force will use the space weather data for military purposes. \"DSCOVR will serve as our tsunami buoy in space, if you will, giving forecasters up to an hour's warning of these huge magnetic eruptions from the sun that occasionally occur, called Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, before the mission's Feb. 11 launch. Berger's team will use DSCOVR data to produce space weather forecasts to better predict which areas of Earth could be impacted by a solar storm. DSCOVR was already fitted with the instruments to detect fluctuations in the intensity, direction, velocity and temperature of the solar wind. The satellite still has the camera and radiometer to take pictures of Earth and track the planet's energy budget. Scientists hope the Earth science payload, which is operated by NASA and is now considered a secondary objective behind DSCOVR's solar wind detection role, will help sort out how much of the sun's energy is reflected back into space. The data point could help researchers determine how much humans contribute to Earth's changing climate. The door to DSCOVR's Earth-viewing camera was expected to open some time after the satellite's arrival at L1. Its first views of Earth should be released in the coming weeks. The imager will take a full-color picture of the sunlit side of Earth every four-to-six hours, and NASA plans to post the imagery on a public website.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/08/dscovr-space-weather-sentinel-reaches-finish-line/"}, {"title": "NOAA's First Operational Satellite in Deep Space Reaches Final Orbit", "date": "2015-07-08", "content": "More than 100 days after it launched, NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite has reached its orbit position about one million miles from Earth.

Its orbit between Earth and the sun is at a location called the Lagrange point 1, or L1, which gives DSCOVR a unique vantage point to see the Earth and sun. Data from DSCOVR, coupled with a new forecast model set to come online in 2016, will enable NOAA's space weather forecasters to predict geomagnetic storm magnitude on a regional basis. Geomagnetic storms occur when plasma and magnetic fields streaming from the sun impact Earth's magnetic field.

Once final instrument checks are completed, DSCOVR, which will provide improved measurements of solar wind conditions to enhance NOAA's ability to warn of potentially harmful solar activity, will be the NOAA's first operational space weather satellite in deep space. Its orbit between Earth and the sun is at a location called the Lagrange point 1, or L1, which gives DSCOVR a unique vantage point to see the Earth and sun. Data from DSCOVR, coupled with a new forecast model set to come online in 2016, will enable NOAA's space weather forecasters to predict geomagnetic storm magnitude on a regional basis. Geomagnetic storms occur when plasma and magnetic fields streaming from the sun impact Earth's magnetic field. Large magnetic eruptions from the sun have the potential to bring major disruptions to power grids, aviation, telecommunications, and GPS systemsDSCOVR will trigger early warnings whenever it detects a surge of energy that could cause a geomagnetic storm that could bring possible damaging impacts for Earth,\" said Stephen Volz, Ph.D., Assistant Administrator for NOAA's Satellite and Information Service. DSCOVR will eventually replace NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) research satellite as America's primary warning system for solar magnetic storms headed towards Earth. ACE will continue to provide valuable research data to the science community. In addition to space weather-monitoring instruments, DSCOVR is carrying two NASA Earth-observing instruments that will gather a range of measurements from ozone and aerosol amounts, to changes in Earth's radiation budget-the balance between incoming radiation (largely from the sun) and that which is reflected from Earth. This balance affects our climate. \"DSCOVR has reached its final orbit and will soon be ready to begin its mission of space weather monitoring for NOAA and Earth observing for NASA,\" said Al Vernacchio, DSCOVR project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colo., will begin using data from DSCOVR in its space weather forecasts as soon as DSCOVR is deemed operational. The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NOAA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force provided the Space X Falcon 9 launch vehicle for the mission. NOAA will operate DSCOVR from its NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Md., and process the space weather data at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, Colo., one of NOAA's nine National Centers for Environmental Prediction. SWPC will distribute these data to users within the United States and around the world. The data will be archived at NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information.

The Earth views are not the primary purpose of the $340 million Deep Space Climate Observatory, but the imagery will be piped to the devices of anyone who wants to see what their home planet looks like every day, surely making the photos the most publicly accessible part of the mission. The result of a space mission first proposed by Al Gore in 1998, DSCOVR blasted off in February aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket after years of starts and stops before finally winning final launch approvals under a partnership between NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Air Force. Its main objective is to track the solar wind streaming toward Earth from the sun, giving warning of incoming solar storms that could disrupt air travel, electrical grids, communications and satellite operations. But the spacecraft also has a camera looking back at Earth, and a NASA website went live Monday showing the latest views from DSCOVR. DSCOVR reached its operating post at the L1 Lagrange point between Earth and the sun in June. The position gives the spacecraft uninterrupted views of the sunlit side of Earth and a place embedded in the stream of particles making up the supersonic solar wind flowing from the sun. Gore envisioned a satellite with the ability to beam back non-stop live views of Earth on the Internet.

But the chief purpose of DSCOVR is space weather forecasting, and NOAA says information collected by the satellite will help experts predict geomagnetic storms on regional scales, an improvement over the global forecasts currently issued. \"DSCOVR data will be used in a new forecast model - the Geospace Model - due to come on line this year,\" NOAA said in a statement. \"The Geospace Model will enable forecasters to issue regional, short-term space weather forecasts for the first time, including predictions on the timing and strength of a solar storm that will impact Earth.\" The spacecraft's location at L1 gives space weather forecasters, satellite operators, and infrastructure managers up to an hour of warning before the effects of a solar storm arrive at Earth.

From its position between the sun and Earth, DSCOVR conducts its primary mission of real-time solar wind monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). EPIC maintains a constant view of the fully illuminated Earth as it rotates, providing scientific observations of ozone, vegetation, cloud height and aerosols in the atmosphere. The EPIC camera is providing a series of Earth images allowing study of daily variations over the entire globe. These images were taken between July 4 at 11:50 p.m. EDT and July 5 at 3:18 a.m. EDT (0350 UTC and 0718 UTC on July 5), showing the moon moving over the Indian and Pacific oceans. The North Pole is at the top of the images. DSCOVR is orbiting around the sun-Earth first Lagrange point (where the gravitational pull of Earth is equal and opposite of that of the sun) in a complex, non-recurring orbit that changes from an ellipse to a circle and back (called a Lissajous orbit) taking the spacecraft between 4 and 12 degrees from the sun-Earth line. This orbit intersects the lunar orbit about four times a year. However, depending on the relative orbital phases of the moon and DSCOVR, the moon appears between the spacecraft and Earth once or twice a year. The last time EPIC captured this event was between 3:50 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT on July 16, 2015. EPIC's \"natural color\" images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images. Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the moon. Because the moon has moved in relation to Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the moon in these unaltered images. DSCOVR is a partnership between NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Air Force with the primary objective of maintaining the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth-for-2nd-time-in-a-year"}, {"title": "The DSCOVR Satellite is Earth's Best Space Weather Fighting Robot", "date": "2016-07-27", "content": "Today was the first day on the job for a 1,200-pound satellite dubbed the Deep Space Climate Observatory 's - DSCOVR for short - that took over as the primary space tech that helps protect our planet from hostile space weather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's space weather forecasts shifted to being exclusively supported by DSCOVR data instead of using data primarily from the 19-year-old Advanced Composition Explorer. Why is this such a big deal? Space weather means a lot for the world's electrical grids, mostly. For the uninitiated, the term refers to the movement and behavior of solar winds ; coronal mass ejections from the sun; varying conditions in the magnetosphere and ionosphere; and other strange cosmic bits hurtling through the vacuum of space. It's basically how high- energy events interface with the electrical and magnetic parts of Earth's atmosphere. Imagine a really powerful solar storm flaring up. Mere minutes later, if no precautionary measures are taken, you have a scenario where entire swaths of the world could lose power - airplane communications and navigation systems could go dark and automated equipment that operates on a centimeter scale would suddenly malfunction. \"Space weather impacts all those kinds of things,\" says Douglas A. Biesecker, the chief program scientist for DSCOVR, based at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. \"These are systems you and I don't necessarily use on a day-to-day basis,\" he tells Inverse, but they are critical for keeping our world spinning. DSCOVR resides in the very distant Lissajous orbit. It's not the most well-known spacecraft orbiting the Earth, but it plays a critical role in helping scientists on Earth monitor space weather. As stated, the biggest concern about solar winds relates to power grids. Space weather could damage critical transformers that move power across large distances at very, very high voltages, and scale that power down to something suitable for our home. If an aberrant space weather event were to knock out those transformers, \"it could take years to replace them all,\" Biesecker says. \"We consider it critical to provide customers with the best quality forecasts in the mornings.\" DSCOVR can see an event from the sun - which produces energetic phenomena traveling at about one to four million miles per hour - and warns us humans to make preparations to protect essential tools, instruments, and infrastructure. The biggest advantage to DSCOVR over ACE is \"the continuity of observations,\" he says. \"The quality of ACE's data suffers frequently, explains Biesecker. NOAA issues space weather forecast alerts on a scale of 1 to 5. The \"noise generated by the ACE data will, by default, add 1 to the scale. An alert under ACE turns out to be nothing as observed by DSCOVR. Its really been remarkable to see how much of a difference that makes to our models,\" he says. \"The data is unprecedented.\" DSCOVR's role as the world's space weather meteorologist is all thanks to its Plasma-Magnetometer instrument. \"PlasMag provides us with data on the solar winds,\" says Biesecker. \"The magnetic field and its direction, and the solar winds' speed, density, and temperature.\" This is the information that helps inform NOAA what kind of warnings to send out to the public, as well as drive the models that illustrate how the planet is responding to these constant winds. In addition, Biesecker and other researchers are hoping to use DSCOVR for more ambitious forms of solar wind research. We're delving so fast into new \"atomic- scale physics\", like sampling shockwaves caused by coronal mass ejections \"in very high detail,\" he says. Besides that, however, DSCOVR has a couple other tricks up its sleeves.

DSCOVR, which stands for Deep Space Climate Observatory, brings improved measurements and higher quality data than currently available, giving forecasters better information with which to issue critical space weather warnings and alerts. \"Even though the sun is 93 million miles away, activity on the surface of the sun can have significant impacts here on Earth,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. \"Severe space weather can disrupt power grids, marine and aviation navigation, satellite operations, GPS systems and communication technologies. DSCOVR will allow us to deliver more timely, accurate, and actionable geomagnetic storm warnings, giving people time to prevent damage and disruption of important technological systems.\" DSCOVR's primary space weather sensors are the Faraday Cup plasma sensor, which measures the speed, density and temperature of the solar wind, and a magnetometer, which measures the strength and direction of the solar wind magnetic field. Together, the instruments provide forecasters with the necessary information to issue geomagnetic storm warnings. Data from DSCOVR, which will be available to the public in real-timeonline, will allow forecasters to provide space weather warnings and alerts up to an hour before a surge of particles and magnetic field generated by solar storms hit Earth.

Positioned in a halo-like orbit around the L1 Lagrange point nearly a million miles from Earth in line with the sun, the DSCOVR spacecraft is beginning a mission of at least two years monitoring the solar wind, looking for spikes that could spark powerful geomagnetic storms at Earth. \"Even though the sun is 93 million miles away, activity on the surface of the sun can have significant impacts here on Earth,\" said Tom Berger, director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. \"Severe space weather can disrupt power grids, marine and aviation navigation, satellite operations, GPS systems and communication technologies.\" Launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in February 2015, DSCOVR is a joint project between mission leader NOAA, NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The spacecraft cruised to the L1 Lagrange point, arriving last June to begin a comprehensive engineering checkout before managers pressed the observatory into service. NOAA announced last week that DSCOVR has completed instrument validations and will go operational July 27. \"DSCOVR will allow us to deliver more timely, accurate, and actionable geomagnetic storm warnings, giving people time to prevent damage and disruption of important technological systems,\" Berger said. The early warning platform carries a Faraday Cup plasma sensor to measure the speed, density and temperature of the solar wind, and a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of the solar magnetic field, according to NOAA. DSCOVR also hosts two NASA-managed instruments: a camera to acquire full-disk images of the day side of Earth and a radiometer to monitor the planet's energy budget. The imager returns spectacular snapshots of Earth several times per day, and the radiometer provides data for climate change researchers. But the chief purpose of DSCOVR is space weather forecasting, and NOAA says information collected by the satellite will help experts predict geomagnetic storms on regional scales, an improvement over the global forecasts currently issued. \"DSCOVR data will be used in a new forecast model - the Geospace Model - due to come on line this year,\" NOAA said in a statement. \"The Geospace Model will enable forecasters to issue regional, short-term space weather forecasts for the first time, including predictions on the timing and strength of a solar storm that will impact Earth.\" The spacecraft's location at L1 gives space weather forecasters, satellite operators, and infrastructure managers up to an hour of warning before the effects of a solar storm arrive at Earth. Data from DSCOVR will be distributed to the public, along with official forecasts from NOAA. The new observatory replaces NASA's aging Advanced Composition Explorer, which launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design life. DSCOVR is slated to function at least two years, but it carries enough fuel for at least five years of operations. ACE will be kept in a backup role until at least next year, when NASA will decide on the future of the mission. NOAA plans to have an upgraded replacement for DSCOVR ready for launch in 2022, according to the agency's budget documents. \"There is a plan for space weather continuity after DSCOVR,\" said Doug Biesecker, DSCOVR mission scientist at NOAA. \"The baseline mission is to provide in-situ magnetic field, thermal plasma, supra-thermal ions, and a remote-sensing instrument, a coronagraph.\" The coronagraph instrument is not aboard DSCOVR, and it would replace the remote imaging capability currently offered by the NASA/ESA SOHO mission at L1. A coronagraph provides scientists warning of approaching solar storms as they are triggered by massive eruptions on the sun, several days before the effects arrive on Earth. NOAA's budget request for fiscal year 2017 asks for money for two spacecraft, two launch vehicles and two sets of instruments, and the program has won initial support from lawmakers drafting the agency's final budget. The first of the satellites would be launched in 2022 at the end of DSCOVR's projected life. The DSCOVR mission had to wait nearly two decades since its inception after the project became tied up in political wrangling in Washington. First proposed by then-Vice President Al Gore in 1998, the mission was supposed to broadcast live views of Earth from a distant vista a million miles away for live streaming on the Internet. Gore believed the mission - which Gore named Triana after one of the sailors on Columbus's 1492 voyage to the new world - would raise awareness of environmental issues, and scientists developed instruments to collect data on the planet's climate. But Republican lawmakers decried the mission as Gore's pet project, and Congress ordered NASA to stop work on Triana in late 1999. The space agency transferred the nearly-complete satellite into storage in November 2001 after President George W. Bush took office. NASA formally canceled the mission in 2005 after renaming Triana as DSCOVR. The space agency said the spacecraft, which was originally designed to launch on the space shuttle, could not fit on one of the shuttle's remaining missions. NOAA took charge of the mission in 2008 to replace ACE, and the U.S. Air Force signed on to pay for DSCOVR's launch on a Falcon 9 rocket.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/06/27/new-and-improved-space-weather-observatory-goes-live-next-month/"}, {"title": "NASA Camera Shows Moon Crossing Face of Earth for 2nd Time in a Year", "date": "2016-07-12", "content": "For only the second time in a year, a NASA camera aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite captured a view of the moon as it moved in front of the sunlit side of Earth. \"For the second time in the life of DSCOVR, the moon moved between the spacecraft and Earth,\" said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The project recorded this event on July 5 with the same cadence and spatial resolution as the first 'lunar photobomb' of last year.\" The images were captured by NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), a four-megapixel CCD camera and telescope on the DSCOVR satellite orbiting 1 million miles from Earth. From its position between the sun and Earth, DSCOVR conducts its primary mission of real-time solar wind monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). EPIC maintains a constant view of the fully illuminated Earth as it rotates, providing scientific observations of ozone, vegetation, cloud height and aerosols in the atmosphere. The EPIC camera is providing a series of Earth images allowing study of daily variations over the entire globe. These images were taken between July 4 at 11:50 p.m. EDT and July 5 at 3:18 a.m. EDT (0350 UTC and 0718 UTC on July 5), showing the moon moving over the Indian and Pacific oceans. The North Pole is at the top of the images. DSCOVR is orbiting around the sun-Earth first Lagrange point (where the gravitational pull of Earth is equal and opposite of that of the sun) in a complex, non-recurring orbit that changes from an ellipse to a circle and back (called a Lissajous orbit) taking the spacecraft between 4 and 12 degrees from the sun-Earth line. This orbit intersects the lunar orbit about four times a year. However, depending on the relative orbital phases of the moon and DSCOVR, the moon appears between the spacecraft and Earth once or twice a year. The last time EPIC captured this event was between 3:50 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT on July 16, 2015. EPIC's \"natural color\" images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images. Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the moon. Because the moon has moved in relation to Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the moon in these unaltered images.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's space weather forecasts shifted to being exclusively supported by DSCOVR data instead of using data primarily from the 19-year-old Advanced Composition Explorer. Why is this such a big deal? Space weather means a lot for the world's electrical grids, mostly. For the uninitiated, the term refers to the movement and behavior of solar winds ; coronal mass ejections from the sun; varying conditions in the magnetosphere and ionosphere; and other strange cosmic bits hurtling through the vacuum of space. It's basically how high- energy events interface with the electrical and magnetic parts of Earth's atmosphere. Imagine a really powerful solar storm flaring up. Mere minutes later, if no precautionary measures are taken, you have a scenario where entire swaths of the world could lose power - airplane communications and navigation systems could go dark and automated equipment that operates on a centimeter scale would suddenly malfunction. \"Space weather impacts all those kinds of things,\" says Douglas A. Biesecker, the chief program scientist for DSCOVR, based at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. \"These are systems you and I don't necessarily use on a day-to-day basis,\" he tells Inverse, but they are critical for keeping our world spinning. DSCOVR resides in the very distant Lissajous orbit. It's not the most well-known spacecraft orbiting the Earth, but it plays a critical role in helping scientists on Earth monitor space weather. As stated, the biggest concern about solar winds relates to power grids. Space weather could damage critical transformers that move power across large distances at very, very high voltages, and scale that power down to something suitable for our home. If an aberrant space weather event were to knock out those transformers, \"it could take years to replace them all,\" Biesecker says. \"We consider it critical to provide customers with the best quality forecasts in the mornings.\" DSCOVR can see an event from the sun - which produces energetic phenomena traveling at about one to four million miles per hour - and warns us humans to make preparations to protect essential tools, instruments, and infrastructure. The biggest advantage to DSCOVR over ACE is \"the continuity of observations,\" he says. \"The quality of ACE's data suffers frequently, explains Biesecker. NOAA issues space weather forecast alerts on a scale of 1 to 5. The \"noise generated by the ACE data will, by default, add 1 to the scale. An alert under ACE turns out to be nothing as observed by DSCOVR. Its really been remarkable to see how much of a difference that makes to our models,\" he says. \"The data is unprecedented.\" DSCOVR's role as the world's space weather meteorologist is all thanks to its Plasma-Magnetometer instrument. \"PlasMag provides us with data on the solar winds,\" says Biesecker. \"The magnetic field and its direction, and the solar winds' speed, density, and temperature.\" This is the information that helps inform NOAA what kind of warnings to send out to the public, as well as drive the models that illustrate how the planet is responding to these constant winds. In addition, Biesecker and other researchers are hoping to use DSCOVR for more ambitious forms of solar wind research. We're delving so fast into new \"atomic- scale physics\", like sampling shockwaves caused by coronal mass ejections \"in very high detail,\" he says.

From its position between the sun and Earth, DSCOVR conducts its primary mission of real-time solar wind monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). EPIC maintains a constant view of the fully illuminated Earth as it rotates, providing scientific observations of ozone, vegetation, cloud height and aerosols in the atmosphere. The EPIC camera is providing a series of Earth images allowing study of daily variations over the entire globe. These images were taken between July 4 at 11:50 p.m. EDT and July 5 at 3:18 a.m. EDT (0350 UTC and 0718 UTC on July 5), showing the moon moving over the Indian and Pacific oceans. The North Pole is at the top of the images. DSCOVR is orbiting around the sun-Earth first Lagrange point (where the gravitational pull of Earth is equal and opposite of that of the sun) in a complex, non-recurring orbit that changes from an ellipse to a circle and back (called a Lissajous orbit) taking the spacecraft between 4 and 12 degrees from the sun-Earth line. This orbit intersects the lunar orbit about four times a year. However, depending on the relative orbital phases of the moon and DSCOVR, the moon appears between the spacecraft and Earth once or twice a year. The last time EPIC captured this event was between 3:50 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT on July 16, 2015. EPIC's \"natural color\" images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images. Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the moon. Because the moon has moved in relation to Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the moon in these unaltered images. DSCOVR is a partnership between NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Air Force with the primary objective of maintaining the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth-for-2nd-time-in-a-year"}, {"title": "The DSCOVR Satellite is Earth's Best Space Weather Fighting Robot", "date": "2016-07-27", "content": "Today was the first day on the job for a 1,200-pound satellite dubbed the Deep Space Climate Observatory 's - DSCOVR for short - that took over as the primary space tech that helps protect our planet from hostile space weather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's space weather forecasts shifted to being exclusively supported by DSCOVR data instead of using data primarily from the 19-year-old Advanced Composition Explorer. Why is this such a big deal? Space weather means a lot for the world's electrical grids, mostly. For the uninitiated, the term refers to the movement and behavior of solar winds ; coronal mass ejections from the sun; varying conditions in the magnetosphere and ionosphere; and other strange cosmic bits hurtling through the vacuum of space. It's basically how high- energy events interface with the electrical and magnetic parts of Earth's atmosphere. Imagine a really powerful solar storm flaring up. Mere minutes later, if no precautionary measures are taken, you have a scenario where entire swaths of the world could lose power - airplane communications and navigation systems could go dark and automated equipment that operates on a centimeter scale would suddenly malfunction. \"Space weather impacts all those kinds of things,\" says Douglas A. Biesecker, the chief program scientist for DSCOVR, based at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. \"These are systems you and I don't necessarily use on a day-to-day basis,\" he tells Inverse, but they are critical for keeping our world spinning. DSCOVR resides in the very distant Lissajous orbit. It's not the most well-known spacecraft orbiting the Earth, but it plays a critical role in helping scientists on Earth monitor space weather. As stated, the biggest concern about solar winds relates to power grids. Space weather could damage critical transformers that move power across large distances at very, very high voltages, and scale that power down to something suitable for our home. If an aberrant space weather event were to knock out those transformers, \"it could take years to replace them all,\" Biesecker says. \"We consider it critical to provide customers with the best quality forecasts in the mornings.\" DSCOVR can see an event from the sun - which produces energetic phenomena traveling at about one to four million miles per hour - and warns us humans to make preparations to protect essential tools, instruments, and infrastructure. The biggest advantage to DSCOVR over ACE is \"the continuity of observations,\" he says. \"The quality of ACE's data suffers frequently, explains Biesecker. NOAA issues space weather forecast alerts on a scale of 1 to 5. The \"noise generated by the ACE data will, by default, add 1 to the scale. An alert under ACE turns out to be nothing as observed by DSCOVR. Its really been remarkable to see how much of a difference that makes to our models,\" he says. \"The data is unprecedented.\" DSCOVR's role as the world's space weather meteorologist is all thanks to its Plasma-Magnetometer instrument. \"PlasMag provides us with data on the solar winds,\" says Biesecker. \"The magnetic field and its direction, and the solar winds' speed, density, and temperature.\" This is the information that helps inform NOAA what kind of warnings to send out to the public, as well as drive the models that illustrate how the planet is responding to these constant winds. In addition, Biesecker and other researchers are hoping to use DSCOVR for more ambitious forms of solar wind research. We're delving so fast into new \"atomic- scale physics\", like sampling shockwaves caused by coronal mass ejections \"in very high detail,\" he says. Besides that, however, DSCOVR has a couple other tricks up its sleeves. Two of its instruments, operated by NASA, have to do with observing Earth from such a far distance and providing a broader view of the planet and its activity. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera takes photos of the full hemisphere of the sunlit side of Earth. \"It's why Al Gore was so interested in the mission,\" says Biesecker. EPIC takes 12 \"blue marble\" images of the Earth every day. Blue Marble refers to an iconic photo taken during Apollo 17. It's not just an inspiring view of the little rock we call home, but scientists can use these images to track weather patterns without having to stitch individual images together. A dozen different filters allow researchers to observe trends and movement in dust particles or pollution across the globe. The last instrument is the National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer, which measures the energy being reflected by the sunlit side of the sun at any given moment. Scientists use this data to track how much radiation enters and exits the Earth's climate system - an increasingly important data point in the face of climate change.

But Earth-observing satellites witnessed something much different -- the moon's dark, ragged shadow sweeping across the planet's face. You can check out this bird's-eye view in a dazzling new solar eclipse video, which combines imagery from four different satellites: NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft; the NASA/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration DSCOVR satellite; and Suomi NPP, which is operated by NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Department of Defense.

In fact, the three spacecraft share an orbit, though they zoom over the same stretches of Earth at different times. A ring of fire solar eclipse occurs when the moon is relatively far from Earth in its elliptical orbit. If the moon had been at or near perigee -- its closest approach to Earth -- on Sunday, a total solar eclipse would have resulted.

The homeward-facing instrument on NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, launched in 2015, caught hundreds of these flashes over the span of a year. As keen observers from outside NASA wrote in, questioning the source of these lights, scientists deciphered the tiny cause to the big reflections: high-altitude, horizontally oriented ice crystals. NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard DSCOVR is taking almost-hourly images of the sunlit planet from its spot between Earth and the sun. Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed light flashes occasionally appearing over oceans as he looked through that day's EPIC images. Investigating the flashes, Marshak and his colleagues found that similar reflections from our pale blue dot caught the attention of astronomer Carl Sagan in 1993. Sagan was looking at images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, which launched in 1989 to study Jupiter and its moons. During one if its gravitational-assist swings around Earth, Galileo turned its instruments on this planet and collected data. Sagan and his colleagues used that to test a key question: Whether spacecraft could detect signatures of life from afar. \"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\" they wrote of the glints. Flashes of light reflected off oceans - like those referenced by Sagan - could have a simple explanation, Marshak said: Sunlight hits a smooth part of an ocean or lake, and reflects directly back to the sensor, like taking a flash-picture in a mirror. But when the scientists took another took a look at the Galileo images, they saw something Sagan and his colleagues apparently missed -- bright flashes of light over land as well. And those flashes appeared in the EPIC images as well. As the contact listed on the website that posts all EPIC images, Marshak started getting emails from people curious about what the flashes were. \"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\" he said. \"When I first saw it I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\" Instead, he and his colleagues Tamas Varnai of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Alexander Kostinski of Michigan Technological University, thought of water elsewhere in the Earth system: ice particles high in the atmosphere. The scientists conducted a series of experiments, detailed in a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, to confirm the cause of the distant flashes. First, the researchers cataloged all of the prospective sunlight glints over land in images from the EPIC camera. The flashes show up in three distinct colors because the camera takes the red, green and blue images several minutes apart. In all, the scientists found 866 bursts between DSCOVR's launch in June 2015 and August 2016. The scientists reasoned that if these 866 flashes were caused by reflected sunlight, they would be limited to certain spots on the globe - spots where the angle between the sun and Earth is the same as the angle between the spacecraft and Earth, allowing for the spacecraft to pick up the reflected light. When they plotted the locations of the glints with where those angles would match, given Earth's tilt and the spacecraft's location, the two matched. This helped confirm that it wasn't something like lightning causing the flashes, Marshak said: \"Lightning doesn't care about the sun and EPIC's location.\" The researchers also plotted angles to determine that the light was reflecting off of ice particles floating in the air nearly horizontally. Another feature of the EPIC data helped confirm that the flashes were from a high altitude, not simply water on the ground. Two channels on the instrument are designed to measure the height of clouds, and when the scientists went to the data they found high cirrus clouds, 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 kilometers) where the glints were located. \"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\" Marshak said. Detecting glints like this from much farther away than in this case could be used by other spacecraft to study exoplanets, he said. As an Earth scientist, however, Marshak is now investigating how common these horizontal ice particles are, and whether they're common enough to have a measurable impact on how much sunlight passes through the atmosphere. If so, it's a feature that could be incorporated into computer models of how much heat is reaching and leaving Earth. The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, with the primary objective to maintain the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasas-epic-view-spots-flashes-on-earth"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Moon's shadow on Earth from \"ring of fire\" eclipse seen from space", "date": "2017-03-03", "content": "Satellite photos provide a spectacular new perspective on this week's \"ring of fire\" solar eclipse.

These images were taken between 3:50 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT showing the moon moving over the Pacific Ocean near North America. The North Pole is in the upper left corner of the image. It is in the original orientation as taken by the spacecraft. The far side of the Moon was not seen until 1959 when the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft returned the first images. Since then, several NASA missions have imaged the lunar far side in great detail. The same side of the Moon always faces an earthbound observer because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. That means its orbital period is the same as its rotation around its axis. In May 2008 NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft captured a similar view of Earth and the Moon from a distance of 31 million miles away. The series of images showed the Moon passing in front of our home planet when it was only partially illuminated by the Sun. EPIC's \"natural color\" images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images. Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the Moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the Moon. Because the Moon has moved in relation to the Earth between the time the first and last exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the Moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the Moon in these unaltered images. The lunar far side lacks the large, dark, basaltic plains, or maria, that are so prominent on the Earth-facing side. The largest far side features are Mare Moscoviense in the upper left and Tsiolkovskiy crater in the lower left. A thin sliver of shadowed area of Moon is visible on its right side. \"It is surprising how much brighter Earth is than the Moon,\" said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Our planet is a truly brilliant object in dark space compared to the lunar surface.\" Once EPIC begins regular observations next month, NASA will post daily color images of Earth to a dedicated public website.

About twice a year the camera captures the Moon and Earth together as the orbit of DSCOVR crosses the orbital plane of the Moon. These images were taken between 3:50 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. EDT showing the moon moving over the Pacific Ocean near North America. The North Pole is in the upper left corner of the image. It is in the original orientation as taken by the spacecraft. The far side of the Moon was not seen until 1959 when the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft returned the first images. Since then, several NASA missions have imaged the lunar far side in great detail. The same side of the Moon always faces an earthbound observer because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. That means its orbital period is the same as its rotation around its axis. In May 2008 NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft captured a similar view of Earth and the Moon from a distance of 31 million miles away. The series of images showed the Moon passing in front of our home planet when it was only partially illuminated by the Sun. EPIC's \"natural color\" images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession.

A spectroradiometer, EPIC acquires images using 10 filters that detect light covering a wavelength region from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. NASA has made publicly available daily color images that the instrument has been capturing of the sunlit Earth since June of 2015, and now following suit are a collection of science products: sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions, total column ozone, ultraviolet (UV) aerosols, cloud and vegetation properties and atmospheric correction including surface reflectance. Those data are available from June 2015 to about two days before the current date. NASA's existing fleet of Earth-orbiting satellites provides observations of those and other quantities, enabling scientific research on how the planet is changing. The newly available EPIC products will complement those observations because of the instrument's ability to capture more images of the entire planet during daylight than any instrument on NASA's other satellites. In the summer, EPIC captures on average one image every hour and one image every two hours during winter. \"Given EPIC's special vantage point and frequent observations, we are able to observe the daytime portion of the daily cycle of many phenomena,\" said NASA's Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for the DSCOVR mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"For example, EPIC can follow a volcanic eruption or a fire plume during the entire day. These measurements complement those taken by other low Earth-orbiting satellites, which view a particular location less often, in many cases only once or twice per day.\" The UV aerosol product tracks phenomena such as plumes from wildfires as they travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles and impact everything from air quality to precipitation. Likewise, the sulfur dioxide product tracks volcanic emissions, which can affect air quality and air transportation around the globe, while the ozone product monitors concentrations of this UV-absorbing gas-important to both plant and animal life. The vegetation product provides information related to plant health and canopy coverage. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measures the concentration of chlorophyll in leaves, which is indicative of plant stress and vitality, as plants need chlorophyll to convert energy from the Sun into nutrients. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) projects the amount of leaves over a given area and is important for estimating canopy cover for forest and other studies. While other remote sensing instruments also provide data on NDVI and LAI, EPIC is the first to provide the Sunlit Leaf Area Index (SLAI). \"Both LAI and SLAI are key parameters in many global climate, hydrology and ecology models,\" Marshak said. The cloud dataset provides a number of details, including cloud height and thickness, which are important for climate studies and weather analysis and can complement data from other remote sensing spacecraft. Geostationary satellites, such as the GOES-16 spacecraft operated by NOAA, can also observe clouds throughout the day but cannot capture much of the areas near the North and South Poles. But EPIC's unique positioning in space allows the instrument to capture the Arctic Circle in the northern hemisphere summer and Antarctica during the northern hemisphere winter. The atmospheric correction dataset provides quantitative information about the amounts of aerosols in the atmospheric column, and it also removes the effects of atmospheric absorption and the scattering of sunlight, providing images of Earth's surface as if observed without the atmosphere. The EPIC instrument is one of a suite of instruments housed aboard the DSCOVR satellite. The primary objective of the DSCOVR mission, a partnership between NASA, NOAA and the U.S. Air Force, is to maintain the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.

The images in the animation above were acquired by the GOES-16 weather satellite on June 9. It orbits much closer than DSCOVR - in geostationary orbit, with an altitude of 22,236 miles above mean sea level. By that date, the smoke had already spent days traveling thousands of miles - all the way from Siberia, where large swaths of the taiga were ablaze. At the beginning of the month, 190 Siberian fires were burning across some 1,275 square miles - an area twice the size of the city of Houston. Some of the most ferocious ones were burning north of the town of Nyurba in the Sakha Republic of Russia. How do we know the smoke blew all the way in from there? Animation of images from the Suomi NPP satellite between July 3 and 9, 2018. This is a screenshot from an animation, created using NASA Worldview. I think the animation nails the case. Before clicking on it, look in the upper left corner for the smudgy pall of smoke centered on the Sakha Republic. I've marked how it will move as the animation progresses. After you click on the screenshot, make sure to hit the play button on the website that comes up. Now, let's zoom in progressively closer. First, a pair of images from Suomi NPP, which orbits at the relatively close altitude of 517 miles above Earth: Two views of the fires burning in Russia's Sakha Republic on July 3, 2018. These were acquired in different wavelengths by Suomi NPP's VIIRS instrument. One of the images shows the wildfires in natural color. The other views the scene in infrared, revealing the telltale orange signature of the flames, and recently burned areas in red. Lastly, even closer: Satellite image acquired over Siberia on July 4, 2018. The European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 spacecraft acquired this image of fires burning near the Lena River in Siberia on July 4. The spacecraft is in a sun-synchronous orbit at a mean altitude above Earth's surface of 488 miles. The landscape is seen in natural color with infrared added to reveal the actively burning areas. for more spectacular remote sensing imagery.) The fire seen in different wavelengths. This is the same scene but now in an image combining near infrared and shortwave infrared portions of the spectrum. This version emphasizes the signature of the flames. It also better emphasizes a large area of land to the right that had burned previously, seen in reddish tones. It's amazing to consider that smoke from these and other fires traveled something like 5,000 miles, possibly reaching New England and beyond. And that it was actually visible from a million miles away.

A spectroradiometer, EPIC acquires images using 10 filters that detect light covering a wavelength region from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. NASA has made publicly available daily color images that the instrument has been capturing of the sunlit Earth since June of 2015, and now following suit are a collection of science products: sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions, total column ozone, ultraviolet (UV) aerosols, cloud and vegetation properties and atmospheric correction including surface reflectance. Those data are available from June 2015 to about two days before the current date. NASA's existing fleet of Earth-orbiting satellites provides observations of those and other quantities, enabling scientific research on how the planet is changing. The newly available EPIC products will complement those observations because of the instrument's ability to capture more images of the entire planet during daylight than any instrument on NASA's other satellites. In the summer, EPIC captures on average one image every hour and one image every two hours during winter. \"Given EPIC's special vantage point and frequent observations, we are able to observe the daytime portion of the daily cycle of many phenomena,\" said NASA's Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for the DSCOVR mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"For example, EPIC can follow a volcanic eruption or a fire plume during the entire day. These measurements complement those taken by other low Earth-orbiting satellites, which view a particular location less often, in many cases only once or twice per day.\" The UV aerosol product tracks phenomena such as plumes from wildfires as they travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles and impact everything from air quality to precipitation. Likewise, the sulfur dioxide product tracks volcanic emissions, which can affect air quality and air transportation around the globe, while the ozone product monitors concentrations of this UV-absorbing gas-important to both plant and animal life. The vegetation product provides information related to plant health and canopy coverage. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measures the concentration of chlorophyll in leaves, which is indicative of plant stress and vitality, as plants need chlorophyll to convert energy from the Sun into nutrients. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) projects the amount of leaves over a given area and is important for estimating canopy cover for forest and other studies. While other remote sensing instruments also provide data on NDVI and LAI, EPIC is the first to provide the Sunlit Leaf Area Index (SLAI). \"Both LAI and SLAI are key parameters in many global climate, hydrology and ecology models,\" Marshak said. The cloud dataset provides a number of details, including cloud height and thickness, which are important for climate studies and weather analysis and can complement data from other remote sensing spacecraft. Geostationary satellites, such as the GOES-16 spacecraft operated by NOAA, can also observe clouds throughout the day but cannot capture much of the areas near the North and South Poles. But EPIC's unique positioning in space allows the instrument to capture the Arctic Circle in the northern hemisphere summer and Antarctica during the northern hemisphere winter. The atmospheric correction dataset provides quantitative information about the amounts of aerosols in the atmospheric column, and it also removes the effects of atmospheric absorption and the scattering of sunlight, providing images of Earth's surface as if observed without the atmosphere.

The spacecraft shifted into a \"safe hold\" status on June 27, which effectively halts its scientific measurements as it remains stationed in orbit nearly a million miles away from the Earth. \"NOAA is addressing a performance issue with the DSCOVR satellite,\" John Leslie, a spokesperson for NOAA, told Popular Science in a statement. \"Engineers have placed the satellite into a 'safehold' position, while they first diagnose and then work to fix a technical issue in the system that maintains the satellite's position.\" The safehold position safeguards instruments by drastically reducing the satellite's power usage, but it has the perturbing side effect of forcing DSCOVR to stop transmitting data back to Earth. The exact cause of the malfunction remains unclear, but it's disrupting the satellite's ability to properly position itself in orbit for data collection. While the EPIC camera has given us some very useful information related to trends and events in Earth's atmospheric composition (like the health of the ozone layer, cloud formation, and aberrant blooms in algae), DSCOVR's more important mission is monitoring space weather. When the sun burps up some nasty jolts of solar wind, Earth's power grids, telecommunications instruments, transportation systems, and other infrastructure are threatened. Such solar events can eject high-energy particles capable of short-circuiting our electrical equipment, potentially leaving millions or even billions of people without power. DSCOVR's ability to forecast space weather events is unprecedented, and its data gives power utilities a 45-minute warning before a solar storm hits the Earth. But we're far from prepared to deal with an event of a dangerous magnitude, and DSCOVR's absence certainly exacerbates the issue. Clearly, we're losing something very valuable in this time that DSCOVR remains in its safehold setting. Leslie explains, however, that while DSCOVR is offline, \"there will be no interruption to the ability of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to forecast and monitor space weather.\" While crews on the groundwork to rectify DSCOVR's woes, the SWPC will rely on data collected by NASA's ACE satellite, the SOHO satellite jointly operated by the European Space Agency and NASA, and NOAA's geostationary satellites. There's no question these instruments are not as sharp as DSCOVR when it comes to measuring solar wind activity, but they should help fill in the gap before DSCOVR comes back to us. Unfortunately, there's no timetable for that return as of yet. DSCOVR has previously gone through safeholds like this, often caused by cosmic rays that have affected onboard electronics. But those have only lasted hours. We're moving into our third week now, and when spacecraft are off for this long, it's often a sign that engineers are dealing with something more grave. For now, all we can do is wait and see.", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/dscovr-nasa-offline/#:~:text=The%20Deep%20Space%20Climate%20Observatory%E2%80%94DSCOVR%20for%20short%E2%80%94is%20an,powerful%20tool%20we%20have%20for%20monitoring%20space%20weather."}, {"title": "Software fix planned to restore DSCOVR", "date": "2019-09-30", "content": "A space weather and Earth observation satellite that has been offline for more than three months could be restored to normal operations with new software, but that fix is not expected to be completed until early next year.

The spacecraft, which is at the Earth-sun L-1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the direction of the sun, went into \"safe hold\" June 27, disrupting normal operations.

Although DSCOVR has its origins in a NASA mission called Triana two decades ago to provide full-disk Earth imagery, its primary mission is to collect space weather data. While the spacecraft was offline, NOAA instead used NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft to provide those observations. ACE, however, is an aging spacecraft, raising concerns that had it failed, NOAA would have been without key data needed to forecast solar storms. NOAA also uses the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to observe the solar corona. SOHO, launched in 1995, is far beyond its design life. \"Should we lose some of those key spacecraft that we talked about, I won't say we're blind, but we're darn close,\" said William Murtagh, program coordinator for NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, during a Feb. 12 Senate Commerce Committee hearing that discussed those missions. \"It will impact our ability to support this nation's need for space weather services.\" Ultimately, DSCOVR, along with ACE and SOHO, will be replaced by the Space Weather Follow-On L-1 mission that NOAA is developing. NOAA, in its fiscal year 2021 budget proposal released in late February, requested $108.1 million for the mission, up from the $64 million it received in 2020. The funding increase would keep the mission on schedule for a 2024 launch, sharing a launch with NASA's IMAP space science mission.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/dscovr-back-in-operation/"}, {"title": "DSCOVR resumes operations after eight-month outage", "date": "2020-03-05", "content": "The Deep Space Climate Observatory has resumed regular observations after NOAA and NASA engineers uplinked a software patch to the spacecraft a million miles from Earth, restoring data on space weather and a daily series views of the sunlit side of our home planet. The NOAA-led mission launched from Cape Canaveral in February 2015 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with instrument contributions from NASA and a rocket funded by U.S. Air Force. DSCOVR was designed for a two-year mission, but carried enough fuel for at least five years of operations. NOAA officials hope the mission can continue for several more years because DSCOVR gathers critical data to forecast geomagnetic storms that could disrupt communications, air travel, electrical grids, satellite operations and human spaceflight. The DSCOVR spacecraft is located around the L1 Lagrange point, a gravitationally-stable location around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth in the direction of the sun. According to NOAA, the DSCOVR spacecraft - about the size of a small car - entered a \"safe hold\" mode June 27, 2019, due to issues with its attitude control system. The problem halted the flow of all science data from DSCOVR, which carries sensors to measure the solar wind, take images of Earth, and monitor how much of the sun's energy is absorbed and reflected from Earth. NOAA and NASA engineers developed a flight software patch to restore DSCOVR to regular service, and NOAA said Monday that the spacecraft is again fully operational. \"Bringing DSCOVR operational again shows the unique skills and adaptability of our NOAA and NASA engineers and the care we are taking to get the maximum life from an aging asset,\" said Steve Volz, assistant NOAA administrator for its satellite and information service. NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer backs up DSCOVR in orbit around the L1 libration point. ACE provided data for NOAA to continue space weather forecasts during DSCOVR's outage, but ACE launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design lifetime. While DSCOVR and ACE constantly monitor the stream of particles flowing from the sun, the joint ESA-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory - which is also beyond its design lifetime - images the solar corona to collect additional data for incorporation into space weather forecasts. NOAA is developing the Space Weather Follow-On L1 mission for launch in 2024 to provide a long-term replacement for ACE and DSCOVR. The DSCOVR mission was launched as a stopgap measure to reduce the risk of a loss of space weather data in the case of a failure on the ACE satellite. A compact coronagraph will fly on the GOES-U weather satellite, also scheduled for launch in 2024, to ensure the continuity of solar corona imagery provided by SOHO. The resumption of DSCOVR operations also allowed imagery from the spacecraft's NASA-provided Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera, or EPIC, instrument to begin streaming back to the ground. Like the DSCOVR spacecraft, the camera is a holdover from the Triana mission. Former Vice President Al Gore proposed a space mission in 1998 that would beam back live views of the Earth from deep space, providing images similar to the famous \"blue marble\" photos taken by the Apollo astronauts. The EPIC instrument has uninterrupted views of the sunlit hemisphere of Earth as the planet rotates through day-night cycles. The camera takes imagery in 10 spectral channels from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared part of the spectrum. NASA canceled the Triana mission in 2005, but NOAA paid to take the spacecraft out of storage in 2008 to assess its usefulness for the space weather mission.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/03/05/dscovr-resumes-operations-after-eight-month-outage/"}, {"title": "Spacewatch: deep space climate monitor back in business", "date": "2020-03-05", "content": "The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) is operational again after being dark for about nine months.

Engineers at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration created a flight software patch and uploaded it recently to the satellite, NOAA officials said Monday. This allowed DISCOVR to resume its observations of space weather, or the area in Earth's vicinity affected by the sun's variability. Media reports in October hinted such a fix was coming early in 2020, but did not give any information on why it took several months to implement the correction. Since the sun regularly sends charged particles towards our planet, monitoring its activity is crucial to protecting satellites and other infrastructure vulnerable to the periodic \"solar storms\" the sun emits, when during times of high activity it sends coronal mass ejections of particles towards Earth. While a backup satellite (NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer) was used to keep space weather updates flowing, and there are many other satellites monitoring the sun, a senior official at NOAA said he was pleased that DSCOVR is contributing once again to the fleet. \"Bringing DSCOVR operational again shows the unique skills and adaptability of our ... engineers, and the care we are taking to get the maximum life from an aging asset,\" Steve Volz, assistant NOAA administrator for its satellite and information service, said in the statement.

While the spacecraft was offline, NOAA instead used NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft to provide those observations. ACE, however, is an aging spacecraft, raising concerns that had it failed, NOAA would have been without key data needed to forecast solar storms. NOAA also uses the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to observe the solar corona. SOHO, launched in 1995, is far beyond its design life. \"Should we lose some of those key spacecraft that we talked about, I won't say we're blind, but we're darn close,\" said William Murtagh, program coordinator for NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, during a Feb. 12 Senate Commerce Committee hearing that discussed those missions. \"It will impact our ability to support this nation's need for space weather services.\" Ultimately, DSCOVR, along with ACE and SOHO, will be replaced by the Space Weather Follow-On L-1 mission that NOAA is developing. NOAA, in its fiscal year 2021 budget proposal released in late February, requested $108.1 million for the mission, up from the $64 million it received in 2020. The funding increase would keep the mission on schedule for a 2024 launch, sharing a launch with NASA's IMAP space science mission.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/dscovr-back-in-operation/"}, {"title": "DSCOVR resumes operations after eight-month outage", "date": "2020-03-05", "content": "The Deep Space Climate Observatory has resumed regular observations after NOAA and NASA engineers uplinked a software patch to the spacecraft a million miles from Earth, restoring data on space weather and a daily series views of the sunlit side of our home planet. The NOAA-led mission launched from Cape Canaveral in February 2015 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with instrument contributions from NASA and a rocket funded by U.S. Air Force. DSCOVR was designed for a two-year mission, but carried enough fuel for at least five years of operations. NOAA officials hope the mission can continue for several more years because DSCOVR gathers critical data to forecast geomagnetic storms that could disrupt communications, air travel, electrical grids, satellite operations and human spaceflight. The DSCOVR spacecraft is located around the L1 Lagrange point, a gravitationally-stable location around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth in the direction of the sun. According to NOAA, the DSCOVR spacecraft - about the size of a small car - entered a \"safe hold\" mode June 27, 2019, due to issues with its attitude control system. The problem halted the flow of all science data from DSCOVR, which carries sensors to measure the solar wind, take images of Earth, and monitor how much of the sun's energy is absorbed and reflected from Earth. NOAA and NASA engineers developed a flight software patch to restore DSCOVR to regular service, and NOAA said Monday that the spacecraft is again fully operational. \"Bringing DSCOVR operational again shows the unique skills and adaptability of our NOAA and NASA engineers and the care we are taking to get the maximum life from an aging asset,\" said Steve Volz, assistant NOAA administrator for its satellite and information service. NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer backs up DSCOVR in orbit around the L1 libration point. ACE provided data for NOAA to continue space weather forecasts during DSCOVR's outage, but ACE launched in 1997 and is operating well beyond its design lifetime. While DSCOVR and ACE constantly monitor the stream of particles flowing from the sun, the joint ESA-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory - which is also beyond its design lifetime - images the solar corona to collect additional data for incorporation into space weather forecasts. NOAA is developing the Space Weather Follow-On L1 mission for launch in 2024 to provide a long-term replacement for ACE and DSCOVR. The DSCOVR mission was launched as a stopgap measure to reduce the risk of a loss of space weather data in the case of a failure on the ACE satellite. A compact coronagraph will fly on the GOES-U weather satellite, also scheduled for launch in 2024, to ensure the continuity of solar corona imagery provided by SOHO. The resumption of DSCOVR operations also allowed imagery from the spacecraft's NASA-provided Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera, or EPIC, instrument to begin streaming back to the ground. Like the DSCOVR spacecraft, the camera is a holdover from the Triana mission. Former Vice President Al Gore proposed a space mission in 1998 that would beam back live views of the Earth from deep space, providing images similar to the famous \"blue marble\" photos taken by the Apollo astronauts. The EPIC instrument has uninterrupted views of the sunlit hemisphere of Earth as the planet rotates through day-night cycles. The camera takes imagery in 10 spectral channels from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared part of the spectrum. NASA canceled the Triana mission in 2005, but NOAA paid to take the spacecraft out of storage in 2008 to assess its usefulness for the space weather mission.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/03/05/dscovr-resumes-operations-after-eight-month-outage/"}, {"title": "Spacewatch: deep space climate monitor back in business", "date": "2020-03-05", "content": "The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) is operational again after being dark for about nine months. The satellite developed issues with its attitude control system last summer. This prompted operators at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to place it in a safe mode that protected the spacecraft from damage but also stopped it from returning data. Analysing the fault, operators have designed new software to allow DSCOVR to work despite the ongoing malfunction. This has been uploaded and the satellite has started to return science data once more. The mission is now fully operational. Launched on 11 February 2015, DSCOVR operates about 1.5m km away from Earth, sitting between the Sun and our planet. It takes images of the whole Earth which are used to monitor clouds and vegetation, atmospheric ozone and aerosols. It also monitors the particles discharged from the Sun that create space weather. Magnetic storms in this space weather can have an adverse effect on electricity networks, communications and navigation systems on Earth. DSCOVR is the US's principal warning system for such events and in its absence the ageing Nasa spacecraft Ace (Advanced Composition Explorer) fulfilled this role.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/05/spacewatch-deep-space-climate-monitor-back-in-business"}, {"title": "The DSCOVR Earth and space weather satellite is back online after a months-long glitch", "date": "2020-03-07", "content": "A disabled satellite that tracks space weather is back online after nine months of efforts to get it communicating with Earth, according to a U.S. government update. The nearly five-year-old Deep Space Climate Observatory went into a safe mode lockdown on June 27, 2019, due to issues with the attitude control system that keeps it properly oriented in space to receive commands and send data. Engineers at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration created a flight software patch and uploaded it recently to the satellite, NOAA officials said Monday. This allowed DISCOVR to resume its observations of space weather, or the area in Earth's vicinity affected by the sun's variability. Media reports in October hinted such a fix was coming early in 2020, but did not give any information on why it took several months to implement the correction. Since the sun regularly sends charged particles towards our planet, monitoring its activity is crucial to protecting satellites and other infrastructure vulnerable to the periodic \"solar storms\" the sun emits, when during times of high activity it sends coronal mass ejections of particles towards Earth. While a backup satellite (NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer) was used to keep space weather updates flowing, and there are many other satellites monitoring the sun, a senior official at NOAA said he was pleased that DSCOVR is contributing once again to the fleet. \"Bringing DSCOVR operational again shows the unique skills and adaptability of our ... engineers, and the care we are taking to get the maximum life from an aging asset,\" Steve Volz, assistant NOAA administrator for its satellite and information service, said in the statement. DSCOVR orbits at a Lagrange point - a relatively stable \"parking spot\" in space between the Earth and the sun, allowing the spacecraft to obtain spectacular full-disc views of our planet.

The rocket in question carried NASA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) to the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, where the still-operating observatory provides advance warning on solar wind activities. The leftover rocket stage, meanwhile, became a floating piece of space junk orbiting the Sun. Its ultimate fate was unknown, until last month, when astronomer Bill Gray predicted that it was bound for an impact with the Moon sometime on March 4th, 2022. This week, Gray, who has been tracking the object ever since, released an update on the situation. He confirmed that there is indeed a rocket stage on course to crash into the far side of the Moon, but it's not a SpaceX rocket at all. Instead, it's a Chinese booster: the upper stage of the rocket that carried China's Chang'e 5-T1 mission to the Moon in 2014. Gray, who manages the near-Earth object tracking software Pluto Project, explained that the erroneous identification of the object as DSCOVR's upper stage back in 2015 was based on shaky evidence. \"Essentially,\" he wrote, \"I had pretty good circumstantial evidence for the identification, but nothing conclusive. That was not at all unusual. Identifications of high-flying space junk often require a bit of detective work, and sometimes, we never do figure out the ID for a bit of space junk; there are a couple of unidentified bits of junk out there. (At least, not identified yet.)\" But the detective work he'd carried out was suggestive enough that he considered it a positive ID for the SpaceX rocket, and no one questioned it. That is, until February 12, 2022, when Gray received an email from Jon Giorgini at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Giorgini pointed out that DSCOVR's initial trajectory did not pass particularly close to the Moon, and so it was strange that the upper stage Gray was tracking seemed to have gone right past it only two days after launch. The email prompted Gray to dig into his data and look for an alternative explanation for the object. If it wasn't the DSCOVR rocket after all, what was it? The only other object that fit the bill was the upper stage from China's Chang'e 5-T1 mission (which was a test flight and precursor to China's successful 2020 lunar sample return mission, Chang'e 5), which did pass close by the Moon, five days after its own launch. A little digging by fellow object-tracking expert Jonathan McDowell provided trajectory data on one of Chang'e 5-T1's CubeSats, which had taken a \"ride-share\" on the booster, and which aligned neatly with the route taken by the object. So it seems conclusive that the object about to hit the Moon is indeed the Chang'e 5-T1 booster, though Gray admits that once again, the evidence is circumstantial evidence. But it's a pretty good match, and offers a better explanation for the object than the SpaceX booster ever did. With the mystery resolved, the misidentified object has been rechristened, and is set for a spectacular finale when it impacts the lunar regolith early next month. The whole affair is somewhat trivial in the grand scheme of things, but it does raise some interesting questions about how space junk beyond low Earth orbit is tracked, and whether better tools are needed to do so. In low Earth orbit, space junk is monitored carefully, as the region is much more crowded, and precise tracking is required to avoid collisions. This is especially important in and around the International Space Station, where space junk could pose a threat to astronauts. But in deep space, there is very little official tracking of objects - most of the attention here is focused on asteroid-hunting to ensure that we are aware of any possible threats to Earth. Human-made objects in deep space are not systematically tracked. Gray himself only does so part-time. As humans venture back to the Moon in the coming decade, Gray suggests that it might be prudent to implement a more rigorous tracking system, and outlined a few steps to take to get started. First, he suggests that launch providers ought to make the last known trajectories of their boosters publicly available. Second, they should put some consideration into reducing space junk, deorbiting used boosters where possible. And finally, Gray suggests that in the long run, an international (and well-funded) organization will probably be required to effectively carry out precise object tracking.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/154520/the-object-about-to-hit-the-moon-isnt-a-spacex-booster-after-all/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Satellite Captures Epic GIF of Moon Transiting the Earth", "date": "2022-02-03", "content": "Though it may look like a CGI animation, this gif of the Moon transiting Earth is very real.

(At least, not identified yet.)\" But the detective work he'd carried out was suggestive enough that he considered it a positive ID for the SpaceX rocket, and no one questioned it. That is, until February 12, 2022, when Gray received an email from Jon Giorgini at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Giorgini pointed out that DSCOVR's initial trajectory did not pass particularly close to the Moon, and so it was strange that the upper stage Gray was tracking seemed to have gone right past it only two days after launch. The email prompted Gray to dig into his data and look for an alternative explanation for the object. If it wasn't the DSCOVR rocket after all, what was it? The only other object that fit the bill was the upper stage from China's Chang'e 5-T1 mission (which was a test flight and precursor to China's successful 2020 lunar sample return mission, Chang'e 5), which did pass close by the Moon, five days after its own launch. A little digging by fellow object-tracking expert Jonathan McDowell provided trajectory data on one of Chang'e 5-T1's CubeSats, which had taken a \"ride-share\" on the booster, and which aligned neatly with the route taken by the object. So it seems conclusive that the object about to hit the Moon is indeed the Chang'e 5-T1 booster, though Gray admits that once again, the evidence is circumstantial evidence. But it's a pretty good match, and offers a better explanation for the object than the SpaceX booster ever did. With the mystery resolved, the misidentified object has been rechristened, and is set for a spectacular finale when it impacts the lunar regolith early next month. The whole affair is somewhat trivial in the grand scheme of things, but it does raise some interesting questions about how space junk beyond low Earth orbit is tracked, and whether better tools are needed to do so. In low Earth orbit, space junk is monitored carefully, as the region is much more crowded, and precise tracking is required to avoid collisions. This is especially important in and around the International Space Station, where space junk could pose a threat to astronauts. But in deep space, there is very little official tracking of objects - most of the attention here is focused on asteroid-hunting to ensure that we are aware of any possible threats to Earth. Human-made objects in deep space are not systematically tracked. Gray himself only does so part-time. As humans venture back to the Moon in the coming decade, Gray suggests that it might be prudent to implement a more rigorous tracking system, and outlined a few steps to take to get started. First, he suggests that launch providers ought to make the last known trajectories of their boosters publicly available. Second, they should put some consideration into reducing space junk, deorbiting used boosters where possible. And finally, Gray suggests that in the long run, an international (and well-funded) organization will probably be required to effectively carry out precise object tracking.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/154520/the-object-about-to-hit-the-moon-isnt-a-spacex-booster-after-all/"}]}]
