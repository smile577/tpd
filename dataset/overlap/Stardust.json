While dim, the lunar image convinced NASA scientists that Stardust's vision has improved enough to complete its main mission objective. The robot ship's navigation camera had been contaminated with an unknown substance months ago. To correct the problem, mission engineers commanded the refrigerator-sized probe to heat up its optical parts. Mission scientists announced a week ago that the probe's troubled vision had been corrected The warming managed to remove much of the mysterious goo, as illustrated in the clarity of the moon picture, the project manager said Friday. \"Whatever the contamination was originally, we have removed about 60 percent of it,\" said Tom Druxbury, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"We have a little bit more improvement to make (but) Stardust can easily meet all of its objectives.\" As before, Stardust engineers will instruct the spacecraft to heat its optical parts to remove more of the goo. \"It's awfully good, but we know it can be better,\" Druxbury said. An unknown substance likely contaminated Stardust shortly after it launched in 1999. However, due to software glitches and other problems, NASA engineers were not able to view Stardust images and detect the problem until about six months later. The $200 million Discovery mission is the first designed to collect and return material from beyond the moon. Stardust is expected to rendezvous with Comet Wild-2 in 2004. It will collect samples of the ice chunk as well as interstellar dust, then return them to Earth in 2006. The NASA spacecraft flew to within 6,012 km (3,721 miles) of Earth on Monday, using the planet's gravity to gain a boost on its journey.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/01/19/stardust.moon/"}, {"title": "Stardust Status Report 8 June 2001", "date": "2001-06-08", "content": "There were three Deep Space Network (DSN) tracking passes this past week and all subsystems are performing normally.

Annefrank is about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across.

This flyby was used as an engineering test of the ground and spacecraft operations that will be implemented at the primary scientific target, Comet Wild 2 (pronounced \"Vilt\" 2) just over one year from now. Stardust is a low-cost Discovery Mission that continues to perform as expected after more than three and a half years into a planned seven-year mission to rendezvous with Comet Wild 2 in January 2004. Stardust will collect cometary dust samples, flowing from the nucleus just hours before spacecraft flyby, and return the samples to Earth in a Sample Return Capsule in January 2006. The close flyby of Annefrank offered a unique opportunity to thoroughly test all planned operations on the spacecraft and ground support operations which will be used during the rendezvous with Comet Wild 2. \"We performed a full dress rehearsal with the cometary dust collector deployed as we flew Stardust within 3,300 kilometers of Annefrank,\" said Professor Donald Brownlee, the project's Principal Investigator from the University of Washington. \"The spacecraft was poised in its flyby attitude with all the science instruments on. The flyby has exceeded all of our expectations and provided us with unexpected data about the asteroid,\" said Brownlee. The approach geometry to Annefrank was much more difficult than will be the case for Comet Wild 2. The spacecraft was pointed over 60 degrees off of the normal Sun and Earth pointing attitude and was running on its battery in order to attempt to detect and capture images of Annefrank. \"The spacecraft performed every command perfectly and did everything asked of it,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Spacecraft Engineer at Lockheed Martin Space Systems near Denver. \"We are thrilled with how well the entire operation went. We couldn't have asked for better performance from Stardust and the images it captured of the asteroid exceeded everyone's expectations. The spacecraft's pointing, attitude and flight operations were excellent. This really adds to our level of confidence about how well the spacecraft will perform when we reach Wild 2,\" added Cheuvront. Cheuvront and a team of engineers at Lockheed Martin's spacecraft control center, known as the Mission Support Area, control the spacecraft in conjunction with JPL and the Deep Space Network. The Navigation Camera was straining to see Annefrank during approach. \"This camera was operating at its limit of performance and seeing very dim stars down to about 11th visual magnitude\", said Ray Newburn, the Lead Scientist for the camera at JPL. However, the brightness predicted by Drs. Stephen Synnott and Donald Yeomans of JPL was dimmer than 11th visual magnitude. \"We tried everything we could think of including taking multiple long exposures and adding these on the ground\", said Dr. T. S. Mike Wang, Optical Navigation Specialist at JPL, \"but Annefrank was not cooperating. It was just too dim.\" Because of the high probability of not seeing Annefrank during the approach, the flyby was designed to be successful without having to see it up to 20 minutes from encounter. \"A flyby distance of 3,000 km (1,864 miles) was chosen so that there was no risk of the spacecraft flying near any possible dust environment or small satellites of Annefrank\", said Ed Hirst, JPL Mission Design Manager. \"We also wanted to ensure that Annefrank would be in the camera view at the start of the encounter sequence,\" added Hirst. Since Annefrank was not seen in the approach images, the flight team felt that the asteroid was at least as dim as predicted and possibly even dimmer. The team decided to send up a new encounter configuration file and set the initial flyby exposures longer. \"We had a planned uplink six hours before encounter for this very purpose,\" said Robert Ryan, Mission Manager at JPL. \"We had some communications problems the day before that gave us some difficulty, but NASA's Deep Space Network gave us highest priority, and excellent communications on Friday, allowing us to play back earlier images we missed as well as sending our final encounter commands,\" added Ryan. At 8:00 pm (PST) Friday evening, communications were established with the spacecraft to watch its pre-loaded sequence command turn the spacecraft away from the Sun and Earth into its flyby attitude. \"We have built up over three years of flight experience and a tremendous amount of confidence and respect for our spacecraft to perform such operations routinely,\" said Joe Vellinga, Stardust Program Manager at Lockheed Martin, who led the development and manufacture of the spacecraft. \"The spacecraft did not miss a beat during its flyby and it maintained all critical thermal, power, attitude, memory and reserves at or above design levels,\" added Vellinga. The main function to be tested during flyby was a sophisticated flight computer program that would take over control of the spacecraft to keep the camera view locked on Annefrank during a 25-minute period around its closest encounter. \"This software was a derivative of the nucleus tracking software successfully flown on the Deep Space 1 flyby of Borrelly,\" said Dr. Shyam Bhaskaran, developer of the algorithms at JPL. \"Based upon my previous experience on Deep Space 1, it performed up to my expectations with this encounter at Annefrank with over 60 successful images having Annefrank right in the middle of each image,\" added Bhaskaran. David Gingerich, Flight Software specialist at Lockheed Martin who implemented and tested the nucleus tracking software, said, \"Its performance was executed just like the coach drew it on the blackboard.\" Over 70 encounter images were obtained that show a typical small solar system body, highly irregularly shaped and cratered. Annefrank is about twice as large as predicted, at least 6 kilometers in diameter, but darker than expected and therefore more difficult to detect in the early images. Not only did the camera perform well but the University of Chicago Dust Flux Measurement Instrument and the German Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer performed as expected. Professor Tom Economou, Dust Flux Measurement Instrument scientist from University of Chicago, stated \"we ran for 28 minutes as we will at Wild 2 with (the measurement instrument) performing all expected functions\". Dr. Jochen Kissel, Lead Scientist for the Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer from Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany, said \"I will be able to put (the analyzer) into an even better configuration at Wild 2 based upon the Annefrank experience.\" Both dust instrument teams are combing through their data to see if by chance they may have seen a dust particle. \"Performing such flight testing before the primary encounter is a critical part of reducing risks and significantly increasing the probability of success when we reach Wild 2\", said JPL Project Manager, Thomas Duxbury. \"We have performed exhaustive testing and training with LMA at their spacecraft test laboratory and through flight simulations, but these cannot totally replace actual flight operations testing. We learned a lot that will improve our operations at Wild 2 based upon the lessons learned at Annefrank. The bottom line is that if Annefrank had been Wild 2, we would have succeeded in every respect,\" added Duxbury. \"I applaud the entire flight team,\" said Don Brownlee. \"We could not have asked for more, except possibly for Annefrank to be a little brighter. However, for everything that we could control with the spacecraft, we were nearly perfect. Even though this was an engineering test, the flyby with Annefrank provided new information previously unknown about the asteroid about its size, shape, spin state and brightness as a function of viewing angle. \"It was an exciting Friday evening for those of us involved in this mission,\" Brownlee said. \"We captured images of a primitive asteroid with a highly significant name and one whose size turned out to be similar to the asteroid that likely killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. We have now validated Stardust's systems and operations and we are eagerly awaiting our encounter with Comet Wild 2, just over one year from now\".", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/news/stardustf-20021104.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Stardust Mission Flies by Asteroid \"Annefrank\"", "date": "2002-11-02", "content": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft successfully completed a close flyby of asteroid Annefrank early today as an opportunity for a full dress rehearsal of procedures the spacecraft will use during its Jan. 2, 2004, encounter with it primary science target, comet Wild 2.

The US-built capsule plunged through the atmosphere and touched down in the Utah desert at 0312. Scientists believe the first cometary dust samples ever returned to Earth will shed light on the origins of the Solar System. \"We travelled about three billion miles in space, we visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it and it landed here on Earth this morning,\" Dr Don Brownlee, Stardust principal investigator, told reporters at a news briefing in Utah. \"I fully expect textbooks in the future will have a lot of new information from the samples that landed here this morning.\" Fiery descent: The Stardust spacecraft released the 45kg capsule at 0557 GMT as it looped past the Earth on its return from interplanetary space. Mission controllers at the US space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, clapped and cheered as the capsule began its plunge to Earth. Four hours after leaving the probe, the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere 125km over the Pacific Ocean. It reached speeds of 46,660km/h - the fastest re-entry of any manmade probe - and was visible from parts of the American northwest as a streak of light in the sky. At about 32km altitude, the capsule released a small parachute to slow its descent. The main parachute opened at about 3km, and brought the capsule down to land on a military base southwest of Salt Lake City. \"All stations, we have touchdown,\" an announcer declared to a jubilant control room. First analysis: The capsule was located by helicopter almost an hour after the landing. It was then flown to a nearby laboratory for checks. On Tuesday, it will be transported to a special lab at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where scientists will get their first chance to examine the precious contents. \"I'm very confident we will have samples in there that are the first returned from beyond the Moon,\" former Stardust project manager, Ken Atkins, told the BBC News website. \"It is magnificent to see something that we saw leave the planet on 7 February 1999 return to the planet here on 15 January 2006.\" The highlight of Stardust's seven-year mission was its close encounter with Comet Wild 2 in January 2004. It swept up particles from the frozen body of ice and dust, flying to within 240km of the comet's core, or nucleus. As part of its trip, the probe also captured a sprinkling of dust that originated in distant stars. The Stardust mothership has now completed its main mission and has been sent into orbit around the Sun. 'Minute specks': Meanwhile the work of scientists is just beginning. On Tuesday, Nasa experts will open the canister containing the samples which is packed away inside a protective shell. The capsule is believed to contain about a million particles of comet and interstellar dust left over from the birth of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. They are trapped inside cells filled with an ultra-light solid called aerogel. About 150 scientists around the world will get a chance to carry out a preliminary analysis of the contents, including researchers at the UK's Open University. Professor Monica Grady, of the OU's Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, said it would be the most scientifically exciting and technically challenging material with which they had ever had the opportunity to work. \"Imagine trying to pick up a grain that is less than a hundredth of the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence,\" she said. \"It is amazing to think that such minute specks of dust can carry within them so much information about the origin of stars and planets.\" Time capsules: Comets are thought to be cosmic \"time capsules\", containing material unchanged since the formation of the Sun and planets. Some even think they may have seeded Earth with the chemical building blocks required for life. \"Stardust could provide a new window into the distant past,\" said Dr Simon Green of the PSSRI. \"Because these particles have come from inside a comet, we know that essentially the particles haven't been heated since they became part of the comet, because the comet is made of ice,\" he told the BBC News website. \"That means that they contain information about the conditions that were present when they were incorporated into the comet. \"That time was four-and-a-half thousand-million years ago, back when the Solar System formed; so what we hope to know from these particles is essentially what the Solar System looked like at that time, and essentially what we're all made of.\" ", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4614222.stm"}, {"title": "Mission Completed: Stardust Capsule Lands in Utah", "date": "2006-01-15", "content": "NASA's Stardust sample return capsule has returned to Earth today, completing a 2.88 billion mile journey that took almost seven years. The capsule successfuly floated to the ground in the Utah Test and Training Range under billowing parachute where a helicopter team successfully located it despite dark desert conditions. The capsule is reportedly intact from the helicopter observations. The capsule's unofficial touch down time was 5:10 a.m. EST. Onboard the small container, a treasure trove of interstellar and comet particles--the collective wisdom of the spacecraft's nearly seven year voyage through space. Tucked within the spacecraft's sample container are pieces of Comet Wild2 and interstellar dust--trapped in a material dubbed aerogel--for scientists to analyze. These are first samples of material from our solar system returned to Earth from beyond the moon. There was palpable heavy-breathing here at the Lockheed Martin Mission Support Area, waiting for a drogue parachute to be released from the falling capsule, thus stabilizing the craft for deployment of its main parachute. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, developed and operated the Stardust spacecraft. In September 2004, the Genesis spacecraft--also built by Lockheed Martin for NASA--smashed into Utah due to improper placement of recovery system components. \"Everything worked so well. What an exciting moment,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust spacecraft engineer here at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. After descending into the Utah Test & Training Range, the capsule activated its locator beacon.

The velocity of the sample return capsule, as it enters Earth's atmosphere at 46,440 kilometers per hour (28,860 miles per hour), will be the fastest reentry of any human-made object on record. It surpasses the record set in May 1969 during the return of the Apollo 10 command module. The capsule is scheduled to return on Jan. 15, 2006. \"Comets are some of the most informative occupants of the solar system.

Next month, the spacecraft is to eject to Earth a capsule filled with particles of interstellar and comet dust. The spacecraft has soared through space for some seven years, chalking up billions of travel miles. During the probe's collection route, Stardust caught particles cast off comet Wild 2 in 2004. Those particles are now safely tucked inside Stardust's sample return capsule, headed for an early morning January 15 landing within U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground southwest of Salt Lake City. The $212 million Stardust mission was launched on February 7, 1999 by a Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, part of NASA's Discovery Program of econo-class, highly focused science investigations. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver and is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. \"We are approaching the end of a quite fantastic voyage,\" said Don Brownlee, Principal Investigator for Stardust at the University of Washington, Seattle. The ancient comet and interstellar dust particles now on Stardust are to be studied for decades into the future, Brownlee said. They will undergo a battery of tests with an array of analytical tools, he told reporters today during a NASA press briefing on the mission from the space agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Stardust has traveled half way to Jupiter to encounter a comet, grab a piece of it, and bring it back to the Earth,\" Brownlee said. Stardust is akin to a library in transit to Earth that has scarfed up the building blocks of the solar system that have been preserved at low temperatures for 4.5 billion years \"and they are landing in the desert in just a couple of weeks,\" he added. \"It's a distance record for an Earth returning spacecraft ... and it's a first that we can all be proud of,\" noted Andy Dantzler, Director of the Solar System Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Measuring less than 3-feet across, Stardust's heat-thwarting reentry capsule will barrel through the atmosphere faster than any human-made spacecraft has ever come in before, said Tom Duxbury, Project Manager for Stardust at JPL. Skyrocketing across the Western U.S. and shooting over Nevada toward its Utah landing, the canister will light up the night sky for a brief period. The fireball should be visible from San Francisco perhaps up to and beyond Portland, Duxbury said. Entry velocity of the 101-pound (46-kilogram) capsule when it penetrates the atmosphere is about 28,000 miles per hour (12.8 kilometers per second), Ed Hirst, Mission System Manager at JPL, told SPACE.com. The capsule then deploys a drogue chute, followed by main parachute deployment. The capsule should touch down January 15 at 3:12 a.m. Mountain Standard Time. Following touchdown, the capsule will be recovered by air and ground teams. It will then be transported to a staging area at UTTR for retrieval of the sample canister held deep inside the return capsule. Once removed, the specimen-carrying canister is transported to the planetary materials curatorial facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas for examination. Stardust is the first NASA mission to return \"solid\" samples from space since Apollo 17 returned to Earth in 1972. Apollo 17 moonwalkers brought back some 244 pounds (111 kilograms) of rock and soil samples. Specimens onboard Stardust will be ultra-tiny in contrast, but are the first bits of material returned from beyond the Earth-Moon orbit. The Stardust craft snared particles blown off comet Wild 2 in 2004. To accomplish the collection task, the spacecraft made use of aerogel, a silica-based solid with a porous, sponge-like structure in which 99 percent of the volume is empty space. One thousand times less dense than glass, the wispy aerogel is often dubbed \"blue smoke.\" The aerogel is contained in a collection device deployed by Stardust that Brownlee likened to a large ice cube tray. Scientists are anxious to dig into the aerogel, he said, \"trying to reveal the secrets of our origin.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10564359"}, {"title": "Stardust capsule returns to Earth", "date": "2006-01-15", "content": "The Stardust probe released the capsule as it flew back to Earth after a 4.6-billion-km trip. The US-built capsule plunged through the atmosphere and touched down in the Utah desert at 0312. Scientists believe the first cometary dust samples ever returned to Earth will shed light on the origins of the Solar System. \"We travelled about three billion miles in space, we visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it and it landed here on Earth this morning,\" Dr Don Brownlee, Stardust principal investigator, told reporters at a news briefing in Utah. \"I fully expect textbooks in the future will have a lot of new information from the samples that landed here this morning.\" Fiery descent: The Stardust spacecraft released the 45kg capsule at 0557 GMT as it looped past the Earth on its return from interplanetary space. Mission controllers at the US space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, clapped and cheered as the capsule began its plunge to Earth. Four hours after leaving the probe, the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere 125km over the Pacific Ocean. It reached speeds of 46,660km/h - the fastest re-entry of any manmade probe - and was visible from parts of the American northwest as a streak of light in the sky. At about 32km altitude, the capsule released a small parachute to slow its descent. The main parachute opened at about 3km, and brought the capsule down to land on a military base southwest of Salt Lake City. \"All stations, we have touchdown,\" an announcer declared to a jubilant control room. First analysis: The capsule was located by helicopter almost an hour after the landing. It was then flown to a nearby laboratory for checks. On Tuesday, it will be transported to a special lab at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where scientists will get their first chance to examine the precious contents. \"I'm very confident we will have samples in there that are the first returned from beyond the Moon,\" former Stardust project manager, Ken Atkins, told the BBC News website. \"It is magnificent to see something that we saw leave the planet on 7 February 1999 return to the planet here on 15 January 2006.\" The highlight of Stardust's seven-year mission was its close encounter with Comet Wild 2 in January 2004. It swept up particles from the frozen body of ice and dust, flying to within 240km of the comet's core, or nucleus. As part of its trip, the probe also captured a sprinkling of dust that originated in distant stars. The Stardust mothership has now completed its main mission and has been sent into orbit around the Sun. 'Minute specks': Meanwhile the work of scientists is just beginning. On Tuesday, Nasa experts will open the canister containing the samples which is packed away inside a protective shell. The capsule is believed to contain about a million particles of comet and interstellar dust left over from the birth of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. They are trapped inside cells filled with an ultra-light solid called aerogel. About 150 scientists around the world will get a chance to carry out a preliminary analysis of the contents, including researchers at the UK's Open University. Professor Monica Grady, of the OU's Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, said it would be the most scientifically exciting and technically challenging material with which they had ever had the opportunity to work. \"Imagine trying to pick up a grain that is less than a hundredth of the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence,\" she said. \"It is amazing to think that such minute specks of dust can carry within them so much information about the origin of stars and planets.\" Time capsules: Comets are thought to be cosmic \"time capsules\", containing material unchanged since the formation of the Sun and planets. Some even think they may have seeded Earth with the chemical building blocks required for life. \"Stardust could provide a new window into the distant past,\" said Dr Simon Green of the PSSRI. \"Because these particles have come from inside a comet, we know that essentially the particles haven't been heated since they became part of the comet, because the comet is made of ice,\" he told the BBC News website. \"That means that they contain information about the conditions that were present when they were incorporated into the comet. \"That time was four-and-a-half thousand-million years ago, back when the Solar System formed; so what we hope to know from these particles is essentially what the Solar System looked like at that time, and essentially what we're all made of.\" ", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4614222.stm"}, {"title": "Mission Completed: Stardust Capsule Lands in Utah", "date": "2006-01-15", "content": "NASA's Stardust sample return capsule has returned to Earth today, completing a 2.88 billion mile journey that took almost seven years.

The capsule is reportedly intact from the helicopter observations. The capsule's unofficial touch down time was 5:10 a.m. EST. Onboard the small container, a treasure trove of interstellar and comet particles--the collective wisdom of the spacecraft's nearly seven year voyage through space. Tucked within the spacecraft's sample container are pieces of Comet Wild2 and interstellar dust--trapped in a material dubbed aerogel--for scientists to analyze. These are first samples of material from our solar system returned to Earth from beyond the moon. There was palpable heavy-breathing here at the Lockheed Martin Mission Support Area, waiting for a drogue parachute to be released from the falling capsule, thus stabilizing the craft for deployment of its main parachute.

Researchers performed preliminary analysis on particles fromsix of Stardust's 132 collectors. Already, they are finding many of the samematerials in samples from the Comet Wild 2 (pronounced \"Vilt 2\") that they believe formed the early stars,planets, and other objects. While the samples appear to lack indicators of water, they docontain sulfides, a key component to life. \"When you have the samples in hand, it's a whole differentuniverse,\" project leader Don Brownlee of the University of Washington said during a pressbriefing here today at the annual meeting of the American Association for theAdvancement of Science. The early results reveal that the 4.5 billion-year-old cometcontains iron, sulfides, glassy materials, olivine, and what the scientiststermed potentially interesting isotopic traces. They believe that thesematerials were also available during the formation of other objects in oursolar system. Stardust also captured contemporary particles as they passedthrough the solar system. More than a million particles larger than one micron (amillionth of a meter) in diameter are believed to have been captured inice-cube-sized aerogel collectors. Many of theimpacts left carrot shaped troughs in the aerogel,each with a sample at the bottom. \"The biggest impacts were big enough to put your littlefinger in,\" Brownlee said. NASA's other recent comet mission, Deep Impact, revealedcarbonates, hydrated silicates, water ice, clay, iron, and olivine in adifferent comet. \"That's the big question: Is there a difference?\" Brownlee said of the two comets. Deep Impact hit Comet Tempel 1 in itsbody, which likely had warmed up from millions of years of impacts with otherbodies. Stardust, however, captured particles jetting out from its tail. Manyof the bits are thought to be the original, unadulterated materials that formedthe comet. \"We're confident that the things coming out [of Comet Wild2] are the same as those that went in,\" Brownlee told SPACE.com. \"We believe that wecollected the most pristine samples of a comet, those that have never beenwarmed.\" While further analysis of Tempel 1revealed waterice on its surface, so far no evidence of water has been detected in theparticles. The other sign of water would be the presence of hydrate silicates,which were present in Tempel 1, Brownlee said, but sofar none of these have been found in the Stardust samples.

The US-built capsule plunged through the atmosphere and touched down in the Utah desert at 0312. Scientists believe the first cometary dust samples ever returned to Earth will shed light on the origins of the Solar System. \"We travelled about three billion miles in space, we visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it and it landed here on Earth this morning,\" Dr Don Brownlee, Stardust principal investigator, told reporters at a news briefing in Utah. \"I fully expect textbooks in the future will have a lot of new information from the samples that landed here this morning.\" Fiery descent: The Stardust spacecraft released the 45kg capsule at 0557 GMT as it looped past the Earth on its return from interplanetary space. Mission controllers at the US space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, clapped and cheered as the capsule began its plunge to Earth. Four hours after leaving the probe, the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere 125km over the Pacific Ocean. It reached speeds of 46,660km/h - the fastest re-entry of any manmade probe - and was visible from parts of the American northwest as a streak of light in the sky. At about 32km altitude, the capsule released a small parachute to slow its descent. The main parachute opened at about 3km, and brought the capsule down to land on a military base southwest of Salt Lake City. \"All stations, we have touchdown,\" an announcer declared to a jubilant control room. First analysis: The capsule was located by helicopter almost an hour after the landing. It was then flown to a nearby laboratory for checks. On Tuesday, it will be transported to a special lab at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where scientists will get their first chance to examine the precious contents. \"I'm very confident we will have samples in there that are the first returned from beyond the Moon,\" former Stardust project manager, Ken Atkins, told the BBC News website. \"It is magnificent to see something that we saw leave the planet on 7 February 1999 return to the planet here on 15 January 2006.\" The highlight of Stardust's seven-year mission was its close encounter with Comet Wild 2 in January 2004. It swept up particles from the frozen body of ice and dust, flying to within 240km of the comet's core, or nucleus. As part of its trip, the probe also captured a sprinkling of dust that originated in distant stars. The Stardust mothership has now completed its main mission and has been sent into orbit around the Sun. 'Minute specks': Meanwhile the work of scientists is just beginning. On Tuesday, Nasa experts will open the canister containing the samples which is packed away inside a protective shell.

And by using existing spacecraft in flight, we can accomplish all of this for only about 15 percent of the cost of starting a new mission from scratch.\" The new assignments come after months of deliberation over what to do with the two spacecraft, which came away from their comet encounters with their observing instruments and navigation systems intact. \"These new mission assignments for veteran spacecraft represent not only creative thinking and planning, but are also a prime example of getting more from the budget we have,\" Stern said.

Only in the last decade has NASA made a concerted effort to study comets. The first mission to study a comet, involving Stardust, was launched in 1999. There have been just five instances in which a spacecraft from Earth has imaged a comet close up. In November, Schultz and graduate student Brendan Hermalyn discussed results from another NASA spacecraft's fly-by of the Hartley 2 comet.

Scientists say the spacecraft is on track for next week's encounter after firing its thrusters last week to refine its path. \"Encountering something as small and fast as a comet in the vastness of space is always a challenge, but we are very pleased with how things are setting up for our Valentine's Day flyby,\" Joe Veverka, a Cornell University researcher and principal investigator for the mission, said in a statement.

The Stardust-NExT probe flew to within 112 miles of the comet at 11:39 p.m. EST, snapping photos and making measurements all the while. It took mission scientists until midnight EST to confirm the successful encounter because of the communications lag between the probe and Earth. The spacecraft's high-resolution images began arriving on scientists' computers around 3:55 a.m. EST today. Researchers had wanted the first photos to bracket the spacecraft's closest approach, but a glitch prevented that from happening. The first Tempel 1 pictures scientists saw were the first ones Stardust-NExT took during the rendezvous, when it was about 1,600 miles away from the comet. The closest-approach photos will roll in, officials said - it'll just take a few more hours than expected. \"They're not lost, and the targeting is quite good,\" said Chris Jones, associate director for flight projects and mission success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a second look at Tempel 1: Comet Tempel 1 is no stranger to robotic visitors from Earth. In July 2005, another NASA probe, known as Deep Impact, smashed an 800-pound impactor into Tempel 1 to study the comet's composition. The 3.7-mile-wide Tempel 1 has an orbital period of 5 1/2 years, so it had made one trip around the sun since Deep Impact's visit. Stardust-NExT's main mission is to help scientists learn how much the comet has changed during this time. Researchers also hope to get a good look at the crater Deep Impact pounded out of the surface; the Deep Impact probe was not able to see it well through the huge cloud of debris ejected from the blow. Another aim of the Stardust-NExT mission is to extend geologic mapping of Tempel 1's surface, adding to the work done by Deep Impact. \"We've never gone back to a comet,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate. \"This is the first time in human history that we've had that opportunity.\" Through these and other observations, Stardust-NExT can contribute to scientists' understanding of how comets formed at the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and how they have evolved, researchers have said. The flyby: After more than three years of preparation, Stardust-NExT - streaking through space at about 24,300 mph - approached the comet and snapped 72 high-resolution images. The probe began beaming its photos back to Earth about four hours after the closest approach. Researchers expected the first photos they received to be the five taken when Stardust-NExT was closest to Tempel 1. But for reasons that remain mysterious at the moment, the craft instead sent its pictures in the order in which they were taken. \"They represent the approach sequence,\" Jones said. \"We still don't understand fully why this didn't work as planned.\" The problem is a glitch, not a disaster. Stardust-NExT didn't lose any pictures; the best ones will just take a little longer to reach scientists' computers. NASA had scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. EST today to discuss the flyby and some early science results. But that has been postponed until 4 p.m. EST at the earliest, officials said, to give scientists time to analyze the closest-approach photos. At this stage, all indications are that the rendezvous was a success, and excitement flowed through mission control at JPL as updates came in from the spacecraft. \"Everything is working wonderfully well,\" said Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Stardust-NExT principal investigator. Recycled spacecraft This was not Stardust-NExT's first comet rodeo. The probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999 on a mission to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth. Stardust completed that mission when its return canister landed in the Utah desert in 2006. Since the orbiting spacecraft was still in good shape and had a fair bit of fuel left, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007 - to rendezvous with Tempel 1. The probe was rechristened Stardust-NExT. The bonus mission is a bargain, NASA officials have said, since it takes advantage of an asset already in space. It cost about $300 million to launch and operate Stardust through the end of its mission. Stardust-NExT's total cost, on the other hand, should be $29 million. Stardust-NExT is a survivor, having already logged about 3.5 billion miles in space.

The flyby of Tempel 1 will give scientists an opportunity to look for changes on the comet's surface since it was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft in July 2005. Since then, Tempel 1 has completed one orbit of the sun, and scientists are looking forward to discovering any differences in the comet. The closest approach is expected tonight at approximately 8:40 p.m. PST (11:40 p.m. EST). During the encounter phase, the spacecraft will carry out many important milestones in short order and automatically, as the spacecraft is too far away to receive timely updates from Earth. These milestones include turning the spacecraft to point its protective shields between it and the anticipated direction from which cometary particles would approach. Another milestone will occur at about four minutes to closest approach, when the spacecraft will begin science imaging of the comet's nucleus. The nominal imaging sequence will run for about eight minutes. The spacecraft's onboard memory is limited to 72 high-resolution images, so the imaging will be most closely spaced around the time of closest approach for best-resolution coverage of Tempel 1's nucleus. At the time of closest encounter, the spacecraft is expected to be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the comet's nucleus. The mission team expects to begin receiving images on the ground starting at around midnight PST (3 a.m. on Feb. 15 EST). Transmission of each image will take about 15 minutes. It will take about 10 hours to complete the transmission of all images and science data aboard the spacecraft. Live coverage on NASA TV and via the Internet begins at 8:30 p.m. PST (11:30 p.m. EST) from mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Coverage also will include segments from the Lockheed Martin Space System's mission support area in Denver. A post-flyby news conference is planned on Feb. 15 at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EST).

Stardust streaked past the comet on Feb. 14 at 10.9 km/sec, or 24,000 MPH, and succeeded in briefly photographing the crater as it approached within 178 km (111 mi) during the fleeting moments of the probes closest approach. The intentional celestial collision in 2005 was designed to violently unleash the buried remnants of the early solar system into an enormous ejecta cloud of dusty debris that scientists could sift for clues to help unlock the secrets of how we all formed and evolved some 4.5 Billion Years ago. Tempel 1 is the first comet to receive a second visit by probes from Earth. Comets have continuously smashed into Earth over the eons and delivered vast quantities of key ingredients - such as water and organic molecules - that may have sparked the formation of life on the early Earth. NASA approved the use of the already orbiting Stardust-NExT spacecraft to follow up on the science discoveries by Deep Impact as the best and most economical way to try and locate the crater blast site, image new terrain and look for changes on the comets surface since the 2005 mission as the comet also completed another orbit around our Sun and eroded due to solar heating. The human made crater is about 150 meters wide and was formed by a 375 kilogram (800 pound) projectile propelled into the speeding path of Comet Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact mothership in 2005. Stardust-NExT took 72 high resolution science images of the comet during the Valentine's Day encounter flyby on Feb, 14 at 11:40 p.m. EST (8:40 p.m. PST). The probe absolutely had to be precisely navigated to exactly hit the aim point for sequencing the images to match the right moment in the erratic rotation of the volatile comet. The results of the Stardust-NExT mission were announced at a post encounter new briefing after most of the images and science data had streamed back to Earth. The science team and NASA said that all the mission objectives were accomplished. \"If you ask me was this mission 100 percent successful in terms of the science, I'd have to say no. It was 1000 percent successful!\" said Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., at the news briefing. \"We found the Deep Impact crater. We see erosion in comparison to 2005. So we do see changes. Erosion on the scale of 20 to 30 meters of material has occurred in the five or six years since we took the first picture. We are seeing a change, but we have to spend time quantifying the changes and understanding what they mean.\" \"We saw a lot of new territory. It's amazing with lots of layers. There is lots of surface sublimation. We had to arrive at precisely the right time in order to see new and old territory.\" \"We had monitored the comets rotation for several years. And we got the longitude almost perfect within 1 or 2 degrees,\" Veverka said. It took a few years of careful study to deduce the comets complex rotational patterns which change as the body orbits in a wide orbital path between Mars and Jupiter and is heated by the sun. Peter Schultz, a science team co-investigator agreed and showed the comparison images. \"We saw the crater,\" said Schultz, of University. \"It's subdued; it's about 150 meters across and has a small central mound in the center. It looks as if from the impact, the stuff went up and came back down. So we did get it, there's no doubt. I think one of the bottom-line messages is that this surface of the comet where we hit is very weak. It's fragile. So the crater partly healed itself.\" \"It was about the size we expected. But more subdued.\" The probes mission is almost complete since it has very little fuel left. The remaining science data from the flyby is being sent back and some outbound data is being collected. \"This spacecraft has logged over 3.5 billion miles since launch, and while its last close encounter is complete, its mission of discovery is not,\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at JPL. \"We'll continue imaging the comet as long as the science team can gain useful information, and then Stardust will get its well-deserved rest.\" Stardust-NExT is a repurposed spacecraft that has journeyed nearly 6 billion kilometers since it was launched in 1999. Initially christened as Stardust, the spaceships original task was to fly by Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It also collected priceless cometary dust particles from the coma which was safely parachuted back to Earth inside a return canister in 2006. High powered science analysis of the precious comet dust will help researchers discern the origin and evolution of our solar system. This was humanities first revisit to a comet and at a bargain basement price by using an old spacecraft already in space. \"The cost was just $29 Million dollars. A new Discovery class mission costs $300 to 500 Million. So that's maybe 6% the cost of developing and launching a new mission,\" said Ed Weiler, the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at NASA HQ in Washington, DC.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/83335/nasas-stardust-discovers-human-made-deep-impact-crater-on-comet-tempel-1/"}, {"title": "NASA's Stardust Spacecraft Completes Comet Flyby", "date": "2011-02-17", "content": "Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., watched as data downlinked from the Stardust spacecraft indicated it completed its closest approach with comet Tempel 1.

Scientists expect to learn a little more when a NASA spacecraft called Stardust flies to within 124 miles of the comet Tempel 1 on Valentine's Day. The encounter with the dark, spud-shaped behemoth - with a mass between 70 and 110 billion tons - will mark the first time that scientists can look for changes on a comet's surface caused by a close flyby of the sun. It also will be the first time that a comet has been revisited; in 2005, another NASA spacecraft recorded the collision of a projectile with Tempel 1. NASA is holding a news conference on Jan. 19, 2011, to discuss the upcoming Tempel 1 encounter. Peter Schultz, professor of geological sciences and a co-investigator on the mission, called Stardust-NExT, will be one of four panelists at the briefing. The briefing will be broadcast live beginning at 1 p.m. on NASA TV and streamed live on the agency's website. \"Tempel 1 has finished one tour of the solar system, from its closest approach to the sun just inside the orbit of Mars and then out to the orbit of Jupiter,\" Schultz said. \"So, this is just over one full year for this comet.\" During its flyby, the Stardust spacecraft is expected to obtain high-resolution images of Tempel 1's nucleus, or coma, an area that is usually heavily obscured by dust and gas. The spacecraft also will study, through various measurements, how a comet changes after it has completed two close flybys of the sun. Schultz, an expert in cometary impacts, is especially interested in seeing how the crater formed by the 2005 impact of Tempel 1 has changed the comet's nucleus. \"For the first time, we will have a look at how this comet has changed,\" Schultz said. \"Have features disappeared? Have new deposits formed?\" Comet clues: Due to their age, comets are believed to house debris dating back to the early history of the solar system, yet they remain among the most enigmatic bodies in our galactic neighborhood. Because they are composed of significant fractions of water ice, dust, and carbon-based compounds, some scientists think comets may have contributed some of the volatiles that make up our oceans and atmosphere. Some also think comets brought to Earth the complex molecules from which life arose. Little evidence has been gathered to support all the theories. Only in the last decade has NASA made a concerted effort to study comets. The first mission to study a comet, involving Stardust, was launched in 1999. There have been just five instances in which a spacecraft from Earth has imaged a comet close up. In November, Schultz and graduate student Brendan Hermalyn discussed results from another NASA spacecraft's fly-by of the Hartley 2 comet. That encounter was from 435 miles away, meaning that the Tempel 1 flyby will be more than two-thirds closer. \"We should see parts of the nucleus we haven't seen and document the processes that shape the comet's surface,\" Schultz noted. \"If we are lucky, we will also be able to see what happened to the crater. This is like sticking our thumb in the sand on Earth and checking what happens after one year.\"", "url": "https://news.brown.edu/articles/2011/01/stardust"}, {"title": "NASA Sets Valentine's Day Date With Comet", "date": "2011-01-19", "content": "An aging NASA spacecraft is gearing up for its last hurrah - a Valentine's Day rendezvous with a comet visited, and slammed, by another probe five years ago. The Stardust-NExT spacecraft is set for a close flyby of comet Tempel 1 at around 11:37 p.m. EST on Feb. 14. The main goal is to see how much Tempel 1 has changed since July 2005, when NASA's Deep Impact probe flew by the icy wanderer and sent an impactor smashing into it, creating a crater. \"Now, with going back, we'll be able to take a look at the surface and see what's changed,\" Pete Schultz, a Stardust-NExT scientist from Brown University, told reporters today. Repurposed spacecraft: The Stardust-NExT probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999. It accomplished its primary mission - to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth in a return canister - back in 2006. Since the spacecraft was in good shape and had enough fuel, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007: to meet up with comet Tempel 1. With the new mission came an expanded name: Stardust-NExT. The 3.7-mile-wide comet completes an orbit of the sun every 5.5 years, so it has circled the sun once since Deep Impact's visit. Researchers hope Stardust-NExT will give them an idea of how Tempel 1 has changed during this time. \"We're going to find out a lot about how comets evolve from perihelion passage to perihelion passage,\" said mission scientist Steve Chesley of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Perihelion passage\" describes an orbiting object's closest approach to the sun. Peering at Deep Impact's crater: The Deep Impact probe couldn't get a good look at what its 816-pound impactor, traveling at 6.2 miles per second, did to the comet surface in 2005; the ejected dust and stirred-up debris obscured the views of the new crater. Stardust-NExT researchers hope the Feb. 14 rendezvous reveals the crater, though they said the probe's mission could be considered a success even if that didn't work out. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History \"We should be able to resolve the impact,\" Schultz said. \"I really hope we get to see the impact crater, but that's going to be a bonus.\" Getting a good look at the crater could reveal a great deal about Tempel 1's makeup, according to Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University. That knowledge could help plan out future missions to return samples from a comet's surface. Such missions could help researchers determine the likelihood that comets provided the raw materials for life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the universe, Veverka added. \"It's a step toward the ultimate answer,\" Veverka said. Lots of miles on the odometer: Stardust-NExT has already logged about 3.7 billion miles in space, researchers said, and it will put a few more on its odometer before calling it quits. The spacecraft is currently about 15 million miles from Tempel 1. It will close to about 124 miles on the night of Feb. 14. The probe will take 72 high-resolution images and begin transmitting them to Earth an hour after the flyby, researchers said. It will take about 12 hours for all the pictures to reach researchers on the ground. When the flyby is done, the spacecraft's work will be, too. It won't have enough fuel left to do much else, researchers said. But Stardust-NExT should go out on a high note. \"The spacecraft is working wonderfully well,\" Veverka said. \"The science team is awfully excited and can't wait to see all the pictures.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/10649-stardust-comet-tempel1-preview.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Adjusts Flight Path for Comet Meetup", "date": "2011-02-01", "content": "Just over two weeks before its flyby of comet Tempel 1, NASA's Stardust spacecraft fired its thrusters to help refine its flight path toward the comet.

Comet Tempel 1 is a ball of ice and rock that orbits the sun every 5 1/2 years. Scientists say the spacecraft is on track for next week's encounter after firing its thrusters last week to refine its path. \"Encountering something as small and fast as a comet in the vastness of space is always a challenge, but we are very pleased with how things are setting up for our Valentine's Day flyby,\" Joe Veverka, a Cornell University researcher and principal investigator for the mission, said in a statement.

The Stardust-NExT probe flew to within 112 miles of the comet at 11:39 p.m. EST, snapping photos and making measurements all the while. It took mission scientists until midnight EST to confirm the successful encounter because of the communications lag between the probe and Earth. The spacecraft's high-resolution images began arriving on scientists' computers around 3:55 a.m. EST today. Researchers had wanted the first photos to bracket the spacecraft's closest approach, but a glitch prevented that from happening. The first Tempel 1 pictures scientists saw were the first ones Stardust-NExT took during the rendezvous, when it was about 1,600 miles away from the comet. The closest-approach photos will roll in, officials said - it'll just take a few more hours than expected. \"They're not lost, and the targeting is quite good,\" said Chris Jones, associate director for flight projects and mission success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a second look at Tempel 1: Comet Tempel 1 is no stranger to robotic visitors from Earth. In July 2005, another NASA probe, known as Deep Impact, smashed an 800-pound impactor into Tempel 1 to study the comet's composition. The 3.7-mile-wide Tempel 1 has an orbital period of 5 1/2 years, so it had made one trip around the sun since Deep Impact's visit. Stardust-NExT's main mission is to help scientists learn how much the comet has changed during this time. Researchers also hope to get a good look at the crater Deep Impact pounded out of the surface; the Deep Impact probe was not able to see it well through the huge cloud of debris ejected from the blow. Another aim of the Stardust-NExT mission is to extend geologic mapping of Tempel 1's surface, adding to the work done by Deep Impact. \"We've never gone back to a comet,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate. \"This is the first time in human history that we've had that opportunity.\" Through these and other observations, Stardust-NExT can contribute to scientists' understanding of how comets formed at the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and how they have evolved, researchers have said. The flyby: After more than three years of preparation, Stardust-NExT - streaking through space at about 24,300 mph - approached the comet and snapped 72 high-resolution images. The probe began beaming its photos back to Earth about four hours after the closest approach. Researchers expected the first photos they received to be the five taken when Stardust-NExT was closest to Tempel 1. But for reasons that remain mysterious at the moment, the craft instead sent its pictures in the order in which they were taken. \"They represent the approach sequence,\" Jones said. \"We still don't understand fully why this didn't work as planned.\" The problem is a glitch, not a disaster. Stardust-NExT didn't lose any pictures; the best ones will just take a little longer to reach scientists' computers. NASA had scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. EST today to discuss the flyby and some early science results. But that has been postponed until 4 p.m. EST at the earliest, officials said, to give scientists time to analyze the closest-approach photos. At this stage, all indications are that the rendezvous was a success, and excitement flowed through mission control at JPL as updates came in from the spacecraft. \"Everything is working wonderfully well,\" said Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Stardust-NExT principal investigator. Recycled spacecraft This was not Stardust-NExT's first comet rodeo. The probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999 on a mission to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth. Stardust completed that mission when its return canister landed in the Utah desert in 2006. Since the orbiting spacecraft was still in good shape and had a fair bit of fuel left, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007 - to rendezvous with Tempel 1. The probe was rechristened Stardust-NExT. The bonus mission is a bargain, NASA officials have said, since it takes advantage of an asset already in space. It cost about $300 million to launch and operate Stardust through the end of its mission. Stardust-NExT's total cost, on the other hand, should be $29 million. Stardust-NExT is a survivor, having already logged about 3.5 billion miles in space. But this should be the last comet encounter for the probe, since it has probably burned up almost all of its remaining fuel chasing down Tempel 1, researchers said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/10858-nasa-valentines-comet-success.html"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Hours From Comet Encounter", "date": "2011-02-14", "content": "As of today, Feb. 14, at 9:21 a.m. PST (12:21 p.m. EST), NASA's Stardust-NExT mission spacecraft is within a quarter-million miles (402,336 kilometers) of its quarry, comet Tempel 1, which it will fly by tonight. The spacecraft is cutting the distance with the comet at a rate of about 10.9 kilometers per second (6.77 miles per second or 24,000 mph). The flyby of Tempel 1 will give scientists an opportunity to look for changes on the comet's surface since it was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft in July 2005. Since then, Tempel 1 has completed one orbit of the sun, and scientists are looking forward to discovering any differences in the comet. The closest approach is expected tonight at approximately 8:40 p.m. PST (11:40 p.m. EST). During the encounter phase, the spacecraft will carry out many important milestones in short order and automatically, as the spacecraft is too far away to receive timely updates from Earth. These milestones include turning the spacecraft to point its protective shields between it and the anticipated direction from which cometary particles would approach. Another milestone will occur at about four minutes to closest approach, when the spacecraft will begin science imaging of the comet's nucleus. The nominal imaging sequence will run for about eight minutes. The spacecraft's onboard memory is limited to 72 high-resolution images, so the imaging will be most closely spaced around the time of closest approach for best-resolution coverage of Tempel 1's nucleus. At the time of closest encounter, the spacecraft is expected to be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the comet's nucleus. The mission team expects to begin receiving images on the ground starting at around midnight PST (3 a.m. on Feb. 15 EST). Transmission of each image will take about 15 minutes. It will take about 10 hours to complete the transmission of all images and science data aboard the spacecraft. Live coverage on NASA TV and via the Internet begins at 8:30 p.m. PST (11:30 p.m. EST) from mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Coverage also will include segments from the Lockheed Martin Space System's mission support area in Denver. A post-flyby news conference is planned on Feb. 15 at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EST).

Stardust streaked past the comet on Feb. 14 at 10.9 km/sec, or 24,000 MPH, and succeeded in briefly photographing the crater as it approached within 178 km (111 mi) during the fleeting moments of the probes closest approach. The intentional celestial collision in 2005 was designed to violently unleash the buried remnants of the early solar system into an enormous ejecta cloud of dusty debris that scientists could sift for clues to help unlock the secrets of how we all formed and evolved some 4.5 Billion Years ago. Tempel 1 is the first comet to receive a second visit by probes from Earth. Comets have continuously smashed into Earth over the eons and delivered vast quantities of key ingredients - such as water and organic molecules - that may have sparked the formation of life on the early Earth. NASA approved the use of the already orbiting Stardust-NExT spacecraft to follow up on the science discoveries by Deep Impact as the best and most economical way to try and locate the crater blast site, image new terrain and look for changes on the comets surface since the 2005 mission as the comet also completed another orbit around our Sun and eroded due to solar heating. The human made crater is about 150 meters wide and was formed by a 375 kilogram (800 pound) projectile propelled into the speeding path of Comet Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact mothership in 2005. Stardust-NExT took 72 high resolution science images of the comet during the Valentine's Day encounter flyby on Feb, 14 at 11:40 p.m. EST (8:40 p.m. PST). The probe absolutely had to be precisely navigated to exactly hit the aim point for sequencing the images to match the right moment in the erratic rotation of the volatile comet. The results of the Stardust-NExT mission were announced at a post encounter new briefing after most of the images and science data had streamed back to Earth. The science team and NASA said that all the mission objectives were accomplished. \"If you ask me was this mission 100 percent successful in terms of the science, I'd have to say no. It was 1000 percent successful!\" said Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., at the news briefing. \"We found the Deep Impact crater. We see erosion in comparison to 2005. So we do see changes. Erosion on the scale of 20 to 30 meters of material has occurred in the five or six years since we took the first picture. We are seeing a change, but we have to spend time quantifying the changes and understanding what they mean.\" \"We saw a lot of new territory. It's amazing with lots of layers. There is lots of surface sublimation. We had to arrive at precisely the right time in order to see new and old territory.\" \"We had monitored the comets rotation for several years. And we got the longitude almost perfect within 1 or 2 degrees,\" Veverka said. It took a few years of careful study to deduce the comets complex rotational patterns which change as the body orbits in a wide orbital path between Mars and Jupiter and is heated by the sun. Peter Schultz, a science team co-investigator agreed and showed the comparison images. \"We saw the crater,\" said Schultz, of University. \"It's subdued; it's about 150 meters across and has a small central mound in the center. It looks as if from the impact, the stuff went up and came back down. So we did get it, there's no doubt. I think one of the bottom-line messages is that this surface of the comet where we hit is very weak. It's fragile. So the crater partly healed itself.\" \"It was about the size we expected. But more subdued.\" The probes mission is almost complete since it has very little fuel left. The remaining science data from the flyby is being sent back and some outbound data is being collected. \"This spacecraft has logged over 3.5 billion miles since launch, and while its last close encounter is complete, its mission of discovery is not,\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at JPL. \"We'll continue imaging the comet as long as the science team can gain useful information, and then Stardust will get its well-deserved rest.\" Stardust-NExT is a repurposed spacecraft that has journeyed nearly 6 billion kilometers since it was launched in 1999. Initially christened as Stardust, the spaceships original task was to fly by Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It also collected priceless cometary dust particles from the coma which was safely parachuted back to Earth inside a return canister in 2006. High powered science analysis of the precious comet dust will help researchers discern the origin and evolution of our solar system. This was humanities first revisit to a comet and at a bargain basement price by using an old spacecraft already in space. \"The cost was just $29 Million dollars. A new Discovery class mission costs $300 to 500 Million.

At first glance, the burn is something of an insignificant event. After all, the venerable spacecraft has executed 40 major flight path maneuvers since its 1999 launch, and between these main engines and the reaction control system, its rocket motors have collectively fired more than 2 million times. But the March 24 burn will be different from all others. This burn will effectively end the life of NASA's most traveled comet hunter. \"We call it a 'burn to depletion,' and that is pretty much what we're doing - firing our rockets until there is nothing left in the tank,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's a unique way for an interplanetary spacecraft to go out. Essentially, Stardust will be providing us useful information to the very end.\" Burn to depletion will answer the question about how much fuel Stardust had left in its tank. \"We'll take those data and compare them to what our estimates told us was left,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems program manager for Stardust-NExT. \"That will give us a better idea how valid our fuel consumption models are and make our predictions even more accurate for future missions.\" Fuel consumption models are necessary because no one has invented an entirely reliable fuel gauge for spacecraft. Until that day arrives, mission planners can approximate fuel usage by looking at the history of the vehicle's flight and how many times and for how long its rocket motors have fired. Stardust's burn to depletion is expected to impart valuable information, because the spacecraft has essentially been running on borrowed time - for some time. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust had already flown past an asteroid (Annefrank), flown past and collected particle samples from a comet (Wild 2), and returned those particles to Earth in a sample return capsule in January 2006 - and in so doing racked up 4.63 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles) on its odometer. NASA then re-tasked the still-healthy spacecraft to perform a flyby of comet Tempel 1, a new, low-cost mission that required another five years and 1.04 billion kilometers (646 million miles). After all those milestones and all that time logged on the spacecraft, the Stardust team knew the end was near. They just didn't know exactly how close. Prior to this final burn, Stardust will point its medium-gain antenna at Earth - some 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away. As there is no tomorrow for Stardust, the spacecraft is expected to downlink information on the burn as it happens. The command from the spacecraft computer ordering the rockets to fire will be sent for 45 minutes, but the burn is expected to last only between a couple of minutes to somewhat above 10 minutes. It is estimated the burn could accelerate the spacecraft anywhere from 2.5 to 35.2 meters per second (6 to 79 mph). \"What we think will happen is that when the fuel reaches a critically low level, gaseous helium will enter the thruster chambers,\" said Larson. \"The resulting thrust will be less than 10 percent of what was expected. While Stardust will continue to command its rocket engines to fire until the pre-planned firing time of 45 minutes has elapsed, the burn is essentially over.\" Twenty minutes after the engines run dry, the spacecraft's computer will command its transmitters off. They actively shut off their radios to preclude the remote chance that at some point down the road Stardust's transmitter could turn on and broadcast on a frequency being used by other operational spacecraft. Turning off the transmitter ensures that there will be no unintended radio interference in the future. Without fuel to power the spacecraft's attitude control system, Stardust's solar panels will not remain pointed at the sun. When this occurs, the spacecraft's batteries are expected to drain of power and deplete within hours. \"When we take into account all the possibilities for how long the burn could be and then the possible post-burn trajectories, we project that over the next 100 years, Stardust will not get any closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit, or within 13 million miles of Mars orbit,\" said Larson. \"That is far enough from protected targets to meet all of NASA's Planetary Protection directives. \" Some planetary spacecraft, like the Galileo mission to Jupiter, are intentionally sent into the planet's atmosphere to make sure it is destroyed in a controlled way. Others have their transmitters shut off or just fade away, said Larson. \"I think this is a fitting end for Stardust. It's going down swinging.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/news/stardust20110323.html"}, {"title": "R.I.P. Stardust: NASA Comet-Visiting Spacecraft Ends 12-Year Mission", "date": "2011-03-24", "content": "You could call it assisted suicide in space. NASA's comet-visiting Stardust spacecraft was purposely put to death today by those that had provided tender loving care to the probe for more than 12 years. After visiting two comets and traveling nearly 5.7 billion miles, the Stardust spacecraft is at journey's end. But even in its death throes, Stardust will yield valuable data for spacecraft engineers. Ground controllers commanded the spacecraft to fire up its four rocket thrusters one last time to use up its remaining fuel today. Engineers watched closely while the probe's propellant tank ran dry to help future missions gauge their fuel reserves more precisely. Stardust's demise comes after a long track record of scientific feats achieved by the Discovery-class mission. A tale of two comets\uff1a NASA launched Stardust in 1999 on a $300 million mission to snatch up the first samples of a comet. The probe flew by the asteroid 5535 Annefrank in November 2002 and later zipped by comet Wild 2 in January 2004, flying through the comet's coma and snagging particles from that object. Two years later, Stardust dutifully ejected its sample-carrying capsule to Earth, with that canister parachuting into the Utah Test and Training Range in the Utah desert. But the hard-working Stardust probe wasn't done yet. NASA recycled the spacecraft for a new $29 million mission to rendezvous with the comet Tempel 1 - a comet already visited by the agency's Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust flew by Tempel 1 on Feb. 14 - Valentine's Day - and snapped photos of the scar left behind by a Deep Impact probe that was intentionally crashed into the comet to determine its composition. But with those achievements behind it, it's time for Stardust to rest in peace. Bittersweet moment\uff1a Saying goodbye to Stardust was a bittersweet moment here at the Mission Support Area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"We call it the farewell maneuver,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust-NExT program manager at the aerospace firm. He gave the order to fire four thrusters on the probe until each ran dry. The burn was designed to exceed the spacecraft's capability to perform. To make sure Stardust didn't put up a fuss, specially-written software was uploaded that disabled the probe's fault protection system, allowing it to succumb self-execution style. Cheuvront told SPACE.com just how Stardust would react in its final moments as it obeyed end-of-life orders were difficult to forecast. Burn to depletion: Information gleaned from Stardust's sayonara, Cheuvront said, can assist currently flying spacecraft, such as Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now circling the red planet, as well as the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn. \"It will help provide a better predictor of when the fuel may go out. Then we have our future missions. Through better placement of pressure and temperature sensors perhaps we can improve our computer modeling,\" Cheuvront explained. In belching out all of its fuel, Stardust is also doomed as it drifts freely. The spacecraft's solar panels won't be sun-oriented and onboard batteries will slowly drain. As a NASA planetary protection requirement, Stardust controllers ran a series of trajectories based on different oomph factors created by the burn to depletion. Those studies have shown the now wayward, sun-orbiting spacecraft has no chance of running into a planet, particularly Mars, Cheuvront said. A NASA analysis predicts that Stardust will never get closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit and 13 million miles of Mars' orbit, mission managers have said. \"Stardust was commanded to turn its transmitter off and not turn it back on,\" Cheuvront said. As a 15-year veteran of Stardust moving from blueprint to spaceflight, he added: \"I've got an empty feeling now, knowing that we're not going to talk to it anymore.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11226-nasa-stardust-spacecraft-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Spacecraft Officially Ends Operations", "date": "2011-03-25", "content": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft sent its last transmission to Earth at 4:33 p.m. PDT (7:33 p.m. EDT) Thursday, March 24, shortly after depleting fuel and ceasing operations.

The Stardust team performed the burn to depletion because the comet hunter was literally running on fumes. The depletion maneuver command was sent from the Stardust-NExT mission control area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. The operation was designed to fire Stardust's rockets until no fuel remained in the tank or fuel lines. The spacecraft sent acknowledgment of its last command from approximately 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away in space. \"This is the end of the spacecraft's operations, but really just the beginnings of what this spacecraft's accomplishments will give to planetary science,\" said Lindley Johnson, Stardust-NExT and Discovery program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The treasure-trove of science data and engineering information collected and returned by Stardust is invaluable for planning future deep space planetary missions.\" After completion of the burn, mission personnel began comparing the computed amount of fuel consumed during the engine firing with the anticipated amount based on consumption models. The models are required to track fuel levels, because there are no fully reliable fuel gauges for spacecraft in the weightless environment of space. Mission planners use approximate fuel usage by reviewing the history of the vehicle's flight, how many times and how long its rocket motors fired. \"Stardust's motors burned for 146 seconds,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company program manager for Stardust-NExT in Denver. \"We'll crunch the numbers and see how close the reality matches up with our projections. That will be a great data set to have in our back pocket when we plan for future missions.\" Launched Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust flew past the asteroid named Annefrank and traveled halfway to Jupiter to collect the particle samples from the comet Wild 2. The spacecraft returned to Earth's vicinity to drop off a sample return capsule eagerly awaited by comet scientists.

The briefing will be broadcast live beginning at 1 p.m. on NASA TV and streamed live on the agency's website. \"Tempel 1 has finished one tour of the solar system, from its closest approach to the sun just inside the orbit of Mars and then out to the orbit of Jupiter,\" Schultz said. \"So, this is just over one full year for this comet.\" During its flyby, the Stardust spacecraft is expected to obtain high-resolution images of Tempel 1's nucleus, or coma, an area that is usually heavily obscured by dust and gas. The spacecraft also will study, through various measurements, how a comet changes after it has completed two close flybys of the sun. Schultz, an expert in cometary impacts, is especially interested in seeing how the crater formed by the 2005 impact of Tempel 1 has changed the comet's nucleus. \"For the first time, we will have a look at how this comet has changed,\" Schultz said. \"Have features disappeared? Have new deposits formed?\" Comet clues: Due to their age, comets are believed to house debris dating back to the early history of the solar system, yet they remain among the most enigmatic bodies in our galactic neighborhood. Because they are composed of significant fractions of water ice, dust, and carbon-based compounds, some scientists think comets may have contributed some of the volatiles that make up our oceans and atmosphere. Some also think comets brought to Earth the complex molecules from which life arose. Little evidence has been gathered to support all the theories. Only in the last decade has NASA made a concerted effort to study comets. The first mission to study a comet, involving Stardust, was launched in 1999. There have been just five instances in which a spacecraft from Earth has imaged a comet close up. In November, Schultz and graduate student Brendan Hermalyn discussed results from another NASA spacecraft's fly-by of the Hartley 2 comet. That encounter was from 435 miles away, meaning that the Tempel 1 flyby will be more than two-thirds closer. \"We should see parts of the nucleus we haven't seen and document the processes that shape the comet's surface,\" Schultz noted. \"If we are lucky, we will also be able to see what happened to the crater. This is like sticking our thumb in the sand on Earth and checking what happens after one year.\"", "url": "https://news.brown.edu/articles/2011/01/stardust"}, {"title": "NASA Sets Valentine's Day Date With Comet", "date": "2011-01-19", "content": "An aging NASA spacecraft is gearing up for its last hurrah - a Valentine's Day rendezvous with a comet visited, and slammed, by another probe five years ago. The Stardust-NExT spacecraft is set for a close flyby of comet Tempel 1 at around 11:37 p.m. EST on Feb. 14. The main goal is to see how much Tempel 1 has changed since July 2005, when NASA's Deep Impact probe flew by the icy wanderer and sent an impactor smashing into it, creating a crater. \"Now, with going back, we'll be able to take a look at the surface and see what's changed,\" Pete Schultz, a Stardust-NExT scientist from Brown University, told reporters today. Repurposed spacecraft: The Stardust-NExT probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999. It accomplished its primary mission - to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth in a return canister - back in 2006. Since the spacecraft was in good shape and had enough fuel, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007: to meet up with comet Tempel 1. With the new mission came an expanded name: Stardust-NExT. The 3.7-mile-wide comet completes an orbit of the sun every 5.5 years, so it has circled the sun once since Deep Impact's visit. Researchers hope Stardust-NExT will give them an idea of how Tempel 1 has changed during this time. \"We're going to find out a lot about how comets evolve from perihelion passage to perihelion passage,\" said mission scientist Steve Chesley of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Perihelion passage\" describes an orbiting object's closest approach to the sun. Peering at Deep Impact's crater: The Deep Impact probe couldn't get a good look at what its 816-pound impactor, traveling at 6.2 miles per second, did to the comet surface in 2005; the ejected dust and stirred-up debris obscured the views of the new crater. Stardust-NExT researchers hope the Feb. 14 rendezvous reveals the crater, though they said the probe's mission could be considered a success even if that didn't work out. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History \"We should be able to resolve the impact,\" Schultz said. \"I really hope we get to see the impact crater, but that's going to be a bonus.\" Getting a good look at the crater could reveal a great deal about Tempel 1's makeup, according to Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University. That knowledge could help plan out future missions to return samples from a comet's surface. Such missions could help researchers determine the likelihood that comets provided the raw materials for life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the universe, Veverka added. \"It's a step toward the ultimate answer,\" Veverka said. Lots of miles on the odometer: Stardust-NExT has already logged about 3.7 billion miles in space, researchers said, and it will put a few more on its odometer before calling it quits. The spacecraft is currently about 15 million miles from Tempel 1. It will close to about 124 miles on the night of Feb. 14. The probe will take 72 high-resolution images and begin transmitting them to Earth an hour after the flyby, researchers said. It will take about 12 hours for all the pictures to reach researchers on the ground. When the flyby is done, the spacecraft's work will be, too. It won't have enough fuel left to do much else, researchers said. But Stardust-NExT should go out on a high note. \"The spacecraft is working wonderfully well,\" Veverka said. \"The science team is awfully excited and can't wait to see all the pictures.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/10649-stardust-comet-tempel1-preview.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Adjusts Flight Path for Comet Meetup", "date": "2011-02-01", "content": "Just over two weeks before its flyby of comet Tempel 1, NASA's Stardust spacecraft fired its thrusters to help refine its flight path toward the comet. The Stardust-NExT mission will fly past comet Tempel 1 on Valentine's Day (Feb. 14, 2011). The trajectory correction maneuver, which adjusts the spacecraft's flight path, began at about 4 p.m. EST (1:00 p.m. PST) on Monday, Jan. 31. The Stardust spacecraft's rockets fired for 130 seconds, consumed about 300 grams (10.6 ounces) of fuel and changed the spacecraft's speed by 2.6 meters per second (about 5.8 mph). \"An almost six-miles-per-hour change may seem insignificant when we're closing in on the comet at 24,236 miles per hour [39,000 kilometers per hour],\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"But we're still two weeks and 8.37 million miles [13.5 million kilometers] away from the comet. At that distance, our burn will move our location at time of closest approach to the comet by almost 1,900 miles [3,058 kilometers]. By observing the results of these planned maneuvers and making further rocket burns, that's how we get a spacecraft to be where we want it, when it's on the other side of the solar system.\" NASA's plan for the Stardust-NExT mission is to fly the spacecraft to target a point in space about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from comet Tempel 1 at the time of its closest approach - about 8:56 p.m. PST on Feb. 14 (11:56 p.m. EST). This is a bonus mission for the comet chaser, which previously flew past comet Wild 2 and returned particles from its coma to Earth. During this bonus encounter, the spacecraft will take images of the comet's surface to observe what changes have occurred since a NASA spacecraft last visited. (NASA's Deep Impact executed an encounter with Tempel 1 in July 2005). Along with the high-resolution images of the comet's surface, Stardust-NExT will also measure the composition, size distribution and flux of dust emitted into the coma, and provide important new information on how Jupiter-family comets evolve and how they formed 4.6 billion years ago. A Jupiter-family comet is a comet whose orbit has been modified by close passages to Jupiter. They have orbital periods less than 20 years. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust became the first spacecraft in history to collect samples from a comet (Wild 2), and return them to Earth for study. While its sample return capsule parachuted to Earth in January 2006, mission controllers were placing the still-viable spacecraft on a path that would allow NASA the opportunity to re-use the already-proven flight system if a target of opportunity presented itself. In January 2007, NASA re-christened the mission \"Stardust-NExT\" (New Exploration of Tempel), and the Stardust team began a four-and-a-half year journey for the spacecraft to comet Tempel 1.

The space agency's Stardust-NExT mission is just one week away from zooming by the comet Tempel 1 Feb. 14 to see what's new since the comet was last visited by a spacecraft in July 2005. Comet Tempel 1 is a ball of ice and rock that orbits the sun every 5 1/2 years. Scientists say the spacecraft is on track for next week's encounter after firing its thrusters last week to refine its path. \"Encountering something as small and fast as a comet in the vastness of space is always a challenge, but we are very pleased with how things are setting up for our Valentine's Day flyby,\" Joe Veverka, a Cornell University researcher and principal investigator for the mission, said in a statement. The Stardust spacecraft snapped its first photos of Tempel 1 Jan. 18-19 from distances of 16.3 million miles, and 15.8 million miles, respectively. \"This is the first of many images to come of comet Tempel 1,\" Veverka said. The upcoming rendezvous is a bonus mission for the Stardust spacecraft, which completed its primary goal in 2006 when it flew past comet Wild 2 and sent a sample of particles from its coma to Earth. The probe was launched in February 1999. The NExT mission stands for New Exploration of Tempel 1. Stardust will fly within 124 miles of comet Tempel 1 during its closest approach, which will occur at 11:56 p.m. EST on Feb. 14. In addition to capturing high-resolution images of the comet's surface, Stardust-NExT will measure the composition, size distribution and flux of dust particles in the coma, the tenuous atmosphere around the comet's nucleus. Tempel 1 was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft, which deliberately sent one of its components crashing into the comet, then took photographs of the cloud of debris that spewed out from the impact. The mission was unable to get clear pictures of the newly formed crater because the dust cloud obscured the view. NASA hopes to complete that unfinished business by imaging the crater with Stardust-NExT. This second encounter with Tempel 1 also could teach scientists more about comets in general, and how they formed along with the rest of the solar system around 4.6 billion years ago.

The Stardust-NExT probe flew to within 112 miles of the comet at 11:39 p.m. EST, snapping photos and making measurements all the while. It took mission scientists until midnight EST to confirm the successful encounter because of the communications lag between the probe and Earth. The spacecraft's high-resolution images began arriving on scientists' computers around 3:55 a.m. EST today. Researchers had wanted the first photos to bracket the spacecraft's closest approach, but a glitch prevented that from happening. The first Tempel 1 pictures scientists saw were the first ones Stardust-NExT took during the rendezvous, when it was about 1,600 miles away from the comet. The closest-approach photos will roll in, officials said - it'll just take a few more hours than expected. \"They're not lost, and the targeting is quite good,\" said Chris Jones, associate director for flight projects and mission success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a second look at Tempel 1: Comet Tempel 1 is no stranger to robotic visitors from Earth. In July 2005, another NASA probe, known as Deep Impact, smashed an 800-pound impactor into Tempel 1 to study the comet's composition. The 3.7-mile-wide Tempel 1 has an orbital period of 5 1/2 years, so it had made one trip around the sun since Deep Impact's visit. Stardust-NExT's main mission is to help scientists learn how much the comet has changed during this time. Researchers also hope to get a good look at the crater Deep Impact pounded out of the surface; the Deep Impact probe was not able to see it well through the huge cloud of debris ejected from the blow. Another aim of the Stardust-NExT mission is to extend geologic mapping of Tempel 1's surface, adding to the work done by Deep Impact. \"We've never gone back to a comet,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate. \"This is the first time in human history that we've had that opportunity.\" Through these and other observations, Stardust-NExT can contribute to scientists' understanding of how comets formed at the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and how they have evolved, researchers have said. The flyby: After more than three years of preparation, Stardust-NExT - streaking through space at about 24,300 mph - approached the comet and snapped 72 high-resolution images. The probe began beaming its photos back to Earth about four hours after the closest approach. Researchers expected the first photos they received to be the five taken when Stardust-NExT was closest to Tempel 1. But for reasons that remain mysterious at the moment, the craft instead sent its pictures in the order in which they were taken. \"They represent the approach sequence,\" Jones said. \"We still don't understand fully why this didn't work as planned.\" The problem is a glitch, not a disaster. Stardust-NExT didn't lose any pictures; the best ones will just take a little longer to reach scientists' computers. NASA had scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. EST today to discuss the flyby and some early science results. But that has been postponed until 4 p.m. EST at the earliest, officials said, to give scientists time to analyze the closest-approach photos. At this stage, all indications are that the rendezvous was a success, and excitement flowed through mission control at JPL as updates came in from the spacecraft. \"Everything is working wonderfully well,\" said Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Stardust-NExT principal investigator. Recycled spacecraft This was not Stardust-NExT's first comet rodeo. The probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999 on a mission to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth. Stardust completed that mission when its return canister landed in the Utah desert in 2006. Since the orbiting spacecraft was still in good shape and had a fair bit of fuel left, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007 - to rendezvous with Tempel 1. The probe was rechristened Stardust-NExT. The bonus mission is a bargain, NASA officials have said, since it takes advantage of an asset already in space. It cost about $300 million to launch and operate Stardust through the end of its mission. Stardust-NExT's total cost, on the other hand, should be $29 million. Stardust-NExT is a survivor, having already logged about 3.5 billion miles in space. But this should be the last comet encounter for the probe, since it has probably burned up almost all of its remaining fuel chasing down Tempel 1, researchers said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/10858-nasa-valentines-comet-success.html"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Hours From Comet Encounter", "date": "2011-02-14", "content": "As of today, Feb. 14, at 9:21 a.m. PST (12:21 p.m. EST), NASA's Stardust-NExT mission spacecraft is within a quarter-million miles (402,336 kilometers) of its quarry, comet Tempel 1, which it will fly by tonight. The spacecraft is cutting the distance with the comet at a rate of about 10.9 kilometers per second (6.77 miles per second or 24,000 mph). The flyby of Tempel 1 will give scientists an opportunity to look for changes on the comet's surface since it was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft in July 2005. Since then, Tempel 1 has completed one orbit of the sun, and scientists are looking forward to discovering any differences in the comet. The closest approach is expected tonight at approximately 8:40 p.m. PST (11:40 p.m. EST). During the encounter phase, the spacecraft will carry out many important milestones in short order and automatically, as the spacecraft is too far away to receive timely updates from Earth. These milestones include turning the spacecraft to point its protective shields between it and the anticipated direction from which cometary particles would approach. Another milestone will occur at about four minutes to closest approach, when the spacecraft will begin science imaging of the comet's nucleus. The nominal imaging sequence will run for about eight minutes. The spacecraft's onboard memory is limited to 72 high-resolution images, so the imaging will be most closely spaced around the time of closest approach for best-resolution coverage of Tempel 1's nucleus. At the time of closest encounter, the spacecraft is expected to be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the comet's nucleus. The mission team expects to begin receiving images on the ground starting at around midnight PST (3 a.m. on Feb. 15 EST). Transmission of each image will take about 15 minutes. It will take about 10 hours to complete the transmission of all images and science data aboard the spacecraft.

Stardust streaked past the comet on Feb. 14 at 10.9 km/sec, or 24,000 MPH, and succeeded in briefly photographing the crater as it approached within 178 km (111 mi) during the fleeting moments of the probes closest approach. The intentional celestial collision in 2005 was designed to violently unleash the buried remnants of the early solar system into an enormous ejecta cloud of dusty debris that scientists could sift for clues to help unlock the secrets of how we all formed and evolved some 4.5 Billion Years ago. Tempel 1 is the first comet to receive a second visit by probes from Earth. Comets have continuously smashed into Earth over the eons and delivered vast quantities of key ingredients - such as water and organic molecules - that may have sparked the formation of life on the early Earth. NASA approved the use of the already orbiting Stardust-NExT spacecraft to follow up on the science discoveries by Deep Impact as the best and most economical way to try and locate the crater blast site, image new terrain and look for changes on the comets surface since the 2005 mission as the comet also completed another orbit around our Sun and eroded due to solar heating. The human made crater is about 150 meters wide and was formed by a 375 kilogram (800 pound) projectile propelled into the speeding path of Comet Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact mothership in 2005. Stardust-NExT took 72 high resolution science images of the comet during the Valentine's Day encounter flyby on Feb, 14 at 11:40 p.m. EST (8:40 p.m. PST). The probe absolutely had to be precisely navigated to exactly hit the aim point for sequencing the images to match the right moment in the erratic rotation of the volatile comet. The results of the Stardust-NExT mission were announced at a post encounter new briefing after most of the images and science data had streamed back to Earth. The science team and NASA said that all the mission objectives were accomplished. \"If you ask me was this mission 100 percent successful in terms of the science, I'd have to say no. It was 1000 percent successful!\" said Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., at the news briefing. \"We found the Deep Impact crater. We see erosion in comparison to 2005. So we do see changes. Erosion on the scale of 20 to 30 meters of material has occurred in the five or six years since we took the first picture. We are seeing a change, but we have to spend time quantifying the changes and understanding what they mean.\" \"We saw a lot of new territory. It's amazing with lots of layers. There is lots of surface sublimation. We had to arrive at precisely the right time in order to see new and old territory.\" \"We had monitored the comets rotation for several years. And we got the longitude almost perfect within 1 or 2 degrees,\" Veverka said. It took a few years of careful study to deduce the comets complex rotational patterns which change as the body orbits in a wide orbital path between Mars and Jupiter and is heated by the sun. Peter Schultz, a science team co-investigator agreed and showed the comparison images. \"We saw the crater,\" said Schultz, of University. \"It's subdued; it's about 150 meters across and has a small central mound in the center. It looks as if from the impact, the stuff went up and came back down. So we did get it, there's no doubt. I think one of the bottom-line messages is that this surface of the comet where we hit is very weak. It's fragile. So the crater partly healed itself.\" \"It was about the size we expected. But more subdued.\" The probes mission is almost complete since it has very little fuel left. The remaining science data from the flyby is being sent back and some outbound data is being collected. \"This spacecraft has logged over 3.5 billion miles since launch, and while its last close encounter is complete, its mission of discovery is not,\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at JPL. \"We'll continue imaging the comet as long as the science team can gain useful information, and then Stardust will get its well-deserved rest.\" Stardust-NExT is a repurposed spacecraft that has journeyed nearly 6 billion kilometers since it was launched in 1999. Initially christened as Stardust, the spaceships original task was to fly by Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It also collected priceless cometary dust particles from the coma which was safely parachuted back to Earth inside a return canister in 2006. High powered science analysis of the precious comet dust will help researchers discern the origin and evolution of our solar system. This was humanities first revisit to a comet and at a bargain basement price by using an old spacecraft already in space. \"The cost was just $29 Million dollars.

At first glance, the burn is something of an insignificant event. After all, the venerable spacecraft has executed 40 major flight path maneuvers since its 1999 launch, and between these main engines and the reaction control system, its rocket motors have collectively fired more than 2 million times. But the March 24 burn will be different from all others. This burn will effectively end the life of NASA's most traveled comet hunter. \"We call it a 'burn to depletion,' and that is pretty much what we're doing - firing our rockets until there is nothing left in the tank,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's a unique way for an interplanetary spacecraft to go out. Essentially, Stardust will be providing us useful information to the very end.\" Burn to depletion will answer the question about how much fuel Stardust had left in its tank. \"We'll take those data and compare them to what our estimates told us was left,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems program manager for Stardust-NExT. \"That will give us a better idea how valid our fuel consumption models are and make our predictions even more accurate for future missions.\" Fuel consumption models are necessary because no one has invented an entirely reliable fuel gauge for spacecraft. Until that day arrives, mission planners can approximate fuel usage by looking at the history of the vehicle's flight and how many times and for how long its rocket motors have fired. Stardust's burn to depletion is expected to impart valuable information, because the spacecraft has essentially been running on borrowed time - for some time. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust had already flown past an asteroid (Annefrank), flown past and collected particle samples from a comet (Wild 2), and returned those particles to Earth in a sample return capsule in January 2006 - and in so doing racked up 4.63 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles) on its odometer. NASA then re-tasked the still-healthy spacecraft to perform a flyby of comet Tempel 1, a new, low-cost mission that required another five years and 1.04 billion kilometers (646 million miles). After all those milestones and all that time logged on the spacecraft, the Stardust team knew the end was near. They just didn't know exactly how close. Prior to this final burn, Stardust will point its medium-gain antenna at Earth - some 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away. As there is no tomorrow for Stardust, the spacecraft is expected to downlink information on the burn as it happens. The command from the spacecraft computer ordering the rockets to fire will be sent for 45 minutes, but the burn is expected to last only between a couple of minutes to somewhat above 10 minutes. It is estimated the burn could accelerate the spacecraft anywhere from 2.5 to 35.2 meters per second (6 to 79 mph). \"What we think will happen is that when the fuel reaches a critically low level, gaseous helium will enter the thruster chambers,\" said Larson. \"The resulting thrust will be less than 10 percent of what was expected. While Stardust will continue to command its rocket engines to fire until the pre-planned firing time of 45 minutes has elapsed, the burn is essentially over.\" Twenty minutes after the engines run dry, the spacecraft's computer will command its transmitters off. They actively shut off their radios to preclude the remote chance that at some point down the road Stardust's transmitter could turn on and broadcast on a frequency being used by other operational spacecraft. Turning off the transmitter ensures that there will be no unintended radio interference in the future. Without fuel to power the spacecraft's attitude control system, Stardust's solar panels will not remain pointed at the sun. When this occurs, the spacecraft's batteries are expected to drain of power and deplete within hours. \"When we take into account all the possibilities for how long the burn could be and then the possible post-burn trajectories, we project that over the next 100 years, Stardust will not get any closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit, or within 13 million miles of Mars orbit,\" said Larson. \"That is far enough from protected targets to meet all of NASA's Planetary Protection directives. \" Some planetary spacecraft, like the Galileo mission to Jupiter, are intentionally sent into the planet's atmosphere to make sure it is destroyed in a controlled way. Others have their transmitters shut off or just fade away, said Larson. \"I think this is a fitting end for Stardust. It's going down swinging.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/news/stardust20110323.html"}, {"title": "R.I.P. Stardust: NASA Comet-Visiting Spacecraft Ends 12-Year Mission", "date": "2011-03-24", "content": "You could call it assisted suicide in space. NASA's comet-visiting Stardust spacecraft was purposely put to death today by those that had provided tender loving care to the probe for more than 12 years. After visiting two comets and traveling nearly 5.7 billion miles, the Stardust spacecraft is at journey's end. But even in its death throes, Stardust will yield valuable data for spacecraft engineers. Ground controllers commanded the spacecraft to fire up its four rocket thrusters one last time to use up its remaining fuel today. Engineers watched closely while the probe's propellant tank ran dry to help future missions gauge their fuel reserves more precisely. Stardust's demise comes after a long track record of scientific feats achieved by the Discovery-class mission. A tale of two comets\uff1a NASA launched Stardust in 1999 on a $300 million mission to snatch up the first samples of a comet. The probe flew by the asteroid 5535 Annefrank in November 2002 and later zipped by comet Wild 2 in January 2004, flying through the comet's coma and snagging particles from that object. Two years later, Stardust dutifully ejected its sample-carrying capsule to Earth, with that canister parachuting into the Utah Test and Training Range in the Utah desert. But the hard-working Stardust probe wasn't done yet. NASA recycled the spacecraft for a new $29 million mission to rendezvous with the comet Tempel 1 - a comet already visited by the agency's Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust flew by Tempel 1 on Feb. 14 - Valentine's Day - and snapped photos of the scar left behind by a Deep Impact probe that was intentionally crashed into the comet to determine its composition. But with those achievements behind it, it's time for Stardust to rest in peace. Bittersweet moment\uff1a Saying goodbye to Stardust was a bittersweet moment here at the Mission Support Area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"We call it the farewell maneuver,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust-NExT program manager at the aerospace firm. He gave the order to fire four thrusters on the probe until each ran dry. The burn was designed to exceed the spacecraft's capability to perform. To make sure Stardust didn't put up a fuss, specially-written software was uploaded that disabled the probe's fault protection system, allowing it to succumb self-execution style. Cheuvront told SPACE.com just how Stardust would react in its final moments as it obeyed end-of-life orders were difficult to forecast. Burn to depletion: Information gleaned from Stardust's sayonara, Cheuvront said, can assist currently flying spacecraft, such as Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now circling the red planet, as well as the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn. \"It will help provide a better predictor of when the fuel may go out. Then we have our future missions. Through better placement of pressure and temperature sensors perhaps we can improve our computer modeling,\" Cheuvront explained. In belching out all of its fuel, Stardust is also doomed as it drifts freely. The spacecraft's solar panels won't be sun-oriented and onboard batteries will slowly drain. As a NASA planetary protection requirement, Stardust controllers ran a series of trajectories based on different oomph factors created by the burn to depletion. Those studies have shown the now wayward, sun-orbiting spacecraft has no chance of running into a planet, particularly Mars, Cheuvront said. A NASA analysis predicts that Stardust will never get closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit and 13 million miles of Mars' orbit, mission managers have said. \"Stardust was commanded to turn its transmitter off and not turn it back on,\" Cheuvront said. As a 15-year veteran of Stardust moving from blueprint to spaceflight, he added: \"I've got an empty feeling now, knowing that we're not going to talk to it anymore.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11226-nasa-stardust-spacecraft-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Spacecraft Officially Ends Operations", "date": "2011-03-25", "content": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft sent its last transmission to Earth at 4:33 p.m. PDT (7:33 p.m. EDT) Thursday, March 24, shortly after depleting fuel and ceasing operations. During a 12-year period, the venerable spacecraft collected and returned comet material to Earth and was reused after the end of its prime mission in 2006 to observe and study another comet during February 2011. The Stardust team performed the burn to depletion because the comet hunter was literally running on fumes. The depletion maneuver command was sent from the Stardust-NExT mission control area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. The operation was designed to fire Stardust's rockets until no fuel remained in the tank or fuel lines. The spacecraft sent acknowledgment of its last command from approximately 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away in space. \"This is the end of the spacecraft's operations, but really just the beginnings of what this spacecraft's accomplishments will give to planetary science,\" said Lindley Johnson, Stardust-NExT and Discovery program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The treasure-trove of science data and engineering information collected and returned by Stardust is invaluable for planning future deep space planetary missions.\" After completion of the burn, mission personnel began comparing the computed amount of fuel consumed during the engine firing with the anticipated amount based on consumption models. The models are required to track fuel levels, because there are no fully reliable fuel gauges for spacecraft in the weightless environment of space. Mission planners use approximate fuel usage by reviewing the history of the vehicle's flight, how many times and how long its rocket motors fired. \"Stardust's motors burned for 146 seconds,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company program manager for Stardust-NExT in Denver. \"We'll crunch the numbers and see how close the reality matches up with our projections. That will be a great data set to have in our back pocket when we plan for future missions.\" Launched Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust flew past the asteroid named Annefrank and traveled halfway to Jupiter to collect the particle samples from the comet Wild 2. The spacecraft returned to Earth's vicinity to drop off a sample return capsule eagerly awaited by comet scientists. NASA re-tasked the spacecraft as Stardust-NExT to perform a bonus mission and fly past comet Tempel 1, which was struck by the Deep Impact mission in 2005. The mission collected images and other scientific data to compare with images of that comet collected by the Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust traveled approximately 21 million kilometers (13 million miles) around the sun in the weeks after the successful Tempel 1 flyby. The Stardust-NExT mission met all mission goals, and the spacecraft was extremely successful during both missions. From launch until final rocket engine burn, Stardust travelled approximately 5.69 billion kilometers (3.54 billion miles). After the mileage logged in space, the Stardust team knew the end was near for the spacecraft. With its fuel tank empty and final radio transmission concluded, history's most traveled comet hunter will move from NASA's active mission roster to retired. \"This kind of feels like the end of one of those old western movies where you watch the hero ride his horse towards the distant setting sun -- and then the credits begin to roll,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Only there's no setting sun in space.\" Stardust and Stardust-NExT missions were managed by JPL for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Launched Feb. 7, 1999, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., the Lockheed Martin-built Stardust spacecraft was the first U.S. mission dedicated to exploring a comet and the first robotic explorer designed to return sample material from beyond the orbit of the Moon, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which managed the mission. NASA's fourth Discovery-class mission, Stardust flew past the asteroid Annefrank and halfway to Jupiter to collect samples from the comet Wild 2. The spacecraft returned to Earth's vicinity in January 2006 to jettison a 57-kilogram canister containing the celestial specks to a landing site southwest of Salt Lake City. NASA then extended the mission and redesignated the spacecraft Stardust-NExT to perform a fly-by past the comet Tempel 1, where it snapped images of a crater blasted into the comet's surface during the Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust-NExT completed its extended mission in February.

The result, which was obtained by studying tiny granules of comet material sent back to Earth by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, should help astronomers better understand how comets form and evolve, researchers said. In particular, it shows that comets can get warm enough to melt the ice that makes up the bulk of their mass - which will likely come as a surprise to many scientists. \"Current thinking suggests that it is impossible to form liquid water inside of a comet,\" said study co-author Dante Lauretta, of the University of Arizona, in a statement. Peering at grains of Stardust: The researchers, led by graduate student Eve Berger of the University of Arizona, analyzed tiny particles of comet Wild 2. The Stardust probe scooped the grains up from Wild 2's coma - the diffuse cloud of material around its nucleus - on a close flyby of the comet in 2004, then sent the samples to Earth in a capsule two years later. After studying the comet dust using electron microscopy and X-ray analysis, the researchers found minerals that formed in the presence of liquid water. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History Comets spend most of their lives in the frigid depths of the outer solar system. So finding signs of liquid water inside the icy wanderers was unexpected. \"When the ice melted on Wild 2, the resulting warm water dissolved minerals that were present at the time and precipitated the iron and copper sulfide minerals we observed in our study,\" Lauretta said. \"The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200 degrees Celsius 122 and 392 degrees Fahrenheit, much warmer than the sub-zero temperatures predicted for the interior of a comet.\" The discovery will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. Learning more about comets: In addition to providing evidence of liquid water, the minerals put an upper limit on the temperatures Wild 2 experienced during its origin and history. For example, the researchers found one form of a copper iron sulfide mineral, called cubanite, that only exists below 210 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Such detailed thermal constraints will allow for detailed analysis of the role temperature played during the history of comet Wild 2,\" Lauretta said. Wild 2's interior could have warmed up in several different ways, researchers said. Minor collisions with other objects could have done the trick, for example, and radioactive decay of elements found throughout the comet could have as well. Comets are pieces left over from the solar system's youth - some of the stuff that didn't coalesce into the sun and planets. So learning more about comets' structure and evolution could shed light on the origins of the solar system, researchers said. The study also reinforces the fact that comets are active, changeable bodies - and that each one is likely different. \"What we found makes us look at comets in a different way,\" Lauretta said. \"We think they should be viewed as individual entities with their own unique geologic history.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11307-comet-samples-liquid-water-stardust.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft to fly by comet Tempel 1", "date": "2011-01-18", "content": "Although comets have been hurtling through the solar system since its earliest history 4.6 billion years ago, we know little about these ancient celestial wanderers. Scientists expect to learn a little more when a NASA spacecraft called Stardust flies to within 124 miles of the comet Tempel 1 on Valentine's Day. The encounter with the dark, spud-shaped behemoth - with a mass between 70 and 110 billion tons - will mark the first time that scientists can look for changes on a comet's surface caused by a close flyby of the sun. It also will be the first time that a comet has been revisited; in 2005, another NASA spacecraft recorded the collision of a projectile with Tempel 1. NASA is holding a news conference on Jan. 19, 2011, to discuss the upcoming Tempel 1 encounter. Peter Schultz, professor of geological sciences and a co-investigator on the mission, called Stardust-NExT, will be one of four panelists at the briefing. The briefing will be broadcast live beginning at 1 p.m. on NASA TV and streamed live on the agency's website. \"Tempel 1 has finished one tour of the solar system, from its closest approach to the sun just inside the orbit of Mars and then out to the orbit of Jupiter,\" Schultz said. \"So, this is just over one full year for this comet.\" During its flyby, the Stardust spacecraft is expected to obtain high-resolution images of Tempel 1's nucleus, or coma, an area that is usually heavily obscured by dust and gas. The spacecraft also will study, through various measurements, how a comet changes after it has completed two close flybys of the sun. Schultz, an expert in cometary impacts, is especially interested in seeing how the crater formed by the 2005 impact of Tempel 1 has changed the comet's nucleus. \"For the first time, we will have a look at how this comet has changed,\" Schultz said. \"Have features disappeared? Have new deposits formed?\" Comet clues: Due to their age, comets are believed to house debris dating back to the early history of the solar system, yet they remain among the most enigmatic bodies in our galactic neighborhood. Because they are composed of significant fractions of water ice, dust, and carbon-based compounds, some scientists think comets may have contributed some of the volatiles that make up our oceans and atmosphere. Some also think comets brought to Earth the complex molecules from which life arose. Little evidence has been gathered to support all the theories. Only in the last decade has NASA made a concerted effort to study comets. The first mission to study a comet, involving Stardust, was launched in 1999. There have been just five instances in which a spacecraft from Earth has imaged a comet close up. In November, Schultz and graduate student Brendan Hermalyn discussed results from another NASA spacecraft's fly-by of the Hartley 2 comet. That encounter was from 435 miles away, meaning that the Tempel 1 flyby will be more than two-thirds closer. \"We should see parts of the nucleus we haven't seen and document the processes that shape the comet's surface,\" Schultz noted. \"If we are lucky, we will also be able to see what happened to the crater. This is like sticking our thumb in the sand on Earth and checking what happens after one year.\"", "url": "https://news.brown.edu/articles/2011/01/stardust"}, {"title": "NASA Sets Valentine's Day Date With Comet", "date": "2011-01-19", "content": "An aging NASA spacecraft is gearing up for its last hurrah - a Valentine's Day rendezvous with a comet visited, and slammed, by another probe five years ago. The Stardust-NExT spacecraft is set for a close flyby of comet Tempel 1 at around 11:37 p.m. EST on Feb. 14. The main goal is to see how much Tempel 1 has changed since July 2005, when NASA's Deep Impact probe flew by the icy wanderer and sent an impactor smashing into it, creating a crater. \"Now, with going back, we'll be able to take a look at the surface and see what's changed,\" Pete Schultz, a Stardust-NExT scientist from Brown University, told reporters today. Repurposed spacecraft: The Stardust-NExT probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999. It accomplished its primary mission - to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth in a return canister - back in 2006. Since the spacecraft was in good shape and had enough fuel, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007: to meet up with comet Tempel 1. With the new mission came an expanded name: Stardust-NExT. The 3.7-mile-wide comet completes an orbit of the sun every 5.5 years, so it has circled the sun once since Deep Impact's visit. Researchers hope Stardust-NExT will give them an idea of how Tempel 1 has changed during this time. \"We're going to find out a lot about how comets evolve from perihelion passage to perihelion passage,\" said mission scientist Steve Chesley of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Perihelion passage\" describes an orbiting object's closest approach to the sun. Peering at Deep Impact's crater: The Deep Impact probe couldn't get a good look at what its 816-pound impactor, traveling at 6.2 miles per second, did to the comet surface in 2005; the ejected dust and stirred-up debris obscured the views of the new crater. Stardust-NExT researchers hope the Feb. 14 rendezvous reveals the crater, though they said the probe's mission could be considered a success even if that didn't work out. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History \"We should be able to resolve the impact,\" Schultz said. \"I really hope we get to see the impact crater, but that's going to be a bonus.\" Getting a good look at the crater could reveal a great deal about Tempel 1's makeup, according to Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University. That knowledge could help plan out future missions to return samples from a comet's surface. Such missions could help researchers determine the likelihood that comets provided the raw materials for life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the universe, Veverka added. \"It's a step toward the ultimate answer,\" Veverka said. Lots of miles on the odometer: Stardust-NExT has already logged about 3.7 billion miles in space, researchers said, and it will put a few more on its odometer before calling it quits. The spacecraft is currently about 15 million miles from Tempel 1. It will close to about 124 miles on the night of Feb. 14. The probe will take 72 high-resolution images and begin transmitting them to Earth an hour after the flyby, researchers said. It will take about 12 hours for all the pictures to reach researchers on the ground. When the flyby is done, the spacecraft's work will be, too. It won't have enough fuel left to do much else, researchers said. But Stardust-NExT should go out on a high note. \"The spacecraft is working wonderfully well,\" Veverka said. \"The science team is awfully excited and can't wait to see all the pictures.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/10649-stardust-comet-tempel1-preview.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Adjusts Flight Path for Comet Meetup", "date": "2011-02-01", "content": "Just over two weeks before its flyby of comet Tempel 1, NASA's Stardust spacecraft fired its thrusters to help refine its flight path toward the comet.

The spacecraft has traveled more than 3.5 billion miles since launch.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/stardust-celebrates-twelve-years-with-rocket-burn"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Photographs Comet in Valentine's Day Flyby", "date": "2011-02-14", "content": "A NASA spacecraft zipped close by comet Tempel 1 late last night, keeping a cosmic date that wrapped up an out-of-this-world Valentine's Day. The Stardust-NExT probe flew to within 112 miles of the comet at 11:39 p.m. EST, snapping photos and making measurements all the while. It took mission scientists until midnight EST to confirm the successful encounter because of the communications lag between the probe and Earth. The spacecraft's high-resolution images began arriving on scientists' computers around 3:55 a.m. EST today. Researchers had wanted the first photos to bracket the spacecraft's closest approach, but a glitch prevented that from happening. The first Tempel 1 pictures scientists saw were the first ones Stardust-NExT took during the rendezvous, when it was about 1,600 miles away from the comet. The closest-approach photos will roll in, officials said - it'll just take a few more hours than expected. \"They're not lost, and the targeting is quite good,\" said Chris Jones, associate director for flight projects and mission success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a second look at Tempel 1: Comet Tempel 1 is no stranger to robotic visitors from Earth. In July 2005, another NASA probe, known as Deep Impact, smashed an 800-pound impactor into Tempel 1 to study the comet's composition. The 3.7-mile-wide Tempel 1 has an orbital period of 5 1/2 years, so it had made one trip around the sun since Deep Impact's visit. Stardust-NExT's main mission is to help scientists learn how much the comet has changed during this time. Researchers also hope to get a good look at the crater Deep Impact pounded out of the surface; the Deep Impact probe was not able to see it well through the huge cloud of debris ejected from the blow. Another aim of the Stardust-NExT mission is to extend geologic mapping of Tempel 1's surface, adding to the work done by Deep Impact. \"We've never gone back to a comet,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate. \"This is the first time in human history that we've had that opportunity.\" Through these and other observations, Stardust-NExT can contribute to scientists' understanding of how comets formed at the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and how they have evolved, researchers have said. The flyby: After more than three years of preparation, Stardust-NExT - streaking through space at about 24,300 mph - approached the comet and snapped 72 high-resolution images. The probe began beaming its photos back to Earth about four hours after the closest approach. Researchers expected the first photos they received to be the five taken when Stardust-NExT was closest to Tempel 1. But for reasons that remain mysterious at the moment, the craft instead sent its pictures in the order in which they were taken. \"They represent the approach sequence,\" Jones said. \"We still don't understand fully why this didn't work as planned.\" The problem is a glitch, not a disaster. Stardust-NExT didn't lose any pictures; the best ones will just take a little longer to reach scientists' computers. NASA had scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. EST today to discuss the flyby and some early science results. But that has been postponed until 4 p.m. EST at the earliest, officials said, to give scientists time to analyze the closest-approach photos. At this stage, all indications are that the rendezvous was a success, and excitement flowed through mission control at JPL as updates came in from the spacecraft. \"Everything is working wonderfully well,\" said Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Stardust-NExT principal investigator. Recycled spacecraft This was not Stardust-NExT's first comet rodeo. The probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999 on a mission to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth. Stardust completed that mission when its return canister landed in the Utah desert in 2006. Since the orbiting spacecraft was still in good shape and had a fair bit of fuel left, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007 - to rendezvous with Tempel 1. The probe was rechristened Stardust-NExT. The bonus mission is a bargain, NASA officials have said, since it takes advantage of an asset already in space. It cost about $300 million to launch and operate Stardust through the end of its mission. Stardust-NExT's total cost, on the other hand, should be $29 million. Stardust-NExT is a survivor, having already logged about 3.5 billion miles in space. But this should be the last comet encounter for the probe, since it has probably burned up almost all of its remaining fuel chasing down Tempel 1, researchers said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/10858-nasa-valentines-comet-success.html"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Hours From Comet Encounter", "date": "2011-02-14", "content": "As of today, Feb. 14, at 9:21 a.m. PST (12:21 p.m. EST), NASA's Stardust-NExT mission spacecraft is within a quarter-million miles (402,336 kilometers) of its quarry, comet Tempel 1, which it will fly by tonight. The spacecraft is cutting the distance with the comet at a rate of about 10.9 kilometers per second (6.77 miles per second or 24,000 mph). The flyby of Tempel 1 will give scientists an opportunity to look for changes on the comet's surface since it was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft in July 2005. Since then, Tempel 1 has completed one orbit of the sun, and scientists are looking forward to discovering any differences in the comet. The closest approach is expected tonight at approximately 8:40 p.m. PST (11:40 p.m. EST). During the encounter phase, the spacecraft will carry out many important milestones in short order and automatically, as the spacecraft is too far away to receive timely updates from Earth. These milestones include turning the spacecraft to point its protective shields between it and the anticipated direction from which cometary particles would approach. Another milestone will occur at about four minutes to closest approach, when the spacecraft will begin science imaging of the comet's nucleus. The nominal imaging sequence will run for about eight minutes. The spacecraft's onboard memory is limited to 72 high-resolution images, so the imaging will be most closely spaced around the time of closest approach for best-resolution coverage of Tempel 1's nucleus. At the time of closest encounter, the spacecraft is expected to be approximately 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the comet's nucleus. The mission team expects to begin receiving images on the ground starting at around midnight PST (3 a.m. on Feb. 15 EST). Transmission of each image will take about 15 minutes. It will take about 10 hours to complete the transmission of all images and science data aboard the spacecraft. Live coverage on NASA TV and via the Internet begins at 8:30 p.m. PST (11:30 p.m. EST) from mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

Stardust streaked past the comet on Feb. 14 at 10.9 km/sec, or 24,000 MPH, and succeeded in briefly photographing the crater as it approached within 178 km (111 mi) during the fleeting moments of the probes closest approach. The intentional celestial collision in 2005 was designed to violently unleash the buried remnants of the early solar system into an enormous ejecta cloud of dusty debris that scientists could sift for clues to help unlock the secrets of how we all formed and evolved some 4.5 Billion Years ago. Tempel 1 is the first comet to receive a second visit by probes from Earth. Comets have continuously smashed into Earth over the eons and delivered vast quantities of key ingredients - such as water and organic molecules - that may have sparked the formation of life on the early Earth. NASA approved the use of the already orbiting Stardust-NExT spacecraft to follow up on the science discoveries by Deep Impact as the best and most economical way to try and locate the crater blast site, image new terrain and look for changes on the comets surface since the 2005 mission as the comet also completed another orbit around our Sun and eroded due to solar heating. The human made crater is about 150 meters wide and was formed by a 375 kilogram (800 pound) projectile propelled into the speeding path of Comet Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact mothership in 2005. Stardust-NExT took 72 high resolution science images of the comet during the Valentine's Day encounter flyby on Feb, 14 at 11:40 p.m. EST (8:40 p.m. PST). The probe absolutely had to be precisely navigated to exactly hit the aim point for sequencing the images to match the right moment in the erratic rotation of the volatile comet. The results of the Stardust-NExT mission were announced at a post encounter new briefing after most of the images and science data had streamed back to Earth. The science team and NASA said that all the mission objectives were accomplished. \"If you ask me was this mission 100 percent successful in terms of the science, I'd have to say no. It was 1000 percent successful!\" said Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., at the news briefing. \"We found the Deep Impact crater. We see erosion in comparison to 2005. So we do see changes. Erosion on the scale of 20 to 30 meters of material has occurred in the five or six years since we took the first picture. We are seeing a change, but we have to spend time quantifying the changes and understanding what they mean.\" \"We saw a lot of new territory. It's amazing with lots of layers. There is lots of surface sublimation. We had to arrive at precisely the right time in order to see new and old territory.\" \"We had monitored the comets rotation for several years. And we got the longitude almost perfect within 1 or 2 degrees,\" Veverka said. It took a few years of careful study to deduce the comets complex rotational patterns which change as the body orbits in a wide orbital path between Mars and Jupiter and is heated by the sun. Peter Schultz, a science team co-investigator agreed and showed the comparison images. \"We saw the crater,\" said Schultz, of University. \"It's subdued; it's about 150 meters across and has a small central mound in the center. It looks as if from the impact, the stuff went up and came back down. So we did get it, there's no doubt. I think one of the bottom-line messages is that this surface of the comet where we hit is very weak. It's fragile. So the crater partly healed itself.\" \"It was about the size we expected. But more subdued.\" The probes mission is almost complete since it has very little fuel left. The remaining science data from the flyby is being sent back and some outbound data is being collected. \"This spacecraft has logged over 3.5 billion miles since launch, and while its last close encounter is complete, its mission of discovery is not,\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at JPL. \"We'll continue imaging the comet as long as the science team can gain useful information, and then Stardust will get its well-deserved rest.\" Stardust-NExT is a repurposed spacecraft that has journeyed nearly 6 billion kilometers since it was launched in 1999. Initially christened as Stardust, the spaceships original task was to fly by Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It also collected priceless cometary dust particles from the coma which was safely parachuted back to Earth inside a return canister in 2006. High powered science analysis of the precious comet dust will help researchers discern the origin and evolution of our solar system. This was humanities first revisit to a comet and at a bargain basement price by using an old spacecraft already in space. \"The cost was just $29 Million dollars. A new Discovery class mission costs $300 to 500 Million.

At first glance, the burn is something of an insignificant event. After all, the venerable spacecraft has executed 40 major flight path maneuvers since its 1999 launch, and between these main engines and the reaction control system, its rocket motors have collectively fired more than 2 million times. But the March 24 burn will be different from all others. This burn will effectively end the life of NASA's most traveled comet hunter. \"We call it a 'burn to depletion,' and that is pretty much what we're doing - firing our rockets until there is nothing left in the tank,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's a unique way for an interplanetary spacecraft to go out. Essentially, Stardust will be providing us useful information to the very end.\" Burn to depletion will answer the question about how much fuel Stardust had left in its tank. \"We'll take those data and compare them to what our estimates told us was left,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems program manager for Stardust-NExT. \"That will give us a better idea how valid our fuel consumption models are and make our predictions even more accurate for future missions.\" Fuel consumption models are necessary because no one has invented an entirely reliable fuel gauge for spacecraft. Until that day arrives, mission planners can approximate fuel usage by looking at the history of the vehicle's flight and how many times and for how long its rocket motors have fired. Stardust's burn to depletion is expected to impart valuable information, because the spacecraft has essentially been running on borrowed time - for some time. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust had already flown past an asteroid (Annefrank), flown past and collected particle samples from a comet (Wild 2), and returned those particles to Earth in a sample return capsule in January 2006 - and in so doing racked up 4.63 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles) on its odometer. NASA then re-tasked the still-healthy spacecraft to perform a flyby of comet Tempel 1, a new, low-cost mission that required another five years and 1.04 billion kilometers (646 million miles). After all those milestones and all that time logged on the spacecraft, the Stardust team knew the end was near. They just didn't know exactly how close. Prior to this final burn, Stardust will point its medium-gain antenna at Earth - some 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away. As there is no tomorrow for Stardust, the spacecraft is expected to downlink information on the burn as it happens. The command from the spacecraft computer ordering the rockets to fire will be sent for 45 minutes, but the burn is expected to last only between a couple of minutes to somewhat above 10 minutes. It is estimated the burn could accelerate the spacecraft anywhere from 2.5 to 35.2 meters per second (6 to 79 mph). \"What we think will happen is that when the fuel reaches a critically low level, gaseous helium will enter the thruster chambers,\" said Larson. \"The resulting thrust will be less than 10 percent of what was expected. While Stardust will continue to command its rocket engines to fire until the pre-planned firing time of 45 minutes has elapsed, the burn is essentially over.\" Twenty minutes after the engines run dry, the spacecraft's computer will command its transmitters off. They actively shut off their radios to preclude the remote chance that at some point down the road Stardust's transmitter could turn on and broadcast on a frequency being used by other operational spacecraft. Turning off the transmitter ensures that there will be no unintended radio interference in the future. Without fuel to power the spacecraft's attitude control system, Stardust's solar panels will not remain pointed at the sun. When this occurs, the spacecraft's batteries are expected to drain of power and deplete within hours. \"When we take into account all the possibilities for how long the burn could be and then the possible post-burn trajectories, we project that over the next 100 years, Stardust will not get any closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit, or within 13 million miles of Mars orbit,\" said Larson. \"That is far enough from protected targets to meet all of NASA's Planetary Protection directives. \" Some planetary spacecraft, like the Galileo mission to Jupiter, are intentionally sent into the planet's atmosphere to make sure it is destroyed in a controlled way. Others have their transmitters shut off or just fade away, said Larson. \"I think this is a fitting end for Stardust. It's going down swinging.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stardust/news/stardust20110323.html"}, {"title": "R.I.P. Stardust: NASA Comet-Visiting Spacecraft Ends 12-Year Mission", "date": "2011-03-24", "content": "You could call it assisted suicide in space. NASA's comet-visiting Stardust spacecraft was purposely put to death today by those that had provided tender loving care to the probe for more than 12 years. After visiting two comets and traveling nearly 5.7 billion miles, the Stardust spacecraft is at journey's end. But even in its death throes, Stardust will yield valuable data for spacecraft engineers. Ground controllers commanded the spacecraft to fire up its four rocket thrusters one last time to use up its remaining fuel today. Engineers watched closely while the probe's propellant tank ran dry to help future missions gauge their fuel reserves more precisely. Stardust's demise comes after a long track record of scientific feats achieved by the Discovery-class mission. A tale of two comets\uff1a NASA launched Stardust in 1999 on a $300 million mission to snatch up the first samples of a comet. The probe flew by the asteroid 5535 Annefrank in November 2002 and later zipped by comet Wild 2 in January 2004, flying through the comet's coma and snagging particles from that object. Two years later, Stardust dutifully ejected its sample-carrying capsule to Earth, with that canister parachuting into the Utah Test and Training Range in the Utah desert. But the hard-working Stardust probe wasn't done yet. NASA recycled the spacecraft for a new $29 million mission to rendezvous with the comet Tempel 1 - a comet already visited by the agency's Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust flew by Tempel 1 on Feb. 14 - Valentine's Day - and snapped photos of the scar left behind by a Deep Impact probe that was intentionally crashed into the comet to determine its composition. But with those achievements behind it, it's time for Stardust to rest in peace. Bittersweet moment\uff1a Saying goodbye to Stardust was a bittersweet moment here at the Mission Support Area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"We call it the farewell maneuver,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust-NExT program manager at the aerospace firm. He gave the order to fire four thrusters on the probe until each ran dry. The burn was designed to exceed the spacecraft's capability to perform. To make sure Stardust didn't put up a fuss, specially-written software was uploaded that disabled the probe's fault protection system, allowing it to succumb self-execution style. Cheuvront told SPACE.com just how Stardust would react in its final moments as it obeyed end-of-life orders were difficult to forecast. Burn to depletion: Information gleaned from Stardust's sayonara, Cheuvront said, can assist currently flying spacecraft, such as Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now circling the red planet, as well as the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn. \"It will help provide a better predictor of when the fuel may go out. Then we have our future missions. Through better placement of pressure and temperature sensors perhaps we can improve our computer modeling,\" Cheuvront explained. In belching out all of its fuel, Stardust is also doomed as it drifts freely. The spacecraft's solar panels won't be sun-oriented and onboard batteries will slowly drain. As a NASA planetary protection requirement, Stardust controllers ran a series of trajectories based on different oomph factors created by the burn to depletion. Those studies have shown the now wayward, sun-orbiting spacecraft has no chance of running into a planet, particularly Mars, Cheuvront said. A NASA analysis predicts that Stardust will never get closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit and 13 million miles of Mars' orbit, mission managers have said. \"Stardust was commanded to turn its transmitter off and not turn it back on,\" Cheuvront said. As a 15-year veteran of Stardust moving from blueprint to spaceflight, he added: \"I've got an empty feeling now, knowing that we're not going to talk to it anymore.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11226-nasa-stardust-spacecraft-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Spacecraft Officially Ends Operations", "date": "2011-03-25", "content": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft sent its last transmission to Earth at 4:33 p.m. PDT (7:33 p.m. EDT) Thursday, March 24, shortly after depleting fuel and ceasing operations. During a 12-year period, the venerable spacecraft collected and returned comet material to Earth and was reused after the end of its prime mission in 2006 to observe and study another comet during February 2011. The Stardust team performed the burn to depletion because the comet hunter was literally running on fumes. The depletion maneuver command was sent from the Stardust-NExT mission control area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. The operation was designed to fire Stardust's rockets until no fuel remained in the tank or fuel lines. The spacecraft sent acknowledgment of its last command from approximately 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away in space. \"This is the end of the spacecraft's operations, but really just the beginnings of what this spacecraft's accomplishments will give to planetary science,\" said Lindley Johnson, Stardust-NExT and Discovery program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The treasure-trove of science data and engineering information collected and returned by Stardust is invaluable for planning future deep space planetary missions.\" After completion of the burn, mission personnel began comparing the computed amount of fuel consumed during the engine firing with the anticipated amount based on consumption models. The models are required to track fuel levels, because there are no fully reliable fuel gauges for spacecraft in the weightless environment of space. Mission planners use approximate fuel usage by reviewing the history of the vehicle's flight, how many times and how long its rocket motors fired. \"Stardust's motors burned for 146 seconds,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company program manager for Stardust-NExT in Denver. \"We'll crunch the numbers and see how close the reality matches up with our projections. That will be a great data set to have in our back pocket when we plan for future missions.\" Launched Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust flew past the asteroid named Annefrank and traveled halfway to Jupiter to collect the particle samples from the comet Wild 2. The spacecraft returned to Earth's vicinity to drop off a sample return capsule eagerly awaited by comet scientists. NASA re-tasked the spacecraft as Stardust-NExT to perform a bonus mission and fly past comet Tempel 1, which was struck by the Deep Impact mission in 2005. The mission collected images and other scientific data to compare with images of that comet collected by the Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust traveled approximately 21 million kilometers (13 million miles) around the sun in the weeks after the successful Tempel 1 flyby. The Stardust-NExT mission met all mission goals, and the spacecraft was extremely successful during both missions.

After traveling some 5.7 billion kilometers, the spacecraft sent acknowledgment of its last command from approximately 310 million kilometers away in space. \"This is the end of the spacecraft's operations, but really just the beginnings of what this spacecraft's accomplishments will give to planetary science,\" Lindley Johnson, Stardust-NExT and Discovery program executive at NASA headquarters in Washington, said in a March 25 agency news release. \"The treasure-trove of science data and engineering information collected and returned by Stardust is invaluable for planning future deep space planetary missions.\"", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-stardust-mission-ends-after-12-years/"}, {"title": "Comet Samples Reveal Surprising Signs of Liquid Water", "date": "2011-04-06", "content": "Scientists have found convincing evidence of liquid water inside a comet for the first time ever, according to a new study. The result, which was obtained by studying tiny granules of comet material sent back to Earth by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, should help astronomers better understand how comets form and evolve, researchers said. In particular, it shows that comets can get warm enough to melt the ice that makes up the bulk of their mass - which will likely come as a surprise to many scientists. \"Current thinking suggests that it is impossible to form liquid water inside of a comet,\" said study co-author Dante Lauretta, of the University of Arizona, in a statement. Peering at grains of Stardust: The researchers, led by graduate student Eve Berger of the University of Arizona, analyzed tiny particles of comet Wild 2. The Stardust probe scooped the grains up from Wild 2's coma - the diffuse cloud of material around its nucleus - on a close flyby of the comet in 2004, then sent the samples to Earth in a capsule two years later. After studying the comet dust using electron microscopy and X-ray analysis, the researchers found minerals that formed in the presence of liquid water. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History Comets spend most of their lives in the frigid depths of the outer solar system. So finding signs of liquid water inside the icy wanderers was unexpected. \"When the ice melted on Wild 2, the resulting warm water dissolved minerals that were present at the time and precipitated the iron and copper sulfide minerals we observed in our study,\" Lauretta said. \"The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200 degrees Celsius 122 and 392 degrees Fahrenheit, much warmer than the sub-zero temperatures predicted for the interior of a comet.\" The discovery will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. Learning more about comets: In addition to providing evidence of liquid water, the minerals put an upper limit on the temperatures Wild 2 experienced during its origin and history. For example, the researchers found one form of a copper iron sulfide mineral, called cubanite, that only exists below 210 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Such detailed thermal constraints will allow for detailed analysis of the role temperature played during the history of comet Wild 2,\" Lauretta said. Wild 2's interior could have warmed up in several different ways, researchers said. Minor collisions with other objects could have done the trick, for example, and radioactive decay of elements found throughout the comet could have as well. Comets are pieces left over from the solar system's youth - some of the stuff that didn't coalesce into the sun and planets. So learning more about comets' structure and evolution could shed light on the origins of the solar system, researchers said. The study also reinforces the fact that comets are active, changeable bodies - and that each one is likely different. \"What we found makes us look at comets in a different way,\" Lauretta said. \"We think they should be viewed as individual entities with their own unique geologic history.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11307-comet-samples-liquid-water-stardust.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA Stardust Adjusts Flight Path for Comet Meetup", "date": "2011-02-01", "content": "Just over two weeks before its flyby of comet Tempel 1, NASA's Stardust spacecraft fired its thrusters to help refine its flight path toward the comet.

The trajectory correction maneuver, which adjusts the spacecraft's flight path, began at about 4 p.m. EST (1:00 p.m. PST) on Monday, Jan. 31. The Stardust spacecraft's rockets fired for 130 seconds, consumed about 300 grams (10.6 ounces) of fuel and changed the spacecraft's speed by 2.6 meters per second (about 5.8 mph). \"An almost six-miles-per-hour change may seem insignificant when we're closing in on the comet at 24,236 miles per hour [39,000 kilometers per hour],\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"But we're still two weeks and 8.37 million miles [13.5 million kilometers] away from the comet. At that distance, our burn will move our location at time of closest approach to the comet by almost 1,900 miles [3,058 kilometers]. By observing the results of these planned maneuvers and making further rocket burns, that's how we get a spacecraft to be where we want it, when it's on the other side of the solar system.\" NASA's plan for the Stardust-NExT mission is to fly the spacecraft to target a point in space about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from comet Tempel 1 at the time of its closest approach - about 8:56 p.m. PST on Feb. 14 (11:56 p.m. EST). This is a bonus mission for the comet chaser, which previously flew past comet Wild 2 and returned particles from its coma to Earth. During this bonus encounter, the spacecraft will take images of the comet's surface to observe what changes have occurred since a NASA spacecraft last visited.

Along with the high-resolution images of the comet's surface, Stardust-NExT will also measure the composition, size distribution and flux of dust emitted into the coma, and provide important new information on how Jupiter-family comets evolve and how they formed 4.6 billion years ago. A Jupiter-family comet is a comet whose orbit has been modified by close passages to Jupiter. They have orbital periods less than 20 years. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust became the first spacecraft in history to collect samples from a comet (Wild 2), and return them to Earth for study. While its sample return capsule parachuted to Earth in January 2006, mission controllers were placing the still-viable spacecraft on a path that would allow NASA the opportunity to re-use the already-proven flight system if a target of opportunity presented itself. In January 2007, NASA re-christened the mission \"Stardust-NExT\" (New Exploration of Tempel), and the Stardust team began a four-and-a-half year journey for the spacecraft to comet Tempel 1.

The space agency's Stardust-NExT mission is just one week away from zooming by the comet Tempel 1 Feb. 14 to see what's new since the comet was last visited by a spacecraft in July 2005. Comet Tempel 1 is a ball of ice and rock that orbits the sun every 5 1/2 years. Scientists say the spacecraft is on track for next week's encounter after firing its thrusters last week to refine its path. \"Encountering something as small and fast as a comet in the vastness of space is always a challenge, but we are very pleased with how things are setting up for our Valentine's Day flyby,\" Joe Veverka, a Cornell University researcher and principal investigator for the mission, said in a statement. The Stardust spacecraft snapped its first photos of Tempel 1 Jan. 18-19 from distances of 16.3 million miles, and 15.8 million miles, respectively. \"This is the first of many images to come of comet Tempel 1,\" Veverka said. The upcoming rendezvous is a bonus mission for the Stardust spacecraft, which completed its primary goal in 2006 when it flew past comet Wild 2 and sent a sample of particles from its coma to Earth.

Tempel 1 was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft, which deliberately sent one of its components crashing into the comet, then took photographs of the cloud of debris that spewed out from the impact. The mission was unable to get clear pictures of the newly formed crater because the dust cloud obscured the view. NASA hopes to complete that unfinished business by imaging the crater with Stardust-NExT.

The Stardust-NExT probe flew to within 112 miles of the comet at 11:39 p.m. EST, snapping photos and making measurements all the while. It took mission scientists until midnight EST to confirm the successful encounter because of the communications lag between the probe and Earth. The spacecraft's high-resolution images began arriving on scientists' computers around 3:55 a.m. EST today. Researchers had wanted the first photos to bracket the spacecraft's closest approach, but a glitch prevented that from happening. The first Tempel 1 pictures scientists saw were the first ones Stardust-NExT took during the rendezvous, when it was about 1,600 miles away from the comet. The closest-approach photos will roll in, officials said - it'll just take a few more hours than expected. \"They're not lost, and the targeting is quite good,\" said Chris Jones, associate director for flight projects and mission success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Getting a second look at Tempel 1: Comet Tempel 1 is no stranger to robotic visitors from Earth. In July 2005, another NASA probe, known as Deep Impact, smashed an 800-pound impactor into Tempel 1 to study the comet's composition. The 3.7-mile-wide Tempel 1 has an orbital period of 5 1/2 years, so it had made one trip around the sun since Deep Impact's visit. Stardust-NExT's main mission is to help scientists learn how much the comet has changed during this time. Researchers also hope to get a good look at the crater Deep Impact pounded out of the surface; the Deep Impact probe was not able to see it well through the huge cloud of debris ejected from the blow. Another aim of the Stardust-NExT mission is to extend geologic mapping of Tempel 1's surface, adding to the work done by Deep Impact. \"We've never gone back to a comet,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate. \"This is the first time in human history that we've had that opportunity.\" Through these and other observations, Stardust-NExT can contribute to scientists' understanding of how comets formed at the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and how they have evolved, researchers have said. The flyby: After more than three years of preparation, Stardust-NExT - streaking through space at about 24,300 mph - approached the comet and snapped 72 high-resolution images. The probe began beaming its photos back to Earth about four hours after the closest approach. Researchers expected the first photos they received to be the five taken when Stardust-NExT was closest to Tempel 1. But for reasons that remain mysterious at the moment, the craft instead sent its pictures in the order in which they were taken. \"They represent the approach sequence,\" Jones said. \"We still don't understand fully why this didn't work as planned.\" The problem is a glitch, not a disaster. Stardust-NExT didn't lose any pictures; the best ones will just take a little longer to reach scientists' computers. NASA had scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. EST today to discuss the flyby and some early science results. But that has been postponed until 4 p.m. EST at the earliest, officials said, to give scientists time to analyze the closest-approach photos. At this stage, all indications are that the rendezvous was a success, and excitement flowed through mission control at JPL as updates came in from the spacecraft. \"Everything is working wonderfully well,\" said Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Stardust-NExT principal investigator. Recycled spacecraft This was not Stardust-NExT's first comet rodeo. The probe began its life as the Stardust spacecraft, which launched in February 1999 on a mission to collect dust and gas from around comet Wild 2 and send the sample back to Earth. Stardust completed that mission when its return canister landed in the Utah desert in 2006. Since the orbiting spacecraft was still in good shape and had a fair bit of fuel left, NASA gave it a new mission in 2007 - to rendezvous with Tempel 1. The probe was rechristened Stardust-NExT. The bonus mission is a bargain, NASA officials have said, since it takes advantage of an asset already in space. It cost about $300 million to launch and operate Stardust through the end of its mission. Stardust-NExT's total cost, on the other hand, should be $29 million. Stardust-NExT is a survivor, having already logged about 3.5 billion miles in space. But this should be the last comet encounter for the probe, since it has probably burned up almost all of its remaining fuel chasing down Tempel 1, researchers said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/10858-nasa-valentines-comet-success.html"}, {"title": "NASA Spacecraft Hours From Comet Encounter", "date": "2011-02-14", "content": "As of today, Feb. 14, at 9:21 a.m. PST (12:21 p.m. EST), NASA's Stardust-NExT mission spacecraft is within a quarter-million miles (402,336 kilometers) of its quarry, comet Tempel 1, which it will fly by tonight. The spacecraft is cutting the distance with the comet at a rate of about 10.9 kilometers per second (6.77 miles per second or 24,000 mph). The flyby of Tempel 1 will give scientists an opportunity to look for changes on the comet's surface since it was visited by NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft in July 2005. Since then, Tempel 1 has completed one orbit of the sun, and scientists are looking forward to discovering any differences in the comet. The closest approach is expected tonight at approximately 8:40 p.m. PST (11:40 p.m. EST). During the encounter phase, the spacecraft will carry out many important milestones in short order and automatically, as the spacecraft is too far away to receive timely updates from Earth. These milestones include turning the spacecraft to point its protective shields between it and the anticipated direction from which cometary particles would approach. Another milestone will occur at about four minutes to closest approach, when the spacecraft will begin science imaging of the comet's nucleus. The nominal imaging sequence will run for about eight minutes. The spacecraft's onboard memory is limited to 72 high-resolution images, so the imaging will be most closely spaced around the time of closest approach for best-resolution coverage of Tempel 1's nucleus.

Stardust streaked past the comet on Feb. 14 at 10.9 km/sec, or 24,000 MPH, and succeeded in briefly photographing the crater as it approached within 178 km (111 mi) during the fleeting moments of the probes closest approach. The intentional celestial collision in 2005 was designed to violently unleash the buried remnants of the early solar system into an enormous ejecta cloud of dusty debris that scientists could sift for clues to help unlock the secrets of how we all formed and evolved some 4.5 Billion Years ago. Tempel 1 is the first comet to receive a second visit by probes from Earth. Comets have continuously smashed into Earth over the eons and delivered vast quantities of key ingredients - such as water and organic molecules - that may have sparked the formation of life on the early Earth. NASA approved the use of the already orbiting Stardust-NExT spacecraft to follow up on the science discoveries by Deep Impact as the best and most economical way to try and locate the crater blast site, image new terrain and look for changes on the comets surface since the 2005 mission as the comet also completed another orbit around our Sun and eroded due to solar heating. The human made crater is about 150 meters wide and was formed by a 375 kilogram (800 pound) projectile propelled into the speeding path of Comet Tempel 1 by the Deep Impact mothership in 2005. Stardust-NExT took 72 high resolution science images of the comet during the Valentine's Day encounter flyby on Feb, 14 at 11:40 p.m. EST (8:40 p.m. PST). The probe absolutely had to be precisely navigated to exactly hit the aim point for sequencing the images to match the right moment in the erratic rotation of the volatile comet. The results of the Stardust-NExT mission were announced at a post encounter new briefing after most of the images and science data had streamed back to Earth. The science team and NASA said that all the mission objectives were accomplished. \"If you ask me was this mission 100 percent successful in terms of the science, I'd have to say no. It was 1000 percent successful!\" said Stardust-NExT principal investigator Joe Veverka of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., at the news briefing. \"We found the Deep Impact crater. We see erosion in comparison to 2005. So we do see changes. Erosion on the scale of 20 to 30 meters of material has occurred in the five or six years since we took the first picture. We are seeing a change, but we have to spend time quantifying the changes and understanding what they mean.\" \"We saw a lot of new territory. It's amazing with lots of layers. There is lots of surface sublimation. We had to arrive at precisely the right time in order to see new and old territory.\" \"We had monitored the comets rotation for several years. And we got the longitude almost perfect within 1 or 2 degrees,\" Veverka said. It took a few years of careful study to deduce the comets complex rotational patterns which change as the body orbits in a wide orbital path between Mars and Jupiter and is heated by the sun. Peter Schultz, a science team co-investigator agreed and showed the comparison images. \"We saw the crater,\" said Schultz, of University. \"It's subdued; it's about 150 meters across and has a small central mound in the center. It looks as if from the impact, the stuff went up and came back down. So we did get it, there's no doubt. I think one of the bottom-line messages is that this surface of the comet where we hit is very weak. It's fragile. So the crater partly healed itself.\" \"It was about the size we expected. But more subdued.\" The probes mission is almost complete since it has very little fuel left. The remaining science data from the flyby is being sent back and some outbound data is being collected. \"This spacecraft has logged over 3.5 billion miles since launch, and while its last close encounter is complete, its mission of discovery is not,\" said Tim Larson, Stardust-NExT project manager at JPL. \"We'll continue imaging the comet as long as the science team can gain useful information, and then Stardust will get its well-deserved rest.\" Stardust-NExT is a repurposed spacecraft that has journeyed nearly 6 billion kilometers since it was launched in 1999. Initially christened as Stardust, the spaceships original task was to fly by Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It also collected priceless cometary dust particles from the coma which was safely parachuted back to Earth inside a return canister in 2006. High powered science analysis of the precious comet dust will help researchers discern the origin and evolution of our solar system. This was humanities first revisit to a comet and at a bargain basement price by using an old spacecraft already in space. \"The cost was just $29 Million dollars.

At first glance, the burn is something of an insignificant event. After all, the venerable spacecraft has executed 40 major flight path maneuvers since its 1999 launch, and between these main engines and the reaction control system, its rocket motors have collectively fired more than 2 million times. But the March 24 burn will be different from all others. This burn will effectively end the life of NASA's most traveled comet hunter. \"We call it a 'burn to depletion,' and that is pretty much what we're doing - firing our rockets until there is nothing left in the tank,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's a unique way for an interplanetary spacecraft to go out. Essentially, Stardust will be providing us useful information to the very end.\" Burn to depletion will answer the question about how much fuel Stardust had left in its tank. \"We'll take those data and compare them to what our estimates told us was left,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems program manager for Stardust-NExT. \"That will give us a better idea how valid our fuel consumption models are and make our predictions even more accurate for future missions.\" Fuel consumption models are necessary because no one has invented an entirely reliable fuel gauge for spacecraft. Until that day arrives, mission planners can approximate fuel usage by looking at the history of the vehicle's flight and how many times and for how long its rocket motors have fired. Stardust's burn to depletion is expected to impart valuable information, because the spacecraft has essentially been running on borrowed time - for some time. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust had already flown past an asteroid (Annefrank), flown past and collected particle samples from a comet (Wild 2), and returned those particles to Earth in a sample return capsule in January 2006 - and in so doing racked up 4.63 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles) on its odometer. NASA then re-tasked the still-healthy spacecraft to perform a flyby of comet Tempel 1, a new, low-cost mission that required another five years and 1.04 billion kilometers (646 million miles). After all those milestones and all that time logged on the spacecraft, the Stardust team knew the end was near. They just didn't know exactly how close. Prior to this final burn, Stardust will point its medium-gain antenna at Earth - some 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away. As there is no tomorrow for Stardust, the spacecraft is expected to downlink information on the burn as it happens. The command from the spacecraft computer ordering the rockets to fire will be sent for 45 minutes, but the burn is expected to last only between a couple of minutes to somewhat above 10 minutes. It is estimated the burn could accelerate the spacecraft anywhere from 2.5 to 35.2 meters per second (6 to 79 mph). \"What we think will happen is that when the fuel reaches a critically low level, gaseous helium will enter the thruster chambers,\" said Larson. \"The resulting thrust will be less than 10 percent of what was expected. While Stardust will continue to command its rocket engines to fire until the pre-planned firing time of 45 minutes has elapsed, the burn is essentially over.\" Twenty minutes after the engines run dry, the spacecraft's computer will command its transmitters off. They actively shut off their radios to preclude the remote chance that at some point down the road Stardust's transmitter could turn on and broadcast on a frequency being used by other operational spacecraft. Turning off the transmitter ensures that there will be no unintended radio interference in the future. Without fuel to power the spacecraft's attitude control system, Stardust's solar panels will not remain pointed at the sun. When this occurs, the spacecraft's batteries are expected to drain of power and deplete within hours. \"When we take into account all the possibilities for how long the burn could be and then the possible post-burn trajectories, we project that over the next 100 years, Stardust will not get any closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit, or within 13 million miles of Mars orbit,\" said Larson. \"That is far enough from protected targets to meet all of NASA's Planetary Protection directives. \" Some planetary spacecraft, like the Galileo mission to Jupiter, are intentionally sent into the planet's atmosphere to make sure it is destroyed in a controlled way. Others have their transmitters shut off or just fade away, said Larson. \"I think this is a fitting end for Stardust.

Stardust: NASA Comet-Visiting Spacecraft Ends 12-Year Mission", "date": "2011-03-24", "content": "You could call it assisted suicide in space. NASA's comet-visiting Stardust spacecraft was purposely put to death today by those that had provided tender loving care to the probe for more than 12 years. After visiting two comets and traveling nearly 5.7 billion miles, the Stardust spacecraft is at journey's end. But even in its death throes, Stardust will yield valuable data for spacecraft engineers. Ground controllers commanded the spacecraft to fire up its four rocket thrusters one last time to use up its remaining fuel today. Engineers watched closely while the probe's propellant tank ran dry to help future missions gauge their fuel reserves more precisely. Stardust's demise comes after a long track record of scientific feats achieved by the Discovery-class mission. A tale of two comets\uff1a NASA launched Stardust in 1999 on a $300 million mission to snatch up the first samples of a comet. The probe flew by the asteroid 5535 Annefrank in November 2002 and later zipped by comet Wild 2 in January 2004, flying through the comet's coma and snagging particles from that object. Two years later, Stardust dutifully ejected its sample-carrying capsule to Earth, with that canister parachuting into the Utah Test and Training Range in the Utah desert. But the hard-working Stardust probe wasn't done yet. NASA recycled the spacecraft for a new $29 million mission to rendezvous with the comet Tempel 1 - a comet already visited by the agency's Deep Impact mission in 2005. Stardust flew by Tempel 1 on Feb. 14 - Valentine's Day - and snapped photos of the scar left behind by a Deep Impact probe that was intentionally crashed into the comet to determine its composition. But with those achievements behind it, it's time for Stardust to rest in peace. Bittersweet moment\uff1a Saying goodbye to Stardust was a bittersweet moment here at the Mission Support Area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"We call it the farewell maneuver,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Stardust-NExT program manager at the aerospace firm. He gave the order to fire four thrusters on the probe until each ran dry. The burn was designed to exceed the spacecraft's capability to perform. To make sure Stardust didn't put up a fuss, specially-written software was uploaded that disabled the probe's fault protection system, allowing it to succumb self-execution style. Cheuvront told SPACE.com just how Stardust would react in its final moments as it obeyed end-of-life orders were difficult to forecast. Burn to depletion: Information gleaned from Stardust's sayonara, Cheuvront said, can assist currently flying spacecraft, such as Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now circling the red planet, as well as the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn. \"It will help provide a better predictor of when the fuel may go out. Then we have our future missions. Through better placement of pressure and temperature sensors perhaps we can improve our computer modeling,\" Cheuvront explained. In belching out all of its fuel, Stardust is also doomed as it drifts freely. The spacecraft's solar panels won't be sun-oriented and onboard batteries will slowly drain. As a NASA planetary protection requirement, Stardust controllers ran a series of trajectories based on different oomph factors created by the burn to depletion. Those studies have shown the now wayward, sun-orbiting spacecraft has no chance of running into a planet, particularly Mars, Cheuvront said. A NASA analysis predicts that Stardust will never get closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit and 13 million miles of Mars' orbit, mission managers have said. \"Stardust was commanded to turn its transmitter off and not turn it back on,\" Cheuvront said. As a 15-year veteran of Stardust moving from blueprint to spaceflight, he added: \"I've got an empty feeling now, knowing that we're not going to talk to it anymore.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11226-nasa-stardust-spacecraft-mission-ends.html"}, {"title": "NASA Stardust Spacecraft Officially Ends Operations", "date": "2011-03-25", "content": "NASA's Stardust spacecraft sent its last transmission to Earth at 4:33 p.m. PDT (7:33 p.m. EDT) Thursday, March 24, shortly after depleting fuel and ceasing operations.

The Stardust team performed the burn to depletion because the comet hunter was literally running on fumes. The depletion maneuver command was sent from the Stardust-NExT mission control area at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. The operation was designed to fire Stardust's rockets until no fuel remained in the tank or fuel lines. The spacecraft sent acknowledgment of its last command from approximately 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away in space. \"This is the end of the spacecraft's operations, but really just the beginnings of what this spacecraft's accomplishments will give to planetary science,\" said Lindley Johnson, Stardust-NExT and Discovery program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The treasure-trove of science data and engineering information collected and returned by Stardust is invaluable for planning future deep space planetary missions.\" After completion of the burn, mission personnel began comparing the computed amount of fuel consumed during the engine firing with the anticipated amount based on consumption models.

The result, which was obtained by studying tiny granules of comet material sent back to Earth by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, should help astronomers better understand how comets form and evolve, researchers said. In particular, it shows that comets can get warm enough to melt the ice that makes up the bulk of their mass - which will likely come as a surprise to many scientists. \"Current thinking suggests that it is impossible to form liquid water inside of a comet,\" said study co-author Dante Lauretta, of the University of Arizona, in a statement. Peering at grains of Stardust: The researchers, led by graduate student Eve Berger of the University of Arizona, analyzed tiny particles of comet Wild 2. The Stardust probe scooped the grains up from Wild 2's coma - the diffuse cloud of material around its nucleus - on a close flyby of the comet in 2004, then sent the samples to Earth in a capsule two years later. After studying the comet dust using electron microscopy and X-ray analysis, the researchers found minerals that formed in the presence of liquid water. Comet Close Encounters: A Brief History Comets spend most of their lives in the frigid depths of the outer solar system. So finding signs of liquid water inside the icy wanderers was unexpected. \"When the ice melted on Wild 2, the resulting warm water dissolved minerals that were present at the time and precipitated the iron and copper sulfide minerals we observed in our study,\" Lauretta said. \"The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200 degrees Celsius 122 and 392 degrees Fahrenheit, much warmer than the sub-zero temperatures predicted for the interior of a comet.\" The discovery will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. Learning more about comets: In addition to providing evidence of liquid water, the minerals put an upper limit on the temperatures Wild 2 experienced during its origin and history. For example, the researchers found one form of a copper iron sulfide mineral, called cubanite, that only exists below 210 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Such detailed thermal constraints will allow for detailed analysis of the role temperature played during the history of comet Wild 2,\" Lauretta said. Wild 2's interior could have warmed up in several different ways, researchers said. Minor collisions with other objects could have done the trick, for example, and radioactive decay of elements found throughout the comet could have as well. Comets are pieces left over from the solar system's youth - some of the stuff that didn't coalesce into the sun and planets. So learning more about comets' structure and evolution could shed light on the origins of the solar system, researchers said. The study also reinforces the fact that comets are active, changeable bodies - and that each one is likely different. \"What we found makes us look at comets in a different way,\" Lauretta said. \"We think they should be viewed as individual entities with their own unique geologic history.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11307-comet-samples-liquid-water-stardust.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Stardust: Good to the Last Drop", "date": "2011-03-23", "content": "On Thursday, March 24 at about 4 p.m. PDT (7 p.m. EDT), NASA's Stardust spacecraft will perform a final burn with its main engines. At first glance, the burn is something of an insignificant event. After all, the venerable spacecraft has executed 40 major flight path maneuvers since its 1999 launch, and between these main engines and the reaction control system, its rocket motors have collectively fired more than 2 million times. But the March 24 burn will be different from all others. This burn will effectively end the life of NASA's most traveled comet hunter. \"We call it a 'burn to depletion,' and that is pretty much what we're doing - firing our rockets until there is nothing left in the tank,\" said Stardust-NExT project manager Tim Larson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"It's a unique way for an interplanetary spacecraft to go out. Essentially, Stardust will be providing us useful information to the very end.\" Burn to depletion will answer the question about how much fuel Stardust had left in its tank. \"We'll take those data and compare them to what our estimates told us was left,\" said Allan Cheuvront, Lockheed Martin Space Systems program manager for Stardust-NExT. \"That will give us a better idea how valid our fuel consumption models are and make our predictions even more accurate for future missions.\" Fuel consumption models are necessary because no one has invented an entirely reliable fuel gauge for spacecraft. Until that day arrives, mission planners can approximate fuel usage by looking at the history of the vehicle's flight and how many times and for how long its rocket motors have fired. Stardust's burn to depletion is expected to impart valuable information, because the spacecraft has essentially been running on borrowed time - for some time. Launched on Feb. 7, 1999, Stardust had already flown past an asteroid (Annefrank), flown past and collected particle samples from a comet (Wild 2), and returned those particles to Earth in a sample return capsule in January 2006 - and in so doing racked up 4.63 billion kilometers (2.88 billion miles) on its odometer. NASA then re-tasked the still-healthy spacecraft to perform a flyby of comet Tempel 1, a new, low-cost mission that required another five years and 1.04 billion kilometers (646 million miles). After all those milestones and all that time logged on the spacecraft, the Stardust team knew the end was near. They just didn't know exactly how close. Prior to this final burn, Stardust will point its medium-gain antenna at Earth - some 312 million kilometers (194 million miles) away. As there is no tomorrow for Stardust, the spacecraft is expected to downlink information on the burn as it happens. The command from the spacecraft computer ordering the rockets to fire will be sent for 45 minutes, but the burn is expected to last only between a couple of minutes to somewhat above 10 minutes. It is estimated the burn could accelerate the spacecraft anywhere from 2.5 to 35.2 meters per second (6 to 79 mph). \"What we think will happen is that when the fuel reaches a critically low level, gaseous helium will enter the thruster chambers,\" said Larson. \"The resulting thrust will be less than 10 percent of what was expected. While Stardust will continue to command its rocket engines to fire until the pre-planned firing time of 45 minutes has elapsed, the burn is essentially over.\" Twenty minutes after the engines run dry, the spacecraft's computer will command its transmitters off. They actively shut off their radios to preclude the remote chance that at some point down the road Stardust's transmitter could turn on and broadcast on a frequency being used by other operational spacecraft. Turning off the transmitter ensures that there will be no unintended radio interference in the future. Without fuel to power the spacecraft's attitude control system, Stardust's solar panels will not remain pointed at the sun. When this occurs, the spacecraft's batteries are expected to drain of power and deplete within hours. \"When we take into account all the possibilities for how long the burn could be and then the possible post-burn trajectories, we project that over the next 100 years, Stardust will not get any closer than 1.7 million miles of Earth's orbit, or within 13 million miles of Mars orbit,\" said Larson. \"That is far enough from protected targets to meet all of NASA's Planetary Protection directives. \" Some planetary spacecraft, like the Galileo mission to Jupiter, are intentionally sent into the planet's atmosphere to make sure it is destroyed in a controlled way.

So finding signs of liquid water inside the icy wanderers was unexpected. \"When the ice melted on Wild 2, the resulting warm water dissolved minerals that were present at the time and precipitated the iron and copper sulfide minerals we observed in our study,\" Lauretta said. \"The sulfide minerals formed between 50 and 200 degrees Celsius 122 and 392 degrees Fahrenheit, much warmer than the sub-zero temperatures predicted for the interior of a comet.\" The discovery will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. Learning more about comets: In addition to providing evidence of liquid water, the minerals put an upper limit on the temperatures Wild 2 experienced during its origin and history. For example, the researchers found one form of a copper iron sulfide mineral, called cubanite, that only exists below 210 degrees Fahrenheit. \"Such detailed thermal constraints will allow for detailed analysis of the role temperature played during the history of comet Wild 2,\" Lauretta said. Wild 2's interior could have warmed up in several different ways, researchers said. Minor collisions with other objects could have done the trick, for example, and radioactive decay of elements found throughout the comet could have as well. Comets are pieces left over from the solar system's youth - some of the stuff that didn't coalesce into the sun and planets. So learning more about comets' structure and evolution could shed light on the origins of the solar system, researchers said. The study also reinforces the fact that comets are active, changeable bodies - and that each one is likely different. \"What we found makes us look at comets in a different way,\" Lauretta said. \"We think they should be viewed as individual entities with their own unique geologic history.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/11307-comet-samples-liquid-water-stardust.html"}]}]
