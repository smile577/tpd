According to a report in New Scientist, the orbiter will fly on its own or with the European Space Agencys (ESAs) ExoMars rover. NASA will launch the orbiter in 2016 to help boost telecommunications around the planet as existing orbiters age. A rover or lander may follow in 2018, as a next step in the path to one day returning samples of Martian rocks and soil to Earth. Though the exact payload and budget of the 2016 probe are not yet set, but a team of researchers has presented a vision of the probes basic payload that could clear up the picture of how methane on Mars is distributed and where it comes from. Ground-based observations of the Red Planet led by Michael Mumma of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center suggest methane on Mars actually stems from a few hotspots that could be linked to underground pockets of gas created by the interaction of water with volcanic rock, or perhaps, by methane-producing microbes. But, some remain unconvinced of the hotspot result, arguing that the gas should be evenly spread since it moves quickly and seems to have a long lifetime in the atmosphere. The 2016 orbiter could help determine whether there are indeed methane hotspots. One idea is to use a spectrometer to look through the Martian atmosphere when the Sun passes behind the planet - an event called a solar occultation. By measuring how much sunlight is absorbed by the atmosphere during the occultations, the spectrometer could detect the concentration of gases in the atmosphere to a sensitivity of several parts per trillion. It has more than enough accuracy to test Mummas report, said Jim Kasting of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, and a member of the 2016 probes Science Definition Team. You will also get better spatial and temporal accuracy of the distribution of methane over the planet, Kasting told New Scientist. The case for a biological origin for the gas would be strengthened if there is an overabundance of methane laden with the isotope carbon-12, which life prefers to process over heavier isotopes. If, however, the atmosphere also contains heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane, which life as we know it cannot produce, that would point to a geological source for the methane.

The principal investigator for one of the instruments, and the management for NASA's roles in the mission, are based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, scheduled to launch in 2016, is the first in a series of planned joint robotic missions to the Red Planet. It will study the chemical makeup of the Martian atmosphere with a 1000-fold increase in sensitivity over previous Mars orbiters. The mission will focus on trace gases, including methane, which could be potentially geochemical or biological in origin and be indicators for the existence of life on Mars. The mission also will serve as an additional communications relay for Mars surface missions beginning in 2018. \"Independently, NASA and ESA have made amazing discoveries up to this point,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Working together, we'll reduce duplication of effort, expand our capabilities and see results neither ever could have achieved alone.\" NASA and ESA invited scientists worldwide to propose the spacecraft's instruments. The five selected were from 19 proposals submitted in April. Both agencies evaluated the submissions and chose those with the best science value and lowest risk. The selection of the instruments begins the first phase of the new NASA-ESA alliance for future ventures to Mars. The instruments and the principal investigators are: Mars Atmosphere Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer: A spectrometer designed to detect very low concentrations of the molecular components of the Martian atmosphere: Paul Wennberg, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. High Resolution Solar Occultation and Nadir Spectrometer: A spectrometer designed to detect traces of the components of the Martian atmosphere and to map where they are on the surface: Ann C. Vandaele, Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy, Brussels, Belgium. ExoMars Climate Sounder: An infrared radiometer that provides daily global data on dust, water vapor and other materials to provide the context for data analysis from the spectrometers: John Schofield, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. High Resolution Stereo Color Imager: A camera that provides four-color stereo imaging at a resolution of two million pixels over an 8.5 kilometer (5.3 mile) swath: Alfred McEwen, University of Arizona, Tucson.

After a series of extensive discussions, the science heads of both agencies agreed on a plan of cooperation during a June 2009 meeting in Plymouth, England, later confirmed by ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in a statement of intent that was signed in November 2009. The plan consists of two Mars cooperative missions in 2016 and 2018, and a later joint sample return mission. The 2016 mission features the European-built ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, a European-built small lander demonstrator, a primarily-U.S. international science payload, and NASA-provided launch vehicle and communications components. ESA member states will provide additional instrument support. The 2018 mission consists of a European rover with a drilling capability, a NASA rover capable of caching selected samples for potential future return to Earth, a NASA landing system, and a NASA launch vehicle.

Scheduled for launch in 2016, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will study the chemical composition of Mars' atmosphere with a suite of instruments specially suited to the task. These instruments are expected to take measurements 1,000 times more sensitive than those by previous Mars orbiters. \"To fully explore Mars, we want to marshal all the talents we can on Earth,\" said European Space Agency scientist David South wood. The selection of the orbiter's tools, which are being developed by both ESA and NASA, was announced Tuesday. The tools will include: Two spectrometers that will detect very low concentrations of molecules and map their location son the planet's surface. An infrared-sensitive radiometer that will continuously measure dust, water and chemicals in the atmosphere as a basis for the spectrometric data. One camera that will provide 4-color simultaneous images of a 5.3-mile (8.5-kilometer) chunk of space, and another that will provide wide-angle images of the entire planet, across a range of wavelengths of light, to support the other instruments. Traveling around Mars in a circular path, the ExoMars spacecraft will record spectra of the sun as its telescope picks up the light that reaches it through orbital sunrise and sunset. Depending on the composition of gas in the atmosphere, sunlight will pass through it differently. \"If you take the spectra fast,\" said NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory researcher Geoffrey Toon, \"you can measure the gas abundance at many different heights above the planet 70 measurements as the sun rises, and 70 asit sets.\" The study of trace gases, especially methane, follows a general quest to determine the planet's status as a potential habitat for past or present organisms. \"We go tour first sniff of the gas with Mars Express in 2003; NASA has since clearly confirmed this,\" said Southwood, ESA's director of science and robotic exploration. \"Mapping methane allows us to investigate further that most important of questions: Is Mars a living planet, and if not, can or will it becomeso in thefuture\" Methane is released in both biological and geological processes, said California Institute of Technology researcher Paul Wennberg. Figuring out where Mars' methane comes from will help scientists better understand the history of the planet. The orbiter's prime spectrometer, MATMOS (short for Mars Atmospheric Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer), will be sensitive enough to detect concentrations of gas down to parts per trillion so if just a few molecules of methane are hiding among 1 trillion molecules of other gases in the atmosphere, this instrument will be able to sniff them out. \"We dida calculation which shows that the microbial community found in threecows?bellies would produce an amount of methane that, in the Marsatmosphere, wouldbe observable by MATMOS,\" said NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory researcher Mark Allen, also at Caltech. Other substances being targeted carbon-, sulfur- and nitrogen-containing molecules, aswell assulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are similarly \"diagnostic of active geological and biogenic activity\" said Wennberg, who is the lead researcher of the MATMOS team. \"Independently,NASA and ESA have made amazing discoveries up to this point,\" said EdWeiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission DirectorateinWashington, D.C. \"Working together, we'll reduce duplication of effort,expand our capabilities and see results neither ever could haveachievedalone.\" In additionto the Trace Gas Orbiter, the 2016 mission will include sending avehicle toconduct observations and experiments on the ground.

This will be a joint mission between NASA and ESA, with NASA providing the launch vehicle and four of the science instruments, and ESA providing the spacecraft and one of the instruments. After a joint proposal and evaluation process, the selection of the science instruments for the mission was recently announced. The focus of the science will be on detecting and characterizing trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. Gases such as methane, which has been detected previously in the Martian atmosphere, could result from either ongoing geological or biological processes. By looking for a lot of different gases in the atmosphere, it will be possible to determine what processes are active today and whether there is active geology or biology. The instruments that were selected will look for trace gases in the atmosphere, map them out over a Mars year, and provide details on the \"weather context\" of the atmosphere that are necessary to understand them. MAVEN and EXMTGO both stand on their own, each one able to achieve its own science objectives. But there will be tremendous value in combining measurements made by each, even though they will be made in different years. EXMTGO arrives about two Earth years, or one Mars year, after MAVEN. Among the gases that EXMTGO will look at in the lower atmosphere are those that are produced by photochemical processes (for example, looking at CO and O that is produced by the breakup of CO2 by sunlight). These processes provide the sources for many of the gases that MAVEN will observe in the upper atmosphere, including some that are escaping. The combination of MAVEN and EXMTGO measurements will provide detailed information on photochemical processes from the bottom of the atmosphere to the top, and on coupling between the lower and the upper parts of the atmosphere. We've ended up with two first-rate atmospheric missions to Mars. Along with the geologically focused missions, the overarching theme is that we are trying to understand the long-term history of Mars and what the potential has been for life to exist there. The Mars environment is a complex system of coupled processes, so that understanding it in detail requires understanding each component separately as well as how they interact. In hindsight, it is easy to see how the missions of the last two decades have provided much of the information that we need, and how results from both MAVEN and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will fit into this broader picture.", "url": "https://lasp.colorado.edu/maven/2010/08/16/2016-trace-gas-orbiter-mission/"}, {"title": "Climate Sounder Instrument for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter", "date": "2010-08-20", "content": "The Mars Climate Sounder instrument, shown here prior to its installation onto NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for the mission's 2006 launch, will get a similar-looking sibling at Mars in 2016.

Its Mars Climate Sounder has provided a lengthening record of the changing vertical distributions of temperatures, dust, water vapor and ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere.

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will also carry instruments for detecting very low concentrations of methane and other gaseous clues about possible life on Mars.

Officials say it is becoming increasingly apparent NASA, Europe and Russia must each make major contributions to the Mars project if the missions are to be left intact. Exploration managers from all three space agencies will meet in Paris next week, according to Jorge Vago, the European Space Agency's chief Mars mission scientist. \"We are kind of in a rush to nail this down,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars program. NASA and ESA established a joint Mars robotic exploration program in 2009, with an eye toward returning samples from the Red Planet's surface in the 2020s. A series of probes leading up to the sample return mission will be developed in partnership between the agencies. But neither space agency can afford to launch a methane-sniffing science orbiter in January 2016. The orbiter is being developed by Thales Alenia Space of France, and instruments are being designed in Europe and the United States. ESA also plans an entry, descent and landing demonstrator to ride piggyback on the orbiter. The Mars Trace Gas Orbiter was supposed to be launched from the United States, but NASA informed ESA earlier this year it could not pay for an Atlas 5 rocket for the probe. NASA's science budget is being restructured to fund the James Webb Space Telescope, which the White House and Congress identified as the agency's top scientific priority, ranking above Mars probes. The communique from NASA left Europe scrambling to find a way to launch the orbiter, which is crucial to NASA and ESA's plans to launch a rover in 2018 loaded with astrobiology experiments and a sample caching system to store Martian soil for pick-up and return to Earth by a later probe. The Mars Trace Gas Orbiter carries a telecommunications relay radio to link the rover with Earth. The orbiter and rover are considered a single program named ExoMars in Europe, but ESA does not have funding to launch either spacecraft, necessitating cooperation with NASA or Russia. European space officials formally invited Russia to participate in the ExoMars program in October, specifically requesting a Proton rocket to launch the 2016 orbiter. Roscosmos has until January to respond, but Russian officials will meet with NASA and ESA managers in Paris on Dec. 7 for a two-day summit on a potential trilateral Mars exploration initiative. \"ESA has approached the Russians about whether they would be interested in participating and providing the launch in 2016 if we can't do that,\" said Doug McCuistion, manager of NASA's Mars exploration progam. \"We have not sat down with the Russians yet, so we'll see.\" NASA's contribution to the rover is capped at $1.5 billion, and ESA has received approval from its member states to spend 850 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, on the orbiter and rover. \"We hope that the Russians would like to play along with us and really help by providing the launch vehicle [for the 2016 orbiter],\" Meyer told members of the planetary protection subcommittee at a meeting in Florida. The discussions will be the first chance for Russia to negotiate directly with ESA and NASA on the level of their commitment to the joint program. \"There is speculation as to what the Russians might want,\" Meyer said, suggesting Russia could provide scientific instruments and surface penetrator probes, in addition to a Proton launcher for the 2016 Mars Trace Gas Orbiter. Russia is evaluating the next step in its Mars program after the $165 million Phobos-Grunt mission was stranded in low Earth orbit on the way to the Red Planet in early November. \"2016 is not very far away,\" Meyer told a meeting of the NASA Advisory Council's planetary protection subcommittee. \"We'll have to structure it when we sit down at the table.

And today, it seems that concerns for the future financial landscape may have scuppered another international collaboration in space. The BBC is reporting that the U.S. space agency is close to officially announcing its intention to step away from the European-led ExoMars mission that was scheduled for a (delayed) 2016 and 2018 launch to the Red Planet.

It's highly unlikely,\" said Alvaro Gimenez, ESA's director of science. \"They are interested, they know it's a very good option for them - but they have difficulties putting these missions in the budget.\" This news comes ahead of President Obama's announcement of next year's budget that will undoubtedly see NASA in its cost-cutting cross hairs. Needless to say, no one is optimistic. As discussed by Keith Cowing at NASAWatch.com: \"Details of the FY 2013 NASA budget are starting to trickle out. One of the most prominent changes will be the substantial cut to SMD (Science Mission Directorate) - specifically its future Mars exploration program. Sources report cuts of 50-60 percent in this area.\" Although a NASA step-down has yet to be confirmed, ESA has begun lobbying the Russian space agency Roscosmos for help. NASA's involvement in ExoMars was to be critical. Instrumentation and a communications package was to be provided for the satellite, plus a number of instruments for the rover. NASA would also be providing the rockets needed to get the mission into space. Oh yes, plus the decent system required to land the one ton rover on the surface. It is now hoped Russia might be able to step in where NASA left off. Unfortunately, this decision will raise a few eyebrows considering Russia's recent bad luck with getting stuff into space and keeping it there. Also, Roscosmos' track record with getting stuff to Mars is abysmal. Even if Russia does decide to step in, the ExoMars mission will have to be less ambitious than it was. For starters, Roscosmos doesn't have the necessary skills and technology for such a big mission, skills that NASA has been able to refine after three (soon to be four) successful rover landings and a series of landers. Also, the additional cost ESA will have to absorb means the European ExoMars budget cap of one billion Euros (1.3 billion dollars) may be too restrictive. As the ExoMars mission hangs by a thread, where does this leave future international collaboration in space? It's a strange irony that to afford the expense of space exploration, international collaboration is often sought after - spreading the cost across several international partners means the biggest space missions may be accomplished. And yet in times of austerity, national budgets balk at the prospect of investing in international projects like ExoMars. It looks like this is one great idea that will continue to struggle to make its way to the launchpad.", "url": "https://www.space.com/14492-nasa-withdraw-europe-mars-mission.html"}, {"title": "NASA drops ExoMars missions in 2013 budget", "date": "2012-02-15", "content": "While NASA's 2013 budget request includes funding for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ahead of a planned launch in late 2018, a casualty of that program's huge overspend now looks to be the ExoMars missions. The total budget for the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope has swelled to $8.8 billion (including the cost of its first five years of operations), and JWST became something of a political football last year after a comprehensive review highlighted some major organizational problems. In its 2013 budget request, NASA admitted as much, but added that things had changed following an overhaul of management last year. \"Communications have greatly improved between Headquarters, Centers, and contractors, particularly at senior management levels,\" stated the administration. \"There now is open and honest dialogue, quick identification of issues, and agreement on fixes.\" If all now goes according to plan, JWST will launch in October 2018 from French Guiana. While all mirror fabrication and vacuum thermal testing is now completed, and backplane construction is said to be nearing completion, there is still plenty to be done. One of the next priorities will be assembling the optical telescope element (OTE) backplane support fixture, while an optics-related risk to the mission identified by NASA includes whether or not the double pass auto-collimating flat test will work to sufficiently tight performance. Announcing the planned 2013 budget, NASA chief and former astronaut Charles Bolden admitted that spending constraints had made some tough choices inevitable. \"This means we will not be moving forward with the planned 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions that we had been exploring with the European Space Agency,\" Bolden said, confirming wide speculation that the planetary missions could pay the price for JWST's overspend. NASA had been due to provide the launch vehicle for the ExoMars trace-gas orbiter mission, among other responsibilities. ESA response: When contacted by optics.org for its response to NASA's withdrawal, ESA referred to comments from its director general Jean-Jacques Dordain in an interview with Space News, in which the agency chief said that ESA did not want to end industrial work on the two missions as that would mean losing an already substantial investment. Delaying each of the two missions by two years would also be very expensive, but there is now an obvious shortfall in a project already expected to cost ESA around \u20ac1 billion. Nevertheless, Dordain has said that ESA will push ahead with involvement from Russia instead of NASA. But while Russian expertise may be sufficient to provide a launch vehicle, it does not currently extend to the critical requirement of a landing system for Mars. The ExoMars project includes a number of photonics tools, primarily for analytical chemistry applications designed to investigate the composition of Martian rock and, for the first time, enable analysis below the surface. Under development are a laser-based mass spectrometer and a combination Raman/laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) tool, as well as an interferometer, a number of imagers plus hyperspectral, infrared and UV-visible spectrometers. While it has withdrawn from the ExoMars missions specifically, Bolden did stress that missions to the red planet were still important to NASA, with possible new activity before the end of the decade. \"We will develop an integrated strategy to ensure that the next steps for Mars exploration will support science as well as human exploration goals, and potentially take advantage of the 2018-2020 exploration window,\" he said. Ongoing Mars missions include the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), which is set to land on the planet in August 2012, while the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission is scheduled for a 2013 launch. Designed to explore Mars' upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with the sun and solar wind, MAVEN's instruments include a UV spectrometer. NASA added that it will also be ending work on the ExoMars trace-gas orbiter and the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) missions shortly, but said that it would look to take advantage of the favorable relative location of Mars and Earth in 2018 and 2020, with pathway options for missions later in the 2020s. The administration said that it would identify the first such mission in its fiscal 2014 budget request, due this time next year. Meanwhile ESA is scheduled to deliver an estimate of the new cost of ExoMars without NASA's involvement next month - and the agency is also due to decide on whether to extend or cancel the mission development contract with primary contractor Thales Alenia Space.", "url": "https://optics.org/news/3/2/23"}, {"title": "Is NASA Pulling Out of Europe's Mars Exploration Missions?", "date": "2012-02-15", "content": "Following the release of their financial budget for 2013, Nasa have officially pulled out of the ExoMars project, much to the dismay of their European partners. ExoMars was intended to be a collaborative project between Nasa and ESA (European Space Agency), but without the Nasa funding, technological input and logistical support ESA will have to look elsewhere if they wish to continue moving forward with this ambitious mission. ExoMars, in its current configuration, is a two-stage project. The first of which is a Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft planned for launch in 2016, followed by a robotic rover scheduled for launch in 2018. The Trace Gas Orbiter has been planned to study the Martian atmosphere, specifically looking for gases that may indicate living organisms on the planet, and then be used as a 'data relay' to send results back to Earth from the following rover-based mission. This second stage of ExoMars was originally expected to consist of two rovers, one ESA-led (called ExoMars) and one Nasa-led (called MAX-C). They were both going to land at the same location on the Martian surface and undertake complementary experiments searching for evidence of past or present life. MAX-C was also intended to collect samples that may be returned to Earth at a later date for further study. In 2011, because of budget restraints, this plan was altered to one, larger rover (based on the ESA led ExoMars) which would carry scientific equipment relevant to both ESA and Nasa's corresponding science goals. With Nasa's funding for this project completely cancelled, most of these plans will have to at least be restructured, if they are to go ahead at all. In fact, the Planetary Sciences are bearing the brunt of the budget cuts which state: \"Nasa is terminating further activity on the formulation activity for the Nasa/ ESA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter 2016 (EMTGO) mission and planning for the previous Nasa/ESA Mars 2018 mission concept. Nasa remains committed to an ongoing Mars Exploration program of robotic exploration missions in support of an integrated strategy of scientific and human exploration, and intends to work with the science community and our international partners in the formulation of a restructured mission.\" This seems to imply that Nasa still believes searching for evidence of past and present life on Mars is worthwhile, just not a mission they can fit into their current budget restrictions. So what is the future for ESA's Martian exploration plans? ESA are currently having conversations with Roscosmos (Russia's Space Agency) about becoming partners in this project, by using Russian launch capabilities for the Trace Gas Orbiter in 2016, possibly including Russian scientific experimentation in return and becoming involved in the following rover based mission. This could be seen as an attractive prospect for Russia, especially given the well-publicised recent failures of their own Martian exploration plans. It would be an immense shame if this mission were not to succeed in some capacity. Not only is it one of ESA's flagship missions, but several key components as well as the test rovers are being devised and constructed here in the UK.

NASA would also be providing the rockets needed to get the mission into space. Oh yes, plus the decent system required to land the one ton rover on the surface. It is now hoped Russia might be able to step in where NASA left off. Unfortunately, this decision will raise a few eyebrows considering Russia's recent bad luck with getting stuff into space and keeping it there. Also, Roscosmos' track record with getting stuff to Mars is abysmal. Even if Russia does decide to step in, the ExoMars mission will have to be less ambitious than it was. For starters, Roscosmos doesn't have the necessary skills and technology for such a big mission, skills that NASA has been able to refine after three (soon to be four) successful rover landings and a series of landers. Also, the additional cost ESA will have to absorb means the European ExoMars budget cap of one billion Euros (1.3 billion dollars) may be too restrictive. As the ExoMars mission hangs by a thread, where does this leave future international collaboration in space? It's a strange irony that to afford the expense of space exploration, international collaboration is often sought after - spreading the cost across several international partners means the biggest space missions may be accomplished. And yet in times of austerity, national budgets balk at the prospect of investing in international projects like ExoMars. It looks like this is one great idea that will continue to struggle to make its way to the launchpad.", "url": "https://www.space.com/14492-nasa-withdraw-europe-mars-mission.html"}, {"title": "NASA drops ExoMars missions in 2013 budget", "date": "2012-02-15", "content": "While NASA's 2013 budget request includes funding for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ahead of a planned launch in late 2018, a casualty of that program's huge overspend now looks to be the ExoMars missions. The total budget for the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope has swelled to $8.8 billion (including the cost of its first five years of operations), and JWST became something of a political football last year after a comprehensive review highlighted some major organizational problems. In its 2013 budget request, NASA admitted as much, but added that things had changed following an overhaul of management last year. \"Communications have greatly improved between Headquarters, Centers, and contractors, particularly at senior management levels,\" stated the administration. \"There now is open and honest dialogue, quick identification of issues, and agreement on fixes.\" If all now goes according to plan, JWST will launch in October 2018 from French Guiana. While all mirror fabrication and vacuum thermal testing is now completed, and backplane construction is said to be nearing completion, there is still plenty to be done. One of the next priorities will be assembling the optical telescope element (OTE) backplane support fixture, while an optics-related risk to the mission identified by NASA includes whether or not the double pass auto-collimating flat test will work to sufficiently tight performance. Announcing the planned 2013 budget, NASA chief and former astronaut Charles Bolden admitted that spending constraints had made some tough choices inevitable. \"This means we will not be moving forward with the planned 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions that we had been exploring with the European Space Agency,\" Bolden said, confirming wide speculation that the planetary missions could pay the price for JWST's overspend. NASA had been due to provide the launch vehicle for the ExoMars trace-gas orbiter mission, among other responsibilities. ESA response: When contacted by optics.org for its response to NASA's withdrawal, ESA referred to comments from its director general Jean-Jacques Dordain in an interview with Space News, in which the agency chief said that ESA did not want to end industrial work on the two missions as that would mean losing an already substantial investment. Delaying each of the two missions by two years would also be very expensive, but there is now an obvious shortfall in a project already expected to cost ESA around \u20ac1 billion. Nevertheless, Dordain has said that ESA will push ahead with involvement from Russia instead of NASA. But while Russian expertise may be sufficient to provide a launch vehicle, it does not currently extend to the critical requirement of a landing system for Mars. The ExoMars project includes a number of photonics tools, primarily for analytical chemistry applications designed to investigate the composition of Martian rock and, for the first time, enable analysis below the surface. Under development are a laser-based mass spectrometer and a combination Raman/laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) tool, as well as an interferometer, a number of imagers plus hyperspectral, infrared and UV-visible spectrometers. While it has withdrawn from the ExoMars missions specifically, Bolden did stress that missions to the red planet were still important to NASA, with possible new activity before the end of the decade. \"We will develop an integrated strategy to ensure that the next steps for Mars exploration will support science as well as human exploration goals, and potentially take advantage of the 2018-2020 exploration window,\" he said. Ongoing Mars missions include the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), which is set to land on the planet in August 2012, while the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission is scheduled for a 2013 launch. Designed to explore Mars' upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with the sun and solar wind, MAVEN's instruments include a UV spectrometer. NASA added that it will also be ending work on the ExoMars trace-gas orbiter and the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) missions shortly, but said that it would look to take advantage of the favorable relative location of Mars and Earth in 2018 and 2020, with pathway options for missions later in the 2020s. The administration said that it would identify the first such mission in its fiscal 2014 budget request, due this time next year. Meanwhile ESA is scheduled to deliver an estimate of the new cost of ExoMars without NASA's involvement next month - and the agency is also due to decide on whether to extend or cancel the mission development contract with primary contractor Thales Alenia Space.", "url": "https://optics.org/news/3/2/23"}, {"title": "Is NASA Pulling Out of Europe's Mars Exploration Missions?", "date": "2012-02-15", "content": "Following the release of their financial budget for 2013, Nasa have officially pulled out of the ExoMars project, much to the dismay of their European partners. ExoMars was intended to be a collaborative project between Nasa and ESA (European Space Agency), but without the Nasa funding, technological input and logistical support ESA will have to look elsewhere if they wish to continue moving forward with this ambitious mission. ExoMars, in its current configuration, is a two-stage project. The first of which is a Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft planned for launch in 2016, followed by a robotic rover scheduled for launch in 2018. The Trace Gas Orbiter has been planned to study the Martian atmosphere, specifically looking for gases that may indicate living organisms on the planet, and then be used as a 'data relay' to send results back to Earth from the following rover-based mission. This second stage of ExoMars was originally expected to consist of two rovers, one ESA-led (called ExoMars) and one Nasa-led (called MAX-C). They were both going to land at the same location on the Martian surface and undertake complementary experiments searching for evidence of past or present life. MAX-C was also intended to collect samples that may be returned to Earth at a later date for further study. In 2011, because of budget restraints, this plan was altered to one, larger rover (based on the ESA led ExoMars) which would carry scientific equipment relevant to both ESA and Nasa's corresponding science goals. With Nasa's funding for this project completely cancelled, most of these plans will have to at least be restructured, if they are to go ahead at all. In fact, the Planetary Sciences are bearing the brunt of the budget cuts which state: \"Nasa is terminating further activity on the formulation activity for the Nasa/ ESA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter 2016 (EMTGO) mission and planning for the previous Nasa/ESA Mars 2018 mission concept. Nasa remains committed to an ongoing Mars Exploration program of robotic exploration missions in support of an integrated strategy of scientific and human exploration, and intends to work with the science community and our international partners in the formulation of a restructured mission.\" This seems to imply that Nasa still believes searching for evidence of past and present life on Mars is worthwhile, just not a mission they can fit into their current budget restrictions. So what is the future for ESA's Martian exploration plans? ESA are currently having conversations with Roscosmos (Russia's Space Agency) about becoming partners in this project, by using Russian launch capabilities for the Trace Gas Orbiter in 2016, possibly including Russian scientific experimentation in return and becoming involved in the following rover based mission. This could be seen as an attractive prospect for Russia, especially given the well-publicised recent failures of their own Martian exploration plans. It would be an immense shame if this mission were not to succeed in some capacity. Not only is it one of ESA's flagship missions, but several key components as well as the test rovers are being devised and constructed here in the UK. Unfortunately we shall all have to wait for further news before the future of ESA's Mars programme is anywhere close to certain.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120511105820/http://news.uk.msn.com/blog/the-space-blog-blogpost.aspx?post=1fac64fc-9e63-4c9c-9304-ce598c2ab71d"}, {"title": "Europe still keen on Mars missions", "date": "2012-03-15", "content": "Europe is to press ahead with its Mars missions in 2016 and 2018. Member state delegations to the European Space Agency (Esa) reiterated their support for the ventures during a council meeting in Paris on Thursday. The plans to send a satellite and rover to the Red Planet were thrown into doubt when the US pulled out because of funding woes. But Russia will now partner Europe instead, taking on key roles, including the provision of two rockets. There are, however, many hurdles still in front of the successful implementation of the missions, not least a budget shortfall on the side of the Europeans. Esa had originally cost-capped the ExoMars projects at a billion euros, but the withdrawal of the US space agency (Nasa) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised. Member states instructed the agency's executive at Thursday's meeting to look at how this shortfall could be made up. One possibility is that other science activities within Esa may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority. It is likely also that member states will be asked for further contributions when the space ministers of Europe meet in November to set the agency's medium-term policies and budgets. Previous design: The UK Space Agency's director of science, Dr David Parker, commented after the Paris gathering: \"The bottom line is that the programme was very strongly supported around the table as being important for Esa, which means there was no proposal to cancel or anything like that. \"On the contrary, the message was that Esa needs to prioritise to make sure ExoMars happens. \"Of course, it's not straightforward, and the agency will need to do some homework to find the necessary money.\" The council also heard the latest thinking on the expected architecture for the two missions. The 2016 satellite will launch on a Russian Proton rocket and go into orbit to investigate the Martian atmosphere. The absence of the US means Europe and Russia will have to provide instruments that will no longer be sourced through Nasa. The idea that the satellite despatches a small static lander to the surface is retained, but the Russians are now expected to take a very prominent role on this part of the mission. One bonus will be the provision by Russia of a radioisotope battery to maintain the life of the lander and its instruments on the surface for many months. Esa had earlier only planned for surface operation lasting just a few hours. Some derivative of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) technology used to put the surface package on Mars in 2016 will now also probably be used to place the 2018 rover on the planet. The Russians will produce most of the hardware, but Europe will handle some key elements such as the guidance and navigation systems. Like the 2016 satellite, the 2018 rover will be despatched to Mars on a Proton. The design for the six-wheeled robot rover goes back to the one envisaged before Europe thought about teaming up with the US, meaning it will be in the 300kg class. It will carry an exobiology instrument suite, known as \"Pasteur\", to look for signs of past or present life. The robot will also drill beneath the surface of the planet to pull up samples for its on-board laboratory. 'Door open' to Nasa: One of the key issues right now is the ever shortening time window to get the 2016 orbiter ready for flight. Senior figures at Esa and Italian space manufacturer Thales Alenia Space (TAS) will be meeting in the next fortnight to determine whether the preparation schedule is still feasible. Assuming everyone agrees the goals can be achieved in the four years available, a full contract will be released to TAS in April to get the hardware built. If the window is considered unrealistic, the whole structure of ExoMars would have to be reconsidered. But there is high confidence that the challenge can be met. At some point in the next few months, the partnership between Europe and Russia will need to be formalised. This will take the form of a memorandum of understanding between the heads of Esa and the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos). Although the Americans turned their backs on ExoMars, Europe is still hopeful Nasa will come back into the ventures in some form at a later date. \"The door always remains open to Nasa, perhaps to do something for 2018 and further consolidate the mission,\" said a spokesman for Esa director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"They will always be welcome, so long as they bring support. International cooperation doesn't die just because Nasa said they didn't have the money to do this now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-17390576"}, {"title": "Europe OKs Funding for Mars Mission with Russia", "date": "2012-03-21", "content": "The ruling council of the European Space Agency (ESA) on March 15 agreed to continue funding a Mars telecommunications orbiter and atmospheric gas analyzer mission for launch in 2016, which along with an entry, descent and landing module will be launched on a Russian Proton rocket donated by the Russian space agency, an ESA official said March 15. The council's decision will permit the ExoMars industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy to proceed with work on the 2016 mission under a full development contract. Industrial work up to now had been funded in a series of small tranches as ESA governments reviewed their options following NASA's decision earlier this year to withdraw from the ExoMars project. ExoMars is a two-mission project that is considered as a single program at ESA. The second mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, will carry an ESA-built Mars rover and a second entry, descent and landing module, this one built 80 percent by Russia and 20 percent by ESA, according to the ESA official. As ESA managers had hoped, the arrival of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, into the ExoMars partnership has saved the mission. NASA originally had agreed to provide Atlas 5 rockets for the 2016 and 2018 launches, and to divide with ESA the cost of the 2018 rover. Thales Alenia Space officials have said they could make the 2016 deadline if there were no more stops and starts to the program's funding. Dordain is expected to confirm this by early April, a decision that would permit ESA's check-writing body, the Industrial Policy Committee, to continue the money flow to the industrial team. An option to delay ExoMars by two years, with launches in 2018 and 2020, was scrapped as an unnecessary waste of money as it would maintain the industrial team in place for two additional years. But while the council decision removes an immediate problem for ExoMars, it does not solve the longer-term funding issue that has dogged the project for years. ESA governments have approved an ExoMars spending limit of 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). But despite more than three years of effort, program managers have been unable to secure more than 850 million euros in formal commitments from ESA member states. Meanwhile, NASA's decision to pull out of the ExoMars campaign riled some of the agency's congressional overseers. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), chairman of the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee, in late February denied NASA's request to take money Congress appropriated for ExoMars and use it instead to begin planning a new U.S.-led, $700 million-class Mars mission that would launch in 2018 or 2020. Wolf's objection opens the possibility that work on several NASA-funded ExoMars instruments could remain funded through at least September. But one U.S. scientist said Wolf's maneuver would do nothing to get a U.S.-built instrument on the 2016 ExoMars mission. \"It's too late for ... Trace Gas Orbiter,\" said Alfred McEwen, a professor of planetary geology at Arizona State University and principle investigator for the High Resolution Color Imager, one of four instruments NASA had planned to contribute to the 2016 orbiter. \"ESA wants to have a high-resolution imager on their 2016 mission, but the hitch is they need a commitment from NASA. And even if NASA comes up with money to support us in 2012, that's not enough for a 2016 launch. In spite of the House's action which says 'keep working on the Trace Gas Orbiter mission,' it's not possible to actually do so.\" With NASA out of the picture, ExoMars now becomes even more expensive as ESA will be responsible for 100 percent of the costs of the 2018 rover and 20 percent of the work on the Russian-led lander for 2018. Program officials had said these new charges could swell ESA's total ExoMars obligations to around 1.2 billion euros. In an interview, the ESA official agreed that new funds would need to be found. The most likely scenario, the official said, is that ESA's 19 member governments will be asked to provide fresh support for the project when they meet in November in Italy. That meeting's agenda had already been stressed by the debt crisis that has gripped many governments in Europe, including Italy, which is the lead ESA contributor to ExoMars. One official said that NASA's 2010 decision not to co-develop a large space science mission with ESA had left a potential source of funds in ESA's science budget. ESA science officials have said they may have to cancel that mission because without NASA it is too expensive. The ESA official said that with ExoMars now taking on more scientific instruments, many provided by Russia, ExoMars backers may be able to persuade Europe's space scientists to take part in the program. That would require the approval of the Science Program Committee, which decides Europe's space science priorities within ESA's budget. The official said ESA is examining several possible funding sources, and had not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.", "url": "https://www.space.com/14975-europe-exomars-mars-mission-funding.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Is NASA Pulling Out of Europe's Mars Exploration Missions?", "date": "2012-02-08", "content": "The blight of space exploration is also the lifeblood of space exploration: government funding.

The BBC is reporting that the U.S. space agency is close to officially announcing its intention to step away from the European-led ExoMars mission that was scheduled for a (delayed) 2016 and 2018 launch to the Red Planet. Composed of a Mars satellite and drilling rover, the combo would make invaluable measurements of atmospheric methane - a potential sign of microbial life on the surface - and drill deep into the ground, accessing a subterranean environment no robot has ever touched before. Of course, the prime objective is to search for the biosignatures of Martian life, but the whole kit would also understand how much water is locked just below the surface and help to assess the Mars environment for future manned missions. Unfortunately, it looks like there's bad news on the horizon; the European Space Agency's (ESA) key partner may be pulling out. \"The Americans have indicated that the possibility of them participating is now low - very low. It's highly unlikely,\" said Alvaro Gimenez, ESA's director of science. \"They are interested, they know it's a very good option for them - but they have difficulties putting these missions in the budget.\" This news comes ahead of President Obama's announcement of next year's budget that will undoubtedly see NASA in its cost-cutting cross hairs. Needless to say, no one is optimistic. As discussed by Keith Cowing at NASAWatch.com: \"Details of the FY 2013 NASA budget are starting to trickle out. One of the most prominent changes will be the substantial cut to SMD (Science Mission Directorate) - specifically its future Mars exploration program. Sources report cuts of 50-60 percent in this area.\" Although a NASA step-down has yet to be confirmed, ESA has begun lobbying the Russian space agency Roscosmos for help.

Senior figures at Esa and Italian space manufacturer Thales Alenia Space (TAS) will be meeting in the next fortnight to determine whether the preparation schedule is still feasible. Assuming everyone agrees the goals can be achieved in the four years available, a full contract will be released to TAS in April to get the hardware built.

The council's decision will permit the ExoMars industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy to proceed with work on the 2016 mission under a full development contract. Industrial work up to now had been funded in a series of small tranches as ESA governments reviewed their options following NASA's decision earlier this year to withdraw from the ExoMars project. ExoMars is a two-mission project that is considered as a single program at ESA. The second mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, will carry an ESA-built Mars rover and a second entry, descent and landing module, this one built 80 percent by Russia and 20 percent by ESA, according to the ESA official. As ESA managers had hoped, the arrival of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, into the ExoMars partnership has saved the mission. NASA originally had agreed to provide Atlas 5 rockets for the 2016 and 2018 launches, and to divide with ESA the cost of the 2018 rover. Thales Alenia Space officials have said they could make the 2016 deadline if there were no more stops and starts to the program's funding. Dordain is expected to confirm this by early April, a decision that would permit ESA's check-writing body, the Industrial Policy Committee, to continue the money flow to the industrial team. An option to delay ExoMars by two years, with launches in 2018 and 2020, was scrapped as an unnecessary waste of money as it would maintain the industrial team in place for two additional years. But while the council decision removes an immediate problem for ExoMars, it does not solve the longer-term funding issue that has dogged the project for years. ESA governments have approved an ExoMars spending limit of 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). But despite more than three years of effort, program managers have been unable to secure more than 850 million euros in formal commitments from ESA member states. Meanwhile, NASA's decision to pull out of the ExoMars campaign riled some of the agency's congressional overseers. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), chairman of the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee, in late February denied NASA's request to take money Congress appropriated for ExoMars and use it instead to begin planning a new U.S.-led, $700 million-class Mars mission that would launch in 2018 or 2020. Wolf's objection opens the possibility that work on several NASA-funded ExoMars instruments could remain funded through at least September. But one U.S. scientist said Wolf's maneuver would do nothing to get a U.S.-built instrument on the 2016 ExoMars mission. \"It's too late for ... Trace Gas Orbiter,\" said Alfred McEwen, a professor of planetary geology at Arizona State University and principle investigator for the High Resolution Color Imager, one of four instruments NASA had planned to contribute to the 2016 orbiter. \"ESA wants to have a high-resolution imager on their 2016 mission, but the hitch is they need a commitment from NASA. And even if NASA comes up with money to support us in 2012, that's not enough for a 2016 launch. In spite of the House's action which says 'keep working on the Trace Gas Orbiter mission,' it's not possible to actually do so.\" With NASA out of the picture, ExoMars now becomes even more expensive as ESA will be responsible for 100 percent of the costs of the 2018 rover and 20 percent of the work on the Russian-led lander for 2018. Program officials had said these new charges could swell ESA's total ExoMars obligations to around 1.2 billion euros. In an interview, the ESA official agreed that new funds would need to be found. The most likely scenario, the official said, is that ESA's 19 member governments will be asked to provide fresh support for the project when they meet in November in Italy. That meeting's agenda had already been stressed by the debt crisis that has gripped many governments in Europe, including Italy, which is the lead ESA contributor to ExoMars. One official said that NASA's 2010 decision not to co-develop a large space science mission with ESA had left a potential source of funds in ESA's science budget. ESA science officials have said they may have to cancel that mission because without NASA it is too expensive. The ESA official said that with ExoMars now taking on more scientific instruments, many provided by Russia, ExoMars backers may be able to persuade Europe's space scientists to take part in the program. That would require the approval of the Science Program Committee, which decides Europe's space science priorities within ESA's budget. The official said ESA is examining several possible funding sources, and had not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.", "url": "https://www.space.com/14975-europe-exomars-mars-mission-funding.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Europe still keen on Mars missions", "date": "2012-03-15", "content": "Europe is to press ahead with its Mars missions in 2016 and 2018. Member state delegations to the European Space Agency (Esa) reiterated their support for the ventures during a council meeting in Paris on Thursday. The plans to send a satellite and rover to the Red Planet were thrown into doubt when the US pulled out because of funding woes. But Russia will now partner Europe instead, taking on key roles, including the provision of two rockets. There are, however, many hurdles still in front of the successful implementation of the missions, not least a budget shortfall on the side of the Europeans. Esa had originally cost-capped the ExoMars projects at a billion euros, but the withdrawal of the US space agency (Nasa) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised. Member states instructed the agency's executive at Thursday's meeting to look at how this shortfall could be made up. One possibility is that other science activities within Esa may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority. It is likely also that member states will be asked for further contributions when the space ministers of Europe meet in November to set the agency's medium-term policies and budgets. Previous design: The UK Space Agency's director of science, Dr David Parker, commented after the Paris gathering: \"The bottom line is that the programme was very strongly supported around the table as being important for Esa, which means there was no proposal to cancel or anything like that. \"On the contrary, the message was that Esa needs to prioritise to make sure ExoMars happens. \"Of course, it's not straightforward, and the agency will need to do some homework to find the necessary money.\" The council also heard the latest thinking on the expected architecture for the two missions. The 2016 satellite will launch on a Russian Proton rocket and go into orbit to investigate the Martian atmosphere. The absence of the US means Europe and Russia will have to provide instruments that will no longer be sourced through Nasa. The idea that the satellite despatches a small static lander to the surface is retained, but the Russians are now expected to take a very prominent role on this part of the mission. One bonus will be the provision by Russia of a radioisotope battery to maintain the life of the lander and its instruments on the surface for many months. Esa had earlier only planned for surface operation lasting just a few hours. Some derivative of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) technology used to put the surface package on Mars in 2016 will now also probably be used to place the 2018 rover on the planet. The Russians will produce most of the hardware, but Europe will handle some key elements such as the guidance and navigation systems. Like the 2016 satellite, the 2018 rover will be despatched to Mars on a Proton. The design for the six-wheeled robot rover goes back to the one envisaged before Europe thought about teaming up with the US, meaning it will be in the 300kg class. It will carry an exobiology instrument suite, known as \"Pasteur\", to look for signs of past or present life.

Our people are mobilised and highly motivated,\" he told journalists. Key to the schedule is the participation of the Russian space agency (Roscosmos), which stepped in to partner Europe on ExoMars when the Americans abruptly scaled back their involvement because of budgetary problems within the US space agency (Nasa) in 2012. Sub-surface drill: Russia is providing two of the four instruments for the 2016 orbiter, as well the 1.8-tonne landing mechanism that aims to place the rover gently on Mars in early 2019. Roscosmos will also pick up the bill for the two Proton rockets that will launch both missions from Earth. \"These contracts make ExoMars more and more of a reality,\" commented Esa director general Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"I shall not go over the difficulties we had in putting ExoMars together. It took some time and energy from a lot of parties, in particular from industry.

This would outline in fine detail just what was expected of Europe and Russia on the two missions, he explained. ExoMars was formally initiated in Europe by ministers in 2005, and with Monday's contracts Esa has now committed 643m euros on developing the technology. The 2016 TGO will try to track down the sources of methane that have been observed at Mars. The gas's presence in the atmosphere is intriguing and could conceivably indicate biological activity on the planet. A major role for the satellite also will be to provide the communications relay for the 2018 rover. This is one aspect the Americans have agreed to continue to supply. The six-wheeled ExoMars rover will look for signs of past or present life. It will do something no robot has ever done at the planet - that is to drill 2m into the ground.

Key to the schedule is the participation of the Russian space agency (Roscosmos), which stepped in to partner Europe on ExoMars when the Americans abruptly scaled back their involvement because of budgetary problems within the US space agency (Nasa) in 2012. Sub-surface drill: Russia is providing two of the four instruments for the 2016 orbiter, as well the 1.8-tonne landing mechanism that aims to place the rover gently on Mars in early 2019. Roscosmos will also pick up the bill for the two Proton rockets that will launch both missions from Earth. \"These contracts make ExoMars more and more of a reality,\" commented Esa director general Jean-Jacques Dordain. \"I shall not go over the difficulties we had in putting ExoMars together. It took some time and energy from a lot of parties, in particular from industry.

Russia is in charge of building the rocket-powered landing system for the rover, which is designed to search for signs of past and present life on Mars. The ExoMars rover will also drill up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) beneath the rust-colored Martian soil and look for biological markers encased in the planet's bedrock. There, the markers would be protected from the damaging radiation and chemical processes present at the planet's surface. The ExoMars program comprises two missions, a Trace Gas Orbiter with a stationary lander set for launch in January 2016, and a 660-pound (300 kilograms) rover scheduled to depart Earth in May 2018. The missions have a collective cost of about 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion). \"This latter mission remains unique, and when it's launched in 2018, it will be a major innovation compared with anything that's happened to date on the surface of Mars,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, director-general of the European Space Agency (ESA). ExoMars has overcome technological, political and financial problems since ESA's member states approved the program in 2005, but hurdles remain. ESA has not yet secured full funding for the two-mission program, which saw its cost spike when NASA pulled out of the ExoMars project in 2012, with the American agency citing its own inadequate budget. NASA had promised to provide two Atlas 5 rockets to launch the European-built orbiter and rover, plus a \"sky crane\" landing system based on technology used on the Curiosity rover mission. With NASA's retreat from the program, European officials turned to Russia. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, will launch both ExoMars missions on Proton rockets from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and Russia also took over NASA's role in building the rover's all-important entry, descent and landing craft. But Mars has not been kind to Russia historically. Since achieving the first soft landing on Mars in 1971, Russia has never repeated the feat. The country's last two attempted Mars missions never got beyond Earth orbit. \"That is why they are coming with us,\" joked Vincenzo Giorgio, vice president of exploration and science at Thales Alenia Space, prime contractor for ESA's ExoMars missions, speaking about the Russians. \"They become lucky with us.\" In addition to the rover, ESA is responsible for the 2018 mission's carrier module and significant components of the descent system that will guide the rover through the Martian atmosphere to a gentle touchdown. \"During the discussion, we told [Russia] we are not going to fly our rover on a brand new system,\" Giorgio said. According to Giorgio, Russia's rover landing design will incorporate elements of Europe's entry, descent and landing demonstrator, an immobile craft riding as a piggyback module on the 2016 orbiter. The Russians \"will have their own descent module, but the shape is not much different from the one before, in 2016,\" Giorgio said. \"The final landing system is not based on airbags. It will be based on landing legs, but the key sensors, as well as parts of algorithms for guidance, navigation and control, the radars and that kind of stuff will come from us.\" Europe is also developing a parachute for the rover, while Russia will fabricate the lander's metal structure and heat shield, supply the descent module's braking rockets and build the separation systems required to open the system's aerodynamic shell before landing, according to Jorge Vago, ESA's ExoMars project scientist. Giorgio said ESA's contributions to the landing system increase his confidence the mission will succeed. \"We will have a rather strong cooperation with Russia,\" Giorgio said. \"There is a lot of experience that will be gained in 2016 to mitigate the risks for 2018, in spite of the fact the descent module will not be led by Europe. It will be led by Russia.\" ESA also plans to tap into NASA's expertise in landing on Mars, said Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division and acting director of the agency's Mars robotic exploration program. Green said ESA has invited NASA experts to participate in design reviews and give advice to Europe, which itself has never achieved a successful landing on Mars. NASA's contributions will be subject to arms trade restrictions, which classify some space technologies as military munitions. \"We stand ready to lend our expertise and help in any way we can to help ESA get to the surface of Mars,\" Green said. NASA remains a junior partner in ExoMars, having committed only to helping the mission with communications support through an Electra relay radio and by furnishing parts for an instrument on the rover that will analyze soil for organic constituents. Once the rover is on the Martian surface, controllers will activate the solar-powered robot and command it to drive off of the Russian landing platform to begin its six-month primary mission.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/europe-confident-exomars-rover-will-end-russias-bad-luck-mars-6c10619170"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Europe's 2016 Mars Mission Enters Final Construction Phase", "date": "2013-06-18", "content": "Europe's next mission to Mars has passed a key milestone to enter its final construction phase in pursuit of a planned 2016 launch toward the Red Planet. European Space Agency officials signed the last construction contract for the 2016 ExoMars mission today (June 17), a deal between ESA and the Mars orbiter's prime contractor Thales Alenia Space. The ExoMars orbiter mission aims to send a methane-sniffing orbiter and a landing demonstrator to the Red Planet. \"The award of this contract provides continuity to the work of the industrial team members of Thales Alenia Space on this complex mission, and will ensure that it remains on track for launch in January 2016,\" Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's director of science and robotic exploration, said in a statement. The ExoMars mission, a partnership between ESA and the Russian space agency Roscomos, aims to search for signs of past or present life on Mars. Two launches are planned, one in 2016 and another two years later. The 2016 portion of the mission includes two main components - the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will hunt for methane and other atmospheric gases that could be produced by lifeforms on the Red Planet; and the Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module, which will prove out technologies needed for the 2018 phase and future Mars missions. The main piece of the 2018 launch is a rover capable of drilling 6.6 feet (2 meters) into the Red Planet dirt. Scientists are keen to collect samples from such depths, which are sheltered from the cold, dry and radiation-bombed Martian surface. The new contract with Thales Alenia Space is worth about 230 million euros ($307 million at current exchange rates), Space News reported. ESA's financial obligation for the entire two-launch ExoMars mission is 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), agency officials have said. ExoMars was originally conceived as a partnership involving ESA and NASA, but budget cuts led to the U.S. space agency's withdrawal from the project in 2012.

Known jointly as ExoMars, the missions have come perilously close to cancellation on a number of occasions. They now look much more secure. \"It will still be tough, I have to say that. But I am more confident than I have been in a long time that ExoMars will now happen,\" Prof Alvaro Gimenez told BBC News. The director of science at the European Space Agency (Esa) signed contracts on Monday totalling 216m euros with the missions' prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space (TAS). The majority of the funds, 146m euros, should ensure the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is ready for launch in January 2016. Money question: It should also guarantee the satellite's descent module is completed on time. This will be released at Mars to prove Europe's ability to land on the Red Planet.

It will also deploy the ESA Schiaparelli Mars landing demonstration craft and provide communications support for ESA ExoMars Rover and a Russian Lander planned for launch in 2018. Twin Electra ultra-high frequency (UHF) radios on the TGO will provide communication links with robots on the Martian surface -- rovers or landers. Relay of information from Mars-surface craft to Mars orbiters, then from Mars orbit to Earth, enables receiving much more data from the surface missions than would otherwise be possible. \"We are fortifying our partnership with Europe to strengthen the Mars relay network together,\" said Phillip Barela of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, project manager for NASA's participation in ExoMars. The Electra radio design from JPL includes special features for relay use between an orbiter and a rover or stationary lander. For example, it can actively adjust the data rate during a communication session -- slower when the orbiter is near the horizon from the surface robot's perspective, faster when it is overhead. NASA's Curiosity Mars rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter already use Electra technology for relay of data. A NASA orbiter currently on the way to Mars, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, also carries an Electra radio. Plans call for the TGO to use its Electra radios for communication with ESA's 2018 ExoMars Rover and Russia's Lander as well as with NASA's 2016 Mars lander and 2020 Mars rover. The first Electra radio for the TGO was delivered June 17, 2014. The second is on track for delivery in September. The planned orbit for the TGO is an advantageous one for providing relay duty.

A convoy carrying the two Mars-bound components of the ExoMars 2016 mission, plus a load of ground support equipment, left the Thales Alenia Space factory in Cannes, France, on Dec. 17 en route to Turin, Italy, where three Antonov An-124 cargo flights would take the hardware to Kazakhstan. The three Antonov transport planes departed Turin-Casselle Airport on Dec. 18, Dec. 20 and Dec. 22, carrying equipment to help prepare ExoMars for launch, the Schiaparelli lander and the Trace Gas Orbiter, respectively. The last shipment arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Dec. 23 after a customs check in Moscow, and ground crews unloaded the spacecraft containers into a clean room to start the launch campaign. One of the first tasks at the launch site will be to set up a temporary tent inside the satellite processing facility at Baikonur. The covering will ensure the Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli are free of contaminants, keeping with stringent \"planetary protection\" protocols aimed at safeguarding Mars from Earth microbes. The Baikonur Cosmodrome currently does not have a facility that meets Western planetary protection requirements, according to Walter Cugno, ExoMars program director at Thales Alenia Space, the mission's prime contractor. The European Space Agency and Roscosmos - the Russian space agency - signed a final agreement in 2013 to collaborate on the ExoMars program. Russia took over much of the work originally assigned to NASA, such as the provision of launchers and a rover descent package, before the U.S. space agency withdrew from the missions due to budget constraints. Then teams will initially prepare the two spacecraft for launch separately. Ground crews planned to work nonstop over the holidays to keep the mission on schedule for its March 14 launch date, and perhaps gain some breathing room in the schedule in case something goes wrong closer to liftoff. The Schiaparelli lander, covered in golden insulation and shaped like a flying saucer, will receive propellants for its descent rockets beginning around Jan. 29, according to Cugno. With a full load of fuel, the lander will weigh about 600 kilograms, or 1,322 pounds. Schiaparelli is based on a simplified design, relying on internal batteries and not recharging solar panels for electricity, and cushioned by a \"crushable\" carbon-fiber structure instead of landing legs or airbags. The lander is stationary, carrying a weather station and sensors programmed to collect data on the layers of the Martian atmosphere during its descent. Engineers expect Schiaparelli to survive between two and four days - or up to eight days if conditions are benign. It is an introductory course to entry, descent and landing at Mars for Europe, which would become the third entity after the United States and Russia to achieve a successful touchdown on the red planet. Workers will hoist the Schiaparelli lander on top of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter around Feb. 12. The duo will remain attached until Oct. 16, when the lander will separate from the mothership three days before arriving at Mars. A three-day procedure to pump 2.3 metric tons of propellants into the Trace Gas Orbiter is scheduled for Feb. 21-24. Combined operations between the spacecraft and launcher authorities will begin Feb. 26. In the final weeks before liftoff, Russian teams connect the ExoMars spacecraft to the Proton rocket's Breeze M upper stage, enclose it within the launcher's nose shroud, then roll out the booster for fueling with its mixture of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants. Launch on March 14 is currently set for approximately 0930 GMT, according to Jorge Vago, ESA's ExoMars project scientist. The ExoMars orbiter and lander will be the only Mars mission launching in 2016 after NASA's announcement last week that the InSight probe will remain on Earth until at least 2018. The InSight lander's seismometer instrument built to search for quakes on Mars ran into problems with its vacuum enclosure, forcing a delay in the mission's launch at least until the next Mars launch opportunity in May 2018, the same month Europe's ExoMars rover is scheduled for liftoff.

A Russian-made Proton-M rocket carrying the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Schiaparelli lander - which together constitute the first part of the two-phase, European-led ExoMars mission - rolled out to the pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan today (March 11) and was hoisted into vertical position. Technicians had filled the Proton's Breeze upper stage with propellant and oxidizer yesterday (March 10), European Space Agency (ESA) officials said.

You can watch the ExoMars launch live here at Space.com, courtesy of ESA. After liftoff, TGO and Schiaparelli will cruise through deep space for seven months, arriving at the Red Planet in October. The pair will separate on Oct. 16. A few days later, TGO will set up shop in Mars orbit, beginning a five-year study of the planet's atmosphere that focuses on a hunt for methane - a gas that could be produced by living organisms, if any exist on the Red Planet. Schiaparelli, meanwhile, will aim to pull off Europe's first-ever successful landing on Mars, with touchdown scheduled for Oct. 19. (ESA's Beagle 2 lander apparently settled softly on the planet in December 2003, but it never contacted its controllers after that.) ESA wants Schiaparelli to gather environmental data on the surface for as long as its batteries last (likely two to eight days, ESA officials have said). But the lander's main purpose is to prove out entry, descent and landing technologies that will help get the second main component of the ExoMars program - a deep-drilling, life-hunting rover due to launch in 2018 - onto the red dirt safely. TGO's observations will help mission planners select a landing site for this rover, and the orbiter will help relay data from the wheeled robot to Earth after it touches down. NASA was ESA's main partner on ExoMars until early 2012, when the American space agency dropped out, citing budget issues. Russia then came onboard as partner.

TGO's two solar arrays deployed shortly after radio contact was established, European Space Agency (ESA) officials announced via Twitter. \"We have a mission, and for the second time, Europe is going to Mars!\" ExoMars flight operations director Michel Denis said from ESA's control center in Darmstadt, Germany, just after TGO's signal was received. \"Go, go, go, ExoMars!\" he said. The European Space Agency's (ESA) first Mars mission was Mars Express, which launched an orbiter and a lander in 2003. The orbiter is still operating at the Red Planet, but mission controllers lost contact with the lander, known as Beagle 2, shortly before it touched down. TGO and Schiaparelli will now cruise through space for another seven months. If all goes according to plan, the pair will separate on Oct. 16; three days later, TGO will be captured into Mars orbit, and Schiaparelli will make its way to the Red Planet's surface for a soft landing. TGO's main goal is to hunt for methane, a possible sign of Mars life, in the planet's atmosphere. The spacecraft will also map subsurface hydrogen deposits and scout out possible landing sites for the second phase of the ExoMars program, a life-hunting rover that's scheduled to launch in 2018. (TGO will also serve as a communications relay between that rover and mission control back on Earth.) Schiaparelli will gather some environmental data on the Martian surface for a few days, but the probe's main job is to test out entry, descent and landing technologies for the 2018 rover. ESA is partnering with Russia's federal space agency, known as Roscosmos, on the ExoMars program.

It looks good for the commissioning, so far, from the small fraction of it.\" The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander are due to arrive at Mars on Oct. 19, the first European Space Agency mission to the red planet since 2003. The craft are making the interplanetary cruise as one, making the combined probe one of the largest ever sent to Mars. The orbiter carries sensors to detect gases in the Martian atmosphere such as methane, which could be a telltale sign of microbial life or previously unseen geologic activity involving liquid water. It also has a mapping camera to survey the planet's landscape and an instrument to search for water hiding in Mars' crust. The lander's primary goal is technological: demonstrating Europe's ability to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars. Schiaparelli will only last a few days after touchdown, but it should beam back images from its descent and weather reports from the surface. \"After the critical first few days in space, TGO is performing flawlessly,\" Denis said. \"Over the next two weeks we will continue to check and commission its systems, including the power, communications, startrackers, and guidance and navigation system.\" The mission blasted off March 14 on top of a Russian Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Proton booster's Breeze M upper stage deployed the ExoMars spacecraft nearly 11 hours after launch, following a set of four maneuvers to guide the Mars probe away from Earth. The launch was right on target, Denis said Tuesday. \"From the information we obtained from tracking, the error from injection was 1.5 meters per second, so extremely small,\" Denis said. The Proton/Breeze M accelerated the 4,335-kilogram spacecraft to a velocity of 33,001 kilometers per hour relative to Earth, according to ESA. An apparent explosion of the Breeze M upper stage after it parted ways from the ExoMars should have no impact on the spacecraft, according to Denis. A report published on the website of Popular Mechanics magazine indicated the Breeze M stage apparently broke apart after releasing ExoMars. The upper stage, which burns a mixture of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, was supposed to ignite its main engine after the separation of the ExoMars orbiter to veer on a different trajectory from the Mars-bound spacecraft. Imagery obtained late March 14 from OASI Observatory in Brazil, and released by ESA three days later, appears to show at least nine fragments from the Breeze M rocket stage speeding through space. While ESA initially said the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter appeared in the imagery, officials on Wednesday updated the caption to the animated image posted above. \"Following additional analysis by teams at ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center, it has become clear that TGO is in fact not in this image - it was already further ahead and beyond the frame,\" officials wrote on the agency's website. \"Thus all of the moving objects in this image are related to the Breeze M.\" The Breeze M should have been in two pieces after the launch - the rocket stage's main body and a detachable fuel tank. Denis told Spaceflight Now that ExoMars managers in Europe have received no information on the potential explosion from Russian launch authorities. Popular Mechanics reported the ExoMars orbiter could have been damaged by the explosion, and further checks of the craft's science instruments are needed to ensure the probe has no ill effects from the anomaly. While the ExoMars spacecraft and the Breeze M were still relatively close, the distance was large enough to ensure there is \"no risk at all\" to the Mars mission, Denis said. \"If it's true, and if it's true that this explosion took place a couple of hours after separation, then the separation was huge - many kilometers - so there is no risk at all,\" Denis said. \"We definitely have not seen anything on the spacecraft with dynamics. Of course, we don't have pictures, but if this explosion had taken place shortly after separation, there might have been an impact, and the spacecraft might have seen something anomalous near it, but we didn't see anything.\" Engineers at the ExoMars control center in Germany finished an initial round of activation and tests of the Mars-bound spacecraft March 17. The next day, controllers commenced with commissioning - a set of thorough systems checks - to verify the probe is fully functional. The orbiter's 2.2-meter steerable high-gain antenna has been deployed and pointed along each axis, Denis said. \"I think we have explored, more or less, all the range,\" Denis said. \"It is not yet used for communications with the Earth because we are still too close, but this will be done one week from now.\" Critical activities still to come include the switch-on of the Trace Gas Orbiter's four science instruments beginning April 4. A U.S.-built Electra radio provided by NASA will be turned on April 1 to check its health. The Electra radio will relay commands and scientific data between Earth and landers on the surface of Mars, such as Schiaparelli, the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, and future robots in development by NASA and Europe. The telecom relay is a faster way to transfer information than via a direct link. Commissioning of the Schiaparelli landing craft should begin April 8, Denis said. The lander briefly turned on shortly after last week's launch, confirming it survived the rumbling blastoff. \"Schiaparelli was switched on for a few minutes and switched off again, so we know that it works, and it generated packets,\" Denis said. \"We haven't looked into those. That will be the goal of commissioning in three weeks, but we know it survived the launch.\" Another key test still ahead for ExoMars is the first firing of the orbiter's main engine July 18. That will be followed by a major mid-course correction maneuver July 28 to bend the craft's trajectory toward Mars. The orbiter's smaller rocket thrusters have all passed their post-launch tests. \"We have tested all the thrusters - all the little engines - one by one such that all thrusters and all redundant thrusters are known to function properly,\" Denis said in a phone interview. Smaller correction burns are planned in August, September and in the weeks before arrival at Mars to use the orbiter to precisely aim the Schiaparelli lander toward its touchdown target in Meridiani Planum, a flat plain near the Martian equator. That leads up to separation of Schiaparelli from the Trace Gas Orbiter on Oct. 16, followed 12 hours later by another maneuver to put the orbiter on a path to miss Mars. The make-or-break engine burn to put the ExoMars mothership in orbit will last more than two hours, during which the Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere and engage a supersonic parachute, braking rockets and a novel crushable carbon fiber shield to make a safe landing. The simultaneous orbit insertion and landing operations require careful planning by the team led by Denis. Controllers are already rehearsing how they will handle the workload. But when arrival day comes, the ground team will only be able to monitor the critical maneuvers. The events are so quickly paced, and the distance between Earth and Mars so great, that engineers will be unable to intervene. It will take nearly 10 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to ExoMars on Oct. 19. With the spacecraft now taking aim on Mars, the only minor problem detected since the launch was an unexpected temperature rise inside the orbiter's main engine. Engineers from ESA and Thales Alenia Space, the craft's prime contractor, decided to change the orbiter's orientation in space by a few degrees to avoid pointing the engine directly toward the sun. The adjustment resolved the issue. \"It's obvious that the European industry who built ExoMars has done an excellent job,\" Denis said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/23/europes-exomars-orbiter-smoothly-cruising-toward-red-planet/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "European Mars probe arrives at launch site", "date": "2015-12-27", "content": "Three heavy-duty Antonov cargo planes flew components of Europe's ExoMars orbiter and lander from Italy to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazkhastan last week, setting up for a March 14 launch toward the red planet.

The spacecraft will also map subsurface hydrogen deposits and scout out possible landing sites for the second phase of the ExoMars program, a life-hunting rover that's scheduled to launch in 2018. (TGO will also serve as a communications relay between that rover and mission control back on Earth.) Schiaparelli will gather some environmental data on the Martian surface for a few days, but the probe's main job is to test out entry, descent and landing technologies for the 2018 rover. ESA is partnering with Russia's federal space agency, known as Roscosmos, on the ExoMars program. The Russian agency is providing Proton rockets for both launches, the landing system for the 2018 rover and some scientific instruments. NASA was ESA's original ExoMars partner, but the American space agency dropped out of the project in early 2012, citing budget issues.", "url": "https://www.space.com/32268-exomars-2016-mission-headed-to-mars.html"}, {"title": "Europe's ExoMars orbiter smoothly cruising toward red planet", "date": "2016-03-23", "content": "Ground controllers are running Europe's ExoMars orbiter through a post-launch checkup a week after its successful liftoff aboard a Proton rocket, and a first look at the probe's systems revealed no problems, the mission's flight director said Tuesday. \"We've been switching on and testing all the systems, including redundant components in certain areas, the antenna, the attitude control system,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. \"We have done a test maneuver, which was very accurate. It looks good for the commissioning, so far, from the small fraction of it.\" The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander are due to arrive at Mars on Oct. 19, the first European Space Agency mission to the red planet since 2003. The craft are making the interplanetary cruise as one, making the combined probe one of the largest ever sent to Mars. The orbiter carries sensors to detect gases in the Martian atmosphere such as methane, which could be a telltale sign of microbial life or previously unseen geologic activity involving liquid water. It also has a mapping camera to survey the planet's landscape and an instrument to search for water hiding in Mars' crust. The lander's primary goal is technological: demonstrating Europe's ability to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars. Schiaparelli will only last a few days after touchdown, but it should beam back images from its descent and weather reports from the surface. \"After the critical first few days in space, TGO is performing flawlessly,\" Denis said. \"Over the next two weeks we will continue to check and commission its systems, including the power, communications, startrackers, and guidance and navigation system.\" The mission blasted off March 14 on top of a Russian Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Proton booster's Breeze M upper stage deployed the ExoMars spacecraft nearly 11 hours after launch, following a set of four maneuvers to guide the Mars probe away from Earth. The launch was right on target, Denis said Tuesday. \"From the information we obtained from tracking, the error from injection was 1.5 meters per second, so extremely small,\" Denis said. The Proton/Breeze M accelerated the 4,335-kilogram spacecraft to a velocity of 33,001 kilometers per hour relative to Earth, according to ESA. An apparent explosion of the Breeze M upper stage after it parted ways from the ExoMars should have no impact on the spacecraft, according to Denis. A report published on the website of Popular Mechanics magazine indicated the Breeze M stage apparently broke apart after releasing ExoMars. The upper stage, which burns a mixture of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, was supposed to ignite its main engine after the separation of the ExoMars orbiter to veer on a different trajectory from the Mars-bound spacecraft. Imagery obtained late March 14 from OASI Observatory in Brazil, and released by ESA three days later, appears to show at least nine fragments from the Breeze M rocket stage speeding through space. While ESA initially said the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter appeared in the imagery, officials on Wednesday updated the caption to the animated image posted above. \"Following additional analysis by teams at ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center, it has become clear that TGO is in fact not in this image - it was already further ahead and beyond the frame,\" officials wrote on the agency's website. \"Thus all of the moving objects in this image are related to the Breeze M.\" The Breeze M should have been in two pieces after the launch - the rocket stage's main body and a detachable fuel tank. Denis told Spaceflight Now that ExoMars managers in Europe have received no information on the potential explosion from Russian launch authorities. Popular Mechanics reported the ExoMars orbiter could have been damaged by the explosion, and further checks of the craft's science instruments are needed to ensure the probe has no ill effects from the anomaly. While the ExoMars spacecraft and the Breeze M were still relatively close, the distance was large enough to ensure there is \"no risk at all\" to the Mars mission, Denis said. \"If it's true, and if it's true that this explosion took place a couple of hours after separation, then the separation was huge - many kilometers - so there is no risk at all,\" Denis said. \"We definitely have not seen anything on the spacecraft with dynamics. Of course, we don't have pictures, but if this explosion had taken place shortly after separation, there might have been an impact, and the spacecraft might have seen something anomalous near it, but we didn't see anything.\" Engineers at the ExoMars control center in Germany finished an initial round of activation and tests of the Mars-bound spacecraft March 17. The next day, controllers commenced with commissioning - a set of thorough systems checks - to verify the probe is fully functional. The orbiter's 2.2-meter steerable high-gain antenna has been deployed and pointed along each axis, Denis said. \"I think we have explored, more or less, all the range,\" Denis said. \"It is not yet used for communications with the Earth because we are still too close, but this will be done one week from now.\" Critical activities still to come include the switch-on of the Trace Gas Orbiter's four science instruments beginning April 4. A U.S.-built Electra radio provided by NASA will be turned on April 1 to check its health. The Electra radio will relay commands and scientific data between Earth and landers on the surface of Mars, such as Schiaparelli, the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, and future robots in development by NASA and Europe. The telecom relay is a faster way to transfer information than via a direct link. Commissioning of the Schiaparelli landing craft should begin April 8, Denis said. The lander briefly turned on shortly after last week's launch, confirming it survived the rumbling blastoff. \"Schiaparelli was switched on for a few minutes and switched off again, so we know that it works, and it generated packets,\" Denis said. \"We haven't looked into those. That will be the goal of commissioning in three weeks, but we know it survived the launch.\" Another key test still ahead for ExoMars is the first firing of the orbiter's main engine July 18. That will be followed by a major mid-course correction maneuver July 28 to bend the craft's trajectory toward Mars. The orbiter's smaller rocket thrusters have all passed their post-launch tests. \"We have tested all the thrusters - all the little engines - one by one such that all thrusters and all redundant thrusters are known to function properly,\" Denis said in a phone interview. Smaller correction burns are planned in August, September and in the weeks before arrival at Mars to use the orbiter to precisely aim the Schiaparelli lander toward its touchdown target in Meridiani Planum, a flat plain near the Martian equator. That leads up to separation of Schiaparelli from the Trace Gas Orbiter on Oct. 16, followed 12 hours later by another maneuver to put the orbiter on a path to miss Mars. The make-or-break engine burn to put the ExoMars mothership in orbit will last more than two hours, during which the Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere and engage a supersonic parachute, braking rockets and a novel crushable carbon fiber shield to make a safe landing. The simultaneous orbit insertion and landing operations require careful planning by the team led by Denis. Controllers are already rehearsing how they will handle the workload. But when arrival day comes, the ground team will only be able to monitor the critical maneuvers. The events are so quickly paced, and the distance between Earth and Mars so great, that engineers will be unable to intervene. It will take nearly 10 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to ExoMars on Oct. 19. With the spacecraft now taking aim on Mars, the only minor problem detected since the launch was an unexpected temperature rise inside the orbiter's main engine. Engineers from ESA and Thales Alenia Space, the craft's prime contractor, decided to change the orbiter's orientation in space by a few degrees to avoid pointing the engine directly toward the sun. The adjustment resolved the issue. \"It's obvious that the European industry who built ExoMars has done an excellent job,\" Denis said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/23/europes-exomars-orbiter-smoothly-cruising-toward-red-planet/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "ExoMars Spacecraft Roll Out to Launchpad for Monday's Liftoff", "date": "2016-03-12", "content": "The next robotic mission to Mars has rolled out to the launchpad ahead of its liftoff, which is planned for Monday (March 14).

On June 13, the mission's Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), currently on its way to Mars, took an image of the planet from 25 million miles (41 million kilometers) away, close enough for some light and dark patches on the planet to be visible. The new images are just a start for ExoMars, which is jointly managed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Though some Earth-based observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, can take better pictures of Mars, the TGO images confirm that the instruments are focused and working as predicted, ESA officials said in a statement. When TGO draws closer to the Red Planet, pictures from the mission will exceed the quality of those that can be captured by Earth-based telescopes by the second week of October, according to the statement. TGO will do a course correction on July 28 and then enter orbit around Mars on Oct. 19. Its main mission is to search for gas sources on the planet's surface (such as volcanoes) and rare gases, particularly methane. TGO will reach orbit on the same day that another piece of the ExoMars mission, called Schiaparelli, lands on the surface of the Red Planet. Schiaparelli's mission is to test entry, descent and landing technology for a future Mars rover. Classifying Mars' methane sources has been a difficult task for scientists. Telescopes pointed at Mars have revealed wildly different measurements. Even NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars, which detected a one-time spike in methane for a few weeks in 2013 and 2014, later found that the spike was not linked to seasonal change. Methane can indicate biological activity (for example, from microbes) or geological activity from features such as volcanoes.

While the ExoMars spacecraft and the Breeze M were still relatively close, the distance was large enough to ensure there is \"no risk at all\" to the Mars mission, Denis said. \"If it's true, and if it's true that this explosion took place a couple of hours after separation, then the separation was huge - many kilometers - so there is no risk at all,\" Denis said. \"We definitely have not seen anything on the spacecraft with dynamics. Of course, we don't have pictures, but if this explosion had taken place shortly after separation, there might have been an impact, and the spacecraft might have seen something anomalous near it, but we didn't see anything.\" Engineers at the ExoMars control center in Germany finished an initial round of activation and tests of the Mars-bound spacecraft March 17. The next day, controllers commenced with commissioning - a set of thorough systems checks - to verify the probe is fully functional. The orbiter's 2.2-meter steerable high-gain antenna has been deployed and pointed along each axis, Denis said. \"I think we have explored, more or less, all the range,\" Denis said. \"It is not yet used for communications with the Earth because we are still too close, but this will be done one week from now.\" Critical activities still to come include the switch-on of the Trace Gas Orbiter's four science instruments beginning April 4. A U.S.-built Electra radio provided by NASA will be turned on April 1 to check its health. The Electra radio will relay commands and scientific data between Earth and landers on the surface of Mars, such as Schiaparelli, the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, and future robots in development by NASA and Europe. The telecom relay is a faster way to transfer information than via a direct link. Commissioning of the Schiaparelli landing craft should begin April 8, Denis said. The lander briefly turned on shortly after last week's launch, confirming it survived the rumbling blastoff. \"Schiaparelli was switched on for a few minutes and switched off again, so we know that it works, and it generated packets,\" Denis said. \"We haven't looked into those. That will be the goal of commissioning in three weeks, but we know it survived the launch.\" Another key test still ahead for ExoMars is the first firing of the orbiter's main engine July 18. That will be followed by a major mid-course correction maneuver July 28 to bend the craft's trajectory toward Mars. The orbiter's smaller rocket thrusters have all passed their post-launch tests. \"We have tested all the thrusters - all the little engines - one by one such that all thrusters and all redundant thrusters are known to function properly,\" Denis said in a phone interview. Smaller correction burns are planned in August, September and in the weeks before arrival at Mars to use the orbiter to precisely aim the Schiaparelli lander toward its touchdown target in Meridiani Planum, a flat plain near the Martian equator. That leads up to separation of Schiaparelli from the Trace Gas Orbiter on Oct. 16, followed 12 hours later by another maneuver to put the orbiter on a path to miss Mars. The make-or-break engine burn to put the ExoMars mothership in orbit will last more than two hours, during which the Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere and engage a supersonic parachute, braking rockets and a novel crushable carbon fiber shield to make a safe landing. The simultaneous orbit insertion and landing operations require careful planning by the team led by Denis. Controllers are already rehearsing how they will handle the workload. But when arrival day comes, the ground team will only be able to monitor the critical maneuvers. The events are so quickly paced, and the distance between Earth and Mars so great, that engineers will be unable to intervene. It will take nearly 10 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to ExoMars on Oct. 19. With the spacecraft now taking aim on Mars, the only minor problem detected since the launch was an unexpected temperature rise inside the orbiter's main engine. Engineers from ESA and Thales Alenia Space, the craft's prime contractor, decided to change the orbiter's orientation in space by a few degrees to avoid pointing the engine directly toward the sun. The adjustment resolved the issue. \"It's obvious that the European industry who built ExoMars has done an excellent job,\" Denis said.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/23/europes-exomars-orbiter-smoothly-cruising-toward-red-planet/"}, {"title": "European Mars Spacecraft Sees Its Destination from Afar", "date": "2016-06-23", "content": "The ExoMars mission has caught its first glimpse of the Red Planet. On June 13, the mission's Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), currently on its way to Mars, took an image of the planet from 25 million miles (41 million kilometers) away, close enough for some light and dark patches on the planet to be visible. The new images are just a start for ExoMars, which is jointly managed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Though some Earth-based observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, can take better pictures of Mars, the TGO images confirm that the instruments are focused and working as predicted, ESA officials said in a statement. When TGO draws closer to the Red Planet, pictures from the mission will exceed the quality of those that can be captured by Earth-based telescopes by the second week of October, according to the statement. TGO will do a course correction on July 28 and then enter orbit around Mars on Oct. 19. Its main mission is to search for gas sources on the planet's surface (such as volcanoes) and rare gases, particularly methane. TGO will reach orbit on the same day that another piece of the ExoMars mission, called Schiaparelli, lands on the surface of the Red Planet. Schiaparelli's mission is to test entry, descent and landing technology for a future Mars rover. Classifying Mars' methane sources has been a difficult task for scientists. Telescopes pointed at Mars have revealed wildly different measurements. Even NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars, which detected a one-time spike in methane for a few weeks in 2013 and 2014, later found that the spike was not linked to seasonal change. Methane can indicate biological activity (for example, from microbes) or geological activity from features such as volcanoes. ExoMars will take place in two parts, with a rover following the TGO and Schiaparelli in 2020.

Composed of an orbiting mothership fitted with scientific instruments and the Schiaparelli landing module, the ExoMars spacecraft ignited its main engine at 0930 GMT Thursday for 52 minutes, the European Space Agency said. Generating about 95 pounds of thrust, the engine was supposed to adjust the spacecraft's velocity by about 730 mph, providing most of the required impulse to aim for Schiaparelli's landing in Meridiani Planum. \"Today's burn was the biggest of the four planned that will enable ExoMars to intercept Mars and precisely deliver the Schiaparelli lander on 19 October onto Meridiani Planum, a large, flat region near the equator,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. Thursday's deep space maneuver - planned since before the mission's March 14 launch - provided about 95 percent of the propulsive force needed to correct the ExoMars spacecraft's trajectory. A \"clean-up\" maneuver is planned Aug. 11 to do most of the remaining work to guide Schiaparelli toward its landing site. Even smaller trim maneuvers are scheduled for Sept. 19 and Oct. 14 before the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander separate Oct. 16. Around 12 hours after the lander deploys, the orbiter will fire its engine again to get on the correct path to enter orbit around Mars. A lengthy 134-minute main engine firing Oct. 19 will slow the probe's speed enough for Martian gravity to capture it into orbit. Measuring nearly 8 feet in diameter with its heat shield, the saucer-shaped Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere during the make-or-break engine firing aboard the Trace Gas Orbiter, making the events of Oct. 19 doubly important. While its engine is burning for the critical orbit insertion maneuver, the ExoMars mothership will listen for status signals radioed from the descending Schiaparelli lander, Denis said. \"At the same time, TGO is flying over and with its radio provided by NASA will be recording the signal of the entry, descent and landing of Schiaparelli ... And it will nonetheless continue burning up to the moment when the burn is finished,\" Denis said. Giant 230-foot dish antennas from NASA's Deep Space Network will support the ExoMars mission's arrival, and an array of 30 radio telescopes in India will also listen for confirmation of Schiaparelli's landing. Europe's Mars Express orbiter and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will help relay signals from the Schiaparelli lander after touchdown. \"It's a huge ballet, a huge coordinated dance that will take place in these couple of days,\" Denis said. As of Thursday, the ExoMars spacecraft had traveled about 208 million miles since its March liftoff aboard a Russian Proton rocket, arcing away from the sun from Earth to intersect Mars' orbit in October. By the time it arrives at Mars, the craft will have traveled 308 million miles, according to ESA. Equipped with a downward-facing descent camera and a weather station, Schiaparelli is primarily a technology demonstrator with a prime objective of proving out heat shield, parachute, radar altimeter, and computer systems for use on future Mars missions. ESA plans to employ the same radar and computer design on a more ambitious joint European-Russian Mars lander to launch in 2020. That will be the second phase of the two-part ExoMars mission. If successful, the Italian-built Schiaparelli probe would become the first European spacecraft to set down on Mars and return data. The UK-led Beagle 2 lander touched down on Mars in 2003, but ran into trouble before it could contact Earth. Schiaparelli should operate on the Martian surface for several days, and perhaps up to a week, before its batteries run out of power. Meanwhile, the Trace Gas Orbiter will swing into a preliminary oval-shaped pathway around Mars taking the craft nearly 60,000 miles from the planet at its highest point. Next year, the orbiter will begin a series of dips into the outer layers of the Martian atmosphere, encountering air drag to reshape its course into a circular 250-mile-high orbit. The \"aerobreaking\" phase of the mission should be complete by November 2017, allowing the mission to commence regular science observations by the end of next year. The spacecraft's main purpose is to measure and map concentrations of trace gases, such as methane, in the Martian atmosphere, which could be an indicator of active geology or microbial life on the red planet. It will provide data 1,000 times more accurate than existing trace gas measurements, according to ESA, and help identify where sources of Martian methane, water vapor, acetylene, and other gases are located. Assembled by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France, the Trace Gas Orbiter also carries a camera to create maps of Mars, and a Russian instrument will locate hydrogen hidden a few feet in the Martian crust, revealing sites where water- ice deposits might be reachable by future human prospectors to turn into air, drinking water, or rocket fuel. A third goal of the mission is to pass commands and scientific data between Earth and rovers exploring the surface, including the ExoMars rover due for launch in 2020 and NASA's multiple landers.

A Russian-made Proton-M rocket carrying the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Schiaparelli lander - which together constitute the first part of the two-phase, European-led ExoMars mission - rolled out to the pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan today (March 11) and was hoisted into vertical position. Technicians had filled the Proton's Breeze upper stage with propellant and oxidizer yesterday (March 10), European Space Agency (ESA) officials said. If all goes according to plan, the Proton will blast off at 5:31 a.m. EDT (0931 GMT; 3:31 p.m. local Kazakhstan time) on Monday. You can watch the ExoMars launch live here at Space.com, courtesy of ESA. After liftoff, TGO and Schiaparelli will cruise through deep space for seven months, arriving at the Red Planet in October. The pair will separate on Oct. 16. A few days later, TGO will set up shop in Mars orbit, beginning a five-year study of the planet's atmosphere that focuses on a hunt for methane - a gas that could be produced by living organisms, if any exist on the Red Planet. Schiaparelli, meanwhile, will aim to pull off Europe's first-ever successful landing on Mars, with touchdown scheduled for Oct. 19. (ESA's Beagle 2 lander apparently settled softly on the planet in December 2003, but it never contacted its controllers after that.) ESA wants Schiaparelli to gather environmental data on the surface for as long as its batteries last (likely two to eight days, ESA officials have said). But the lander's main purpose is to prove out entry, descent and landing technologies that will help get the second main component of the ExoMars program - a deep-drilling, life-hunting rover due to launch in 2018 - onto the red dirt safely. TGO's observations will help mission planners select a landing site for this rover, and the orbiter will help relay data from the wheeled robot to Earth after it touches down. NASA was ESA's main partner on ExoMars until early 2012, when the American space agency dropped out, citing budget issues. Russia then came onboard as partner.

TGO's two solar arrays deployed shortly after radio contact was established, European Space Agency (ESA) officials announced via Twitter. \"We have a mission, and for the second time, Europe is going to Mars!\" ExoMars flight operations director Michel Denis said from ESA's control center in Darmstadt, Germany, just after TGO's signal was received. \"Go, go, go, ExoMars!\" he said. The European Space Agency's (ESA) first Mars mission was Mars Express, which launched an orbiter and a lander in 2003. The orbiter is still operating at the Red Planet, but mission controllers lost contact with the lander, known as Beagle 2, shortly before it touched down. TGO and Schiaparelli will now cruise through space for another seven months. If all goes according to plan, the pair will separate on Oct. 16; three days later, TGO will be captured into Mars orbit, and Schiaparelli will make its way to the Red Planet's surface for a soft landing. TGO's main goal is to hunt for methane, a possible sign of Mars life, in the planet's atmosphere. The spacecraft will also map subsurface hydrogen deposits and scout out possible landing sites for the second phase of the ExoMars program, a life-hunting rover that's scheduled to launch in 2018. (TGO will also serve as a communications relay between that rover and mission control back on Earth.) Schiaparelli will gather some environmental data on the Martian surface for a few days, but the probe's main job is to test out entry, descent and landing technologies for the 2018 rover. ESA is partnering with Russia's federal space agency, known as Roscosmos, on the ExoMars program.

It looks good for the commissioning, so far, from the small fraction of it.\" The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander are due to arrive at Mars on Oct. 19, the first European Space Agency mission to the red planet since 2003. The craft are making the interplanetary cruise as one, making the combined probe one of the largest ever sent to Mars. The orbiter carries sensors to detect gases in the Martian atmosphere such as methane, which could be a telltale sign of microbial life or previously unseen geologic activity involving liquid water. It also has a mapping camera to survey the planet's landscape and an instrument to search for water hiding in Mars' crust. The lander's primary goal is technological: demonstrating Europe's ability to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars. Schiaparelli will only last a few days after touchdown, but it should beam back images from its descent and weather reports from the surface. \"After the critical first few days in space, TGO is performing flawlessly,\" Denis said. \"Over the next two weeks we will continue to check and commission its systems, including the power, communications, startrackers, and guidance and navigation system.\" The mission blasted off March 14 on top of a Russian Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Proton booster's Breeze M upper stage deployed the ExoMars spacecraft nearly 11 hours after launch, following a set of four maneuvers to guide the Mars probe away from Earth. The launch was right on target, Denis said Tuesday. \"From the information we obtained from tracking, the error from injection was 1.5 meters per second, so extremely small,\" Denis said. The Proton/Breeze M accelerated the 4,335-kilogram spacecraft to a velocity of 33,001 kilometers per hour relative to Earth, according to ESA. An apparent explosion of the Breeze M upper stage after it parted ways from the ExoMars should have no impact on the spacecraft, according to Denis. A report published on the website of Popular Mechanics magazine indicated the Breeze M stage apparently broke apart after releasing ExoMars. The upper stage, which burns a mixture of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, was supposed to ignite its main engine after the separation of the ExoMars orbiter to veer on a different trajectory from the Mars-bound spacecraft. Imagery obtained late March 14 from OASI Observatory in Brazil, and released by ESA three days later, appears to show at least nine fragments from the Breeze M rocket stage speeding through space. While ESA initially said the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter appeared in the imagery, officials on Wednesday updated the caption to the animated image posted above. \"Following additional analysis by teams at ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Center, it has become clear that TGO is in fact not in this image - it was already further ahead and beyond the frame,\" officials wrote on the agency's website. \"Thus all of the moving objects in this image are related to the Breeze M.\" The Breeze M should have been in two pieces after the launch - the rocket stage's main body and a detachable fuel tank. Denis told Spaceflight Now that ExoMars managers in Europe have received no information on the potential explosion from Russian launch authorities. Popular Mechanics reported the ExoMars orbiter could have been damaged by the explosion, and further checks of the craft's science instruments are needed to ensure the probe has no ill effects from the anomaly. While the ExoMars spacecraft and the Breeze M were still relatively close, the distance was large enough to ensure there is \"no risk at all\" to the Mars mission, Denis said. \"If it's true, and if it's true that this explosion took place a couple of hours after separation, then the separation was huge - many kilometers - so there is no risk at all,\" Denis said. \"We definitely have not seen anything on the spacecraft with dynamics.

On June 13, the mission's Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), currently on its way to Mars, took an image of the planet from 25 million miles (41 million kilometers) away, close enough for some light and dark patches on the planet to be visible. The new images are just a start for ExoMars, which is jointly managed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Though some Earth-based observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, can take better pictures of Mars, the TGO images confirm that the instruments are focused and working as predicted, ESA officials said in a statement.

Composed of an orbiting mothership fitted with scientific instruments and the Schiaparelli landing module, the ExoMars spacecraft ignited its main engine at 0930 GMT Thursday for 52 minutes, the European Space Agency said. Generating about 95 pounds of thrust, the engine was supposed to adjust the spacecraft's velocity by about 730 mph, providing most of the required impulse to aim for Schiaparelli's landing in Meridiani Planum. \"Today's burn was the biggest of the four planned that will enable ExoMars to intercept Mars and precisely deliver the Schiaparelli lander on 19 October onto Meridiani Planum, a large, flat region near the equator,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. Thursday's deep space maneuver - planned since before the mission's March 14 launch - provided about 95 percent of the propulsive force needed to correct the ExoMars spacecraft's trajectory. A \"clean-up\" maneuver is planned Aug. 11 to do most of the remaining work to guide Schiaparelli toward its landing site. Even smaller trim maneuvers are scheduled for Sept. 19 and Oct. 14 before the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander separate Oct. 16. Around 12 hours after the lander deploys, the orbiter will fire its engine again to get on the correct path to enter orbit around Mars. A lengthy 134-minute main engine firing Oct. 19 will slow the probe's speed enough for Martian gravity to capture it into orbit. Measuring nearly 8 feet in diameter with its heat shield, the saucer-shaped Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere during the make-or-break engine firing aboard the Trace Gas Orbiter, making the events of Oct. 19 doubly important. While its engine is burning for the critical orbit insertion maneuver, the ExoMars mothership will listen for status signals radioed from the descending Schiaparelli lander, Denis said. \"At the same time, TGO is flying over and with its radio provided by NASA will be recording the signal of the entry, descent and landing of Schiaparelli ... And it will nonetheless continue burning up to the moment when the burn is finished,\" Denis said. Giant 230-foot dish antennas from NASA's Deep Space Network will support the ExoMars mission's arrival, and an array of 30 radio telescopes in India will also listen for confirmation of Schiaparelli's landing. Europe's Mars Express orbiter and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will help relay signals from the Schiaparelli lander after touchdown. \"It's a huge ballet, a huge coordinated dance that will take place in these couple of days,\" Denis said. As of Thursday, the ExoMars spacecraft had traveled about 208 million miles since its March liftoff aboard a Russian Proton rocket, arcing away from the sun from Earth to intersect Mars' orbit in October. By the time it arrives at Mars, the craft will have traveled 308 million miles, according to ESA. Equipped with a downward-facing descent camera and a weather station, Schiaparelli is primarily a technology demonstrator with a prime objective of proving out heat shield, parachute, radar altimeter, and computer systems for use on future Mars missions. ESA plans to employ the same radar and computer design on a more ambitious joint European-Russian Mars lander to launch in 2020. That will be the second phase of the two-part ExoMars mission. If successful, the Italian-built Schiaparelli probe would become the first European spacecraft to set down on Mars and return data. The UK-led Beagle 2 lander touched down on Mars in 2003, but ran into trouble before it could contact Earth. Schiaparelli should operate on the Martian surface for several days, and perhaps up to a week, before its batteries run out of power. Meanwhile, the Trace Gas Orbiter will swing into a preliminary oval-shaped pathway around Mars taking the craft nearly 60,000 miles from the planet at its highest point. Next year, the orbiter will begin a series of dips into the outer layers of the Martian atmosphere, encountering air drag to reshape its course into a circular 250-mile-high orbit. The \"aerobreaking\" phase of the mission should be complete by November 2017, allowing the mission to commence regular science observations by the end of next year. The spacecraft's main purpose is to measure and map concentrations of trace gases, such as methane, in the Martian atmosphere, which could be an indicator of active geology or microbial life on the red planet. It will provide data 1,000 times more accurate than existing trace gas measurements, according to ESA, and help identify where sources of Martian methane, water vapor, acetylene, and other gases are located. Assembled by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France, the Trace Gas Orbiter also carries a camera to create maps of Mars, and a Russian instrument will locate hydrogen hidden a few feet in the Martian crust, revealing sites where water- ice deposits might be reachable by future human prospectors to turn into air, drinking water, or rocket fuel.

Having travelled half a billion kilometres across the solar system, a European spacecraft will release a robotic lander on Sunday and send it spinning towards Mars and a place in the history books. Mission controllers expect the Schiaparelli lander to separate from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, at 3.42pm UK time, one million kilometres from Mars. The pair will reach their destination on Wednesday when the mothership swings into orbit and the lander heads for the rust-red surface. Named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the 600kg lander faces a dramatic six minute descent. As it punches into the Martian sky at 21,000 km per hour, the disc-shaped probe will endure temperatures of more than 1500C. A parachute and thrusters will slow the descent, until the lander belly flops the last two metres onto the Meridiani Planum, a flat expanse near the equator. Apart from the US and the Soviet Union, no other country has put a working lander on Mars. The closest Europe came was in 2003 when the UK-led Beagle 2 lander set down on the surface, but failed to call home. Scientists at the European Space Agency expect to do better this time. \"It is very important that it goes right. It will be the first successful Mars landing for Europe. We have to keep a cool head,\" said Michel Denis, flight director at ESA. A joint ESA venture with Russia's space agency, the ExoMars mission is arguably scientists' best chance of finding life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter will loop around the planet and sniff the atmosphere for methane - potentially a waste gas emanating from subterranean microbial Martians. Meanwhile, the lander will monitor conditions on the ground and test technology for the ExoMars rover, which is expected to launch in 2020. The rover will hunt for microbial life in Martian soil samples pulled up with a two-metre-long drill. But first the spacecraft must make it to Mars. Soon after the Schiaparelli lander parts company with the Trace Gas Orbiter, it will go into hibernation to save power. As it nears the planet, the probe will wake and aim for a small ellipse-shaped landing zone. A smooth descent will see the probe touch down at 3.48pm UK time on Wednesday. The battery-operated Schiaparelli is expected to last about two days on Mars. From the moment it lands, it will take weather measurements and record electrical fields near the surface. Swirling dust storms that can spread across the whole planet generate such strong electric fields they can rip apart carbon dioxide and water molecules in the atmosphere. High above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter must slam on its brakes so it can be captured by the planet's gravity. The braking manoeuvre calls for a main engine burn of more than two hours, but in that time the spacecraft will pass behind the red planet and lose all communications with Earth. \"We won't know if it has gone into orbit properly until it comes out the other side,\" said Denis. The Trace Gas Orbiter, a giant machine measuring 18 metres across with its solar arrays unfurled, will take many months to steer into the right orbit from which it can do serious science. But with its sensors fully operational at the end of next year, the orbiter will sniff the Martian atmosphere for low levels of gases, including the mysterious methane detected by Europe's Mars Express orbiter more than a decade ago. The surface of Mars appears to belch out plumes of the gas. While it may come from natural reactions in rocks, it could equally be a sign of life. \"The more we can study these trace gases, the more we'll understand the full picture,\" said H\u00e5kan Svedhem, project scientist on ExoMars. Should the orbiter detect enough Martian methane, it can learn where the gas comes from. A key measurement will be the ratio of carbon isotopes. When methane is made by life, it has a different proportion of carbon-12 to carbon-13 than when it is given off from geological processes. \"Methane on Mars is a longstanding puzzle. Is it coming from geological activity under the surface or is it coming from life? Either of those would be amazing, but life would of course be stunning,\" said Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. If the rover launches as planned, it will arrive in 2021. \"The ExoMars rover will be the first mission in recent times to look for signs of life. Nasa's rovers have followed the water and made important discoveries, but what they haven't been able to do is actually get to the life question. That's the really new thing we'll be able to do with the rover,\" Coates said. Last year, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted the final resting place of the Beagle 2 probe, which went missing after its attempted landing on Christmas Day 2003. In a handful of pixels, the orbiter's camera showed the Beagle had landed, but had failed to deploy its solar panels. \"We got Beagle to the right place, so most of its descent system must have worked. It didn't explode into a thousand pieces,\" said Denis. \"As for Schiaparelli, once we have uploaded the commands, we sit back and watch. It is a technology demonstrator, and those are not supposed to fail, but there might be some little surprises. We'll see on the day.\" This article was amended on 17 October 2016. An earlier version said the US, the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia had put a working lander on Mars. That was not true of Russia.

Named for Giovanni Schiaparelli, the Italian astronomer who charted the first rudimentary maps of Mars in the 19th century, the landing probe is heading for a target in Meridiani Planum, an expansive plain near the Martian equator. Schiaparelli deployed from a pod on its carrier craft, an instrument-laden satellite heading into orbit around Mars, as scheduled at 1442 GMT Sunday, and each spacecraft is heading off on separate missions. Both elements - built by Thales Alenia Space - are part of the European Space Agency's ExoMars program in partnership with Russia, which was responsible for launching the mission. The next phase of the ExoMars mission will come in 2020 with the launch of a European-built rover on another Russian rocket. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has several purposes: measuring traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere, improving maps of the planet, and relaying signals between Earth and rovers on the surface. Ground controllers at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait longer than expected to regain a full telemetry link from the orbiter mothership after the separation maneuver, but the problem apparently had no lasting effects. The orbiter fired its engine for about one minute, 46 seconds, overnight Sunday to shove the spacecraft off of a collision course with Mars. Navigators intentionally pointed the orbiter's trajectory for Mars for the release of Schiaparelli, which is coasting toward the planet and unable to adjust its course. The overnight rocket firing put the Trace Gas Orbiter on track for a position several hundred miles above Mars for a critical make-or-break engine burn Wednesday to swing into orbit around the planet. At the same time Wednesday, the 7.9-foot-diameter Schiaparelli lander will dive into the atmosphere. Its computers will wake the spacecraft from hibernation shortly before entry. Schiaparelli an experimental testbed designed to prove Europe can successfully land a spacecraft on the Martian surface. It carries a downward-facing camera to collect images during the descent, and a weather station on Schiaparelli will return data on the temperature, humidity, pressure and winds at the landing site. Another suite of sensors will monitor conditions during Schiaparelli's six- minute plunge into the Martian atmosphere, gathering inputs that could help engineers design future Mars missions. A heat shield, parachute and rocket thrusters will slow Schiaparelli's descent, then the braking rockets will cut off at an altitude of 6 feet, allowing the craft to fall to the ground on a crushable carbon fiber shell. Schiaparelli is a relatively simple spacecraft, and its battery should provide power for up to eight days of operations after landing. The probe is not able to recharge the battery. Schiaparelli will be the first mission to touch down on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season, and its landing will come 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet. Mission control never heard from Beagle 2 after its landing attempt, but scientists last year revealed new imagery from Mars orbit apparently showing the lander sitting on the surface with its power-generating solar arrays still partially folded. The discovery led engineers to conclude Beagle 2 may have survived its landing, but a problem prevented full deployment of the solar panels, potentially blocking the antenna that was to radio its status to Earth. Schiaparelli's flight to Mars is Europe's second try, with a much bigger package than Beagle 2. It goes to Mars with a doppler radar guidance system, modernized control algorithms and a computer that will be crucial to the 2020 mission's rover landing. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will become the sixth operational spacecraft circling Mars, and the second European orbiter studying the red planet. It will join three other NASA orbiters and an Indian spacecraft flying around Mars.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/17/european-mars-lander-released-from-exomars-mothership/"}, {"title": "ESA celebrates ExoMars orbiter success, keeps vigil for lost lander", "date": "2016-10-19", "content": "A European-built orbiter designed to seek out the source of methane on Mars slipped into orbit around the red planet Wednesday after a seven-month interplanetary journey, but mission control lost contact with an experimental landing probe just before touchdown. Both spacecraft - part of the joint European-Russian ExoMars program - reached Mars around the same time Wednesday for simultaneous maneuvers to swing into orbit and plunge into the red planet's atmosphere. The Schiaparelli lander, shaped like a flying saucer with a diameter of nearly 8 feet, dived into the Martian atmosphere as expected around 1442 GMT Wednesday. Designed for a technology demonstration mission, Schiaparelli had heat shield tiles, a parachute and nine rocket thrusters to slow its speed from 13,000 mph to zero in less than six minutes. But something went wrong in the last phase of the descent, interrupting a real-time beacon signal sent back to Earth to a vast radio telescope array in Pune, India. The carrier tone went silent after mission controllers reported Schiaparelli's supersonic parachute had deployed, but the signal only told engineers whether the spacecraft was transmitting, and did not contain telemetry data that might reveal the root of the problem. European Space Agency officials waited to receive a recording of Schiaparelli's beacon signal from the Mars Express orbiter around the red planet to confirm some sort of glitch with the Indian antennas was not responsible for the loss of communications. \"We saw the signal through the atmospheric phase - the descent phase. At a certain point, it stopped,\" said Paolo Ferri, head of ESA's mission operations department. \"This was unexpected, but we couldn't conclude anything from that because this very weak signal picked up on the ground was coming from an experimental tool.\" The telescope array in India was never designed to communicate with deep space missions like Schiaparelli, but engineers added equipment to the antenna network - the largest in the world - for Wednesday's Mars landing in hopes of gaining real-time insight into the status of the mission. Otherwise, ground controllers would have had to wait for Mars Express for news on the 1,272-pound landing craft. It turns out the ground team at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait all day Wednesday as data on Schiaparelli's landing trickled back to Earth and hopes for the mission's successful landing waned. The carrier signal from Schiaparelli relayed by Mars Express also abruptly ended shortly before landing, just as the beacon tone received in India. \"The Mars Express measurement came ... and confirmed exactly the same: the signal went through the majority of the descent phase, and it stopped at a certain point that we reckon was before the landing,\" Ferri said. \"There could be many many reasons for that,\" Ferri said. \"It's clear these are not good signs, but we will need more information.\" The newly-arrived Trace Gas Orbiter, Schiaparelli's mothership, recorded detailed telemetry broadcast by the lander - not just the beacon signal - and that data should be beamed back to Earth overnight, according to Ferri. \"This is fundamental because we should remember that this landing was a test, and as part of the test, you want to know what happened,\" Ferri said. \"If the landing were to fail, presumably from TGO we will know what was the last thing that worked all right,\" said Jorge Vago, ESA's ExoMars project scientist, in an interview with Spaceflight Now on Tuesday, before Schiaparelli's landing attempt. Officials hope to share more on what they know about Schiaparelli's fate in a press conference Thursday at 0800 GMT. Schiaparelli rode to Mars piggyback on the Trace Gas Orbiter after their tandem launch March 14 aboard a Russian Proton rocket, then separated Sunday for the final approach to the planet. Both ExoMars spacecraft were manufactured by an industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space. The orbiter fired its main engine at 1305 GMT, smoothly slowing the craft's velocity by more than 3,300 mph during a 139-minute burn. The final few minutes of the make-or-break rocket maneuver occurred as the spacecraft flew behind Mars, temporarily cutting off communications. When mission control regained contact with the Trace Gas Orbiter, telemetry showed the probe was healthy and had completed the orbit insertion burn as planned. The confirmation sparked a round of applause inside the ExoMars control center, but attention quickly turned back to Schiaparelli. \"Part of the mission is a clear go,\" said Don McCoy, ESA's ExoMars project manager, after the Trace Gas Orbiter braked into orbit around Mars without difficulty. \"For the lander, we have received some data ... We've seen a series of indicators of the entry, parachute deployment, release of the backshell, etc. We don't have the full set of data.\" The orbiter is the primary part of the mission, carrying four science instruments to take pictures, locate water resources, and search for the sources of intermittent methane detected in the Martian atmosphere, an indicator of ongoing biological or geological activity. ESA expects the Trace Gas Orbiter to function through at least 2022 and help relay commands and science data between Earth and a fleet of existing and planned rovers on the Martian surface. NASA provided two radio packages for the orbiter to link up with the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, along with planned rovers from NASA and ESA scheduled for launch in 2020. Officials billed Schiaparelli as a technology demonstrator, and the probe was aiming to become the first European spacecraft to successfully land and function on Mars. Engineers hoped lessons learned from Schiaparelli will feed into the design of the second part of the two-launch ExoMars program, a European-built rover scheduled for liftoff in mid-2020. Under the terms of their partnership with ESA, Russian engineers will design and build the descent module for the ExoMars rover, but the computer and parts of the lander's guidance system will come from Europe. Schiaparelli was supposed to verify parts of the design worked at Mars. A doppler radar altimeter was supposed to activate when Schiaparelli jettisoned its forward heat shield under parachute and collect data on the spacecraft's altitude and speed. The measurements were to go to Schiaparelli on-board computer to control the thrust of nine hydrazine-fueled rocket engines fixed around the perimeter of the probe. The thrusters were programmed to cut off around 6 feet, or 2 meters, above the Martian surface, and Schiaparelli was to fall to the ground cushioned by a crushable carbon-fiber crash structure. A downward-facing descent camera was expected to take images during the last phase of Schiaparelli's descent, and the lander's computer was supposed to switch on a weather station after touchdown to monitor the temperature, humidity, pressure, dust opacity, wind speed, and wind direction at site landing site in Meridiani Planum, a relatively flat plain near the Martian equator. Named for Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the lander was to become the first mission to land on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season. One of the sensors aboard the craft was designed to measure electrical fields in the Martian atmosphere, one of the mechanisms scientists think might drive dust storms. \"The Schiaparelli lander was designed to be able to land in a global dust storm, a big one where you don't see anything,\" Vago said. \"From the point-of- view of hypersonic entry, heat shield performance, and parachute performance, it should all be OK.\" The lander, primarily funded and built in Italy, was also fitted with instrumentation to track the density, pressure and temperature of the atmosphere from the point of entry at an altitude of 80 miles to the surface. Another payload on Schiaparelli was a compact array of laser retroreflectors to help future orbiters precisely locate the lander. Schiaparelli only carried batteries to power its science sensors, computer and radio transmitter, so engineers expected it to shut down within a few days of landing. ESA said ground controllers will have multiple opportunities in the comings to attempt to contact Schiaparelli - assuming it is safely on the surface - before its batteries run down. \"We don't know all the details, but this is typical for a test,\" said Jan Woerner, ESA's director general. \"We did this in order to get data about how to land European technology on Mars, therefore, all the data we will get tonight ... will be used to understand how to manage the next landing when we will go with a European rover.\" Wednesday's nail-biting landing attempt came 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet. Mission control never heard from Beagle 2 after its landing attempt, but scientists last year revealed new imagery from Mars orbit apparently showing the lander sitting the surface with its power-generating solar arrays still partially folded. The discovery led engineers to conclude Beagle 2 may have survived its landing, but a problem prevented full deployment of the solar panels, potentially blocking the antenna that was to radio its status to Earth. Schiaparelli's flight to Mars was Europe's second try, with a much bigger package than Beagle 2. It went to Mars with the new doppler radar guidance system, modernized control algorithms and a computer that will be crucial to the 2020 mission's rover landing. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is ESA's second spacecraft circling the red planet after Mars Express, which is still flying well beyond its design life after arriving at Mars in 2003. With the insertion of the latest orbiter, there are now six active satellites around Mars, including the two ESA science stations, three NASA orbiters, and an Indian spacecraft. Navigators intended for the Trace Gas Orbiter to enter into an initial egg- shaped orbit taking the spacecraft as close as 186 miles and as far as 60,000 miles from Mars. Experts verified the orbiter was right on course after its orbit insertion burn. \"Yes, the TGO is captured in orbit around Mars, and yes, it's in a very nominal orbit of four days duration, only a couple hours more, but this is within a few percent, and it's perfectly normal,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director. All systems on the orbiter are performing well, he said. \"It's all good,\" Denis said. \"It's a good spacecraft at the right place, and we have a mission around Mars, another one.\" The orbiter will turn on its camera and science instruments for two orbits - about eight days - in November for a first look at the red planet since arriving, according to Vago. \"We will turn the instruments on and hope to be able to make some interesting first observations then,\" Vago said. \"Don't expect any magnificent revelations on the distribution of methane or trace gases just in two orbits, but some images for sure and the confirmation that the instruments work as well.\" Starting in January, the orbiter will begin an aerobraking campaign, dipping into the upper fringes of Mars' atmosphere on each lap around the planet. Drag on the spacecraft's solar panels will gradually lower its altitude, with the satellite ending up in a circular 250-mile-high orbit by early 2018.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/19/esa-celebrates-exomars-orbiter-success-keeps-vigil-for-lost-lander/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "ExoMars orbiter fine-tunes path toward red planet", "date": "2016-07-28", "content": "A European spacecraft cruising toward Mars fired its main engine Thursday, tweaking its trajectory and helping set up for carefully-choreographed simultaneous maneuvers Oct. 19 to place part of the tandem mission into orbit around the red planet and deposit a stationary battery-powered lander on the Martian surface. Composed of an orbiting mothership fitted with scientific instruments and the Schiaparelli landing module, the ExoMars spacecraft ignited its main engine at 0930 GMT Thursday for 52 minutes, the European Space Agency said. Generating about 95 pounds of thrust, the engine was supposed to adjust the spacecraft's velocity by about 730 mph, providing most of the required impulse to aim for Schiaparelli's landing in Meridiani Planum. \"Today's burn was the biggest of the four planned that will enable ExoMars to intercept Mars and precisely deliver the Schiaparelli lander on 19 October onto Meridiani Planum, a large, flat region near the equator,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany. Thursday's deep space maneuver - planned since before the mission's March 14 launch - provided about 95 percent of the propulsive force needed to correct the ExoMars spacecraft's trajectory. A \"clean-up\" maneuver is planned Aug. 11 to do most of the remaining work to guide Schiaparelli toward its landing site. Even smaller trim maneuvers are scheduled for Sept. 19 and Oct. 14 before the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander separate Oct. 16. Around 12 hours after the lander deploys, the orbiter will fire its engine again to get on the correct path to enter orbit around Mars. A lengthy 134-minute main engine firing Oct. 19 will slow the probe's speed enough for Martian gravity to capture it into orbit. Measuring nearly 8 feet in diameter with its heat shield, the saucer-shaped Schiaparelli probe will plunge into the atmosphere during the make-or-break engine firing aboard the Trace Gas Orbiter, making the events of Oct. 19 doubly important. While its engine is burning for the critical orbit insertion maneuver, the ExoMars mothership will listen for status signals radioed from the descending Schiaparelli lander, Denis said. \"At the same time, TGO is flying over and with its radio provided by NASA will be recording the signal of the entry, descent and landing of Schiaparelli ... And it will nonetheless continue burning up to the moment when the burn is finished,\" Denis said. Giant 230-foot dish antennas from NASA's Deep Space Network will support the ExoMars mission's arrival, and an array of 30 radio telescopes in India will also listen for confirmation of Schiaparelli's landing. Europe's Mars Express orbiter and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will help relay signals from the Schiaparelli lander after touchdown. \"It's a huge ballet, a huge coordinated dance that will take place in these couple of days,\" Denis said. As of Thursday, the ExoMars spacecraft had traveled about 208 million miles since its March liftoff aboard a Russian Proton rocket, arcing away from the sun from Earth to intersect Mars' orbit in October. By the time it arrives at Mars, the craft will have traveled 308 million miles, according to ESA. Equipped with a downward-facing descent camera and a weather station, Schiaparelli is primarily a technology demonstrator with a prime objective of proving out heat shield, parachute, radar altimeter, and computer systems for use on future Mars missions. ESA plans to employ the same radar and computer design on a more ambitious joint European-Russian Mars lander to launch in 2020. That will be the second phase of the two-part ExoMars mission. If successful, the Italian-built Schiaparelli probe would become the first European spacecraft to set down on Mars and return data. The UK-led Beagle 2 lander touched down on Mars in 2003, but ran into trouble before it could contact Earth. Schiaparelli should operate on the Martian surface for several days, and perhaps up to a week, before its batteries run out of power. Meanwhile, the Trace Gas Orbiter will swing into a preliminary oval-shaped pathway around Mars taking the craft nearly 60,000 miles from the planet at its highest point. Next year, the orbiter will begin a series of dips into the outer layers of the Martian atmosphere, encountering air drag to reshape its course into a circular 250-mile-high orbit. The \"aerobreaking\" phase of the mission should be complete by November 2017, allowing the mission to commence regular science observations by the end of next year. The spacecraft's main purpose is to measure and map concentrations of trace gases, such as methane, in the Martian atmosphere, which could be an indicator of active geology or microbial life on the red planet. It will provide data 1,000 times more accurate than existing trace gas measurements, according to ESA, and help identify where sources of Martian methane, water vapor, acetylene, and other gases are located. Assembled by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France, the Trace Gas Orbiter also carries a camera to create maps of Mars, and a Russian instrument will locate hydrogen hidden a few feet in the Martian crust, revealing sites where water- ice deposits might be reachable by future human prospectors to turn into air, drinking water, or rocket fuel. A third goal of the mission is to pass commands and scientific data between Earth and rovers exploring the surface, including the ExoMars rover due for launch in 2020 and NASA's multiple landers. The ExoMars orbiter's mission is slated to last through at least 2022.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/07/28/exomars-orbiter-fine-tunes-path-toward-red-planet/"}, {"title": "European Mars Probe Performs 1st Crucial Deep-Space Maneuver", "date": "2016-08-04", "content": "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars spacecraft has performed its first critical deep-space maneuver since launching toward the Red Planet on March 14. ExoMars fired up its main engine for nearly an hour on July 28, fine-tuning the probe's trajectory ahead of a planned Oct. 19 arrival at the Red Planet, ESA officials said. \"The engine provides about the same force as that needed to lift a 45-kilogram [100 lbs.] weight in a fitness studio, and it ran for about 52 minutes, so that's quite a significant push,\" deputy spacecraft operations manager Silvia Sangiorgi said in a statement. The maneuver came after brief test burns on July 18 and July 21. The current plan calls for three more engine firings on the way to Mars: one each on Aug. 11, Sept. 19 and Oct. 14, ESA officials said. The ExoMars spacecraft consists of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and a landing demonstrator called Schiaparelli. The pair are scheduled to separate on Oct. 16; three days later, TGO will begin circling Mars, while Schiaparelli will touch down softly on the planet's surface. TGO's main job involves hunting for rare gases in the Red Planet's atmosphere, especially methane, which may be a sign of Martian life. (The vast majority of methane in Earth's air was produced by microbes.) The orbiter is scheduled to begin its five-year mission in December 2017, after slowly making its way down to its final science orbit. Schiaparelli will gather some environmental data on the Martian surface, but its main job is to test out the technology needed to land the life-hunting ExoMars rover on the Red Planet. That robot is currently slated to launch in 2020, the same year that NASA will send its next rover toward Mars. ESA leads the ExoMars program, with considerable support from Russia; the Russian federal space agency, known as Roscosmos, is ESA's main partner on the project.", "url": "https://www.space.com/33643-exomars-mission-deep-space-maneuver.html"}, {"title": "All eyes on the red planet as ESA's lander prepares to hurtle towards Mars", "date": "2016-10-14", "content": "The moment has come. Having travelled half a billion kilometres across the solar system, a European spacecraft will release a robotic lander on Sunday and send it spinning towards Mars and a place in the history books. Mission controllers expect the Schiaparelli lander to separate from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, at 3.42pm UK time, one million kilometres from Mars. The pair will reach their destination on Wednesday when the mothership swings into orbit and the lander heads for the rust-red surface. Named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the 600kg lander faces a dramatic six minute descent. As it punches into the Martian sky at 21,000 km per hour, the disc-shaped probe will endure temperatures of more than 1500C. A parachute and thrusters will slow the descent, until the lander belly flops the last two metres onto the Meridiani Planum, a flat expanse near the equator. Apart from the US and the Soviet Union, no other country has put a working lander on Mars. The closest Europe came was in 2003 when the UK-led Beagle 2 lander set down on the surface, but failed to call home. Scientists at the European Space Agency expect to do better this time. \"It is very important that it goes right. It will be the first successful Mars landing for Europe. We have to keep a cool head,\" said Michel Denis, flight director at ESA. A joint ESA venture with Russia's space agency, the ExoMars mission is arguably scientists' best chance of finding life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter will loop around the planet and sniff the atmosphere for methane - potentially a waste gas emanating from subterranean microbial Martians. Meanwhile, the lander will monitor conditions on the ground and test technology for the ExoMars rover, which is expected to launch in 2020. The rover will hunt for microbial life in Martian soil samples pulled up with a two-metre-long drill. But first the spacecraft must make it to Mars. Soon after the Schiaparelli lander parts company with the Trace Gas Orbiter, it will go into hibernation to save power. As it nears the planet, the probe will wake and aim for a small ellipse-shaped landing zone. A smooth descent will see the probe touch down at 3.48pm UK time on Wednesday. The battery-operated Schiaparelli is expected to last about two days on Mars. From the moment it lands, it will take weather measurements and record electrical fields near the surface. Swirling dust storms that can spread across the whole planet generate such strong electric fields they can rip apart carbon dioxide and water molecules in the atmosphere. High above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter must slam on its brakes so it can be captured by the planet's gravity. The braking manoeuvre calls for a main engine burn of more than two hours, but in that time the spacecraft will pass behind the red planet and lose all communications with Earth. \"We won't know if it has gone into orbit properly until it comes out the other side,\" said Denis. The Trace Gas Orbiter, a giant machine measuring 18 metres across with its solar arrays unfurled, will take many months to steer into the right orbit from which it can do serious science. But with its sensors fully operational at the end of next year, the orbiter will sniff the Martian atmosphere for low levels of gases, including the mysterious methane detected by Europe's Mars Express orbiter more than a decade ago. The surface of Mars appears to belch out plumes of the gas. While it may come from natural reactions in rocks, it could equally be a sign of life. \"The more we can study these trace gases, the more we'll understand the full picture,\" said H\u00e5kan Svedhem, project scientist on ExoMars. Should the orbiter detect enough Martian methane, it can learn where the gas comes from. A key measurement will be the ratio of carbon isotopes. When methane is made by life, it has a different proportion of carbon-12 to carbon-13 than when it is given off from geological processes. \"Methane on Mars is a longstanding puzzle. Is it coming from geological activity under the surface or is it coming from life? Either of those would be amazing, but life would of course be stunning,\" said Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. If the rover launches as planned, it will arrive in 2021. \"The ExoMars rover will be the first mission in recent times to look for signs of life. Nasa's rovers have followed the water and made important discoveries, but what they haven't been able to do is actually get to the life question. That's the really new thing we'll be able to do with the rover,\" Coates said. Last year, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted the final resting place of the Beagle 2 probe, which went missing after its attempted landing on Christmas Day 2003. In a handful of pixels, the orbiter's camera showed the Beagle had landed, but had failed to deploy its solar panels. \"We got Beagle to the right place, so most of its descent system must have worked. It didn't explode into a thousand pieces,\" said Denis. \"As for Schiaparelli, once we have uploaded the commands, we sit back and watch. It is a technology demonstrator, and those are not supposed to fail, but there might be some little surprises. We'll see on the day.\" This article was amended on 17 October 2016. An earlier version said the US, the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia had put a working lander on Mars. That was not true of Russia.

Schiaparelli deployed from a pod on its carrier craft, an instrument-laden satellite heading into orbit around Mars, as scheduled at 1442 GMT Sunday, and each spacecraft is heading off on separate missions. Both elements - built by Thales Alenia Space - are part of the European Space Agency's ExoMars program in partnership with Russia, which was responsible for launching the mission. The next phase of the ExoMars mission will come in 2020 with the launch of a European-built rover on another Russian rocket. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has several purposes: measuring traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere, improving maps of the planet, and relaying signals between Earth and rovers on the surface. Ground controllers at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait longer than expected to regain a full telemetry link from the orbiter mothership after the separation maneuver, but the problem apparently had no lasting effects. The orbiter fired its engine for about one minute, 46 seconds, overnight Sunday to shove the spacecraft off of a collision course with Mars. Navigators intentionally pointed the orbiter's trajectory for Mars for the release of Schiaparelli, which is coasting toward the planet and unable to adjust its course. The overnight rocket firing put the Trace Gas Orbiter on track for a position several hundred miles above Mars for a critical make-or-break engine burn Wednesday to swing into orbit around the planet. At the same time Wednesday, the 7.9-foot-diameter Schiaparelli lander will dive into the atmosphere. Its computers will wake the spacecraft from hibernation shortly before entry. Schiaparelli an experimental testbed designed to prove Europe can successfully land a spacecraft on the Martian surface. It carries a downward-facing camera to collect images during the descent, and a weather station on Schiaparelli will return data on the temperature, humidity, pressure and winds at the landing site. Another suite of sensors will monitor conditions during Schiaparelli's six- minute plunge into the Martian atmosphere, gathering inputs that could help engineers design future Mars missions. A heat shield, parachute and rocket thrusters will slow Schiaparelli's descent, then the braking rockets will cut off at an altitude of 6 feet, allowing the craft to fall to the ground on a crushable carbon fiber shell. Schiaparelli is a relatively simple spacecraft, and its battery should provide power for up to eight days of operations after landing. The probe is not able to recharge the battery. Schiaparelli will be the first mission to touch down on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season, and its landing will come 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet.

One of the sensors aboard the craft was designed to measure electrical fields in the Martian atmosphere, one of the mechanisms scientists think might drive dust storms. \"The Schiaparelli lander was designed to be able to land in a global dust storm, a big one where you don't see anything,\" Vago said. \"From the point-of- view of hypersonic entry, heat shield performance, and parachute performance, it should all be OK.\" The lander, primarily funded and built in Italy, was also fitted with instrumentation to track the density, pressure and temperature of the atmosphere from the point of entry at an altitude of 80 miles to the surface. Another payload on Schiaparelli was a compact array of laser retroreflectors to help future orbiters precisely locate the lander. Schiaparelli only carried batteries to power its science sensors, computer and radio transmitter, so engineers expected it to shut down within a few days of landing. ESA said ground controllers will have multiple opportunities in the comings to attempt to contact Schiaparelli - assuming it is safely on the surface - before its batteries run down. \"We don't know all the details, but this is typical for a test,\" said Jan Woerner, ESA's director general. \"We did this in order to get data about how to land European technology on Mars, therefore, all the data we will get tonight ... will be used to understand how to manage the next landing when we will go with a European rover.\" Wednesday's nail-biting landing attempt came 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet. Mission control never heard from Beagle 2 after its landing attempt, but scientists last year revealed new imagery from Mars orbit apparently showing the lander sitting the surface with its power-generating solar arrays still partially folded. The discovery led engineers to conclude Beagle 2 may have survived its landing, but a problem prevented full deployment of the solar panels, potentially blocking the antenna that was to radio its status to Earth. Schiaparelli's flight to Mars was Europe's second try, with a much bigger package than Beagle 2. It went to Mars with the new doppler radar guidance system, modernized control algorithms and a computer that will be crucial to the 2020 mission's rover landing. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is ESA's second spacecraft circling the red planet after Mars Express, which is still flying well beyond its design life after arriving at Mars in 2003. With the insertion of the latest orbiter, there are now six active satellites around Mars, including the two ESA science stations, three NASA orbiters, and an Indian spacecraft. Navigators intended for the Trace Gas Orbiter to enter into an initial egg- shaped orbit taking the spacecraft as close as 186 miles and as far as 60,000 miles from Mars. Experts verified the orbiter was right on course after its orbit insertion burn. \"Yes, the TGO is captured in orbit around Mars, and yes, it's in a very nominal orbit of four days duration, only a couple hours more, but this is within a few percent, and it's perfectly normal,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director. All systems on the orbiter are performing well, he said. \"It's all good,\" Denis said. \"It's a good spacecraft at the right place, and we have a mission around Mars, another one.\" The orbiter will turn on its camera and science instruments for two orbits - about eight days - in November for a first look at the red planet since arriving, according to Vago. \"We will turn the instruments on and hope to be able to make some interesting first observations then,\" Vago said. \"Don't expect any magnificent revelations on the distribution of methane or trace gases just in two orbits, but some images for sure and the confirmation that the instruments work as well.\" Starting in January, the orbiter will begin an aerobraking campaign, dipping into the upper fringes of Mars' atmosphere on each lap around the planet.

ExoMars fired up its main engine for nearly an hour on July 28, fine-tuning the probe's trajectory ahead of a planned Oct. 19 arrival at the Red Planet, ESA officials said. \"The engine provides about the same force as that needed to lift a 45-kilogram [100 lbs.] weight in a fitness studio, and it ran for about 52 minutes, so that's quite a significant push,\" deputy spacecraft operations manager Silvia Sangiorgi said in a statement. The maneuver came after brief test burns on July 18 and July 21. The current plan calls for three more engine firings on the way to Mars: one each on Aug. 11, Sept. 19 and Oct. 14, ESA officials said. The ExoMars spacecraft consists of the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and a landing demonstrator called Schiaparelli. The pair are scheduled to separate on Oct. 16; three days later, TGO will begin circling Mars, while Schiaparelli will touch down softly on the planet's surface. TGO's main job involves hunting for rare gases in the Red Planet's atmosphere, especially methane, which may be a sign of Martian life. (The vast majority of methane in Earth's air was produced by microbes.) The orbiter is scheduled to begin its five-year mission in December 2017, after slowly making its way down to its final science orbit. Schiaparelli will gather some environmental data on the Martian surface, but its main job is to test out the technology needed to land the life-hunting ExoMars rover on the Red Planet. That robot is currently slated to launch in 2020, the same year that NASA will send its next rover toward Mars. ESA leads the ExoMars program, with considerable support from Russia; the Russian federal space agency, known as Roscosmos, is ESA's main partner on the project.", "url": "https://www.space.com/33643-exomars-mission-deep-space-maneuver.html"}, {"title": "All eyes on the red planet as ESA's lander prepares to hurtle towards Mars", "date": "2016-10-14", "content": "The moment has come. Having travelled half a billion kilometres across the solar system, a European spacecraft will release a robotic lander on Sunday and send it spinning towards Mars and a place in the history books. Mission controllers expect the Schiaparelli lander to separate from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, at 3.42pm UK time, one million kilometres from Mars. The pair will reach their destination on Wednesday when the mothership swings into orbit and the lander heads for the rust-red surface. Named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the 600kg lander faces a dramatic six minute descent. As it punches into the Martian sky at 21,000 km per hour, the disc-shaped probe will endure temperatures of more than 1500C. A parachute and thrusters will slow the descent, until the lander belly flops the last two metres onto the Meridiani Planum, a flat expanse near the equator. Apart from the US and the Soviet Union, no other country has put a working lander on Mars. The closest Europe came was in 2003 when the UK-led Beagle 2 lander set down on the surface, but failed to call home. Scientists at the European Space Agency expect to do better this time. \"It is very important that it goes right. It will be the first successful Mars landing for Europe. We have to keep a cool head,\" said Michel Denis, flight director at ESA. A joint ESA venture with Russia's space agency, the ExoMars mission is arguably scientists' best chance of finding life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter will loop around the planet and sniff the atmosphere for methane - potentially a waste gas emanating from subterranean microbial Martians. Meanwhile, the lander will monitor conditions on the ground and test technology for the ExoMars rover, which is expected to launch in 2020. The rover will hunt for microbial life in Martian soil samples pulled up with a two-metre-long drill. But first the spacecraft must make it to Mars. Soon after the Schiaparelli lander parts company with the Trace Gas Orbiter, it will go into hibernation to save power. As it nears the planet, the probe will wake and aim for a small ellipse-shaped landing zone. A smooth descent will see the probe touch down at 3.48pm UK time on Wednesday. The battery-operated Schiaparelli is expected to last about two days on Mars. From the moment it lands, it will take weather measurements and record electrical fields near the surface. Swirling dust storms that can spread across the whole planet generate such strong electric fields they can rip apart carbon dioxide and water molecules in the atmosphere. High above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter must slam on its brakes so it can be captured by the planet's gravity. The braking manoeuvre calls for a main engine burn of more than two hours, but in that time the spacecraft will pass behind the red planet and lose all communications with Earth. \"We won't know if it has gone into orbit properly until it comes out the other side,\" said Denis. The Trace Gas Orbiter, a giant machine measuring 18 metres across with its solar arrays unfurled, will take many months to steer into the right orbit from which it can do serious science. But with its sensors fully operational at the end of next year, the orbiter will sniff the Martian atmosphere for low levels of gases, including the mysterious methane detected by Europe's Mars Express orbiter more than a decade ago. The surface of Mars appears to belch out plumes of the gas. While it may come from natural reactions in rocks, it could equally be a sign of life. \"The more we can study these trace gases, the more we'll understand the full picture,\" said H\u00e5kan Svedhem, project scientist on ExoMars. Should the orbiter detect enough Martian methane, it can learn where the gas comes from. A key measurement will be the ratio of carbon isotopes. When methane is made by life, it has a different proportion of carbon-12 to carbon-13 than when it is given off from geological processes. \"Methane on Mars is a longstanding puzzle. Is it coming from geological activity under the surface or is it coming from life? Either of those would be amazing, but life would of course be stunning,\" said Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. If the rover launches as planned, it will arrive in 2021. \"The ExoMars rover will be the first mission in recent times to look for signs of life. Nasa's rovers have followed the water and made important discoveries, but what they haven't been able to do is actually get to the life question. That's the really new thing we'll be able to do with the rover,\" Coates said. Last year, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted the final resting place of the Beagle 2 probe, which went missing after its attempted landing on Christmas Day 2003. In a handful of pixels, the orbiter's camera showed the Beagle had landed, but had failed to deploy its solar panels. \"We got Beagle to the right place, so most of its descent system must have worked. It didn't explode into a thousand pieces,\" said Denis. \"As for Schiaparelli, once we have uploaded the commands, we sit back and watch. It is a technology demonstrator, and those are not supposed to fail, but there might be some little surprises. We'll see on the day.\" This article was amended on 17 October 2016.

Named for Giovanni Schiaparelli, the Italian astronomer who charted the first rudimentary maps of Mars in the 19th century, the landing probe is heading for a target in Meridiani Planum, an expansive plain near the Martian equator. Schiaparelli deployed from a pod on its carrier craft, an instrument-laden satellite heading into orbit around Mars, as scheduled at 1442 GMT Sunday, and each spacecraft is heading off on separate missions. Both elements - built by Thales Alenia Space - are part of the European Space Agency's ExoMars program in partnership with Russia, which was responsible for launching the mission. The next phase of the ExoMars mission will come in 2020 with the launch of a European-built rover on another Russian rocket. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has several purposes: measuring traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere, improving maps of the planet, and relaying signals between Earth and rovers on the surface. Ground controllers at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait longer than expected to regain a full telemetry link from the orbiter mothership after the separation maneuver, but the problem apparently had no lasting effects. The orbiter fired its engine for about one minute, 46 seconds, overnight Sunday to shove the spacecraft off of a collision course with Mars. Navigators intentionally pointed the orbiter's trajectory for Mars for the release of Schiaparelli, which is coasting toward the planet and unable to adjust its course. The overnight rocket firing put the Trace Gas Orbiter on track for a position several hundred miles above Mars for a critical make-or-break engine burn Wednesday to swing into orbit around the planet. At the same time Wednesday, the 7.9-foot-diameter Schiaparelli lander will dive into the atmosphere. Its computers will wake the spacecraft from hibernation shortly before entry. Schiaparelli an experimental testbed designed to prove Europe can successfully land a spacecraft on the Martian surface. It carries a downward-facing camera to collect images during the descent, and a weather station on Schiaparelli will return data on the temperature, humidity, pressure and winds at the landing site. Another suite of sensors will monitor conditions during Schiaparelli's six- minute plunge into the Martian atmosphere, gathering inputs that could help engineers design future Mars missions. A heat shield, parachute and rocket thrusters will slow Schiaparelli's descent, then the braking rockets will cut off at an altitude of 6 feet, allowing the craft to fall to the ground on a crushable carbon fiber shell. Schiaparelli is a relatively simple spacecraft, and its battery should provide power for up to eight days of operations after landing. The probe is not able to recharge the battery. Schiaparelli will be the first mission to touch down on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season, and its landing will come 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet.

Both spacecraft - part of the joint European-Russian ExoMars program - reached Mars around the same time Wednesday for simultaneous maneuvers to swing into orbit and plunge into the red planet's atmosphere. The Schiaparelli lander, shaped like a flying saucer with a diameter of nearly 8 feet, dived into the Martian atmosphere as expected around 1442 GMT Wednesday. Designed for a technology demonstration mission, Schiaparelli had heat shield tiles, a parachute and nine rocket thrusters to slow its speed from 13,000 mph to zero in less than six minutes. But something went wrong in the last phase of the descent, interrupting a real-time beacon signal sent back to Earth to a vast radio telescope array in Pune, India. The carrier tone went silent after mission controllers reported Schiaparelli's supersonic parachute had deployed, but the signal only told engineers whether the spacecraft was transmitting, and did not contain telemetry data that might reveal the root of the problem. European Space Agency officials waited to receive a recording of Schiaparelli's beacon signal from the Mars Express orbiter around the red planet to confirm some sort of glitch with the Indian antennas was not responsible for the loss of communications. \"We saw the signal through the atmospheric phase - the descent phase. At a certain point, it stopped,\" said Paolo Ferri, head of ESA's mission operations department. \"This was unexpected, but we couldn't conclude anything from that because this very weak signal picked up on the ground was coming from an experimental tool.\" The telescope array in India was never designed to communicate with deep space missions like Schiaparelli, but engineers added equipment to the antenna network - the largest in the world - for Wednesday's Mars landing in hopes of gaining real-time insight into the status of the mission. Otherwise, ground controllers would have had to wait for Mars Express for news on the 1,272-pound landing craft. It turns out the ground team at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait all day Wednesday as data on Schiaparelli's landing trickled back to Earth and hopes for the mission's successful landing waned. The carrier signal from Schiaparelli relayed by Mars Express also abruptly ended shortly before landing, just as the beacon tone received in India. \"The Mars Express measurement came ... and confirmed exactly the same: the signal went through the majority of the descent phase, and it stopped at a certain point that we reckon was before the landing,\" Ferri said. \"There could be many many reasons for that,\" Ferri said. \"It's clear these are not good signs, but we will need more information.\" The newly-arrived Trace Gas Orbiter, Schiaparelli's mothership, recorded detailed telemetry broadcast by the lander - not just the beacon signal - and that data should be beamed back to Earth overnight, according to Ferri. \"This is fundamental because we should remember that this landing was a test, and as part of the test, you want to know what happened,\" Ferri said. \"If the landing were to fail, presumably from TGO we will know what was the last thing that worked all right,\" said Jorge Vago, ESA's ExoMars project scientist, in an interview with Spaceflight Now on Tuesday, before Schiaparelli's landing attempt. Officials hope to share more on what they know about Schiaparelli's fate in a press conference Thursday at 0800 GMT. Schiaparelli rode to Mars piggyback on the Trace Gas Orbiter after their tandem launch March 14 aboard a Russian Proton rocket, then separated Sunday for the final approach to the planet. Both ExoMars spacecraft were manufactured by an industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space. The orbiter fired its main engine at 1305 GMT, smoothly slowing the craft's velocity by more than 3,300 mph during a 139-minute burn. The final few minutes of the make-or-break rocket maneuver occurred as the spacecraft flew behind Mars, temporarily cutting off communications. When mission control regained contact with the Trace Gas Orbiter, telemetry showed the probe was healthy and had completed the orbit insertion burn as planned. The confirmation sparked a round of applause inside the ExoMars control center, but attention quickly turned back to Schiaparelli. \"Part of the mission is a clear go,\" said Don McCoy, ESA's ExoMars project manager, after the Trace Gas Orbiter braked into orbit around Mars without difficulty. \"For the lander, we have received some data ... We've seen a series of indicators of the entry, parachute deployment, release of the backshell, etc. We don't have the full set of data.\" The orbiter is the primary part of the mission, carrying four science instruments to take pictures, locate water resources, and search for the sources of intermittent methane detected in the Martian atmosphere, an indicator of ongoing biological or geological activity. ESA expects the Trace Gas Orbiter to function through at least 2022 and help relay commands and science data between Earth and a fleet of existing and planned rovers on the Martian surface. NASA provided two radio packages for the orbiter to link up with the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, along with planned rovers from NASA and ESA scheduled for launch in 2020. Officials billed Schiaparelli as a technology demonstrator, and the probe was aiming to become the first European spacecraft to successfully land and function on Mars. Engineers hoped lessons learned from Schiaparelli will feed into the design of the second part of the two-launch ExoMars program, a European-built rover scheduled for liftoff in mid-2020. Under the terms of their partnership with ESA, Russian engineers will design and build the descent module for the ExoMars rover, but the computer and parts of the lander's guidance system will come from Europe. Schiaparelli was supposed to verify parts of the design worked at Mars. A doppler radar altimeter was supposed to activate when Schiaparelli jettisoned its forward heat shield under parachute and collect data on the spacecraft's altitude and speed. The measurements were to go to Schiaparelli on-board computer to control the thrust of nine hydrazine-fueled rocket engines fixed around the perimeter of the probe. The thrusters were programmed to cut off around 6 feet, or 2 meters, above the Martian surface, and Schiaparelli was to fall to the ground cushioned by a crushable carbon-fiber crash structure. A downward-facing descent camera was expected to take images during the last phase of Schiaparelli's descent, and the lander's computer was supposed to switch on a weather station after touchdown to monitor the temperature, humidity, pressure, dust opacity, wind speed, and wind direction at site landing site in Meridiani Planum, a relatively flat plain near the Martian equator.

As it nears the planet, the probe will wake and aim for a small ellipse-shaped landing zone. A smooth descent will see the probe touch down at 3.48pm UK time on Wednesday. The battery-operated Schiaparelli is expected to last about two days on Mars. From the moment it lands, it will take weather measurements and record electrical fields near the surface. Swirling dust storms that can spread across the whole planet generate such strong electric fields they can rip apart carbon dioxide and water molecules in the atmosphere. High above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter must slam on its brakes so it can be captured by the planet's gravity. The braking manoeuvre calls for a main engine burn of more than two hours, but in that time the spacecraft will pass behind the red planet and lose all communications with Earth. \"We won't know if it has gone into orbit properly until it comes out the other side,\" said Denis. The Trace Gas Orbiter, a giant machine measuring 18 metres across with its solar arrays unfurled, will take many months to steer into the right orbit from which it can do serious science. But with its sensors fully operational at the end of next year, the orbiter will sniff the Martian atmosphere for low levels of gases, including the mysterious methane detected by Europe's Mars Express orbiter more than a decade ago. The surface of Mars appears to belch out plumes of the gas. While it may come from natural reactions in rocks, it could equally be a sign of life. \"The more we can study these trace gases, the more we'll understand the full picture,\" said H\u00e5kan Svedhem, project scientist on ExoMars. Should the orbiter detect enough Martian methane, it can learn where the gas comes from. A key measurement will be the ratio of carbon isotopes. When methane is made by life, it has a different proportion of carbon-12 to carbon-13 than when it is given off from geological processes. \"Methane on Mars is a longstanding puzzle. Is it coming from geological activity under the surface or is it coming from life? Either of those would be amazing, but life would of course be stunning,\" said Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. If the rover launches as planned, it will arrive in 2021. \"The ExoMars rover will be the first mission in recent times to look for signs of life. Nasa's rovers have followed the water and made important discoveries, but what they haven't been able to do is actually get to the life question. That's the really new thing we'll be able to do with the rover,\" Coates said. Last year, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted the final resting place of the Beagle 2 probe, which went missing after its attempted landing on Christmas Day 2003. In a handful of pixels, the orbiter's camera showed the Beagle had landed, but had failed to deploy its solar panels. \"We got Beagle to the right place, so most of its descent system must have worked. It didn't explode into a thousand pieces,\" said Denis. \"As for Schiaparelli, once we have uploaded the commands, we sit back and watch. It is a technology demonstrator, and those are not supposed to fail, but there might be some little surprises. We'll see on the day.\" This article was amended on 17 October 2016. An earlier version said the US, the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia had put a working lander on Mars. That was not true of Russia.

Named for Giovanni Schiaparelli, the Italian astronomer who charted the first rudimentary maps of Mars in the 19th century, the landing probe is heading for a target in Meridiani Planum, an expansive plain near the Martian equator. Schiaparelli deployed from a pod on its carrier craft, an instrument-laden satellite heading into orbit around Mars, as scheduled at 1442 GMT Sunday, and each spacecraft is heading off on separate missions. Both elements - built by Thales Alenia Space - are part of the European Space Agency's ExoMars program in partnership with Russia, which was responsible for launching the mission. The next phase of the ExoMars mission will come in 2020 with the launch of a European-built rover on another Russian rocket. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has several purposes: measuring traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere, improving maps of the planet, and relaying signals between Earth and rovers on the surface. Ground controllers at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait longer than expected to regain a full telemetry link from the orbiter mothership after the separation maneuver, but the problem apparently had no lasting effects. The orbiter fired its engine for about one minute, 46 seconds, overnight Sunday to shove the spacecraft off of a collision course with Mars. Navigators intentionally pointed the orbiter's trajectory for Mars for the release of Schiaparelli, which is coasting toward the planet and unable to adjust its course. The overnight rocket firing put the Trace Gas Orbiter on track for a position several hundred miles above Mars for a critical make-or-break engine burn Wednesday to swing into orbit around the planet. At the same time Wednesday, the 7.9-foot-diameter Schiaparelli lander will dive into the atmosphere. Its computers will wake the spacecraft from hibernation shortly before entry. Schiaparelli an experimental testbed designed to prove Europe can successfully land a spacecraft on the Martian surface. It carries a downward-facing camera to collect images during the descent, and a weather station on Schiaparelli will return data on the temperature, humidity, pressure and winds at the landing site. Another suite of sensors will monitor conditions during Schiaparelli's six- minute plunge into the Martian atmosphere, gathering inputs that could help engineers design future Mars missions. A heat shield, parachute and rocket thrusters will slow Schiaparelli's descent, then the braking rockets will cut off at an altitude of 6 feet, allowing the craft to fall to the ground on a crushable carbon fiber shell. Schiaparelli is a relatively simple spacecraft, and its battery should provide power for up to eight days of operations after landing. The probe is not able to recharge the battery. Schiaparelli will be the first mission to touch down on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season, and its landing will come 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet. Mission control never heard from Beagle 2 after its landing attempt, but scientists last year revealed new imagery from Mars orbit apparently showing the lander sitting on the surface with its power-generating solar arrays still partially folded. The discovery led engineers to conclude Beagle 2 may have survived its landing, but a problem prevented full deployment of the solar panels, potentially blocking the antenna that was to radio its status to Earth. Schiaparelli's flight to Mars is Europe's second try, with a much bigger package than Beagle 2. It goes to Mars with a doppler radar guidance system, modernized control algorithms and a computer that will be crucial to the 2020 mission's rover landing. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will become the sixth operational spacecraft circling Mars, and the second European orbiter studying the red planet. It will join three other NASA orbiters and an Indian spacecraft flying around Mars.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/17/european-mars-lander-released-from-exomars-mothership/"}, {"title": "ESA celebrates ExoMars orbiter success, keeps vigil for lost lander", "date": "2016-10-19", "content": "A European-built orbiter designed to seek out the source of methane on Mars slipped into orbit around the red planet Wednesday after a seven-month interplanetary journey, but mission control lost contact with an experimental landing probe just before touchdown. Both spacecraft - part of the joint European-Russian ExoMars program - reached Mars around the same time Wednesday for simultaneous maneuvers to swing into orbit and plunge into the red planet's atmosphere. The Schiaparelli lander, shaped like a flying saucer with a diameter of nearly 8 feet, dived into the Martian atmosphere as expected around 1442 GMT Wednesday. Designed for a technology demonstration mission, Schiaparelli had heat shield tiles, a parachute and nine rocket thrusters to slow its speed from 13,000 mph to zero in less than six minutes. But something went wrong in the last phase of the descent, interrupting a real-time beacon signal sent back to Earth to a vast radio telescope array in Pune, India. The carrier tone went silent after mission controllers reported Schiaparelli's supersonic parachute had deployed, but the signal only told engineers whether the spacecraft was transmitting, and did not contain telemetry data that might reveal the root of the problem. European Space Agency officials waited to receive a recording of Schiaparelli's beacon signal from the Mars Express orbiter around the red planet to confirm some sort of glitch with the Indian antennas was not responsible for the loss of communications. \"We saw the signal through the atmospheric phase - the descent phase. At a certain point, it stopped,\" said Paolo Ferri, head of ESA's mission operations department. \"This was unexpected, but we couldn't conclude anything from that because this very weak signal picked up on the ground was coming from an experimental tool.\" The telescope array in India was never designed to communicate with deep space missions like Schiaparelli, but engineers added equipment to the antenna network - the largest in the world - for Wednesday's Mars landing in hopes of gaining real-time insight into the status of the mission. Otherwise, ground controllers would have had to wait for Mars Express for news on the 1,272-pound landing craft. It turns out the ground team at the European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany, had to wait all day Wednesday as data on Schiaparelli's landing trickled back to Earth and hopes for the mission's successful landing waned. The carrier signal from Schiaparelli relayed by Mars Express also abruptly ended shortly before landing, just as the beacon tone received in India. \"The Mars Express measurement came ... and confirmed exactly the same: the signal went through the majority of the descent phase, and it stopped at a certain point that we reckon was before the landing,\" Ferri said. \"There could be many many reasons for that,\" Ferri said. \"It's clear these are not good signs, but we will need more information.\" The newly-arrived Trace Gas Orbiter, Schiaparelli's mothership, recorded detailed telemetry broadcast by the lander - not just the beacon signal - and that data should be beamed back to Earth overnight, according to Ferri. \"This is fundamental because we should remember that this landing was a test, and as part of the test, you want to know what happened,\" Ferri said. \"If the landing were to fail, presumably from TGO we will know what was the last thing that worked all right,\" said Jorge Vago, ESA's ExoMars project scientist, in an interview with Spaceflight Now on Tuesday, before Schiaparelli's landing attempt. Officials hope to share more on what they know about Schiaparelli's fate in a press conference Thursday at 0800 GMT. Schiaparelli rode to Mars piggyback on the Trace Gas Orbiter after their tandem launch March 14 aboard a Russian Proton rocket, then separated Sunday for the final approach to the planet. Both ExoMars spacecraft were manufactured by an industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space. The orbiter fired its main engine at 1305 GMT, smoothly slowing the craft's velocity by more than 3,300 mph during a 139-minute burn. The final few minutes of the make-or-break rocket maneuver occurred as the spacecraft flew behind Mars, temporarily cutting off communications. When mission control regained contact with the Trace Gas Orbiter, telemetry showed the probe was healthy and had completed the orbit insertion burn as planned. The confirmation sparked a round of applause inside the ExoMars control center, but attention quickly turned back to Schiaparelli. \"Part of the mission is a clear go,\" said Don McCoy, ESA's ExoMars project manager, after the Trace Gas Orbiter braked into orbit around Mars without difficulty. \"For the lander, we have received some data ... We've seen a series of indicators of the entry, parachute deployment, release of the backshell, etc. We don't have the full set of data.\" The orbiter is the primary part of the mission, carrying four science instruments to take pictures, locate water resources, and search for the sources of intermittent methane detected in the Martian atmosphere, an indicator of ongoing biological or geological activity. ESA expects the Trace Gas Orbiter to function through at least 2022 and help relay commands and science data between Earth and a fleet of existing and planned rovers on the Martian surface. NASA provided two radio packages for the orbiter to link up with the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, along with planned rovers from NASA and ESA scheduled for launch in 2020. Officials billed Schiaparelli as a technology demonstrator, and the probe was aiming to become the first European spacecraft to successfully land and function on Mars. Engineers hoped lessons learned from Schiaparelli will feed into the design of the second part of the two-launch ExoMars program, a European-built rover scheduled for liftoff in mid-2020. Under the terms of their partnership with ESA, Russian engineers will design and build the descent module for the ExoMars rover, but the computer and parts of the lander's guidance system will come from Europe. Schiaparelli was supposed to verify parts of the design worked at Mars. A doppler radar altimeter was supposed to activate when Schiaparelli jettisoned its forward heat shield under parachute and collect data on the spacecraft's altitude and speed. The measurements were to go to Schiaparelli on-board computer to control the thrust of nine hydrazine-fueled rocket engines fixed around the perimeter of the probe. The thrusters were programmed to cut off around 6 feet, or 2 meters, above the Martian surface, and Schiaparelli was to fall to the ground cushioned by a crushable carbon-fiber crash structure. A downward-facing descent camera was expected to take images during the last phase of Schiaparelli's descent, and the lander's computer was supposed to switch on a weather station after touchdown to monitor the temperature, humidity, pressure, dust opacity, wind speed, and wind direction at site landing site in Meridiani Planum, a relatively flat plain near the Martian equator. Named for Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the lander was to become the first mission to land on Mars during the planet's global dust storm season. One of the sensors aboard the craft was designed to measure electrical fields in the Martian atmosphere, one of the mechanisms scientists think might drive dust storms. \"The Schiaparelli lander was designed to be able to land in a global dust storm, a big one where you don't see anything,\" Vago said. \"From the point-of- view of hypersonic entry, heat shield performance, and parachute performance, it should all be OK.\" The lander, primarily funded and built in Italy, was also fitted with instrumentation to track the density, pressure and temperature of the atmosphere from the point of entry at an altitude of 80 miles to the surface. Another payload on Schiaparelli was a compact array of laser retroreflectors to help future orbiters precisely locate the lander. Schiaparelli only carried batteries to power its science sensors, computer and radio transmitter, so engineers expected it to shut down within a few days of landing. ESA said ground controllers will have multiple opportunities in the comings to attempt to contact Schiaparelli - assuming it is safely on the surface - before its batteries run down. \"We don't know all the details, but this is typical for a test,\" said Jan Woerner, ESA's director general. \"We did this in order to get data about how to land European technology on Mars, therefore, all the data we will get tonight ... will be used to understand how to manage the next landing when we will go with a European rover.\" Wednesday's nail-biting landing attempt came 13 years after the Beagle 2 probe built in Britain reached the red planet. Mission control never heard from Beagle 2 after its landing attempt, but scientists last year revealed new imagery from Mars orbit apparently showing the lander sitting the surface with its power-generating solar arrays still partially folded. The discovery led engineers to conclude Beagle 2 may have survived its landing, but a problem prevented full deployment of the solar panels, potentially blocking the antenna that was to radio its status to Earth. Schiaparelli's flight to Mars was Europe's second try, with a much bigger package than Beagle 2. It went to Mars with the new doppler radar guidance system, modernized control algorithms and a computer that will be crucial to the 2020 mission's rover landing. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is ESA's second spacecraft circling the red planet after Mars Express, which is still flying well beyond its design life after arriving at Mars in 2003. With the insertion of the latest orbiter, there are now six active satellites around Mars, including the two ESA science stations, three NASA orbiters, and an Indian spacecraft. Navigators intended for the Trace Gas Orbiter to enter into an initial egg- shaped orbit taking the spacecraft as close as 186 miles and as far as 60,000 miles from Mars. Experts verified the orbiter was right on course after its orbit insertion burn. \"Yes, the TGO is captured in orbit around Mars, and yes, it's in a very nominal orbit of four days duration, only a couple hours more, but this is within a few percent, and it's perfectly normal,\" said Michel Denis, ExoMars flight director. All systems on the orbiter are performing well, he said. \"It's all good,\" Denis said. \"It's a good spacecraft at the right place, and we have a mission around Mars, another one.\" The orbiter will turn on its camera and science instruments for two orbits - about eight days - in November for a first look at the red planet since arriving, according to Vago. \"We will turn the instruments on and hope to be able to make some interesting first observations then,\" Vago said. \"Don't expect any magnificent revelations on the distribution of methane or trace gases just in two orbits, but some images for sure and the confirmation that the instruments work as well.\" Starting in January, the orbiter will begin an aerobraking campaign, dipping into the upper fringes of Mars' atmosphere on each lap around the planet. Drag on the spacecraft's solar panels will gradually lower its altitude, with the satellite ending up in a circular 250-mile-high orbit by early 2018.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/19/esa-celebrates-exomars-orbiter-success-keeps-vigil-for-lost-lander/"}, {"title": "European Probe Snaps Color Photos of Martian Moon Phobos", "date": "2016-12-27", "content": "The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter orbiting Mars has snapped its first views of Phobos, the largest of two moons circling the Red Planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter, or TGO, is part of the European ExoMars exploration program and arrived in orbit around Mars on Oct. 19. The orbiter snapped the new views of Phobos during its second orbit Mars. It was the second half of a series of test science measurements, with the first half focused on Mars itself during its first orbit. TGO captured the images used to make the composite view seen here while the probe was about 4,784 miles from Phobos. The camera collected two images with each of its four color filters which are optimized to show distinctions in the mineral makeup of the Martian satellite. These differences show up as the \"bluer\" or \"redder\" colors in the image. By using images the blue-green and red filters, a 3D image was produced as well. \"Although higher-resolution images of Phobos have been returned by other missions, such as ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, this provided a good test of what can be done with our data in a very short time,\" Nick Thomas, principal investigator of TGO's CaSSIS camera team at the University of Bern, said in a statement. \"The images have given us a lot of useful information about the color calibration of the camera and its internal timing.\" With testing of the ExoMars instruments underway, team members focus on getting the craft into it's near-circular science orbit by the end of 2017 through aerobraking. The leading scientific goal for TGO's mission is to gather detailed records of rare gases in Mars' atmosphere - methane, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide and acetylene, which compose less than 1 percent of the atmosphere's volume. Methane is of particular interest because Earth's methane is primarily produced thanks to biological activity, with some contributed by hydrothermal reactions. ExoMars also hopes to uncover whether water or ice exists just below the surface. Color and stereo images of the surface will aid in these findings.

The Trace Gas Orbiter, TGO for short, arrived at Mars back in October after a half-year interplanetary cruise, firing its engine for nearly two and a half hours to hit the brakes in order to be captured in orbit around Mars. TGO's critical orbit insertion maneuver was a complete success and ESA said the spacecraft achieved an orbit of 250 by 98,000 Kilometers, inclined seven degrees to either side of the Martian equator. Taking 4.2 days for each lap around the planet, TGO completed a pair of science checkout orbits in late November, exercising the spacecraft's imagers and spectrometers to ensure the cutting-edge instruments were in good shape, also providing valuable data for fine-tuning of the instruments over the coming months before science data acquisition can begin in earnest. One final hurdle that has to be passed before putting TGO's instruments to work is placing the spacecraft into its planned science orbit. The low inclination of the initial capture orbit was the result of the attempted landing of the Schiaparelli demonstrator module in Meridiani Planum near the equator, also taking into account the required position of TGO at the time of the landing to capture signals sent by the descending craft. These signals proved out vital in the investigation into the unfortunate failure of Schiaparelli's landing at the point of parachute descent. TGO's orbital adjustment has been set up as a two-stage effort starting with a propulsive plane change followed by a lengthy period of aerobraking for altitude reduction. The initial inclination of seven degrees is not of much use for science as it would only allow the orbiter to cover a small band around the equator - requiring a significant plane change to position TGO into an orbital trajectory covering the majority of the planet. Therefore, TGO brought sufficient propellant for a series of plane change maneuvers, firing its 424-Newton main engine out-of-plane in order to increase the orbital inclination while also shaving off some apoapsis altitude. Engine firings were performed on January 19, 23 and 27 with very high precision according to tracking data gathered after each maneuver. A small trim maneuver was carried out on February 5 to fine-tune the orbital inclination and lower the periapsis altitude from 250 to 210 Kilometers in preparation for future operations. Still in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars, TGO is now set to head into an aerobraking campaign of around 13 months picking up in mid-March after another series of science calibration passes. Aerobraking has been chosen over a propulsive apoapsis reduction given the limitations of fuel mass imposed on the mission and the desire to preserve as much propellant as possible for later mission phases. Aerobraking will be completed by stepping down the periapsis altitude to have the spacecraft skim the outermost layers of the Martian atmosphere with the solar arrays acting as drag brakes. With each successive pass through the atmosphere, the apoapsis altitude will be lowered. Successful aerobraking requires a lot of finesse in setting up the low passes, walking on a relatively fine line between efficient braking and potentially hazardous aerodynamic environments for the spacecraft. Frequent tracking data will be obtained after each pass to ensure the spacecraft remains on a safe trajectory at all times. Aerobraking is budgeted for 13 months with a two-month break to wait out a solar conjunction in July/August 2017, however, there is some uncertainty of up to several months depending how efficiently the aerobraking campaign goes. The start of TGO's four-year science mission is expected in 2018. The Trace Gas Orbiter, built in Europe by Thales Alenia, is outfitted with two European and two Russian instruments - a pair of high-fidelity spectrometer instruments, a high-resolution imaging camera, and a suite of neutron sensors and radiation dosimeters. The two spectrometer instruments are capable of detecting the spectral signatures of trace gases down to a concentration of a few parts per billion, allowing TGO to track changes in the Martian atmosphere, to create high-resolution vertical profiles from the ground to 160 Kilometers in altitude, and to identify possible sources and sinks for atmospheric trace gases. These sources and sinks on the Martian surface will be imaged in full-color and stereoscopic photography to tie atmospheric phenomena to processes ongoing within the surface of Mars. The neutron instrument will deliver a high-resolution map of water in the Martian subsurface and measure the total radiation a human would endure when in transit to and in orbit around Mars. TGO also acts as a communications terminal in Mars Orbit, outfitted with Electra radio units that can receive data from Mars surface missions.

These differences show up as the \"bluer\" or \"redder\" colors in the image. By using images the blue-green and red filters, a 3D image was produced as well. \"Although higher-resolution images of Phobos have been returned by other missions, such as ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, this provided a good test of what can be done with our data in a very short time,\" Nick Thomas, principal investigator of TGO's CaSSIS camera team at the University of Bern, said in a statement. \"The images have given us a lot of useful information about the color calibration of the camera and its internal timing.\" With testing of the ExoMars instruments underway, team members focus on getting the craft into it's near-circular science orbit by the end of 2017 through aerobraking. The leading scientific goal for TGO's mission is to gather detailed records of rare gases in Mars' atmosphere - methane, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide and acetylene, which compose less than 1 percent of the atmosphere's volume. Methane is of particular interest because Earth's methane is primarily produced thanks to biological activity, with some contributed by hydrothermal reactions. ExoMars also hopes to uncover whether water or ice exists just below the surface. Color and stereo images of the surface will aid in these findings. TGO will serve as a data relay for current and future crafts on the surface of Mars, including the 2020 ExoMars mission featuring a rover and surface science platform.", "url": "https://www.space.com/35029-mars-moon-phobos-exomars-color-photos.html"}, {"title": "ESA Mars Orbiter completes Plane Change Maneuvers ahead of long Aerobraking Campaign", "date": "2017-02-14", "content": "ESA's Trace Gas Orbiter completed a series of engine burns to shift its orbit around Mars toward a higher inclination in preparation for a lengthy altitude reduction campaign that will take the rest of the year and spiral the spacecraft down into its science orbit from where the orbiter can obtain a detailed inventory of the Martian atmosphere. The Trace Gas Orbiter, TGO for short, arrived at Mars back in October after a half-year interplanetary cruise, firing its engine for nearly two and a half hours to hit the brakes in order to be captured in orbit around Mars. TGO's critical orbit insertion maneuver was a complete success and ESA said the spacecraft achieved an orbit of 250 by 98,000 Kilometers, inclined seven degrees to either side of the Martian equator. Taking 4.2 days for each lap around the planet, TGO completed a pair of science checkout orbits in late November, exercising the spacecraft's imagers and spectrometers to ensure the cutting-edge instruments were in good shape, also providing valuable data for fine-tuning of the instruments over the coming months before science data acquisition can begin in earnest. One final hurdle that has to be passed before putting TGO's instruments to work is placing the spacecraft into its planned science orbit. The low inclination of the initial capture orbit was the result of the attempted landing of the Schiaparelli demonstrator module in Meridiani Planum near the equator, also taking into account the required position of TGO at the time of the landing to capture signals sent by the descending craft. These signals proved out vital in the investigation into the unfortunate failure of Schiaparelli's landing at the point of parachute descent. TGO's orbital adjustment has been set up as a two-stage effort starting with a propulsive plane change followed by a lengthy period of aerobraking for altitude reduction. The initial inclination of seven degrees is not of much use for science as it would only allow the orbiter to cover a small band around the equator - requiring a significant plane change to position TGO into an orbital trajectory covering the majority of the planet. Therefore, TGO brought sufficient propellant for a series of plane change maneuvers, firing its 424-Newton main engine out-of-plane in order to increase the orbital inclination while also shaving off some apoapsis altitude. Engine firings were performed on January 19, 23 and 27 with very high precision according to tracking data gathered after each maneuver. A small trim maneuver was carried out on February 5 to fine-tune the orbital inclination and lower the periapsis altitude from 250 to 210 Kilometers in preparation for future operations. Still in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars, TGO is now set to head into an aerobraking campaign of around 13 months picking up in mid-March after another series of science calibration passes. Aerobraking has been chosen over a propulsive apoapsis reduction given the limitations of fuel mass imposed on the mission and the desire to preserve as much propellant as possible for later mission phases. Aerobraking will be completed by stepping down the periapsis altitude to have the spacecraft skim the outermost layers of the Martian atmosphere with the solar arrays acting as drag brakes. With each successive pass through the atmosphere, the apoapsis altitude will be lowered. Successful aerobraking requires a lot of finesse in setting up the low passes, walking on a relatively fine line between efficient braking and potentially hazardous aerodynamic environments for the spacecraft. Frequent tracking data will be obtained after each pass to ensure the spacecraft remains on a safe trajectory at all times. Aerobraking is budgeted for 13 months with a two-month break to wait out a solar conjunction in July/August 2017, however, there is some uncertainty of up to several months depending how efficiently the aerobraking campaign goes. The start of TGO's four-year science mission is expected in 2018.

These sources and sinks on the Martian surface will be imaged in full-color and stereoscopic photography to tie atmospheric phenomena to processes ongoing within the surface of Mars.

It will also serve as a relay, connecting rovers on the surface with their controllers on Earth. But before any of this could get underway, the spacecraft had to transform its initial, highly elliptical four-day orbit of about 98 000 x 200 km into the final, much lower and circular path at about 400 km. \"Since March 2017, we've been conducting a terrifically delicate 'aerobraking' campaign, during which we commanded it to dip into the wispy, upper-most tendrils of the atmosphere once per revolution, slowing the craft and lowering its orbit,\" says ESA flight director Michel Denis. \"This took advantage of the faint drag on the solar wings, steadily transforming the orbit.

The thin upper atmosphere provides only gentle deceleration - at most some 17 mm/s each second. How small is this? If you braked your car at this rate from an initial speed of 50 km/h to stop at a junction, you'd have to start 6 km in advance. \"Aerobraking works only because we spent significant time in the atmosphere during each orbit, and then repeated this over 950 times,\" says Michel. \"Over a year, we've reduced the speed of the spacecraft by an enormous 3600 km/h, lowering its orbit by the necessary amount.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180222072551/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Surfing_complete"}, {"title": "Methane-Sniffing Orbiter Finishes 'Aerobraking' Dives Through Mars' Atmosphere", "date": "2018-02-24", "content": "A spacecraft that will sniff for possible signs of life in the Martian atmosphere is nearly ready to start its science work at the Red Planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) - part of the European-led, Russian-assisted ExoMars exploration program - just wrapped up a nearly yearlong \"aerobraking\" campaign, during which it used the drag from Mars' atmosphere to lower and circularize its orbit. \"Aerobraking works only because we spent significant time in the atmosphere during each orbit, and then repeated this over 950 times,\" European Space Agency (ESA) flight director Michel Denis said in a statement. \"Over a year, we've reduced the speed of the spacecraft by an enormous 3,600 km/h [2,240 mph], lowering its orbit by the necessary amount.\" When TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016, it slipped into a highly elliptical four-day-long orbit, which brought it as close to the Red Planet as 124 miles (200 kilometers) and took it as far away as 60,900 miles (98,000 km). The aerobraking campaign, which ran from March 2017 through Tuesday (Feb. 20), brought the most-distant point down to a mere 650 miles (1,050 km) while keeping the closest approach the same, ESA officials said. There's still work to be done, however: TGO's final path is a circular one that's 250 miles (400 km) above the Martian surface. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will achieve this orbit by mid-April after a series of thruster firings. TGO will begin checking out its instruments in mid-March, while these maneuvers are still going on, so the orbiter will be ready to start making science observations on April 21. \"Then, the craft will be reoriented to keep its camera pointing downwards and its spectrometers towards the sun, so as to observe the Mars atmosphere, and we can finally begin the long-awaited science phase of the mission,\" H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's project scientist, said in the same statement. The science phase will involve the characterization of low-abundance gases in the Martian air, including methane, which could be a sign of life. About 90 percent of Earth's atmospheric methane is produced biologically, and astronomers have detected apparent plumes of the stuff in Mars' air several times in the past decade or so. Methane can also be produced abiotically, however, so such plumes by themselves are not evidence of tiny Martians. Scientists hope TGO can help them figure out just where the Red Planet's methane is coming from, and what's generating it. TGO also has several other tasks, including hunting for buried water ice and serving as a data relay for the life-hunting ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to touch down in 2021. TGO launched toward Mars in March 2016 along with a lander called Schiaparelli, which was designed to test the touchdown technologies for the ExoMars rover. Schiaparelli crashed on the Red Planet's surface in October 2016; ESA officials later traced the mishap to a data glitch, which confused the lander's onboard computer with conflicting information.", "url": "https://www.space.com/39796-methane-sniffing-mars-orbiter-aerobraking-dives.html"}, {"title": "European Mars orbiter completes 11-month aerobraking maneuver", "date": "2018-02-25", "content": "It has to be one of the slowest parking attempts ever made, but ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has completed a daring maneuver that saw it surfing the outer layers of the Martian atmosphere for 11 months. The purpose of the exercise was to gradually lower the unmanned probe's trajectory to place it in a planet- hugging, near-circular orbit at an altitude of about 400 km, allowing the spacecraft to begin its mission to study trace gases on Mars as well as act as a communications relay between Mars surface rovers and Earth. Launched on March 14, 2016 atop a Proton-M rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the ExoMars Trace gas Orbiter arrived at Mars on October 19 of that year. However, the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical four-day orbit at an altitude ranging from 200 to 98,000 km, which was completely unsuitable for its mission. To alter this orbit in the most economical manner possible, in March 2017 mission control ordered the TGO to carry out a maneuver called aerobraking, which involves repeatedly hitting the very top layer of the Martian atmosphere to reduce its velocity and was first tried with ESA's Venus Express orbiter in 2014. Though to a human observer the atmosphere at about 103 km above Mars may seem like hard vacuum, there is enough air present to allow the solar panels on the TGO to act like the air brakes on an aircraft and slow it down. According to ESA, this braking isn't much - only decelerating the spacecraft by 17 mm per second per second, which would bring a car traveling at 50 km/h to a stop over a distance of 6 km. It's also a very tricky maneuver because with Mars at an average distance of 225 million km, it as to be carried out by the TGO under autonomous control. Worse, the Martian atmosphere expands greatly during the day and the summer months, so a single miscalculation could result in a probe burning up in an uncontrolled entry. The braking took over 950 orbits of the TGO and was completed on February 20 at 17:20 GMT when the spacecraft fired its thrusters for 16 minutes, placing it an orbit ranging between 1,050 and 200 km. This orbit will be fine tuned over the next month in a series of 10 thruster maneuvers to bring it into its final mission orbit in mid-April. Once on station, the TGO will have completed a month of instrument tests and calibrations, after which it will begin its primary mission of making a detailed inventory of atmospheric trace gases that could provide key insights into geological activity and possible biological signatures.

If you braked your car at this rate from an initial speed of 50 km/h to stop at a junction, you'd have to start 6 km in advance. \"Aerobraking works only because we spent significant time in the atmosphere during each orbit, and then repeated this over 950 times,\" says Michel. \"Over a year, we've reduced the speed of the spacecraft by an enormous 3600 km/h, lowering its orbit by the necessary amount.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180222072551/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Surfing_complete"}, {"title": "Methane-Sniffing Orbiter Finishes 'Aerobraking' Dives Through Mars' Atmosphere", "date": "2018-02-24", "content": "A spacecraft that will sniff for possible signs of life in the Martian atmosphere is nearly ready to start its science work at the Red Planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) - part of the European-led, Russian-assisted ExoMars exploration program - just wrapped up a nearly yearlong \"aerobraking\" campaign, during which it used the drag from Mars' atmosphere to lower and circularize its orbit. \"Aerobraking works only because we spent significant time in the atmosphere during each orbit, and then repeated this over 950 times,\" European Space Agency (ESA) flight director Michel Denis said in a statement. \"Over a year, we've reduced the speed of the spacecraft by an enormous 3,600 km/h [2,240 mph], lowering its orbit by the necessary amount.\" When TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016, it slipped into a highly elliptical four-day-long orbit, which brought it as close to the Red Planet as 124 miles (200 kilometers) and took it as far away as 60,900 miles (98,000 km). The aerobraking campaign, which ran from March 2017 through Tuesday (Feb. 20), brought the most-distant point down to a mere 650 miles (1,050 km) while keeping the closest approach the same, ESA officials said. There's still work to be done, however: TGO's final path is a circular one that's 250 miles (400 km) above the Martian surface. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will achieve this orbit by mid-April after a series of thruster firings. TGO will begin checking out its instruments in mid-March, while these maneuvers are still going on, so the orbiter will be ready to start making science observations on April 21. \"Then, the craft will be reoriented to keep its camera pointing downwards and its spectrometers towards the sun, so as to observe the Mars atmosphere, and we can finally begin the long-awaited science phase of the mission,\" H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's project scientist, said in the same statement. The science phase will involve the characterization of low-abundance gases in the Martian air, including methane, which could be a sign of life. About 90 percent of Earth's atmospheric methane is produced biologically, and astronomers have detected apparent plumes of the stuff in Mars' air several times in the past decade or so. Methane can also be produced abiotically, however, so such plumes by themselves are not evidence of tiny Martians. Scientists hope TGO can help them figure out just where the Red Planet's methane is coming from, and what's generating it. TGO also has several other tasks, including hunting for buried water ice and serving as a data relay for the life-hunting ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to touch down in 2021. TGO launched toward Mars in March 2016 along with a lander called Schiaparelli, which was designed to test the touchdown technologies for the ExoMars rover. Schiaparelli crashed on the Red Planet's surface in October 2016; ESA officials later traced the mishap to a data glitch, which confused the lander's onboard computer with conflicting information.", "url": "https://www.space.com/39796-methane-sniffing-mars-orbiter-aerobraking-dives.html"}, {"title": "European Mars orbiter completes 11-month aerobraking maneuver", "date": "2018-02-25", "content": "It has to be one of the slowest parking attempts ever made, but ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has completed a daring maneuver that saw it surfing the outer layers of the Martian atmosphere for 11 months. The purpose of the exercise was to gradually lower the unmanned probe's trajectory to place it in a planet- hugging, near-circular orbit at an altitude of about 400 km, allowing the spacecraft to begin its mission to study trace gases on Mars as well as act as a communications relay between Mars surface rovers and Earth. Launched on March 14, 2016 atop a Proton-M rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the ExoMars Trace gas Orbiter arrived at Mars on October 19 of that year. However, the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical four-day orbit at an altitude ranging from 200 to 98,000 km, which was completely unsuitable for its mission. To alter this orbit in the most economical manner possible, in March 2017 mission control ordered the TGO to carry out a maneuver called aerobraking, which involves repeatedly hitting the very top layer of the Martian atmosphere to reduce its velocity and was first tried with ESA's Venus Express orbiter in 2014. Though to a human observer the atmosphere at about 103 km above Mars may seem like hard vacuum, there is enough air present to allow the solar panels on the TGO to act like the air brakes on an aircraft and slow it down. According to ESA, this braking isn't much - only decelerating the spacecraft by 17 mm per second per second, which would bring a car traveling at 50 km/h to a stop over a distance of 6 km. It's also a very tricky maneuver because with Mars at an average distance of 225 million km, it as to be carried out by the TGO under autonomous control. Worse, the Martian atmosphere expands greatly during the day and the summer months, so a single miscalculation could result in a probe burning up in an uncontrolled entry. The braking took over 950 orbits of the TGO and was completed on February 20 at 17:20 GMT when the spacecraft fired its thrusters for 16 minutes, placing it an orbit ranging between 1,050 and 200 km. This orbit will be fine tuned over the next month in a series of 10 thruster maneuvers to bring it into its final mission orbit in mid-April. Once on station, the TGO will have completed a month of instrument tests and calibrations, after which it will begin its primary mission of making a detailed inventory of atmospheric trace gases that could provide key insights into geological activity and possible biological signatures. In addition, it will look for signs of subsurface ice as well as acting as a data-relay for surface lander missions beginning later this year.

The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured the image on Feb. 8 in Mars' Terra Sabaea region, using the spacecraft's Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System. Blue tracks represent parts of the ridge that were scraped and scoured by the tornadoes' winds. Though the actual color of the material exposed by the tornadoes is dark red, it shows up as blue in the color-composite image; this technique enhances the contrast of surface features, according to the statement. It is unknown why so many dust devils converged along the ridge, though the region's mountains may impact the flow of air masses and contribute to tornado formation, ESA representatives said. The ExoMars orbiter, which launched in 2016, also captured a photo of NASA's InSight lander on March 2, as it pounded its burrowing \"mole\" instrument into the ground to sample Mars' interior. In the image, InSight appears as a small, white speck inside a darker circle of rock scorched by the lander's rockets during touchdown.

In fact, the spacecraft's two spectrometers, NOMAD and ACS, found 10 to 100 times less methane than all previously reported detections by a variety of spacecraft and ground-based telescopes. Martian methane is an area of high interest because it can be a signature of biological activity. It also can be produced by geological processes, but either way, solar radiation acts to destroy it over relatively short timescales. As a result, any detections indicate recent activity. That's true even if the methane was generated millions to billions of years ago and remained trapped in sub-surface reservoirs until now. On Earth, 95 percent of all the methane in the atmosphere was produced by biological processes. The concentration is about 18 parts per billion by volume, or ppbv, meaning that out of every one billion molecules, 1,800 are methane. Previous methane detections in the martian atmosphere have been difficult to interpret. ESA's Mars Express orbiter found levels as high as 10 ppbv while Earth-based instruments captured transient events with readings as high as 45 ppbv. Data from NASA's Curiosity Mars rover suggests background levels that vary with the martian seasons between about 0.2 and 0.7 ppbv.

This is exciting because, on Earth, methane comes from two primary sources - biology and geology. Mars' methane has been detected by telescopes on Earth, orbiting spacecraft and rovers. It has been quite well established that the methane is there ; the big question is where does it come from? But now there is a new wrinkle in the data. Recent observations by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter have shown no presence of the methane, even though its instruments are more sensitive to tiny amounts than any of the instruments used previously. The new results were reported in Science on December 12, 2018, with the peer-reviewed paper published the same day. They were also announced at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington, D.C. The findings prompted an unexpected question - has Mars' methane gone missing? TGO is one of two components of the ExoMars mission, which crashed on Mars' surface. TGO began searching the atmosphere for traces of methane earlier this year, after the spacecraft achieved its circular \"science\" orbit of 250 miles above Mars' surface in April 2018. Two key spectrometers are being used - a Belgian instrument called NOMAD and a Russian one called ACS. They are capable of detecting methane in extremely small amounts - better than other instruments used so far. The scientists were sure they would see some methane, but when they analyzed the data sent back - they saw nothing. These initial results show no sign of methane down to a very minute level of 50 parts per trillion. The observations scanned most of the atmosphere, going almost all the way down to the surface. Ann Carine Vandaele, NOMAD's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy in Brussels, said that there is still some cleanup to do with the data, adding: But we already know we can't see any methane. So what is happening? The results seem disappointing, certainly, but there are a few things to keep in mind. The Curiosity rover has detected small amounts of methane on multiple occasions now. Plus, that data indicates the methane is seasonal in that region of Gale Crater, peaking in summer and dwindling again in winter. Curiosity detected a methane spike of seven parts per billion, which lasted for several months, before finding a seasonal spike of 0.7 ppb. In 2004, the Mars Express orbiter saw a methane spike of 10 ppb. As Chris Webster, a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who leads the methane-sensing instrument on Curiosity noted, it took his team six months to detect the first methane spike and years to find the seasonal background methane cycle. He is optimistic, saying that: I'm confident that over time there will be a consistency between the two data sets. Curiosity actually saw a large seasonal variation in the amount of methane. As noted by Webster: The thing that's so shocking here is this large variation. We're left trying to imagine how we can create this seasonal variation. The lowest background level of methane that Curiosity detected was 0.4 ppb. The highest levels ever detected so far were by Mike Mumma, a planetary scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center, and his colleagues in 2009. They detected spectral signs of a 45 ppb methane plume using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the twin telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. There's another possible positive result in all this. The lack of any methane right now would seem to indicate that it is not coming down through the atmosphere from space, e.g. from comets. That was one possible source of methane that had been considered early on. That would also be consistent with Curiosity's findings, that the methane is seasonal and most likely originating from underground sources. According to Webster: The methane is not coming from above. That's a big result. Scientists also think that methane could form from organic carbon that enters the atmosphere with dust, which would react with solar radiation. So where is it? It is suspected that Gale Crater is probably just one of many locations where methane seeps to the surface. But even if there are thousands, the total amount of methane produced would still be small. According to Sushil Atreya, a planetary scientist at the University of Michigan and a member of the Curiosity science team: I actually did the calculation. It's going to average out to be a very, very low value, nondetectable.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/esa-exomars-trace-gas-orbiter-missing-methane/"}, {"title": "Space Orbiter Spots 'Hairy Blue Spider' on Mars", "date": "2019-03-15", "content": "An image captured by a European Space Agency orbiter recently showed what appears to be a very hairy, blue spider extending its \"legs\" across the Martian landscape.

TGO and InSight are also working together, as explained last month by Nicolas Thomas, CaSSIS Principal Investigator, from the University of Bern in Switzerland: The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is being used to relay data from InSight to Earth. Because of this function, to avoid uncertainties in communications, we had not been able to point the camera towards the landing site so far - we had to wait until the landing site passed directly under the spacecraft to get this image. The image from TGO - in the Elysium Planitia region - covers an area of about 2.25 x 2.25 km in size; at that scale, InSight just looks like a bright dot on the relatively flat landscape. A dark patch surrounds the lander, caused by the retro rockets as the lander touched down. The heat shield and back shell are also visible in the image. Various rovers have also been photographed from orbit, and even their wheel tracks can be seen. InSight is a stationary lander, however, so it will always remain in the same spot. The CaSSIS system can also monitor the region surrounding InSight, including keeping watch for things like meteorite impacts - another great way that completely different missions, from different countries, can work together in Mars exploration. CaSSIS will also be used when the next part of the ExoMars mission arrives in 2021 - the Rosalind Franklin rover, for both imaging and data relay. The new image of InSight is just one of many new images released. Others cover a wide variety of landscape features, such as layered deposits in the polar regions, dynamic dunes and the effects of converging dust devils. The 3-D stereo images bring an extra sense of reality to the images, so that it is almost like actually being there. Color-composite images can better highlight the differences in surface features, helping scientists find regions that have been altered by water in the past and guide future exploration missions. All of these are valuable, as explained by Thomas: The InSight landing site image is just one of many really high quality images that we have been receiving. All of the images we're sharing today represent some of the best from the last few months. We're also really pleased with the digital terrain models. As also noted by H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's TGO project scientist: This stunning image showcase really demonstrates the scientific potential we have with TGO's imaging system. Over the course of the mission we'll be able to investigate dynamic surface processes, including those that might also help to constrain the atmospheric gas inventory that TGO's spectrometers have been analyzing, as well as characterise future landing sites. TGO's primary mission is to search for trace gases in the Martian atmosphere - including methane, which could be a sign of either active geology or biology. Oddly, it hasn't found any methane yet, although the gas has been confirmed previously by the Curiosity rover and multiple telescopes on Earth. The answer may lie in the fact that Curiosity documented a seasonal variation in the methane at its location in Gale Crater. TGO may have just looked at the wrong time, but it will continue to monitor the atmosphere in the months and years ahead. The entire TGO image library can be seen here. Bottom line: This fantastic collection of new images from TGO - like others - helps to show Mars as it really is, a world of diverse landscapes that in some ways are reminiscent of Earth, while also uniquely alien.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/images-mars-esa-exomars-orbiter-views-insight/"}, {"title": "Mars methane mystery deepens with ExoMars data", "date": "2019-04-16", "content": "The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter - TGO - spacecraft has found a surprising lack of methane in the martian atmosphere. In fact, the spacecraft's two spectrometers, NOMAD and ACS, found 10 to 100 times less methane than all previously reported detections by a variety of spacecraft and ground-based telescopes. Martian methane is an area of high interest because it can be a signature of biological activity. It also can be produced by geological processes, but either way, solar radiation acts to destroy it over relatively short timescales. As a result, any detections indicate recent activity. That's true even if the methane was generated millions to billions of years ago and remained trapped in sub-surface reservoirs until now. On Earth, 95 percent of all the methane in the atmosphere was produced by biological processes. The concentration is about 18 parts per billion by volume, or ppbv, meaning that out of every one billion molecules, 1,800 are methane. Previous methane detections in the martian atmosphere have been difficult to interpret. ESA's Mars Express orbiter found levels as high as 10 ppbv while Earth-based instruments captured transient events with readings as high as 45 ppbv. Data from NASA's Curiosity Mars rover suggests background levels that vary with the martian seasons between about 0.2 and 0.7 ppbv. The new results from TGO indicate an upper limit of just 0.05 ppbv, or 10 to 100 times less methane than all previous detections. That still means up to 500 tons of methane is present, but it is distributed through the entire martian atmosphere. \"We can only report a modest upper limit that suggests a global absence of methane,\" said ACS principal investigator Oleg Korablev from the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. \"The TGO's high-precision measurements seem to be at odds with previous detections. To reconcile the various datasets and match the fast transition from previously reported plumes to the apparently very low background levels, we need to find a method that efficiently destroys methane close to the surface of the planet.\" H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's TGO project scientist, said the latest observations mean \"we don't have all the pieces of the puzzle or see the full picture yet, but that is why we are there with TGO, making a detailed analysis of the atmosphere with the best instruments we have, to better understand how active this planet is - whether geologically or biologically.\"", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2019/04/16/mars-methane-mystery-deepens-with-exomars-data/"}, {"title": "The Mars Trace Gas Orbiter", "date": "2019-06-03", "content": "The Mars Trace Gas Orbiter Today's **Video of the Day** from the European Space Agency describes the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter, which provides scientists with data directly from rovers that are located on the surface of Mars.

On Earth, glowing oxygen is produced during polar auroras when energetic electrons from interplanetary space hit the upper atmosphere. This oxygen- driven emission of light gives polar auroras their beautiful and characteristic green hue. The aurora, however, is just one way in which planetary atmospheres light up. The atmospheres of planets including Earth and Mars glow constantly during both day and night as sunlight interacts with atoms and molecules within the atmosphere. Day and night glow are caused by slightly different mechanisms: night glow occurs as broken-apart molecules recombine, whereas day glow arises when the Sun's light directly excites atoms and molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen. On Earth, green night glow is quite faint, and so is best seen by looking from an 'edge on' perspective - as portrayed in many spectacular images taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. This faintness can be an issue when hunting for it around other planets, as their bright surfaces can drown it out. This green glow has now been detected for the first time at Mars by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since October 2016. \"One of the brightest emissions seen on Earth stems from night glow. More specifically, from oxygen atoms emitting a particular wavelength of light that has never been seen around another planet,\" says Jean-Claude G\u00e9rard of the Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, and lead author of the new study published in Nature Astronomy. \"However, this emission has been predicted to exist at Mars for around 40 years - and, thanks to TGO, we've found it.\" Jean-Claude and colleagues were able to spot this emission using a special observing mode of the TGO. One of the orbiter's advanced suite of instruments, known as NOMAD and including the ultraviolet and visible spectrometer, can observe in various configurations, one of which positions its instruments to point directly down at the martian surface - also referred to as the 'nadir' channel. \"Previous observations hadn't captured any kind of green glow at Mars, so we decided to reorient the UVIS nadir channel to point at the 'edge' of Mars, similar to the perspective you see in images of Earth taken from the ISS,\" adds co-author Ann Carine Vandaele of the Institut Royal d'A\u00e9ronomie Spatiale de Belgique, Belgium, and Principal Investigator of NOMAD. Between 24 April and 1 December 2019, Jean-Claude, Ann Carine, and colleagues used NOMAD-UVIS to scan altitudes ranging from 20 to 400 kilometers from the martian surface twice per orbit. When they analyzed these datasets, they found the green oxygen emission in all of them. \"The emission was strongest at an altitude of around 80 kilometers and varied depending on the changing distance between Mars and the Sun,\" adds Ann Carine. Studying the glow of planetary atmospheres can provide a wealth of information about the composition and dynamics of an atmosphere, and reveal how energy is deposited by both the Sun's light and the solar wind - the stream of charged particles emanating from our star. To better understand this green glow at Mars, and compare it to what we see around our own planet, Jean-Claude and colleagues dug further into how it was formed. \"We modeled this emission and found that it's mostly produced as carbon dioxide, or CO2, is broken up into its constituent parts: carbon monoxide and oxygen,\" says Jean-Claude. \"We saw the resulting oxygen atoms glowing in both visible and ultraviolet light.\" Simultaneously comparing these two kinds of emission showed that the visible emission was 16.5 times more intense than the ultraviolet. \"The observations at Mars agree with previous theoretical models but not with the actual glowing we've spotted around Earth, where the visible emission is far weaker,\" adds Jean-Claude. \"This suggests we have more to learn about how oxygen atoms behave, which is hugely important for our understanding of atomic and quantum physics.\" This understanding is key to characterizing planetary atmospheres and related phenomena - such as auroras. By deciphering the structure and behavior of this green glowing layer of Mars' atmosphere, scientists can gain insight into an altitude range that has remained largely unexplored, and monitor how it changes as the Sun's activity varies and Mars travels along its orbit around our star. \"This is the first tim this important emission has ever been observed around another planet beyond Earth, and marks the first scientific publication based on observations from the UVIS channel of the NOMAD instrument on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter,\" highlights H\u00e5kan Svedhem, ESA's TGO Project Scientist. \"It demonstrates the remarkably high sensitivity and optical quality of the NOMAD instrument. This is especially true given that this study explored the dayside of Mars, which is much brighter than the nightside, thus making it even more difficult to spot this faint emission.\" Understanding the properties of Mars' atmosphere is not only interesting scientifically, but is also key to operate the missions we send to the Red Planet. Atmospheric density, for example, directly affects the drag experienced by orbiting satellites and by the parachutes used to deliver probes to the martian surface. \"This type of remote-sensing observation, coupled with in situ measurements at higher altitudes, helps us to predict how the martian atmosphere will respond to seasonal changes and variations in solar activity,\" adds H\u00e5kan. \"Predicting changes in atmospheric density is especially important for forthcoming missions, including the ExoMars 2022 mission that will send a rover and surface science platform to explore the surface of the Red Planet.\"", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/unique-green-glow-spotted-on-mars-first-time-around-a-planet-other-than-earth/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Eight European satellites 'put to sleep' in COVID-19 move", "date": "2020-03-25", "content": "Eight spacecraft belonging to the European Space Agency are being put into hibernation as operations get scaled down amid the COVID 19 outbreak on the continent.

Atmospheric density, for example, directly affects the drag experienced by orbiting satellites and by the parachutes used to deliver probes to the martian surface. \"This type of remote-sensing observation, coupled with in situ measurements at higher altitudes, helps us to predict how the martian atmosphere will respond to seasonal changes and variations in solar activity,\" adds H\u00e5kan. \"Predicting changes in atmospheric density is especially important for forthcoming missions, including the ExoMars 2022 mission that will send a rover and surface science platform to explore the surface of the Red Planet.\"", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/unique-green-glow-spotted-on-mars-first-time-around-a-planet-other-than-earth/"}, {"title": "\"Puzzling and Surprising\" New Gas Signatures Discovered by ExoMars Orbiter in the Martian Atmosphere", "date": "2020-07-27", "content": "ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has spotted new gas signatures at Mars. These unlock new secrets about the martian atmosphere, and will enable a more accurate determination of whether there is methane, a gas associated with biological or geological activity, at the planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has been studying the Red Planet from orbit for over two years. The mission aims to understand the mixture of gases that make up the martian atmosphere, with a special focus on the mystery surrounding the presence of methane there. Meanwhile, the spacecraft has now spotted never-before-seen signatures of ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2), based on a full martian year of observations by its sensitive Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS). The findings are reported in two new papers published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, one led by Kevin Olsen of the University of Oxford, UK and another led by Alexander Trokhimovskiy of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia. \"These features are both puzzling and surprising,\" says Kevin. \"They lie over the exact wavelength range where we expected to see the strongest signs of methane. Before this discovery, the CO2 feature was completely unknown, and this is the first time ozone on Mars has been identified in this part of the infrared wavelength range.\" The martian atmosphere is dominated by CO2, which scientists observe to gauge temperatures, track seasons, explore air circulation, and more. Ozone - which forms a layer in the upper atmosphere on both Mars and Earth - helps to keep atmospheric chemistry stable. Both CO2 and ozone have been seen at Mars by spacecraft such as ESA's Mars Express, but the exquisite sensitivity of the ACS instrument on TGO was able to reveal new details about how these gases interact with light. Observing ozone in the range where TGO hunts for methane is a wholly unanticipated result. Scientists have mapped how martian ozone varies with altitude before. So far, however, this has largely taken place via methods that rely upon the gas' signatures in the ultraviolet, a technique which only allows measurement at high altitudes (over 20 km above the surface). The new ACS results show that it is possible to map martian ozone also in the infrared, so its behavior can be probed at lower altitudes to build a more detailed view of ozone's role in the planet's climate. Unraveling the methane mystery: One of the key objectives of TGO is to explore methane. To date, signs of martian methane - tentatively spied by missions including ESA's Mars Express from orbit and NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface - are variable and somewhat enigmatic. While also generated by geological processes, most of the methane on Earth is produced by life, from bacteria to livestock and human activity. Detecting methane on other planets is therefore hugely exciting. This is especially true given that the gas is known to break down in around 400 years, meaning that any methane present must have been produced or released in the relatively recent past. \"Discovering an unforeseen CO2 signature where we hunt for methane is significant,\" says Alexander Trokhimovskiy. \"This signature could not be accounted for before, and may therefore have played a role in detections of small amounts of methane at Mars.\" The observations analyzed by Alexander, Kevin, and colleagues were mostly performed at different times to those supporting detections of martian methane. Besides, the TGO data cannot account for large plumes of methane, only smaller amounts - and so, currently, there is no direct disagreement between missions. \"In fact, we're actively working on coordinating measurements with other missions,\" clarifies Kevin. \"Rather than disputing any previous claims, this finding is a motivator for all teams to look closer - the more we know, the more deeply and accurately we can explore Mars' atmosphere.\" Realizing the potential of ExoMars: Methane aside, the findings highlight just how much we will learn about Mars as a result of the ExoMars program. \"These findings enable us to build a fuller understanding of our planetary neighbor,\" adds Alexander. \"Ozone and CO2 are important in Mars' atmosphere. By not accounting for these gases properly, we run the risk of mischaracterizing the phenomena or properties we see.\" Additionally, the surprising discovery of the new CO2 band at Mars, never before observed in the laboratory, provides exciting insight for those studying how molecules interact both with one another and with light - and searching for the unique chemical fingerprints of these interactions in space. \"Together, these two studies take a significant step towards revealing the true characteristics of Mars: towards a new level of accuracy and understanding,\" says Alexander. Successful collaboration in the hunt for life: As its name suggests, the TGO aims to characterize any trace gases in Mars' atmosphere that could arise from active geological or biological processes on the planet, and identify their origin. The ExoMars program consists of two missions: TGO, which was launched in 2016 and will be joined by the Rosalind Franklin rover and the Kazachok landing platform, due to lift off in 2022. These will take instruments complementary to ACS to the martian surface, examining the planet's atmosphere from a different perspective, and share the core objective of the ExoMars programme: to search for signs of past or present life on the Red Planet. \"These findings are the direct result of hugely successful and ongoing collaboration between European and Russian scientists as part of ExoMars,\" says ESA TGO Project Scientist H\u00e5kan Svedhem. \"They set new standards for future spectral observations, and will help us to paint a more complete picture of Mars' atmospheric properties - including where and when there may be methane to be found, which remains a key question in Mars exploration.\" \"Additionally, these findings will prompt a thorough analysis of all the relevant data we've collected to date - and the prospect of new discovery in this way is, as always, very exciting. Each piece of information revealed by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter marks progress towards a more accurate understanding of Mars, and puts us one step closer to unraveling the planet's lingering mysteries.\"", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/puzzling-and-surprising-new-gas-signatures-discovered-by-exomars-orbiter-in-the-martian-atmosphere/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Eight European satellites 'put to sleep' in COVID-19 move", "date": "2020-03-25", "content": "Eight spacecraft belonging to the European Space Agency are being put into hibernation as operations get scaled down amid the COVID 19 outbreak on the continent.

On Earth, glowing oxygen is produced during polar auroras when energetic electrons from interplanetary space hit the upper atmosphere. This oxygen- driven emission of light gives polar auroras their beautiful and characteristic green hue. The aurora, however, is just one way in which planetary atmospheres light up. The atmospheres of planets including Earth and Mars glow constantly during both day and night as sunlight interacts with atoms and molecules within the atmosphere. Day and night glow are caused by slightly different mechanisms: night glow occurs as broken-apart molecules recombine, whereas day glow arises when the Sun's light directly excites atoms and molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen. On Earth, green night glow is quite faint, and so is best seen by looking from an 'edge on' perspective - as portrayed in many spectacular images taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. This faintness can be an issue when hunting for it around other planets, as their bright surfaces can drown it out. This green glow has now been detected for the first time at Mars by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since October 2016. \"One of the brightest emissions seen on Earth stems from night glow. More specifically, from oxygen atoms emitting a particular wavelength of light that has never been seen around another planet,\" says Jean-Claude G\u00e9rard of the Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, and lead author of the new study published in Nature Astronomy. \"However, this emission has been predicted to exist at Mars for around 40 years - and, thanks to TGO, we've found it.\" Jean-Claude and colleagues were able to spot this emission using a special observing mode of the TGO. One of the orbiter's advanced suite of instruments, known as NOMAD and including the ultraviolet and visible spectrometer, can observe in various configurations, one of which positions its instruments to point directly down at the martian surface - also referred to as the 'nadir' channel. \"Previous observations hadn't captured any kind of green glow at Mars, so we decided to reorient the UVIS nadir channel to point at the 'edge' of Mars, similar to the perspective you see in images of Earth taken from the ISS,\" adds co-author Ann Carine Vandaele of the Institut Royal d'A\u00e9ronomie Spatiale de Belgique, Belgium, and Principal Investigator of NOMAD. Between 24 April and 1 December 2019, Jean-Claude, Ann Carine, and colleagues used NOMAD-UVIS to scan altitudes ranging from 20 to 400 kilometers from the martian surface twice per orbit. When they analyzed these datasets, they found the green oxygen emission in all of them. \"The emission was strongest at an altitude of around 80 kilometers and varied depending on the changing distance between Mars and the Sun,\" adds Ann Carine. Studying the glow of planetary atmospheres can provide a wealth of information about the composition and dynamics of an atmosphere, and reveal how energy is deposited by both the Sun's light and the solar wind - the stream of charged particles emanating from our star. To better understand this green glow at Mars, and compare it to what we see around our own planet, Jean-Claude and colleagues dug further into how it was formed. \"We modeled this emission and found that it's mostly produced as carbon dioxide, or CO2, is broken up into its constituent parts: carbon monoxide and oxygen,\" says Jean-Claude. \"We saw the resulting oxygen atoms glowing in both visible and ultraviolet light.\" Simultaneously comparing these two kinds of emission showed that the visible emission was 16.5 times more intense than the ultraviolet. \"The observations at Mars agree with previous theoretical models but not with the actual glowing we've spotted around Earth, where the visible emission is far weaker,\" adds Jean-Claude. \"This suggests we have more to learn about how oxygen atoms behave, which is hugely important for our understanding of atomic and quantum physics.\" This understanding is key to characterizing planetary atmospheres and related phenomena - such as auroras.

Dune fields in the Green Crater of Mars: The image above, taken on April 27, 2020 and centered at 52.3\u00b0S, 351.8\u00b0E, shows part of an impact crater located inside the larger Green Crater in the Argyre quadrangle in the southern hemisphere of Mars. The image reveals an almost black dune field on the right surrounded by red soils, partially covered with bright white ice. Gullies, also partially covered with ice, are visible in the crater wall in the center of the image. Scientists are currently investigating the relationship between this seasonal ice and the presence of the gullies. The image was taken just after the spring equinox in the southern hemisphere of Mars, when the southernmost part of the crater was almost completely free of ice while the northern part was still partially covered. The southern crater wall has had a longer exposure to the Sun, so the ice in this area has receded faster. Leaf-like structures in Antoniadi impact crater: This image, captured on March 25, 2020, shows the bottom of the 400 km in diameter Antoniadi impact crater, which is located in the northern hemisphere of Mars in the Syrtis Major Planum region. The blue color of the image, centered at 21.0\u00b0N, 61.2\u00b0E, does not represent the real color of the crater floor but highlights the diversity of the rock composition inside this impact crater. In the center of the image are dendritic structures that look like the veins on oak leaves. These structures, evidence of ancient river networks in this region, protrude from the surface, unlike channels, which are usually sunken in the surface. This is because the channels were filled with harder material - possibly lava - and over time the softer rocks surrounding these branching channels have been eroded, leaving an inverted imprint of this ancient river system. Argyre impact basin after the spring equinox: This image of the Argyre impact basin in the southern highlands of Mars was taken on April 28, 2020, just as Mars had passed its southern hemisphere spring equinox. The seasonal ice in the 800km-long impact basin is visibly receding while the ridge on the right side of the image is still covered with frost. The image is centered at 57.5\u00b0S, 310.2\u00b0E. The frost-covered ridge is facing the pole, therefore receiving less solar radiation than the neighboring equator-facing slope. On Mars, incoming solar radiation transforms the ice into water vapour directly without melting it first into water in a process called sublimation. Since the north-facing slope has had a longer exposure to solar radiation, its ice has sublimated more quickly. Rock composition in Ius Chasma canyon: The image taken on May 5, 2020 shows a part of the floor of the Ius Chasma canyon, part of the Valles Marines system of canyons that stretches nearly a quarter of the circumference of Mars south of the planet's equator. The Ius Chasma canyon, which can be seen in the image rising up to a ridge on the right side, is about 1000 km long and up to 8 km deep, which makes it more than twice as long and four times as deep as the famous Grand Canyon in the US state of Arizona. The center of this image is located at 8.8\u00b0S, 282.5\u00b0E. The beautiful color variations across the floor of Ius Chasma are caused by changes in rock composition. Scientists theorize that the light rocks are salts left behind after an ancient lake evaporated. The information about the rock's composition is useful to scientists as it allows them to retrace the formation history of the canyon.

Besides, the TGO data cannot account for large plumes of methane, only smaller amounts - and so, currently, there is no direct disagreement between missions. \"In fact, we're actively working on coordinating measurements with other missions,\" clarifies Kevin. \"Rather than disputing any previous claims, this finding is a motivator for all teams to look closer - the more we know, the more deeply and accurately we can explore Mars' atmosphere.\" Realizing the potential of ExoMars: Methane aside, the findings highlight just how much we will learn about Mars as a result of the ExoMars program. \"These findings enable us to build a fuller understanding of our planetary neighbor,\" adds Alexander. \"Ozone and CO2 are important in Mars' atmosphere.

Successful collaboration in the hunt for life: As its name suggests, the TGO aims to characterize any trace gases in Mars' atmosphere that could arise from active geological or biological processes on the planet, and identify their origin. The ExoMars program consists of two missions: TGO, which was launched in 2016 and will be joined by the Rosalind Franklin rover and the Kazachok landing platform, due to lift off in 2022. These will take instruments complementary to ACS to the martian surface, examining the planet's atmosphere from a different perspective, and share the core objective of the ExoMars programme: to search for signs of past or present life on the Red Planet. \"These findings are the direct result of hugely successful and ongoing collaboration between European and Russian scientists as part of ExoMars,\" says ESA TGO Project Scientist H\u00e5kan Svedhem. \"They set new standards for future spectral observations, and will help us to paint a more complete picture of Mars' atmospheric properties - including where and when there may be methane to be found, which remains a key question in Mars exploration.\" \"Additionally, these findings will prompt a thorough analysis of all the relevant data we've collected to date - and the prospect of new discovery in this way is, as always, very exciting.

Dune fields in the Green Crater of Mars: The image above, taken on April 27, 2020 and centered at 52.3\u00b0S, 351.8\u00b0E, shows part of an impact crater located inside the larger Green Crater in the Argyre quadrangle in the southern hemisphere of Mars. The image reveals an almost black dune field on the right surrounded by red soils, partially covered with bright white ice. Gullies, also partially covered with ice, are visible in the crater wall in the center of the image. Scientists are currently investigating the relationship between this seasonal ice and the presence of the gullies. The image was taken just after the spring equinox in the southern hemisphere of Mars, when the southernmost part of the crater was almost completely free of ice while the northern part was still partially covered. The southern crater wall has had a longer exposure to the Sun, so the ice in this area has receded faster. Leaf-like structures in Antoniadi impact crater: This image, captured on March 25, 2020, shows the bottom of the 400 km in diameter Antoniadi impact crater, which is located in the northern hemisphere of Mars in the Syrtis Major Planum region. The blue color of the image, centered at 21.0\u00b0N, 61.2\u00b0E, does not represent the real color of the crater floor but highlights the diversity of the rock composition inside this impact crater. In the center of the image are dendritic structures that look like the veins on oak leaves. These structures, evidence of ancient river networks in this region, protrude from the surface, unlike channels, which are usually sunken in the surface. This is because the channels were filled with harder material - possibly lava - and over time the softer rocks surrounding these branching channels have been eroded, leaving an inverted imprint of this ancient river system. Argyre impact basin after the spring equinox: This image of the Argyre impact basin in the southern highlands of Mars was taken on April 28, 2020, just as Mars had passed its southern hemisphere spring equinox. The seasonal ice in the 800km-long impact basin is visibly receding while the ridge on the right side of the image is still covered with frost. The image is centered at 57.5\u00b0S, 310.2\u00b0E. The frost-covered ridge is facing the pole, therefore receiving less solar radiation than the neighboring equator-facing slope. On Mars, incoming solar radiation transforms the ice into water vapour directly without melting it first into water in a process called sublimation. Since the north-facing slope has had a longer exposure to solar radiation, its ice has sublimated more quickly. Rock composition in Ius Chasma canyon: The image taken on May 5, 2020 shows a part of the floor of the Ius Chasma canyon, part of the Valles Marines system of canyons that stretches nearly a quarter of the circumference of Mars south of the planet's equator. The Ius Chasma canyon, which can be seen in the image rising up to a ridge on the right side, is about 1000 km long and up to 8 km deep, which makes it more than twice as long and four times as deep as the famous Grand Canyon in the US state of Arizona. The center of this image is located at 8.8\u00b0S, 282.5\u00b0E. The beautiful color variations across the floor of Ius Chasma are caused by changes in rock composition. Scientists theorize that the light rocks are salts left behind after an ancient lake evaporated. The information about the rock's composition is useful to scientists as it allows them to retrace the formation history of the canyon.

These unlock new secrets about the martian atmosphere, and will enable a more accurate determination of whether there is methane, a gas associated with biological or geological activity, at the planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has been studying the Red Planet from orbit for over two years. The mission aims to understand the mixture of gases that make up the martian atmosphere, with a special focus on the mystery surrounding the presence of methane there. Meanwhile, the spacecraft has now spotted never-before-seen signatures of ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2), based on a full martian year of observations by its sensitive Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS). The findings are reported in two new papers published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, one led by Kevin Olsen of the University of Oxford, UK and another led by Alexander Trokhimovskiy of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia. \"These features are both puzzling and surprising,\" says Kevin. \"They lie over the exact wavelength range where we expected to see the strongest signs of methane. Before this discovery, the CO2 feature was completely unknown, and this is the first time ozone on Mars has been identified in this part of the infrared wavelength range.\" The martian atmosphere is dominated by CO2, which scientists observe to gauge temperatures, track seasons, explore air circulation, and more. Ozone - which forms a layer in the upper atmosphere on both Mars and Earth - helps to keep atmospheric chemistry stable. Both CO2 and ozone have been seen at Mars by spacecraft such as ESA's Mars Express, but the exquisite sensitivity of the ACS instrument on TGO was able to reveal new details about how these gases interact with light. Observing ozone in the range where TGO hunts for methane is a wholly unanticipated result. Scientists have mapped how martian ozone varies with altitude before. So far, however, this has largely taken place via methods that rely upon the gas' signatures in the ultraviolet, a technique which only allows measurement at high altitudes (over 20 km above the surface). The new ACS results show that it is possible to map martian ozone also in the infrared, so its behavior can be probed at lower altitudes to build a more detailed view of ozone's role in the planet's climate. Unraveling the methane mystery: One of the key objectives of TGO is to explore methane. To date, signs of martian methane - tentatively spied by missions including ESA's Mars Express from orbit and NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface - are variable and somewhat enigmatic. While also generated by geological processes, most of the methane on Earth is produced by life, from bacteria to livestock and human activity. Detecting methane on other planets is therefore hugely exciting. This is especially true given that the gas is known to break down in around 400 years, meaning that any methane present must have been produced or released in the relatively recent past. \"Discovering an unforeseen CO2 signature where we hunt for methane is significant,\" says Alexander Trokhimovskiy. \"This signature could not be accounted for before, and may therefore have played a role in detections of small amounts of methane at Mars.\" The observations analyzed by Alexander, Kevin, and colleagues were mostly performed at different times to those supporting detections of martian methane.

According to a study published in Science Advances, scientists detected hydrogen chloride, which is comprised of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom. The researchers said that gases based on chlorine or sulphur are possible indicators of volcanic activity, which Mars scientists were already looking to discover, but the new find has some strange qualities. 'First new trace gas in Mars' atmosphere': According to study, the fact that this particular discovery was made in distant locations at the same time, without any other gases that would be expected from martian volcanos, means that an unknown process between the surface of the planet and its atmosphere is taking place. The scientists said that salt is lifted into the atmosphere by winds. Sunlight, on the other hand, warms the atmosphere causing dust and water vapour to rise. These two components reach with each other in a bid to release chlorine eventually producing hydrogen chlorine. Scientists said that understanding the process in more detail is vital to understanding how the Martian climate evolved, especially as the cycle is so similar to that on Earth. Svedhem said that the changing seasons on Mars and particular the relatively hot summer in the southern hemisphere seem to be the driving force behind the new observations such as the enhanced atmospheric water loss and the dust activity linked to the detection of hydrogen chloride, that was seen in the two latest studies. He added that Trace Gas Orbiter observations are enabling the researchers to explore the Martian atmosphere like never before.

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, launched in 2016 as a joint mission between the European Space Agency and Roscosmos, detected the water in Valles Marineris on Mars. This canyon system is 10 times longer, five times deeper and 20 times wider than the Grand Canyon. The water is located beneath the surface of the canyon system and was detected by the orbiter's FREND instrument, or Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector. This instrument is able to map hydrogen in the top meter of Martian soil. Most water on Mars is located in the planet's polar regions and remains frozen as water ice. Valles Marineris is just south of the planet's equator, where temperatures typically aren't cold enough for water ice to remain. The observations were collected by the orbiter between May 2018 to February 2021. Previously, other orbiters have searched for water just beneath the Martian surface and detected small amounts under Martian dust. A study detailing the findings published Wednesday in the journal Icarus. \"With we can look down to one metre below this dusty layer and see what's really going on below Mars' surface - and, crucially, locate water-rich 'oases' that couldn't be detected with previous instruments,\" said study author Igor Mitrofanov, principal investigator of the FREND neutron telescope, in a statement. \"FREND revealed an area with an unusually large amount of hydrogen in the colossal Valles Marineris canyon system: assuming the hydrogen we see is bound into water molecules, as much as 40% of the near-surface material in this region appears to be water.\" To put that into perspective, this area is about the size of the Netherlands. It overlaps with Candor Chaos, a network of valleys within the canyon system. The FREND instrument searches for neutrons to map hydrogen content in the Martian soil. \"We can deduce how much water is in a soil by looking at the neutrons it emits,\" said study coauthor Alexey Malakhov, a senior scientist the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in a statement. That's because \"neutrons are produced when highly energetic particles known as 'galactic cosmic rays' strike Mars; drier soils emit more neutrons than wetter ones,\" he said in the same statement. \"We found a central part of Valles Marineris to be packed full of water - far more water than we expected. This is very much like Earth's permafrost regions, where water ice permanently persists under dry soil because of the constant low temperatures.\" The instrument's unique observational capabilities allowed the team to detect water that remained hidden before, Malakhov said. This could be water ice or water that is attached to minerals within the soil. But the scientists believe the presence of ice is more likely because the minerals at this location contain little water. There are higher temperatures near the equator on Mars, so the researchers believe there must be some special blend of conditions that allow the water to remain and be replenished. \"This finding is an amazing first step, but we need more observations to know for sure what form of water we're dealing with,\" said study coauthor H\u00e5kan Svedhem, a former project scientist for the orbiter, in a statement. \"The finding demonstrates the unrivalled abilities of TGO's instruments in enabling us to 'see' below Mars' surface - and reveals a large, not-too-deep, easily exploitable reservoir of water in this region of Mars.\" Future missions to Mars will land at lower latitudes. This discovery in Valles Marineris highlights the feature as an intriguing place for potential human exploration in the years ahead, especially because this water would be much more accessible than other previously discovered subsurface water sources. \"Knowing more about how and where water exists on present-day Mars is essential to understand what happened to Mars' once-abundant water, and helps our search for habitable environments, possible signs of past life, and organic materials from Mars' earliest days,\" said Colin Wilson, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter project scientist, in a statement. In 2022, the European Rosalind Franklin rover and Russian surface platform Kazachok will launch and is expected to land on Mars in 2023. The rover will drill beneath the surface of Mars in search of organic material that could reveal if Mars ever hosted life. The rover will explore Oxia Planum, a site of exposed, ancient clay-rich rocks that were once exposed to water.

An unusually high quantity of hydrogen has been detected in the heart of the 4,000 kilometers of canyons known as Valles Marineris, nicknamed the Grand Canyon of Mars.

The finding suggests that, at depths up to a meter below the surface, the soil in the region is rich in water, either bound up in minerals or as subsurface water ice, potentially offering a new way of locating the precious stuff on the apparently extremely arid world. \"With the Trace Gas Orbiter, we can look down to one meter below this dusty layer and see what's really going on below Mars's surface - and, crucially, locate water-rich 'oases' that couldn't be detected with previous instruments,\" said physicist Igor Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Russia; lead author of the new study. \"FREND revealed an area with an unusually large amount of hydrogen in the colossal Valles Marineris canyon system: Assuming the hydrogen we see is bound into water molecules, as much as 40 percent of the near-surface material in this region appears to be water.\" We know there's water on Mars. We can see it, at the cold poles, bound up as ice. That's where most of it seems to be; at the equator, conditions are too warm for water ice to form at the surface. It's possible that water can be found under the surface, but other previous searches by other Mars satellites only found it at higher latitudes. Cue FREND, or the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector. Rather than mapping light at the very surface of the red planet, FREND detects neutrons. This allows it to see the hydrogen content of Mars's soil up to a meter below the surface, the researchers said. Which, in observations taken between May 2018 and February 2021, it seems to have done. \"Neutrons are produced when highly energetic particles known as galactic cosmic rays strike Mars; drier soils emit more neutrons than wetter ones, and so we can deduce how much water is in a soil by looking at the neutrons it emits,\" said physicist Alexey Malakhov, also of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \"We found a central part of Valles Marineris to be packed full of water - far more water than we expected.

In this region of Mars, minerals typically contain very little water, so the researchers believe the substance is likely in the form of water ice below the surface. But how that water could persist there is a mystery. Pressure and temperature conditions at the Mars equator ought to prohibit the formation of such water reserves. There may be some unknown combination of geomorphological conditions in Valles Marineris that allows it, such as patchy isolated deposits that have been there for some time, or the angle and orientation of steep slopes. Further investigation will be needed to work out exactly what is going on - not just the conditions that allow for equatorial water on Mars, but to confirm what form that water takes. Doing so could be deeply rewarding: stores of water in a permafrost-like form may, just as we have found right here on Earth, have preserved frozen fragments of microbial life, or organic molecules that once existed on Mars. The discovery also represents exciting possibilities for Mars exploration. Any crewed Mars mission is likely to set down near the equator; water that might be found not far beneath the surface would be an amazing asset, both for exploration purposes, and for the vital task of keeping water-reliant humans alive. And, of course, it makes scientists even more keen to visit the unusual and fascinating Valles Marineris - the largest canyon in our Solar System. \"This result really demonstrates the success of the joint ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars programme,\" said physicist Colin Wilson of the European Space Agency. \"Knowing more about how and where water exists on present-day Mars is essential to understand what happened to Mars's once-abundant water, and helps our search for habitable environments, possible signs of past life, and organic materials from Mars's earliest days.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-water-has-been-found-in-the-soil-of-mars-grand-canyon"}, {"title": "Red Velvet Mars - ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Captures Delightful Image", "date": "2021-12-30", "content": "Like a sprinkle of powdered sugar on a rich red velvet cake, this scene from the ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captures the contrasting colors of bright white water-ice against the rusty red martian soil.

Just like on Earth, Mars' tilt gives rise to seasons, but unlike Earth, its tilt has changed dramatically over long periods of time. One of the notable features in the crater deposits is the presence of quasi- circular and polygonal patterns of fractures. These features are likely a result of seasonal changes in temperature that cause cycles of expansion and contraction of the ice-rich material, eventually leading to the development of fractures.

This is very much like Earth's permafrost regions, where water ice permanently persists under dry soil because of the constant low temperatures.\" The instrument's unique observational capabilities allowed the team to detect water that remained hidden before, Malakhov said. This could be water ice or water that is attached to minerals within the soil. But the scientists believe the presence of ice is more likely because the minerals at this location contain little water. There are higher temperatures near the equator on Mars, so the researchers believe there must be some special blend of conditions that allow the water to remain and be replenished. \"This finding is an amazing first step, but we need more observations to know for sure what form of water we're dealing with,\" said study coauthor H\u00e5kan Svedhem, a former project scientist for the orbiter, in a statement. \"The finding demonstrates the unrivalled abilities of TGO's instruments in enabling us to 'see' below Mars' surface - and reveals a large, not-too-deep, easily exploitable reservoir of water in this region of Mars.\" Future missions to Mars will land at lower latitudes. This discovery in Valles Marineris highlights the feature as an intriguing place for potential human exploration in the years ahead, especially because this water would be much more accessible than other previously discovered subsurface water sources. \"Knowing more about how and where water exists on present-day Mars is essential to understand what happened to Mars' once-abundant water, and helps our search for habitable environments, possible signs of past life, and organic materials from Mars' earliest days,\" said Colin Wilson, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter project scientist, in a statement. In 2022, the European Rosalind Franklin rover and Russian surface platform Kazachok will launch and is expected to land on Mars in 2023.

Cue FREND, or the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector. Rather than mapping light at the very surface of the red planet, FREND detects neutrons.

There may be some unknown combination of geomorphological conditions in Valles Marineris that allows it, such as patchy isolated deposits that have been there for some time, or the angle and orientation of steep slopes. Further investigation will be needed to work out exactly what is going on - not just the conditions that allow for equatorial water on Mars, but to confirm what form that water takes. Doing so could be deeply rewarding: stores of water in a permafrost-like form may, just as we have found right here on Earth, have preserved frozen fragments of microbial life, or organic molecules that once existed on Mars. The discovery also represents exciting possibilities for Mars exploration. Any crewed Mars mission is likely to set down near the equator; water that might be found not far beneath the surface would be an amazing asset, both for exploration purposes, and for the vital task of keeping water-reliant humans alive.

This canyon system is 10 times longer, five times deeper and 20 times wider than the Grand Canyon. The water is located beneath the surface of the canyon system and was detected by the orbiter's FREND instrument, or Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector.

Scientists assessed data recorded by the Trace Gas Orbiter's Fine- Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector instrument, which maps hydrogen in the uppermost metre of Mars' soil, a measure of water content, to make the discovery. The research, accepted for publication in the journal Icarus, revealed an area in the canyon, about the size of the Netherlands, with an unusually large amount of hydrogen. \"Assuming the hydrogen we see is bound into water molecules, as much as 40 per cent of the near-surface material in this region appears to be water,\" study lead author Igor Mitrofanov of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, said. \"With TGO we can look down to one metre below this dusty layer and see what's really going on below Mars' surface-and, crucially, locate water-rich 'oases' that couldn't be detected with previous instruments.\" While previous studies have found hints of water deeper underground in the Red Planet's mid-latitudes, as well as evidence of deep pools of liquid water under the Martian south pole, these potential deposits are few kilometres below ground and less accessible to future exploration than any found just below the surface.

But based on other studies, they say the minerals seen in this part of Mars usually contain only a few percentage of water-\"much less than is evidenced by these new observations\". \"Overall, we think this water more likely exists in the form of ice,\" Dr Malakhov said. However, researchers added that further studies of this part of the canyon were needed to confirm what form of water these deposits hold. While water ice usually evaporates in this region of Mars due to the temperature and pressure conditions near the equator, scientists say the right combination of temperature, pressure and hydration must be there to prevent water loss from the region. They say a \"special, as-yet-unclear mix of conditions\" is likely present in Valles Marineris to preserve the water. Alternatively, the researchers speculate the water is somehow being replenished by an as-yet-unknown process. \"This finding is an amazing first step, but we need more observations to know for sure what form of water we're dealing with,\" study co-author H\u00e5kan Svedhem of ESA's ESTEC in the Netherlands added. \"Regardless of the outcome, the finding demonstrates the unrivalled abilities of TGO's instruments in enabling us to 'see' below Mars' surface,\" Dr Svedhem added.

The European Space Agency, which recently shared this snapshot, described the scene as \"geology in motion.\" The image was taken by a camera on board the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter in August 2020. The result is a dramatic Ansel Adams-like landscape. The picture captures a sliver of the Noctis Labyrinthus, \"labyrinth of the night,\" near the intersection with Lus Chasma of Valles Marineris - the \"grand canyon\" of Mars. Valles Marineris is over 2,500 miles long, wider than the United States, with depths of up to 4 miles. By comparison, Earth's Grand Canyon reaches a maximum of one mile deep. Scientists believe the region was formed by a tectonic crack in Mars' crust billions of years ago as the planet cooled. CaSSIS, the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System, was the camera used on the orbiter. It takes pictures of Martian surfaces that could be related to gas sources, such as volcanoes. The photo also features wind-whipped ripples to the right of the cliff that cuts through the center of the scene. A few small craters also pockmark the terrain. The spacecraft, a collaboration of ESA and the Russian Roscosmos space agency, began its mission in 2016. It has returned myriad images, cataloging the planet's atmospheric gases and mapping Mars' potential water-rich sites. Its purpose is to find evidence of methane and other signs of biological or geological activity on the red planet. On Earth, organisms release methane during digestion, although there are other geological processes that create methane, such as the oxidation of minerals. ExoMars is also watching how seasons affect the Martian atmosphere and hunting for water vapor and ice. Its findings will help scientists pick locations for future land exploration.", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/mars-esa-boulders-image"}, {"title": "Crater Tree Rings: Incredible Birds-Eye View Into an Ice-Rich Impact Crater on Mars", "date": "2022-01-29", "content": "This feature could easily be mistaken for a tree stump with characteristic concentric rings. It's actually an impressive bird's-eye view into an ice-rich impact crater on Mars. Tree rings provide snapshots of Earth's past climate and, although formed in a very different way, the patterns inside this crater reveal details of the Red Planet's history, too. The image was taken by the CaSSIS camera onboard the ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter on June 13, 2021, in the vast northern plains of Acidalia Planitia, centered at 51.9\u00b0N/326.7\u00b0E. The interior of the crater is filled with deposits that are probably water-ice rich. It is thought that these deposits were laid down during an earlier time in Mars' history when the inclination of the planet's spin axis allowed water- ice deposits to form at lower latitudes than it does today. Just like on Earth, Mars' tilt gives rise to seasons, but unlike Earth, its tilt has changed dramatically over long periods of time. One of the notable features in the crater deposits is the presence of quasi- circular and polygonal patterns of fractures. These features are likely a result of seasonal changes in temperature that cause cycles of expansion and contraction of the ice-rich material, eventually leading to the development of fractures. Understanding the history of water on Mars and if this once allowed life to flourish is at the heart of ESA's ExoMars missions. TGO arrived at Mars in 2016 and began its full science mission in 2018. The spacecraft is not only returning spectacular images, but also providing the best-ever inventory of the planet's atmospheric gases with a particular emphasis on geologically and biologically important gases, and mapping the planet's surface for water-rich locations. It will also provide data relay services for the second ExoMars mission comprising the Rosalind Franklin rover and Kazachok platform, when it arrives on Mars in 2023. The rover will explore a region of Mars thought once to have hosted an ancient ocean and will search underground for signs of life.
