[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Japanese Panel To OK Hayabusa-2 Development", "date": "2010-08-09", "content": "Japan's Space Activities Commission (SAC) is poised to formally recommend in mid-August development of a follow-on to the Hayabusa asteroid sample-return mission that reached Earth in June. A key SAC evaluation committee approved the technical plan and mission goals for Hayabusa-2 in a report published Aug. 5. The 33-page report recommends launching the follow-on craft before the end of March 2015 to visit, land on, deploy a miniature rover and collect and return a sample of a C-class asteroid, which is believed to contain materials that can give clues to the formation of the solar system. The report's findings mean that SAC, which has oversight of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), will formally recommend development of the new probe when it meets Aug. 11 to review JAXA's space programs, according to Hiroko Takuma, deputy director of the space and aeronautics policy division at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The budget for Hayabusa-2 is projected to be about 16.4 billion yen ($190 million), excluding the cost of the H-2A rocket that will launch the probe, Takuma said in an Aug. 5 interview. Japan's annual space budget request is due to be submitted to the Finance Ministry at the end of August and ratified by Japan's Diet the following March. Japan's new fiscal year begins April 1. The first Hayabusa, launched in May 2003 on a longer-than-expected round-trip journey, visited and collected dust particles from the near-Earth object 25143. In a separate report also released Aug. 5, the same SAC technical subcommittee recommended development of the next-generation Epsilon solid-rocket that will be the successor to the M-V. The 24-meter-tall Epsilon, which is being designed by JAXA, is based on the SRB-A solid-augmentation booster used on the H-2A, and will be capable of lifting 1,200 kilograms into low Earth orbit at a target cost of 3.8 billion yen per launch, about half the cost of the M-V, according to the subcommittee report. Following the draft report, SAC will also approve development of the Epsilon rocket Aug. 11, Takuma said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/japanese-panel-ok-hayabusa-2-development/"}, {"title": "Asteroid probe, rocket get nod from Japanese panel", "date": "2010-08-11", "content": "The board governing Japan's space program last week formally approved a successor to the Hayabusa asteroid explorer and the Epsilon small satellite launch vehicle to continue development. The Space Activities Commission decision gives the Japanese government authority to request funding for the programs in its budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in April. The government space panel, which has oversight of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, only gave the go-ahead for preliminary design work on Hayabusa 2, a mission projected to cost nearly $200 million. The commission recommended proceeding with full development of the Epsilon rocket, a new Japanese launcher to send small satellites into orbit beginning in 2013. The Hayabusa 2 mission would blast off as soon as 2014 and reach a carbon-rich asteroid in 2018 for a touch-and-go approach to collect samples. After spending a few months in the vicinity of the asteroid, the probe would return to Earth in 2020. The spacecraft's mission would replicate the feat accomplished by Hayabusa, the mission that completed the first round-trip journey to an asteroid in June. During its seven-year journey to and from asteroid Itokawa, Hayabusa suffered major glitches in its sample collection device, propulsion system and reaction wheels. But the probe released an entry capsule that landed in Australia, possibly with the first microscopic dust grains from the surface of an asteroid. Hayabusa 2 would incorporate improvements to the faulty systems that plagued its predecessor, but the craft would rely on the same fundamental design to slash costs. Junichiro Kawaguchi, Hayabusa's project manager, said a \"good indication was shown by the government\" in negotiations and hearings over the past few weeks. \"Precisely speaking, still we need some more time to make it actually appropriated. But most opinions say the mission shall be performed,\" Kawaguchi wrote in an e-mail to Spaceflight Now. Kawaguchi is managing the Hayabusa 2 proposal team, but he will relinquish leadership once the mission enters full development. Hayabusa 2 would target an asteroid named 1999 JU3, a C-type body with a diameter of about 1 kilometer, or 0.6 miles. Scientists say C-type asteroids are the unspoiled relics of the early solar system, which was dominated by small bodies as the planets coalesced. Itokawa, the destination for Hayabusa, is a stony rubble pile asteroid that formed from separate objects fusing together over time. Japan is moving forward with Hayabusa 2 after the Marco Polo mission, a joint asteroid probe with Europe, was not selected by an international panel of scientific advisors earlier this year. The budget decisions for JAXA are being considered as an economic stimulus, according to Kawaguchi. Yasuhiro Morita, the Epsilon rocket's project manager, said the new launch vehicle will be ready for service beginning in 2013. It will replace the M-5 rocket, a similar vehicle that flew seven times between 1997 and 2006. \"We've already spent three years on the preliminary design,\" Morita said. \"This is the actual start of the development. This is a good time for us.\" Now finished with preliminary development, engineers are focusing on a critical design review planned about 18 months from now. The Epsilon rocket will launch about once per year with small technology demonstration and scientific missions, starting with a craft named Sprint-A that will place a telescope into a 300-mile-high Earth orbit to observe Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The three-stage launcher is designed to lift more than 2,600 pounds to low Earth orbit. The M-5 rocket could haul about 4,000 pounds to a similar trajectory. Morita, who is also the former manager of the M-5 rocket program, said it will cost approximately $200 million to finish developing the Epsilon rocket, but it's much less expensive than the M-5, which carried a $70 million price for each launch. He would not discuss the Epsilon's cost per flight. \"For example, the M-5 first stage rocket motor was very expensive because it uses a big chamber and is in two segments. We had to assemble the two segments at the launch site,\" Morita said. Engineers will also design the Epsilon with more autonomy, making the rocket less labor-intensive and reducing the workforce required for launches. \"The launching performance of the M-5 was the best in the world for a solid rocket at the time, but operations took a lot of time and labor,\" Morita said in an interview with Spaceflight Now. \"As far as the Epsilon rocket, the sales point is its responsiveness. This is far beyond the M-5's capacity, so we can extend the solid rocket technology in Japan, not only in the launching capacity but also in operations.\" JAXA's goal is to have an inexpensive rocket ready to answer the needs of scientists and engineers building low-cost satellites. Epsilon designers are reusing technology from the M-5 and H-2A rockets to cut costs. The Epsilon's first stage is based on the H-2A's solid rocket booster, while the second and third stages will use heritage solid-fueled motors from the M-5's upper stages. According to Morita, JAXA has still not decided where to launch the new rocket. It could be operated from the Uchinoura Space Center on the south shore of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. The M-5 rocket's launch pad at Uchinoura could be modified to support Epsilon launches, Morita said. Another option is Japan's main launching base at the Tanegashima Space Center, the home of the much larger H-2A and H-2B rockets. One of two active launch pads there could be outfitted for the Epsilon rocket, or a vacant Tanegashima launch pad used by the N-1 and N-2 rockets more than 20 years ago could also host Epsilon missions, according to Morita. \"One of the most remarkable features of the Epsilon rocket is its mobility, so the vehicle can be launched by Uchinoura as well as by Tanegashima, and the government has not yet decided its launch site,\" Morita said. Morita said high construction costs might limit the Epsilon to just one launch site. IHI Aerospace Co. is the Epsilon rocket's prime contractor. The company builds the H-2A solid rocket boosters and previously held the lead contract for the M-5 rocket. \"The small rocket will be required for small satellite missions,\" Morita said. \"The H-2A is too big to support small satellites. We need a small launcher with the responsiveness to support small satellites.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1008/11japan/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NEC Tapped To Build Second Asteroid-bound Hayabusa Probe", "date": "2012-01-25", "content": "NEC Corp. of Tokyo said Jan. 25 that it has been selected to start work on designing and building hardware for Japan's Hayabusa-2 asteroid sample-return mission, which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) hopes to launch in 2014. Chris Shimizu, an NEC spokesman, said that the selection will allow NEC to start building the probe, which will be similar in design to the original Hayabusa spacecraft that traveled 6 billion kilometers over seven years to collect about 60 particles of the asteroid 25143 Itokawa and return them to Earth in June 2010. Shimizu declined to give the value of NEC's contract for the satellite, development of which is expected to exceed 16 billion yen ($204 million). According to information released by NEC, Hayabusa-2 will weigh 600 kilograms fully fueled and will be built on a slightly bigger satellite platform, or frame, than the original Hayabusa. \"It'll be a rectangular frame, but slightly deeper than Hayabusa,\" Shimizu said. NEC also built the first Hayabusa, an ion engine-powered craft that took an additional three years to complete its mission due to several crippling problems that cropped up following the 510-kilogram craft's 2003 launch atop a Japanese solid-fuel M-5 rocket. According to JAXA, the Hayabusa-2 mission is being designed to visit 1999 JU3, an approximately 920-meter-diameter object in a similar orbit to Itokawa, but thought to be a so-called C- type, or carbonaceous, asteroid. Such asteroids are plentiful, rocky and thought to contain organic materials and perhaps water. Itokawa is an S-type asteroid, which are stony and the second most common after C-type. Hayabusa-2 will carry a more powerful sample collection system than the original Hayabusa, and will attempt to dig a crater in the asteroid to bring a bigger cache of samples back to Earth. NEC plans to make one major improvement on Hayabusa-2 over the first model: it will be equipped with a Ka-band communications subsystem that will be faster than the original Hayabusa's X-band system. The new craft also will have more sophisticated camera and be able to better capture the shape and the geography of the asteroid, according to NEC. JAXA spokesman Eijiro Namura said Jan. 25 that Hayabusa-2 is targeted for launch in 2014 aboard Japan's mainstay H-2A rocket, a bigger rocket than the M-5 that launched the first Hayabusa. \"We haven't released details of the launch and how much spare capacity we will have on the H-2A,\" Namura said. JAXA expects Hayabusa-2 development to cost 16.2 billion yen, a figure that does not include launch costs. Namura said the project will receive a 3 billion yen budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1. If launched in 2014, Hayabusa-2 would reach its target in 2018, survey the asteroid for a year and a half, depart in December 2019, and return in December 2020, according to JAXA. The day before NEC announced that it has been tapped to build Hayabusa-2, JAXA issued a call for research proposals from scientists interested in receiving a portion of the first Hayabusa's sample haul for study. The Jan. 24 announcement of opportunity, according to a posting on JAXA's website, is open to scientists around the world. Proposals are due March 7 and selections are expected to be made in mid-May. JAXA said samples would be distributed to selected researchers \"soon after.\"", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nec-tapped-build-second-asteroid-bound-hayabusa-probe/"}, {"title": "Japan's next asteroid probe approved for development", "date": "2012-01-29", "content": "Japanese government officials last week gave the green light to Hayabusa 2, a robotic explorer due for launch in 2014 on a journey to retrieve and return rocks from a near-Earth asteroid.

The decision came after a 2010 ruling that directed the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to continue preliminary design of the probe. Launch of Hayabusa 2 must occur in 2014 to reach asteroid 1999 JU3, the mission's 3,000-foot-diameter target. Asteroid 1999 JU3, which is still awaiting a name, is a C-type body, the most common form of asteroid in the solar system. Observations by telescopes on Earth indicate the asteroid is roughly spherical and has dark features. The probe would reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and depart in December 2019. Landing on Earth is expected at the end of 2020, according to JAXA. Japan is working on a tight schedule and budget to develop the spacecraft in time for the narrow launch window, which is timed for when the asteroid is in the right position relative to Earth. JAXA officials say a back-up launch opportunity exists in 2015, but the mission would have to wait a decade longer to get off the ground if the probe misses the secondary window. The project will receive $39 million in the Japanese fiscal year beginning April 1, according to documents released by the Space Activities Commission. JAXA previously reported the Hayabusa 2 mission's total cost will be more than $200 million. NEC Corp. of Tokyo announced Jan. 25 it was beginning system design of the 1,300-pound spacecraft, its Ka-band communications system and an intermediate infrared camera. NEC was the builder of the Hayabusa probe, which blasted off in 2003 and returned to Earth with microscopic asteroid samples in 2010. Hayabusa's sample-collection device malfunctioned, and the craft was crippled by a fuel leak and failures of reaction wheels. But the probe limped back to Earth with an ion propulsion system, jettisoning a canister that parachuted to a soft landing in Australia. Inside the capsule, researchers found tiny particles of material from asteroid Itokawa, a potato-shaped rock about the size of a city block. The initial research shows the samples inspected contain no organic molecules. Scientists also say the analysis confirms the rocks at Itokawa were formed 4.6 billion years ago at the dawn of the solar system. Hayabusa 2 will attempt to correct the flaws that hampered Hayabusa's voyage, according to JAXA. The next mission will feature more durable ion engines, upgraded guidance and navigation technology to ensure a smooth landing on asteroid 1999 JU3, and new antennas and attitude control systems. Hayabusa 2's sample collection method is also being revamped after problems during Hayabusa's approach to Itokawa in late 2005. Instead of firing a high-speed kinetic projectile at close range into the asteroid, as Hayabusa was supposed to do, Hayabusa 2 will drop an impactor about 1,000 feet from the surface. After descending slowly, the impactor will detonate once it reaches the asteroid, scattering bits of rock and exposing subsurface material. Once the dust settles, Hayabusa 2 will approach the impact site and collect rocks with a horn leading into a sample holding chamber. If all goes according to plan, the mission should return a more sizable cache of samples than Hayabusa.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1201/29hayabusa2/"}, {"title": "Hayabusa 2 Mission Approved by Japanese Government", "date": "2012-01-31", "content": "In 2010, the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa completed an exciting although nail-biting mission to the asteroid Itokawa, successfully returning samples to Earth after first reaching the asteroid in 2005; the mission almost failed, with the spacecraft plagued by technical problems. The canister containing the microscopic rock samples made a soft landing in Australia, the first time that samples from an asteroid had been brought back to Earth for study. Now, the Japanese government has approved a follow-up mission, Hayabusa 2. This time the probe is scheduled to be launched in 2014 and rendezvous with the asteroid known as 1999 JU3 in mid-2018. Samples would again be taken and returned to Earth in late 2020. 1999 JU3 is approximately 914 metres (3,000 feet) in diameter, a little larger than Itokawa, and is roughly spherical in shape, whereas Itokawa was much more oblong. As is common for any space agency, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is working with tight budgets and deadlines to make this next mission happen. There is a possibility of a back-up launch window in 2015, but if that deadline is also not met, the mission will have to wait another decade to launch. One of the main problems with Hayabusa was the failure of the sampling mechanism during the \"landing\" (actually more of a brief contact with the surface with the sample capturing device) to retrieve the samples for delivery back to Earth. Only a small amount of material made it into the sample capsule, but which was fortunate and ultimately made the mission a limited success. The microscopic grains were confirmed to have primarily come from Itokawa itself and are still being studied today. To avoid a repetition of the glitches experienced by Hayabusa, some fundamental changes needed to be made. This next spacecraft will use an updated ion propulsion engine, the same propulsion system used by Hayabusa, as well as improved guidance and navigation systems, new antennas and a new altitude control system. For Hayabusa 2's sample-collecting activities, a slowly descending impactor will be used, detonating upon contact with the surface, instead of the high-speed projectile used by Hayabusa. Perhaps not quite as dramatic, but hopefully more likely to succeed. Like its predecessor, the main objective of the mission is to collect as much surface material as possible for delivery back home. Hopefully Hayabusa 2 will not be hampered by the same problems as Hayabusa; if JAXA can achieve this, it will be exciting to have samples returned from a second asteroid as well, which can only help to further our understanding of the history and formation of the solar system, and by extrapolation, even other solar systems as well.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/93163/hayabusa-2-mission-approved-by-japanese-government/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NEC Tapped To Build Second Asteroid-bound Hayabusa Probe", "date": "2012-01-25", "content": "NEC Corp. of Tokyo said Jan. 25 that it has been selected to start work on designing and building hardware for Japan's Hayabusa-2 asteroid sample-return mission, which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) hopes to launch in 2014.

Once there it will drop an impact device from around 1,000ft, which will detonate when it hits the surface. The probe will land in the impact zone and excavate samples from the core material of the asteroid and return in 2020. In 2003 JAXA launched the first Hayabusa probe, which did succeed in bringing back a sample from an asteroid for the first time, albeit in microscopic quantities. The probe suffered a series of malfunctions in its propulsion and sample collection systems, but landed in the South Australian outback in 2010 with a tiny amount of dust on board. Nevertheless several papers have been published on the samples and Campins said JAXA deserved credit for being the first to succeed. In terms of funding JAXA is tiny, but it has produced impressive results, he said. With the new mission it is hoped scientists can get a detailed look at the composition of the asteroid, and find organic chemicals that could have formed some of the essential building blocks of life on Earth. Such chemicals could have stimulated the beginning with organic life on the planet, rather than having them form terrestrially, he said. Campins explained that in the early stages of the Earth's development, before the surface had cooled to a crust, the temperatures involved would have destroyed any organic life. The Miller and Urey experiment has shown that it would be possible for organic compounds to form by mixing inorganic chemicals and applying electricity to stimulate lightning, but he suggested there may be a simpler solution. \"We know that organic compounds are found in these objects, and asteroids and meteors would have been much more common in the early stages of planetry formation - we've only got the dregs of them now,\" he said. \"Organic compounds can form naturally on Earth, but it's a slow process, and what's the need when there's this great inventory that can be delivered from space? Maybe both functions had a role.\" The Japanese are not the only ones with asteroid collection in mind. The European Space Agency is mulling the Marco Polo-R probe and in 2016 NASA will launch the Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) on a course with asteroid 1999 RQ36. On arrival in 2019 it will spend a few months mapping the surface to find a survey spot, then bring back a couple of ounces of material for study - if all goes according to plan. While the search for extraterrestrial organic compounds is all very interesting, these trips also have other purposes. While none of the asteroids being visited are in any danger of impacting Earth, the ability to successfully send a mission to an threatening asteroid - if it were discovered in time - could be crucial, as too would be information on the composition of such objects. One of the key goals of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to study the Yarkovsky effect, the ability of the sun's energy to affect the trajectory of rotating material in space. Such information will be key to assessing the viability of some asteroid deflection plans being formulated by NASA.

Chris Shimizu, an NEC spokesman, said that the selection will allow NEC to start building the probe, which will be similar in design to the original Hayabusa spacecraft that traveled 6 billion kilometers over seven years to collect about 60 particles of the asteroid 25143 Itokawa and return them to Earth in June 2010. Shimizu declined to give the value of NEC's contract for the satellite, development of which is expected to exceed 16 billion yen ($204 million). According to information released by NEC, Hayabusa-2 will weigh 600 kilograms fully fueled and will be built on a slightly bigger satellite platform, or frame, than the original Hayabusa. \"It'll be a rectangular frame, but slightly deeper than Hayabusa,\" Shimizu said. NEC also built the first Hayabusa, an ion engine-powered craft that took an additional three years to complete its mission due to several crippling problems that cropped up following the 510-kilogram craft's 2003 launch atop a Japanese solid-fuel M-5 rocket. According to JAXA, the Hayabusa-2 mission is being designed to visit 1999 JU3, an approximately 920-meter-diameter object in a similar orbit to Itokawa, but thought to be a so-called C- type, or carbonaceous, asteroid. Such asteroids are plentiful, rocky and thought to contain organic materials and perhaps water. Itokawa is an S-type asteroid, which are stony and the second most common after C-type. Hayabusa-2 will carry a more powerful sample collection system than the original Hayabusa, and will attempt to dig a crater in the asteroid to bring a bigger cache of samples back to Earth. NEC plans to make one major improvement on Hayabusa-2 over the first model: it will be equipped with a Ka-band communications subsystem that will be faster than the original Hayabusa's X-band system. The new craft also will have more sophisticated camera and be able to better capture the shape and the geography of the asteroid, according to NEC. JAXA spokesman Eijiro Namura said Jan. 25 that Hayabusa-2 is targeted for launch in 2014 aboard Japan's mainstay H-2A rocket, a bigger rocket than the M-5 that launched the first Hayabusa. \"We haven't released details of the launch and how much spare capacity we will have on the H-2A,\" Namura said. JAXA expects Hayabusa-2 development to cost 16.2 billion yen, a figure that does not include launch costs. Namura said the project will receive a 3 billion yen budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1. If launched in 2014, Hayabusa-2 would reach its target in 2018, survey the asteroid for a year and a half, depart in December 2019, and return in December 2020, according to JAXA. The day before NEC announced that it has been tapped to build Hayabusa-2, JAXA issued a call for research proposals from scientists interested in receiving a portion of the first Hayabusa's sample haul for study. The Jan. 24 announcement of opportunity, according to a posting on JAXA's website, is open to scientists around the world. Proposals are due March 7 and selections are expected to be made in mid-May. JAXA said samples would be distributed to selected researchers \"soon after.\"", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nec-tapped-build-second-asteroid-bound-hayabusa-probe/"}, {"title": "Japan's next asteroid probe approved for development", "date": "2012-01-29", "content": "Japanese government officials last week gave the green light to Hayabusa 2, a robotic explorer due for launch in 2014 on a journey to retrieve and return rocks from a near-Earth asteroid. The Space Activities Commission, a board governing funding for the Japanese space program, formally approved the Hayabusa 2 mission last week. The decision came after a 2010 ruling that directed the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to continue preliminary design of the probe. Launch of Hayabusa 2 must occur in 2014 to reach asteroid 1999 JU3, the mission's 3,000-foot-diameter target. Asteroid 1999 JU3, which is still awaiting a name, is a C-type body, the most common form of asteroid in the solar system. Observations by telescopes on Earth indicate the asteroid is roughly spherical and has dark features. The probe would reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and depart in December 2019. Landing on Earth is expected at the end of 2020, according to JAXA. Japan is working on a tight schedule and budget to develop the spacecraft in time for the narrow launch window, which is timed for when the asteroid is in the right position relative to Earth. JAXA officials say a back-up launch opportunity exists in 2015, but the mission would have to wait a decade longer to get off the ground if the probe misses the secondary window. The project will receive $39 million in the Japanese fiscal year beginning April 1, according to documents released by the Space Activities Commission. JAXA previously reported the Hayabusa 2 mission's total cost will be more than $200 million. NEC Corp. of Tokyo announced Jan. 25 it was beginning system design of the 1,300-pound spacecraft, its Ka-band communications system and an intermediate infrared camera. NEC was the builder of the Hayabusa probe, which blasted off in 2003 and returned to Earth with microscopic asteroid samples in 2010. Hayabusa's sample-collection device malfunctioned, and the craft was crippled by a fuel leak and failures of reaction wheels. But the probe limped back to Earth with an ion propulsion system, jettisoning a canister that parachuted to a soft landing in Australia. Inside the capsule, researchers found tiny particles of material from asteroid Itokawa, a potato-shaped rock about the size of a city block. The initial research shows the samples inspected contain no organic molecules. Scientists also say the analysis confirms the rocks at Itokawa were formed 4.6 billion years ago at the dawn of the solar system. Hayabusa 2 will attempt to correct the flaws that hampered Hayabusa's voyage, according to JAXA. The next mission will feature more durable ion engines, upgraded guidance and navigation technology to ensure a smooth landing on asteroid 1999 JU3, and new antennas and attitude control systems. Hayabusa 2's sample collection method is also being revamped after problems during Hayabusa's approach to Itokawa in late 2005. Instead of firing a high-speed kinetic projectile at close range into the asteroid, as Hayabusa was supposed to do, Hayabusa 2 will drop an impactor about 1,000 feet from the surface. After descending slowly, the impactor will detonate once it reaches the asteroid, scattering bits of rock and exposing subsurface material. Once the dust settles, Hayabusa 2 will approach the impact site and collect rocks with a horn leading into a sample holding chamber. If all goes according to plan, the mission should return a more sizable cache of samples than Hayabusa.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1201/29hayabusa2/"}, {"title": "Hayabusa 2 Mission Approved by Japanese Government", "date": "2012-01-31", "content": "In 2010, the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa completed an exciting although nail-biting mission to the asteroid Itokawa, successfully returning samples to Earth after first reaching the asteroid in 2005; the mission almost failed, with the spacecraft plagued by technical problems. The canister containing the microscopic rock samples made a soft landing in Australia, the first time that samples from an asteroid had been brought back to Earth for study. Now, the Japanese government has approved a follow-up mission, Hayabusa 2. This time the probe is scheduled to be launched in 2014 and rendezvous with the asteroid known as 1999 JU3 in mid-2018. Samples would again be taken and returned to Earth in late 2020. 1999 JU3 is approximately 914 metres (3,000 feet) in diameter, a little larger than Itokawa, and is roughly spherical in shape, whereas Itokawa was much more oblong. As is common for any space agency, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is working with tight budgets and deadlines to make this next mission happen. There is a possibility of a back-up launch window in 2015, but if that deadline is also not met, the mission will have to wait another decade to launch. One of the main problems with Hayabusa was the failure of the sampling mechanism during the \"landing\" (actually more of a brief contact with the surface with the sample capturing device) to retrieve the samples for delivery back to Earth. Only a small amount of material made it into the sample capsule, but which was fortunate and ultimately made the mission a limited success. The microscopic grains were confirmed to have primarily come from Itokawa itself and are still being studied today. To avoid a repetition of the glitches experienced by Hayabusa, some fundamental changes needed to be made. This next spacecraft will use an updated ion propulsion engine, the same propulsion system used by Hayabusa, as well as improved guidance and navigation systems, new antennas and a new altitude control system. For Hayabusa 2's sample-collecting activities, a slowly descending impactor will be used, detonating upon contact with the surface, instead of the high-speed projectile used by Hayabusa. Perhaps not quite as dramatic, but hopefully more likely to succeed. Like its predecessor, the main objective of the mission is to collect as much surface material as possible for delivery back home. Hopefully Hayabusa 2 will not be hampered by the same problems as Hayabusa; if JAXA can achieve this, it will be exciting to have samples returned from a second asteroid as well, which can only help to further our understanding of the history and formation of the solar system, and by extrapolation, even other solar systems as well.", "url": "https://www.universetoday.com/93163/hayabusa-2-mission-approved-by-japanese-government/"}, {"title": "Japan takes second shot at extraterrestrial sampling with Hayabusa 2", "date": "2012-02-01", "content": "The Japanese space agency (JAXA) has confirmed a new mission to collect samples from an asteroid and return them safely to earth, and has set the target as 1999 JU3 - one of the damper asteroids in range. \"We're expecting the asteroid to be rich in hydrated minerals and, we believe, in organic compounds - long carbon chains with hydrogen that may be the building blocks for life for life on Earth,\" University of Central Florida professor Humberto Campins, author of a 2009 paper on the asteroid, told The Register. \"The last rock JAXA visited was very dry, but this asteroid is primitive, as in it has received very little heating, and it may contain organic materials or even water.\" The Hayabusa 2 mission will blast off in 2014 (although contingency plans are in place to delay the launch until 2015 if needed,) and should reach the 3,000ft asteroid 1999JU3 by mid-2018. Once there it will drop an impact device from around 1,000ft, which will detonate when it hits the surface. The probe will land in the impact zone and excavate samples from the core material of the asteroid and return in 2020. In 2003 JAXA launched the first Hayabusa probe, which did succeed in bringing back a sample from an asteroid for the first time, albeit in microscopic quantities. The probe suffered a series of malfunctions in its propulsion and sample collection systems, but landed in the South Australian outback in 2010 with a tiny amount of dust on board. Nevertheless several papers have been published on the samples and Campins said JAXA deserved credit for being the first to succeed. In terms of funding JAXA is tiny, but it has produced impressive results, he said. With the new mission it is hoped scientists can get a detailed look at the composition of the asteroid, and find organic chemicals that could have formed some of the essential building blocks of life on Earth. Such chemicals could have stimulated the beginning with organic life on the planet, rather than having them form terrestrially, he said. Campins explained that in the early stages of the Earth's development, before the surface had cooled to a crust, the temperatures involved would have destroyed any organic life. The Miller and Urey experiment has shown that it would be possible for organic compounds to form by mixing inorganic chemicals and applying electricity to stimulate lightning, but he suggested there may be a simpler solution. \"We know that organic compounds are found in these objects, and asteroids and meteors would have been much more common in the early stages of planetry formation - we've only got the dregs of them now,\" he said. \"Organic compounds can form naturally on Earth, but it's a slow process, and what's the need when there's this great inventory that can be delivered from space? Maybe both functions had a role.\" The Japanese are not the only ones with asteroid collection in mind. The European Space Agency is mulling the Marco Polo-R probe and in 2016 NASA will launch the Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) on a course with asteroid 1999 RQ36. On arrival in 2019 it will spend a few months mapping the surface to find a survey spot, then bring back a couple of ounces of material for study - if all goes according to plan. While the search for extraterrestrial organic compounds is all very interesting, these trips also have other purposes. While none of the asteroids being visited are in any danger of impacting Earth, the ability to successfully send a mission to an threatening asteroid - if it were discovered in time - could be crucial, as too would be information on the composition of such objects. One of the key goals of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to study the Yarkovsky effect, the ability of the sun's energy to affect the trajectory of rotating material in space. Such information will be key to assessing the viability of some asteroid deflection plans being formulated by NASA. Deflecting such an object from Earth's path, by focusing solar energy effects on the object for example, would be preferable to destroying it - if such a thing were even possible.

The total cost of the mission is pegged at about $400 million - $150 million more than the original Hayabusa. The budget boost is not surprising since Hayabusa 2 is going to be launched on Japan's H2A rocket, which is larger than the M-V rocket used for Hayabusa. The new probe would also have a bigger payload and a longer operational stint, spending roughly one year at 1999 JU3 compared to Hayabusa's three months of inspecting Itokawa. The first Hayabusa: \"It's a much more scientifically aggressive mission than the first Hayabusa. They are applying all the lessons learned from that mission to Hayabusa 2,\" said Paul Abell, lead scientist for planetary small bodies in the Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science Directorate at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He was a joint science team member on the Hayabusa mission. The original Hayabusa was launched in May 2003 and reached Itokawa in mid-September 2005. Despite a sampling glitch, the craft managed to return to Earth a precious cargo of ultra-tiny grains of asteroid material. [Photos from the Hayabusa Mission] Those prized extraterrestrial specimens were parachuted into the Australian outback in June 2010. Some of the bits and pieces are being distributed to researchers around the world. Hayabusa overcame a series of glitches to make a victorious back-and-forth sojourn, and it has thus been heralded as a robotic version of NASA's famous Apollo 13 mission.

There's more redundancy, for one, as well as improved software for autonomous navigation, guidance and control. Hayabusa 2 will involve international collaborations with Germany, the United States, Australia, and other countries. One new technical feature is that Hayabusa 2 will tote two landers to the asteroid instead of one. One will be a version of the detachable MIcro/Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid (MINERVA). This tiny lander was on the first Hayabusa as well, but it missed its mark, drifting off into space after being deployed too high above Itokawa. This time, joining the MINERVA-like lander is MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout), a small separate landing package developed by the German Aerospace Center. \"MASCOT will take some measurements, then move to a different location and take more readings,\" Abell said. Impact! Unique to Hayabusa 2 is its impactor system. Deployed from the mothership, the impactor will slam into the asteroid and blast out a crater. A deployed standalone camera package will watch the high-speed crash. While all of this is under way, Hayabusa 2 will slip behind the limb of the asteroid. \"They don't want to be anywhere near the event with respect to the mothership,\" Abell said. \"The ejecta from the impact might interfere with spacecraft systems.\" Once Hayabusa 2 is back around the asteroid, it will relay to Earth detailed imagery of the crater. \"So they'd have a really good idea of the actual impact event itself, the crater formation and the ejecta pattern from that hypervelocity impact,\" Abell told SPACE.com. Also on the agenda for Hayabusa 2 is to attempt a pinpoint landing at the newly created crater and sample that site, again sifting up material for transport back to Earth. Sweet-spot samples: Hayabusa 2's ability to suck up specimens is greater than what the first Hayabusa was capable of - and that gear failed to operate properly. Hayabusa 2 is designed to come back home to planet Earth with three different samples: two prior to the impact event and one post-impact. \"They are very optimistic that they will be able to return much more sample than they have in the original Hayabusa mission. It should be very interesting to see what they bring back,\" Abell said. \"No matter where we go...we're surprised at what we find.\" Abell said scientists and laypeople in Japan and around the world were enthralled with the first Hayabusa mission.

The first Hayabusa: \"It's a much more scientifically aggressive mission than the first Hayabusa. They are applying all the lessons learned from that mission to Hayabusa 2,\" said Paul Abell, lead scientist for planetary small bodies in the Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science Directorate at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. He was a joint science team member on the Hayabusa mission. The original Hayabusa was launched in May 2003 and reached Itokawa in mid-September 2005. Despite a sampling glitch, the craft managed to return to Earth a precious cargo of ultra-tiny grains of asteroid material. [Photos from the Hayabusa Mission] Those prized extraterrestrial specimens were parachuted into the Australian outback in June 2010. Some of the bits and pieces are being distributed to researchers around the world. Hayabusa overcame a series of glitches to make a victorious back-and-forth sojourn, and it has thus been heralded as a robotic version of NASA's famous Apollo 13 mission. But in this case, it was more appropriate to say, \"Sagamihara, we've got a problem.\" Asteroid landers: Abell told SPACE.com that Hayabusa 2 is basically a copycat version of its older sister ship, but with greater capabilities. There's more redundancy, for one, as well as improved software for autonomous navigation, guidance and control. Hayabusa 2 will involve international collaborations with Germany, the United States, Australia, and other countries. One new technical feature is that Hayabusa 2 will tote two landers to the asteroid instead of one. One will be a version of the detachable MIcro/Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid (MINERVA). This tiny lander was on the first Hayabusa as well, but it missed its mark, drifting off into space after being deployed too high above Itokawa. This time, joining the MINERVA-like lander is MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout), a small separate landing package developed by the German Aerospace Center. \"MASCOT will take some measurements, then move to a different location and take more readings,\" Abell said. Impact! Unique to Hayabusa 2 is its impactor system. Deployed from the mothership, the impactor will slam into the asteroid and blast out a crater. A deployed standalone camera package will watch the high-speed crash. While all of this is under way, Hayabusa 2 will slip behind the limb of the asteroid. \"They don't want to be anywhere near the event with respect to the mothership,\" Abell said. \"The ejecta from the impact might interfere with spacecraft systems.\" Once Hayabusa 2 is back around the asteroid, it will relay to Earth detailed imagery of the crater. \"So they'd have a really good idea of the actual impact event itself, the crater formation and the ejecta pattern from that hypervelocity impact,\" Abell told SPACE.com. Also on the agenda for Hayabusa 2 is to attempt a pinpoint landing at the newly created crater and sample that site, again sifting up material for transport back to Earth. Sweet-spot samples: Hayabusa 2's ability to suck up specimens is greater than what the first Hayabusa was capable of - and that gear failed to operate properly. Hayabusa 2 is designed to come back home to planet Earth with three different samples: two prior to the impact event and one post-impact. \"They are very optimistic that they will be able to return much more sample than they have in the original Hayabusa mission. It should be very interesting to see what they bring back,\" Abell said. \"No matter where we go...we're surprised at what we find.\" Abell said scientists and laypeople in Japan and around the world were enthralled with the first Hayabusa mission. It was relatively inexpensive and had a high scientific payoff. Hayabusa 2 is being designed in the same vein. \"What you are starting to see is recognition that missions to near-Earth objects are very attractive,\" Abell added. Asteroids are interesting for many reasons, cutting across both science and space exploration. Some scientists and entrepreneurs advocate mining asteroids someday, since they harbor vast stores of potentially valuable resources, including water, iron and platinum. And many researchers stress that we need to learn more about space rocks, since a big one is bound to strike Earth again sometime in the future. The payoff from this type of asteroid research is valuable \"in terms of how to deal with something that may have our name on it in the future,\" Abell said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/14759-asteroid-sample-mission-hayabusa-2.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Japan Launching Ambitious Asteroid-Sampling Mission in 2014", "date": "2012-12-29", "content": "Japan's space agency is readying a new asteroid probe for launch, an ambitious mission that aims to build on the victory of the country's first round-trip asteroid mission that sent the Hayabusa spacecraft to retrieve samples of the space rock Itokowa. The new Japanese asteroid mission, called Hayabusa2, is scheduled for launch in 2014 and aimed at the asteroid 1999 JU3, a large space rock about 3,018 feet (920 meters) in length. It is due to arrive at the asteroid in mid-2018, loiter at the space rock and carry out a slew of challenging firsts before departing the scene at the end of 2019. If all goes well, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft will return to Earth with samples of asteroid 1999 JU3 at the end of 2020. The probe's name is Japanese for \"Falcon2.\" Building on success: Officials with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said Hayabusa2, like its Hayabusa predecessor, will also involve a significant level of international cooperation. The initial Hayabusa mission launched in May 2003 and returned samples of Itokawa - the first asteroid samples ever collected in space - in June 2010. Like that first flight, the Hayabusa2 mission will rely on NASA's Deep Space Network of ground stations to help track the spacecraft. The spacecraft's return capsule will also land in Australia, another similarity to the first flight. Hayabusa2 is expected to stay with asteroid 1999 JU3 for more than a year, 18 months in all, thereby allowing ample time for observation and careful sample collection, according to the mission's project manager Makoto Yoshikawa of Japan's the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS). Asteroid 1999 JU3 is of particular interest to researchers because it consists of 4.5-billion-year-old material that has been altered very little. Measurements taken from Earth suggest that the asteroid's rock may have come into contact with water. The C-type asteroid is expected to contain organic and hydrated minerals, making it different from Itokawa, which was a rocky S-type asteroid. Asteroid 1999 JU3 is also larger than Itokawa, which was 1,771 (540 m) long. New and novel hardware: While the configuration of Hayabusa2 is similar to that of the first Hayabusa, the second probe will carry new and novel asteroid-studying hardware. For example, the antenna for Hayabusa was a single parabolic dish, but Hayabusa2 will sport two flat high-gain antennas to support faster communication speeds than its predecessor. Also, Hayabusa2 is to will fly through space with more propulsion power from its ion engines. Another addition is a 4-pound (2 kilograms) \"collision device\" that will be used to create an artificial crater on asteroid 1999 JU3 during the mission. This human-caused dent is expected to be a small one, a few meters in diameter. But it will allow Hayabusa2 to acquire samples of the asteroid that are exposed by the smashing event, fresh specimens that are less weathered by the brutal space environment on the asteroid's surface. Yoshikawa noted that during the first Hayabusa mission, the probe's MIcro/Nano Experimental Robot Vehicle for Asteroid (MINERVA) failed to reach the surface of Itokawa. \"So for Hayabusa2 we have even greater motivation to succeed with our new version of the robot, MINERVA2.\" Hayabusa2's MASCOT hitchhiker: For its part, the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) Institute of Space Systems in Bremen is contributing the Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout asteroid lander, or Mascot, to the JAXA mission. Mascot is being developed by DLR in collaboration with the French space agency and JAXA. After Hayabusa2 arrives at asteroid 1999 JU3 in 2018, Mascot will be released from the main spacecraft. A spring-loaded mechanism will push the 22-pound (10 kilograms) lander clear of from Hayabusa2. Mascot is a \"hopping\" lander packed with four separate instruments and is designed to move across the surface of an asteroid. Doing so will enable it to take measurements at different sites. As Mascot performs the near-asteroid maneuvers, a radiometer will measure the temperature of the asteroid and a camera will image the fine structure of the surface of 1999 JU3. The lander will be controlled from DLR's Microgravity User Support Center in Cologne. Free-falling on an asteroid: \"Mascot will free-fall to the asteroid from an altitude of around 100 meters [328 feet],\" said Tra-Mi Ho, DLR's project leader for the device, in a statement. Sensors will then ensure that Mascot knows which way is up and down, so it can orient itself and, if necessary, correct its attitude. Once on the asteroid, Mascot is expected to automatically adjust itself and \"hop\" from one measurement site to the next. \"Mascot is due to take measurements of the regolith itself, which will provide reference data about the surface and enable the samples subsequently brought back by Hayabusa2 to be interpreted in the correct context,\" said Ralf Jaumann, a DLR planetary researcher and scientific spokesman for the experiments on the lander. Mascot will work on the asteroid for a total of 16 hours, the equivalent of two days on asteroid 1999 JU3. Up close with an asteroid: \"We anticipate obtaining close-up photographs of the asteroid surface up to the order of centimeter-level resolution, something that Hayabusa1 was unable to capture,\" said Masanao Abe, Hayabusa2 project scientist at ISAS. The experience gained from that first Hayabusa mission, in terms of asteroid sample collection and analysis technologies, is proving highly useful, Abe said. \"Japan is at the forefront of sample-return technology and execution,\" Abe added \"and we are constantly thinking about how we can maintain our position and steadily working on things that will keep us at the leading edge.\" Akio Fujimura, an advisor in JAXA's Lunar and Planetary Exploration Program Group, said that in Hayabusa2's snagging of carbonaceous asteroid material, there is a high probability of gaining samples that contain organic matter - the fundamental building blocks of life. \"So, first, I expect Hayabusa2 to be a success. Then after that, I'd like us to proceed with an inquiry concerning where we came from and how life came about,\" Fujimura said. \"It would be great to uncover the origins of the solar system, Earth, the other planets, and life itself by getting information that we can't obtain here on Earth. I'd like us to open up new lines of scientific inquiry that seek to discover these origins.\" JAXA and the ISAS has learned a great deal from the first Hayabusa mission, said Michael Zolensky, a Hayabusa team member in sample analysis at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. \"Although the second spacecraft is based on the first one, they have made significant upgrades and expanded the capabilities of the spacecraft for Hayabusa2,\" Zolensky told SPACE.com. \"It should be a fantastic mission.

Engineers designed Hayabusa with upgrades to expand its scientific payoff and increase its chance for success.

The mission will take off on top of an H-2A launcher as soon as December, fly to an asteroid scientists believe is a relic from the genesis of the solar system, drop a European-built lander, and return to Earth in 2020 with extraterrestrial rock samples. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency revealed Hayabusa 2 to media Sunday as it neared the finish line in a four-year effort to design, construct and test the spacecraft. Japanese officials have not announced the target launch date, but they say the mission is on schedule to lift off as soon as December in a narrow window when Earth and Hayabusa 2's target asteroid are properly positioned to make the journey possible. Backup launch windows are available in June and December 2015. The spacecraft, now almost fully assembled for flight, will soon wrap up testing at JAXA's Sagamihara campus near Tokyo, according to Hitoshi Kuninaka, Hayabusa 2's project manager. \"At the end of September, the spacecraft will be transported to Tanegashima,\" Kuninaka said. Hayabusa 2's launch is next in line for liftoff from the Tanegashima Space Center -- located on Tanegashima Island in southwestern Japan -- after an Oct. 7 launch of the Himawari 8 weather satellite. Once the spacecraft arrives at the launch site, Kuninaka said technicians will install pyrotechnic charges for its mission, which include explosives to excavate material from beneath the asteroid's surface. Ground crews will also add the mission's flight batteries and fill the probe with xenon gas and hydrazine propellant. JAXA says the Hayabusa 2 mission's cost is 28.9 billion yen, or about $275 million. Hayabusa 2's launch follows four years after its namesake -- the hard-luck Hayabusa mission -- returned to Earth with microscopic specimens collected from asteroid Itokawa. Engineers designed Hayabusa with upgrades to expand its scientific payoff and increase its chance for success. Hayabusa 2 carries four xenon-fueled ion thrusters for the voyage to asteroid 1999 JU3, an object with a diameter of about 3,200 feet that researchers believe is made of primitive rock left over from the ancient solar system. After a swingby of Earth in late 2015 to get a gravity boost, the 1,320-pound craft will arrive at 1999 JU3 in June 2018 and loiter around the asteroid for about 18 months. Once it arrives at asteroid 1999 JU3, Hayabusa 2 will survey the rock with an array of instruments, including imagers, a spectrometer, and a terrain-mapping altimeter. The craft will also release a small Japanese rover named MINERVA to hop across the surface of the asteroid and deploy the MASCOT lander developed by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. Hayabusa spent about three months exploring Itokawa, an asteroid about half the size of 1999 JU3. Hayabusa 2's destination is a different type of miniature world than Itokawa. Asteroid 1999 JU3 is a C-type asteroid, a classification of primitive objects made of organic and hydrated minerals. Itokawa is an S-type asteroid composed of rocks and metals heated and modified over the solar system's 4.5 billion year history, causing the material to lose chemical markers left over from the dawn of the solar system. Scientists expect the Hayabusa 2 samples to hold a record of the tumultuous early phases of the solar system's formation, including the basic building blocks of life such as amino acids. Hayabusa 2 will collect up to three samples from 1999 JU3, including material blasted from beneath the asteroid's surface by a explosive grapefruit-sized copper impactor released from the mothership. Depending on the texture of the rocks on 1999 JU3, Hayabusa 2 should pick up between a gram and several grams of samples. After up to three close approaches to acquire samples, Hayabusa 2 will depart the asteroid in December 2019 and deploy a sample-bearing re-entry capsule into Earth's atmosphere in December 2020.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1409/01hayabusa2/"}, {"title": "Japanese asteroid probe delayed", "date": "2014-11-28", "content": "Thick cloud has postponed the launch of Hayabusa-2, which was scheduled to leave for a carbon-rich space rock on 30 November.

What it captured was a stunning visual of the Antarctica region. The ONC-T camera (Optical Navigation Camera - Telescopic) can take multi-colour images with seven filters. An image based on three of the filters is shown in Figure 1, which shows the Australia and Antarctica continents. Since the Antarctic region is difficult to observe with meteorological satellites, such as Himawari, this is a rare picture of the Earth. Coincidently, the 57th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE57) is currently onboard the icebreaker vessel, Shirase, on her way to the Showa Station in Antarctica. The image clearly shows that a series of vorteses of low-pressure systems in the Roaring Forties and Furious Fifties winds are waiting for the expedition members. Hayabusa2 is travelling to Asteroid Ryugu to analyse and bring back hydrated minerals and organic matter. With its seven filters, the ONC-T camera can image the asteroid to find the location of these compounds, as well as determining the best place for the spacecraft to touch down. An example of its effectiveness is shown in Figure 2. On the left-hand image, the ONC-T filters were used to show locations where plants exist. This is superimposed over the image in Figure 1 on the right-hand side. While New Zealand and the African Continent were previously concealed by cloud, they stand out sharply in their plant life. Meanwhile, Antarctica is completely dark in the green overlay image, depicting a foliage-free region. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3, the ONC-T filters have picked out the Antarctica ice in blue and the clouds in white. With a normal camera, these would be hard to differentiate as both would appear in similar hues. Now the natural features of the coastline and mountain range that traverses the continent can be clearly recognized in the blue ice image. The ONC-T camera therefore allows us to get information not only on appearance, but also the material properties. Prior to launch, the ONC-T functionality was checked extensively and these images beautifully confirm that the camera is working as planned. The next stop will be the surface of Asteroid Ryugu, where ONC-T will be deciding the best locations to collect the precious cargo of organic matter and hydrated minerals. Hayabusa2 will arrive at Ryugu in 2018.

The probe still has over a million Kilometers to cover in order to reach its target in June for a one-and-a-half-year exploration mission that will see the spacecraft dispatch a series of landers and an impactor while also making contact with Ryugu itself to scoop up sample material to be returned to Earth in December 2020. The first optical images of Ryugu, only appearing as a speck of light, were taken by the faraway spacecraft on February 26, Day 1,181 of the Hayabusa 2 mission that started back on December 3, 2014 with a successful launch atop an H-IIA rocket that sent the 590-Kilogram craft on a three-and-a-half-year journey to Ryugu - a 920-meter C-type primitive body that is hoped to hold a treasure trove of scientific information in the form of a preserved record of the early days of the solar system. Sent off at a top speed of 11.8 Kilometers per second (relative to Earth), Hayabusa 2 entered a heliocentric orbit and completed 547 hours of ion engine firings between March and September 2015 to adjust course for an Earth flyby on December 3rd that saw the spacecraft zip past the planet at an altitude of around 3,090 Kilometers and borrow some of Earth's angular momentum to speed up in its orbit around the sun to reach asteroid Ryugu. The speedy flyby provided a welcome opportunity for exercising the craft's instrument suite and collecting calibration data of a very well-known target. Heading back out, Hayabusa 2 was set for two major orbit-adjustment campaigns using its ion engines to slowly catch up with Ryugu that orbits the sun at 0.96 by 1.42 astronomical units. Some testing of the craft's critical systems including the long-distance Ka-Band communications link were carried out along the way and the ion engines were operated for 794 hours between March and May 2016 to adjust the craft's solar orbit by changing its speed by 127 m/s and adding a brief fine-tuning maneuver of 40 cm/s. The second orbit-adjustment campaign between November 2016 and May 2017 operated three of the four engines for 2,558 hours to change the craft's speed by 435 m/s. Hayabusa began firing three of its four ion engines again on January 10, 2018 marking the initiation of the far-field approach phase to take the spacecraft toward its destination with ion engine operation planned to last until early June when the final approach phase will be initiated from a distance of 2,500 Kilometers. Until June, the ion engines are expected to operate for 2,700 hours for a total delta-v of around 400 meters per second. On February 26, Hayabusa pointed its Telescopic Optical Navigation Camera ONC-T toward Ryugu's location and snapped approximately 300 images, a subset of which were transmitted on the 27th and indeed show the asteroid at an optical magnitude of 9. At the time the images were taken, the spacecraft was still 1.3 million Kilometers from its destination. The ONC-T images provided independent confirmation that Hayabusa 2 is on the correct approach course toward Ryugu in addition to constant radio tracking of the spacecraft's trajectory. According to Project Management, the spacecraft remains in excellent health and the current ion propulsion phase will proceed with maximum thrust. Reaching the approach point in early June, Hayabusa 2 will rely on its three Optical Navigation Cameras to provide relative navigation data used by mission teams on Earth to plan the spacecraft's final approach, first into a 20-Kilometer surveying orbit where the spacecraft is expected to arrive by July 5th. It will then be set for a step-wise descent first to five and then to one Kilometer from Ryugu's surface to collect detailed remote-sensing data of the asteroid using a pair of infrared spectrometers tasked with studying the energy balance of the asteroid as well as its chemical composition. The primary payload of Hayabusa 2 is a sample collection system that will acquire small amounts of surface samples during as many as three brief touchdowns of the main spacecraft on the asteroid's surface using a high-fidelity navigation system that allows the spacecraft to make contact with the surface just long enough to shoot down a projectile and scoop up lifted dust through a sampling horn. Furthermore, the spacecraft will dispatch four landers - the 10-Kilogram MASCOT lander built in Europe for an in-situ study of surface composition and properties, and three MINERVA landers to deliver imagery and temperature measurements. All landers will make several hops across the asteroid's surface to take measurements at different locations. Another payload of the mission is an impactor device that will be deployed towards the asteroid and use high-explosives to generate a high-speed impact that is hoped to expose material from under the asteroid's surface for later collection by Hayabusa 2. A deployable camera will be used to document the impact of the penetrator. The number of touch-and-go attempts and landers to be dispatched not only makes Hayabusa 2 one of the most complex missions currently in operation but also creates a packed schedule for the 18 months it plans to spend in proximity to the asteroid. Per current planning schedules, the initial touchdown and lander deployment is planned for September/October followed by a brief intermission ahead of touchdown #2 in February 2019, the release of the impactor in March/April and the third touchdown one month later.

Although we can currently see Ryugu only as a point, it is very exciting for the whole project team to catch sight of the destination! The ONC-T was developed under collaboration between JAXA, the University of Tokyo, Kochi University, Rikkyo University, Nagoya University, Chiba Institute of Technology, Meiji University, The University of Aizu, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).", "url": "https://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/topics/20180301_e/"}, {"title": "Eyes on Target: Japan's Hayabusa 2 Takes First Images of Asteroid Ryugu", "date": "2018-03-02", "content": "Japan's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft - on a quest to touch an asteroid - has set its sight on its destination in late February via the first detection of asteroid Ryugu by the craft's Telescopic Optical Navigation Camera that will be used to guide it into close proximity to the distant world later this year. The probe still has over a million Kilometers to cover in order to reach its target in June for a one-and-a-half-year exploration mission that will see the spacecraft dispatch a series of landers and an impactor while also making contact with Ryugu itself to scoop up sample material to be returned to Earth in December 2020. The first optical images of Ryugu, only appearing as a speck of light, were taken by the faraway spacecraft on February 26, Day 1,181 of the Hayabusa 2 mission that started back on December 3, 2014 with a successful launch atop an H-IIA rocket that sent the 590-Kilogram craft on a three-and-a-half-year journey to Ryugu - a 920-meter C-type primitive body that is hoped to hold a treasure trove of scientific information in the form of a preserved record of the early days of the solar system. Sent off at a top speed of 11.8 Kilometers per second (relative to Earth), Hayabusa 2 entered a heliocentric orbit and completed 547 hours of ion engine firings between March and September 2015 to adjust course for an Earth flyby on December 3rd that saw the spacecraft zip past the planet at an altitude of around 3,090 Kilometers and borrow some of Earth's angular momentum to speed up in its orbit around the sun to reach asteroid Ryugu. The speedy flyby provided a welcome opportunity for exercising the craft's instrument suite and collecting calibration data of a very well-known target. Heading back out, Hayabusa 2 was set for two major orbit-adjustment campaigns using its ion engines to slowly catch up with Ryugu that orbits the sun at 0.96 by 1.42 astronomical units. Some testing of the craft's critical systems including the long-distance Ka-Band communications link were carried out along the way and the ion engines were operated for 794 hours between March and May 2016 to adjust the craft's solar orbit by changing its speed by 127 m/s and adding a brief fine-tuning maneuver of 40 cm/s. The second orbit-adjustment campaign between November 2016 and May 2017 operated three of the four engines for 2,558 hours to change the craft's speed by 435 m/s. Hayabusa began firing three of its four ion engines again on January 10, 2018 marking the initiation of the far-field approach phase to take the spacecraft toward its destination with ion engine operation planned to last until early June when the final approach phase will be initiated from a distance of 2,500 Kilometers. Until June, the ion engines are expected to operate for 2,700 hours for a total delta-v of around 400 meters per second. On February 26, Hayabusa pointed its Telescopic Optical Navigation Camera ONC-T toward Ryugu's location and snapped approximately 300 images, a subset of which were transmitted on the 27th and indeed show the asteroid at an optical magnitude of 9. At the time the images were taken, the spacecraft was still 1.3 million Kilometers from its destination. The ONC-T images provided independent confirmation that Hayabusa 2 is on the correct approach course toward Ryugu in addition to constant radio tracking of the spacecraft's trajectory. According to Project Management, the spacecraft remains in excellent health and the current ion propulsion phase will proceed with maximum thrust. Reaching the approach point in early June, Hayabusa 2 will rely on its three Optical Navigation Cameras to provide relative navigation data used by mission teams on Earth to plan the spacecraft's final approach, first into a 20-Kilometer surveying orbit where the spacecraft is expected to arrive by July 5th. It will then be set for a step-wise descent first to five and then to one Kilometer from Ryugu's surface to collect detailed remote-sensing data of the asteroid using a pair of infrared spectrometers tasked with studying the energy balance of the asteroid as well as its chemical composition. The primary payload of Hayabusa 2 is a sample collection system that will acquire small amounts of surface samples during as many as three brief touchdowns of the main spacecraft on the asteroid's surface using a high-fidelity navigation system that allows the spacecraft to make contact with the surface just long enough to shoot down a projectile and scoop up lifted dust through a sampling horn. Furthermore, the spacecraft will dispatch four landers - the 10-Kilogram MASCOT lander built in Europe for an in-situ study of surface composition and properties, and three MINERVA landers to deliver imagery and temperature measurements. All landers will make several hops across the asteroid's surface to take measurements at different locations. Another payload of the mission is an impactor device that will be deployed towards the asteroid and use high-explosives to generate a high-speed impact that is hoped to expose material from under the asteroid's surface for later collection by Hayabusa 2. A deployable camera will be used to document the impact of the penetrator. The number of touch-and-go attempts and landers to be dispatched not only makes Hayabusa 2 one of the most complex missions currently in operation but also creates a packed schedule for the 18 months it plans to spend in proximity to the asteroid. Per current planning schedules, the initial touchdown and lander deployment is planned for September/October followed by a brief intermission ahead of touchdown #2 in February 2019, the release of the impactor in March/April and the third touchdown one month later.

The probe was also the first ever to achieve the feat of extracting a substance from below the surface of an asteroid by creating an artificial crater. The mission's success demonstrated that Japan both possesses advanced asteroid exploration technology and can be expected to contribute to greater understanding of the origin of the universe. Analyses of the material from Ryugu, which scientists believe contains evidence from the time of the solar system's formation some 4.6 billion years ago, could yield hints about how our planetary system came to be. In addition, as Ryugu is thought to contain a copious amount of organic material and water, such analysis could validate the hypothesis that the organic material essential to life was carried to Earth by similar asteroids crashing into our planet. TSUDA Yuichi, project manager at the JAXA Space Science Laboratory and the mission's leader, said, \"The Hayabusa2 mission sought to find the secrets behind how the Earth and life were created.\" The probe's predecessor, Hayabusa, completed the first-ever successful sample return mission in 2010 by bringing material back to Earth from the asteroid Itokawa. Despite facing several difficulties, including a fuel leak and engine failure, the probe miraculously made it back home. The frame and engine of Hayabusa2 were upgraded from the original model, while the JAXA team personnel conducted drills to deal with various conceivable scenarios. These preparations were fully utilized during the eventual mission. With touchdown being an incredibly high-risk operation, the most difficult decision faced was whether to collect a second sample from a different location. A failed second landing would risk the loss of the surface materials that had been collected on the first landing. \"However,\" Tsuda said, \"in addition to providing the opportunity to extract material from below the asteroid's surface, the second touchdown would be scientifically significant since obtaining material from multiple locations would enable us to conduct a comparative analysis. After reconfirming the significance of an additional touchdown with scientists from around the world, we chose to make this difficult second attempt.\" With the support of scientists who believed in the technology carried by Hayabusa2, the team was able to complete the second landing successfully. The enthusiasm and meticulousness of all the project members bore fruit, enabling Hayabusa2 to bring samples back to Earth in a way that exceeded expectations. Looking back on the mission, Tsuda said, \"Every single rock has its own unique surface. When I saw the actual samples, I was moved to tears.\" Japan continues to be at the forefront of asteroid sample return missions.

Rare samples collected from the surface of an asteroid by NASA and its international partners are helping to decipher these clues. Now, scientists in the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Division at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston are among those able to study samples retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Hayabusa2 spacecraft and returned to Earth in late 2020. JAXA is sharing a portion of these samples with NASA, and in exchange, NASA will provide JAXA a percentage of a sample of asteroid Bennu, when the agency's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft returns to Earth from the space rock in 2023. NASA received 23 millimeter-sized grains and 4 containers of even finer material from Ryugu -- 10 percent of the total collected - from JAXA on Nov. 30. A JAXA official and a JAXA scientist delivered the asteroid fragments to Johnson, meeting with agency team members to complete the sample transfer and receiving training on safe handling procedures for their portion of the OSIRIS-REx samples. \"This is an exciting opportunity to amplify science return through international cooperation,\" said Lori Glaze, Planetary Science Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"The collaboration will help both countries get the most out of their returns and share the responsibility of sample curation independently crosscheck results. JAXA's contribution is a welcomed addition to the ARES collection of extraterrestrial materials and will provide researchers important new samples wealth of information to examine for generations to come.\" The JAXA sample was placed in a cleanroom dedicated to Ryugu research. The ARES facility includes a unique, state-of-the-art laboratory suite for the study of extraterrestrial materials. The team first documented the regolith using high-resolution photography, and then stored the samples in a glovebox filled with dry nitrogen gas. This gas protects the sample from breaking down in Earth's naturally humid and subtly acidic atmosphere. It also protects pores of gas within the sample for future study. The ARES facility at Johnson houses the world's largest collection of astromaterials from the solar system under one roof, including samples from asteroids, comets, Mars, the Moon, Sun, and dust from our solar system and beyond. Scientists use world-class laboratories to perform research on planetary materials and the space environment to investigate the origin and evolution of our solar system, the universe, and the possibilities of how life might form on other planets. Additionally, researchers participate in robotic planetary missions, support human spaceflight activities on board the International Space Station, and assist in the design of next-generation exploration spacecraft. Asteroids are debris left over from the dawn of the solar system. The Sun and its planets formed from a cloud of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago, and asteroids are thought to date to the first few million years of solar system history. More data are needed to understand how the solar system's evolution exactly unfolded. Sample returns from asteroids help provide some of that data. \"Sample returns are the gifts that keep on giving,\" said Keiko Nakamura-Messenger, ARES planetary scientist and sample curator. \"Advancements in technology and methodology will continue to help scientists gather data from sample returns in ways once thought impossible. We're still studying Apollo samples.\" Ryugu belongs to a class of asteroids called carbonaceous, or C-type, asteroids. C-type asteroids are rich in water, carbon, and organic compounds from when the solar system formed. Researchers suspect that bits of C-type asteroids that crashed into Earth as meteorites delivered the raw ingredients of life to Earth in the early solar system. Scientists have surveyed thousands of meteorites that have been found on Earth, many of which also likely came from C-type asteroids. However, analyzing these rocks is challenging due to Earth-based contaminants, and determining which meteorites came from which asteroids is a challenge. Although missions like Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx are difficult to collect in space and get back to Earth, samples retrieved directly from an asteroid like Ryugu are uncontaminated and tell us about known locations in the solar system. \"More science can be conducted with directly collected asteroid samples because we know where they came from. Plus, we're directly analyzing the sample rather than scanning the asteroid from afar,\" explained Nakamura-Messenger. \"This allows us to use extremely sensitive techniques to reveal the tiniest concentrations of organic compounds potentially present in the samples. The results may shed light on how the solar system evolved and life originated.\" The delivery marks the end of a long journey for the Ryugu sample. JAXA launched Hayabusa2 in December 2014 to collect samples from Ryugu. After arriving at the asteroid, Hayabusa2 deployed two rovers and a small lander on the surface. Then, in February 2019, Hayabusa2 fired an impactor into the asteroid to create an artificial crater. This allowed the spacecraft to retrieve a sample beneath Ryugu's surface. \"Exposure to galactic and solar cosmic rays takes away water and alters the surface of asteroids,\" Nakamura-Messenger. \"We believe fresh material resides beneath Ryugu's surface that will be key to understanding its true nature.\" Hayabusa2 returned to Earth with the Ryugu sample in December 2020. Scientists at Johnson analyzed a microscopic sample from Hayabusa2 in June of this year before receiving the entire allotment from JAXA last week. The spacecraft itself is now on an extended mission to a smaller asteroid, called 1998 KY26. Meanwhile, NASA's OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft is on track to return the sample from the carbonaceous asteroid Bennu to Earth in 2023. Ryugu, Bennu, and 1998 KY26 are considered \"near-Earth asteroids,\" meaning they likely formed within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but have since drifted closer to Earth. The exchange of the Ryugu and Bennu samples is part of a larger initiative by NASA to partner with JAXA and other countries to push the frontiers of space exploration. \"The future of space exploration will require collaboration among nations,\" said Grossman. \"The sample exchange between NASA and JAXA marks a step toward achieving this goal.\" The Ryugu fragments provided by JAXA will be available to scientists across the world upon request. Analysis of the samples is ongoing. ARES researchers and other scientists not involved in the exchange will be able to submit requests to study asteroid fragments to the sample curator at Johnson. Currently, ARES is upgrading and expanding facilities to support new capabilities required to investigate inbound collections (most notably asteroid samples from Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx). A new annex to Johnson's Building 31 complex will be complete in 2023 in time to host the OSIRIS-REx science team for preliminary examination and initial sample analysis when these samples return to Earth. NASA also plans to work with JAXA on the Martian Moons Exploration, or MMX, spacecraft. JAXA intends to send the spacecraft to the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, retrieve a sample from the surface of one of them, and return it to Earth around 2029. Insights gained from the mission are expected to clarify how the Red Planet and Martian moons formed and evolved. JAXA will also play a role in supporting future missions to the Moon under NASA's Artemis program. NASA formalized an agreement this year to work with the Japanese government to help develop an outpost orbiting the Moon, called Gateway. The outpost will house commercial and international partners during Artemis missions, and enable crews to bring back samples from the lunar surface to Earth.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-receives-special-cosmic-delivery-of-asteroid-sample-from-japan"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Receives Special Cosmic Delivery of Asteroid Sample from Japan", "date": "2021-12-06", "content": "Just as fossils hold clues to the history of life, asteroids hold clues to the history of the solar system.
