[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler Spacecraft Designed to Detect Earth-size Planets", "date": "2007-04-10", "content": "NASA's new Kepler spacecraft will greatly expand the quest for planets orbiting stars - not just giant, Jupiter-size planets -- but smaller, Earth-size worlds that might well contain liquid water, and so could harbor life. Kepler is a NASA 'Discovery' mission that scientists have designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to detect potentially hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near habitable zones. A habitable zone is the distance from a star where liquid water could exist on the surface of a planet orbiting that star. \"It's the most important endeavor NASA is undertaking, in my opinion,\" ventured William Borucki, a space scientist and Kepler's principal investigator who works at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, where the mission was conceived and where science operations will be conducted. \"We are trying to find man's place in the universe. The first step in doing that is finding Earth-like planets. Ultimately, we'll travel to the stars to see who is there,\" Borucki predicted. \"Since we first proposed Kepler in 1994, scientists have detected more than 200 extra-solar planets,\" said astrophysicist David Koch of Ames, Kepler's deputy principal investigator. However, almost all of these are gas-giant planets, and the virtue of Kepler is that it is able to find Earth-size and smaller planets -- that is, planets more than 300 times smaller in mass than Jupiter, Koch observed. Kepler will be the first space telescope specifically designed to find Earth-size planets in the habitable zones around distant stars. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in November 2008 on a Delta II rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Kepler will look for periodic dimming of stars, or transits, as clues that would reveal the presence of intervening planets along the craft's line of sight. How did the search for planets beyond our solar system begin? Why did astronomers want to launch a telescope into space to look for 'extra-solar' planets? In the imagination of science fiction writers, the universe teems with planets inhabited by a variety of exotic creatures. But in reality, we did not detect any planets beyond our solar system until recently. Astronomers could not observe these mostly gas-giant planets orbiting stars, but instead used indirect methods to find those distant worlds. Not many years ago, telescopes observed stars that wobble, a telltale sign that large, Jupiter-size or larger gas planets were orbiting the stars, according to astronomers. Observers then noticed that some of these stars dimmed, then brightened again regularly, providing further evidence that planets are orbiting those far-away suns as well and reducing observed starlight when the planets pass between their home stars and Earth. Looking for planets orbiting other stars is difficult with Earth-based telescopes that have to peer through Earth's atmosphere. The starlight is 'polluted' by the nocturnal lights cast by cities, and the smoke and smog of civilization and by other natural distortions created by our atmosphere. Even the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth, is limited because it is not designed to stare intently for years at just one small section of the Milky Way. To overcome these and other problems encountered by Earth-bound telescopes, astronomers suggested that a new telescope that can detect Earth-size and smaller planets in habitable zones be launched into space. This new telescope would be expressly designed to look for star-dimming 'transits.' \"(The idea for Kepler) started with a paper by Frank Rosenblatt in the late 1970s. He was a neurosurgeon. He wrote a paper and envisioned how one might use transits to find planets. I read this paper, and it inspired me,\" said Borucki. Kepler will include a lens, a primary mirror and a charge-coupled device (CCD) array for collecting light. The CCD array is similar, but bigger than, the CCDs that replace film in consumer, digital cameras. \"The Kepler focal plane is made up of 95 megapixels, unlike a digital home camera, which might be five megapixels,\" Koch explained. As of February 2007, the CCD photometer array was nearing completion, and engineers were planning for spacecraft assembly and testing at Ball Aerospace, Boulder, Colo. The new optics system on Kepler, including its mirror and telescope, will focus pinpoints of light from 100,000 Milky Way stars onto the light-sensitive (CCD) array, according to Koch. After launch in 2008, Kepler will soar away from the Earth, and in a few days the spacecraft will be past the moon's orbit. Kepler's final orbit will be around the sun, trailing Earth. Scientists expect the spacecraft to drift slowly until it is about 46.5 million miles (75 million kilometers) behind the Earth in four years. Scientists designed the orbit to give the spacecraft a stable view of the 100,000 stars being examined and to keep Kepler's view of those stars from being blocked by the sun or moon. Researchers planned the Kepler mission to last four years with the potential to extend it an additional two years. \"If you're thinking about the Earth traveling around the sun, Earth goes around once a year. So, you need to observe for at least three years, and preferably four years, to be more certain statistically that a planet has been spotted,\" Borucki explained. Scientists theorize that the smaller stars will yield useful data first because the planets will be closer to their suns and orbit them in less than an Earth year, according to Borucki. Like a photographer's light meter, the CCD array will not capture actual images of planets, but instead will look for starlight that dims and brightens again on a regular timetable. This periodic variation of starlight may indicate that planets could orbit these stars. Planets would be passing between their stars and Earth, causing the starlight reaching the Kepler spacecraft to be weakened, once for each planet's 'yearly' orbit. Planets' years will vary in comparison to Earth years, depending on how far away from their home star they orbit, and how fast they orbit. According to Koch, Kepler would look at the same field of view in space, a region along the Orion arm of the galaxy for at least four years. \"We needed to find a region that is never blocked by the sun and has a high density of stars,\" Koch explained. \"Think of Kepler as a hundred-thousand channel photographic light meter,\" Koch continued. \"We need to count lots of photons. A typical measurement is a billion photons of light per hour for each star that we measure. What we have to look for are changes of 100 parts per million or smaller,\" Koch observed. Photons are elementary particles that make up all forms of light and other kinds of radiation such as heat or radio waves. The brightness change that would show the signature of an Earth-size transit across its star would last for two to 16 hours, according to Koch. \"Kepler must process 95 million pixels every five seconds, and the spacecraft must measure the brightness of all 100,000 stars once every 30 minutes,\" he explained. A pixel is derived from two words, 'picture element,' which is the smallest unit or piece of a computer, television or similar image. \"The chances of detecting a planet in the habitable zone of a star are about a half of a percent. Therefore, tens of thousands of stars need to be monitored continuously (at least once every hour) in order to detect hundreds of planets,\" Koch said. \"We store the data on the spacecraft for a whole month, and we have 16 gigabytes of data storage on Kepler,\" Koch noted. Kepler will transmit its data to Earth every 30 days via NASA's Deep Space Network. The network will carry the data to the mission operations center at the University of Colorado, Boulder. There are two kinds of data -- engineering data and science data. The center staff will use the engineering data to monitor the health of the spacecraft and its key component, the CCD photometer. The science data will travel to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., where researchers will archive Kepler's raw science information. Researchers in Baltimore will relay raw science data to the science operations center at Ames for analysis and interpretation. Computers will examine the data from the stars to locate any potential dimming caused by planetary transits. Kepler scientists will be able to calculate the size of the planet by noting how much the brightness of the star drops in relation to how large the star is. Scientists will use the size of the planet's orbit and the temperature of the star to estimate the planet's temperature. The temperature will help scientists answer whether or not the planet is in the habitable zone. Koch expects to derive information about the planets' orbits and sizes from the data the Kepler spacecraft will deliver. \"The data will also show the frequency of planet formation for inner planets and the distribution of planetary sizes, orbital sizes and co-planetary effects of Jovian type planets,\" Koch said. \"The Kepler mission will perform an unbiased search for all orbital periods out to a 'martian orbit,'\" Koch observed. He said the region around a star extending out to a martian orbit should be explored because models show that \"molecular cloud collapse\" can be expected to produce, on the average, four inner planets between the orbits of Mercury and Mars. \"Two of these are approximately Earth-sized and two are smaller,\" Koch noted. \"If there are many planets around a star, we should know how many planets there are, how big and how far away from the star they are, and if they are in the habitable zone,\" Borucki observed. \"That happens if all the planets are in the same orbital plane.\" According to Borucki, scientists will find out how frequently Earth-size planets form around stars. \"From that, one will know whether, potentially, life is widespread or rare,\" Borucki said. Scientists hope the Kepler mission will detect Mars-size to Jupiter-size planets in an estimated 700 planetary systems, according to Koch. If Kepler detects hundreds of Earth-size planets on which liquid water could exist, the discovery would be an exciting and very important one, according to astronomers. \"We are in the early stages of looking for Earth-size planets,\" Borucki said. According to scientists, if Earth-size planets are detected, astronomers might be able to look at them with advanced telescopes not yet developed. As many as 250 people are working on Kepler across the nation. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for management of the project for NASA Ames Research Center and ensuring the flight system is successfully delivered and performing in orbit. NASA Ames is managing the development of the ground system and will conduct scientific analysis. Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. is developing the flight system (spacecraft and photometer) and participating in mission operations. Ames will manage flight operations after commissioning is completed. Commissioning is the period after launch when the spacecraft's systems and the photometer will be checked to ensure they are working properly and ready to begin routine science operations.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/2007/kepler-story.html"}, {"title": "Kepler Team Cuts Costs, Avoids Cancellation", "date": "2007-07-25", "content": "Threatened with cancellation, the team building NASA's Kepler planet-hunting telescope found a way get the spacecraft to the launch pad by early 2009 without a new infusion of cash. Kepler consists of a single instrument, a 0.95-meter Schmidt telescope optimized for scanning a field of stars for signs of potentially habitable Earth-size planets. Integration of the spacecraft gets under way this summer, with the telescope due to be installed a year from now. A Delta 2 rocket is slated to launch Kepler into an Earth-trailing orbit. The price tag for the Discovery-class mission has risen several times since its 2001 selection due to a combination of factors, including management problems, technical challengesand budget fluctuations beyond the project's control. In mid-2006, believing Kepler's problems were largely in the past, NASA accepted a 21-percent cost increase for construction of the telescope, pushing the total cost of the mission above $550 million. The launch date also slipped another five months past its original 2006 target to November 2008. This spring, the Kepler team - which consists of Ball Aerospace & Technology,Ames Research Centerand the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) - told NASA science chief Alan Stern it needed an additional $42 million and an extra four months to finish the spacecraft. \"My response was 'no, [the Science Mission Directorate] no longer manages by open checkbook. You need to find a way to get it back in the box because I don't have $42 million in the astrophysics program anyway,'\" Stern recalled in a July 9 interview. Stern told the team to come back in June with a plan for getting the job done within the revised budget NASA approved for Kepler last year. \"On June 1, they came with a request for $54 million instead of $42 million,at which point I said: 'Kepler project, apparently you don't think I'm serious ... If you don't think I'm serious just come back to me with numbers like these again and that will be the end of the project.'\" When he testified before Congress in May, Stern made clear that the program was all but canceled at that point - and that was before the Kepler team responded to his call to cut costs by asking for even more money. After rejecting their June 1 request for another $54 million, Stern gave the Kepler teama month to take another crack at putting their program\"back in the box.\" On July 6, the Kepler team returned to NASA headquarters here to present their plan. \"They took us very seriously,\" Stern said. \"They came back with no cost increase.\" The Kepler team, according to Stern, proposed staying within the budget NASA approved in 2006, by cutting six months off the end of the four-year mission, scaling back some spacecraft testing, reducing schedule reserveand making some management changes. In addition, Ball Aerospace & Technologies, the Boulder, Colo.-based firm building the spacecraft and instrument, gave up \"millions and millions of dollars of their earned fee,\" Stern said. The plan passed muster with Stern and the other NASA officials who examined it - including Stern's science advisor John Mather, his deputy for programs Todd May and a representative from NASA's Office of the Chief Engineer - as a clear and viable path to the launch pad. Ball spokeswoman Roz Brown declined to say how much fee the company agreed to forfeit or whether the project would still prove profitable. \"I can't be specific on the financial stuff,\" Brown said July 10. \"Profit is just one tool. We were determined that we were going to get the program back on track and we are getting the program back on track. We heard NASA loud and clear.\" Kepler will still miss its November 2008 launch target by two or three months, but Stern said he could live with that. \"The only thing more important than keeping Kepler marching towards launch is to have responsible management in the Science Mission Directorate,\" he said. \"I won't write checks any more. There's a new team in town and we don't work that way.\" While reducing testing and cutting schedule reserves might sound like a recipe for failure, Stern said neither action would put the success of the mission at risk. \"They found some places where they could responsibly de-scope - where testing was icing on the cake,\" he said. \"They [also] had very lavish schedule reserves by normal industry standards.

Scheduled to launch in February 2009, the Kepler Mission will measure tiny variations in the brightness of stars to find planets that pass in front of them during their orbits. During these passes or \"transits\" the planets will slightly decrease the star's brightness. The detectors are similar to the image detectors found in a digital camera, but much more sensitive. \"This is a major milestone for the Kepler mission,\" said David Koch, deputy principal investigator for the Kepler Mission. \"We will use hardware identical to what we will be flying on Kepler in the test bed at Ames. We will have the ability to create transits of a star so that we can see the change in the star's brightness. By simulating transits, we will be able to demonstrate that the flight hardware will work,\" Koch explained. Kepler mission scientists will determine the frequency of Earth-size and larger planets in or near the habitable zone around other stars. Although hundreds of larger, Jupiter-like planets composed of gas already have been detected, Kepler mission scientists are seeking smaller planets where water, and perhaps, life, could exist. \"We expect to find dozens of planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars that are terrestrial size, rocky planets, similar to Earth,\" said William Borucki, Kepler's science principal investigator. \"We will learn whether Earths are common or rare in our galaxy.\" There will be 42 charge coupled devices (CCDs) used in the focal plane of the telescope during the actual mission. Together, the 42 CCDs make up a large array measuring about a foot square in Kepler's telescope. This is the largest array of CCD detectors ever flown in space, Koch said. In this month's Single String Transit Verification Test at Ames, scientists will be testing only one CCD, measuring approximately one-inch by two inches. Scientists will use a Kepler Technology Demonstration test bed to generate a star field, a pattern of stars, to represent that part of the sky where mission scientists will search for transits. The tests will verify the detectors' ability to measure the tiny light intensity variations.

During these passes or \"transits\" the planets will slightly decrease the star's brightness. The detectors are similar to the image detectors found in a digital camera, but much more sensitive. \"This is a major milestone for the Kepler mission,\" said David Koch, deputy principal investigator for the Kepler Mission. \"We will use hardware identical to what we will be flying on Kepler in the test bed at Ames. We will have the ability to create transits of a star so that we can see the change in the star's brightness. By simulating transits, we will be able to demonstrate that the flight hardware will work,\" Koch explained. Kepler mission scientists will determine the frequency of Earth-size and larger planets in or near the habitable zone around other stars. Although hundreds of larger, Jupiter-like planets composed of gas already have been detected, Kepler mission scientists are seeking smaller planets where water, and perhaps, life, could exist. \"We expect to find dozens of planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars that are terrestrial size, rocky planets, similar to Earth,\" said William Borucki, Kepler's science principal investigator. \"We will learn whether Earths are common or rare in our galaxy.\" There will be 42 charge coupled devices (CCDs) used in the focal plane of the telescope during the actual mission. Together, the 42 CCDs make up a large array measuring about a foot square in Kepler's telescope. This is the largest array of CCD detectors ever flown in space, Koch said. In this month's Single String Transit Verification Test at Ames, scientists will be testing only one CCD, measuring approximately one-inch by two inches. Scientists will use a Kepler Technology Demonstration test bed to generate a star field, a pattern of stars, to represent that part of the sky where mission scientists will search for transits. The tests will verify the detectors' ability to measure the tiny light intensity variations. In space, the array of detectors will be covered with sapphire field-flattener lenses and use a telescope, which Borucki said will search a region of sky 30,000 times larger that the Hubble Space Telescope is able to observe.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/nasa-ames-conducts-tests-of-kepler-mission-image-detectors/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft ready to ship to Florida", "date": "2008-12-30", "content": "Engineers are getting ready to pack NASA's Kepler spacecraft into a container and ship it off to its launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, where the launch is scheduled for March 5, 2009. \"Kepler is ready to begin its journey to its launch site, and ultimately to space, where it will answer a question that has been pondered by humankind at least as long ago as the ancient Greeks,\" said James Fanson, the project manager for the mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.

If Earth-size planets are common in the habitable zone, Kepler could find dozens; if those planets are rare, Kepler might find none. In the end, the mission will be our first step toward answering a question posed by the ancient Greeks: are there other worlds like ours or are we alone? \"Finding that most stars have Earths implies that the conditions that support the development of life could be common throughout our galaxy,\" said William Borucki, Kepler's science principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. \"Finding few or no Earths indicates that we might be alone.\" The Kepler telescope is specially designed to detect the periodic dimming of stars that planets cause as they pass by. Some star systems are oriented in such a way that their planets cross in front of their stars, as seen from our Earthly point of view. As the planets pass by, they cause their stars' light to slightly dim, or wink. The telescope can detect even the faintest of these winks, registering changes in brightness of only 20 parts per million. To achieve this resolution, Kepler will use the largest camera ever launched into space, a 95-megapixel array of charged couple devices, known as CCDs. \"If Kepler were to look down at a small town on Earth at night from space, it would be able to detect the dimming of a porch light as somebody passed in front,\" said James Fanson, Kepler project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. By staring at one large patch of sky for the duration of its lifetime, Kepler will be able to watch planets periodically transit their stars over multiple cycles. This will allow astronomers to confirm the presence of planets. Earth-size planets in habitable zones would theoretically take about a year to complete one orbit, so Kepler will monitor those stars for at least three years to confirm the planets' presence. Ground-based telescopes and NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes will perform follow-up studies on the larger planets. \"Kepler is a critical cornerstone in understanding what types of planets are formed around other stars,\" said exoplanet hunter Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University in California. \"The discoveries that emerge will be used immediately to study the atmospheres of large, gas exoplanets with Spitzer. And the statistics that are compiled will help us chart a course toward one day imaging a pale blue dot like our planet, orbiting another star in our galaxy.\"", "url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219201411.htm"}, {"title": "Kepler Mission Rockets to Space in Search of Other Earths", "date": "2009-03-06", "content": "NASA's Kepler mission successfully launched into space from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II at 10:49 p.m. EST, Friday.

Neptune-size planets will most likely be found next, followed by rocky ones as small as Earth. The true Earth analogs -- Earth-sized planets orbiting stars like our sun at distances where surface water, and possibly life, could exist -- would take at least three years to discover and confirm. Ground-based telescopes also will contribute to the mission by verifying some of the finds.

Kepler initially will look at 140,000 stars, with project scientists paring the field of study down to 100,000 stars, Troeltzsch said. Building the NASA Discovery-classKepler has meant harnessing a trio of key capabilities: pointing accuracy, a very large field of view andlow-noise electronics to maximize the ability to read data from the sensitive detection system. \"It's avery sophisticated machine,\" Troeltzsch told Space News in a Dec. 16 interview. The technology toundertake Kepler was not available until just a few yearsago, he said, \"so we really are at the right place at the right time.\" Part ofthat opportune timing has been the increasing number ofextrasolar planets detected to date, most of which have been at least the size of Jupiter.

It is expected to find a variety of worlds, from large, gaseous ones, to rocky ones as small as Earth. The mission is the first with the ability to find planets like ours -- small, rocky planets orbiting sun-like stars in the habitable zone, where temperatures are right for possible lakes and oceans of water. To find the planets, Kepler will stare at one large expanse of sky for the duration of its lifetime, looking for periodic dips in starlight that occur as planets circle in front of their stars and partially block the light. Its 95-megapixel camera, the largest ever launched into space, can detect tiny changes in a star's brightness of only 20 parts per million.

Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. - the Boulder, Colo. - based NASA contractor responsible for developing the Kepler flight system and supporting mission operations - recently completed the spacecraft's final pre-ship checkout and delivered the spacecraft to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., for a March 5 liftoff on a Delta2 booster. \"In orderto find Earth-sized planets, you need to stare at the same place in space and look for dips in the light curve,\" said John Troeltzsch, Ball Aerospace program manager for civil space systems. Kepler initially will look at 140,000 stars, with project scientists paring the field of study down to 100,000 stars, Troeltzsch said. Building the NASA Discovery-classKepler has meant harnessing a trio of key capabilities: pointing accuracy, a very large field of view andlow-noise electronics to maximize the ability to read data from the sensitive detection system. \"It's avery sophisticated machine,\" Troeltzsch told Space News in a Dec. 16 interview. The technology toundertake Kepler was not available until just a few yearsago, he said, \"so we really are at the right place at the right time.\" Part ofthat opportune timing has been the increasing number ofextrasolar planets detected to date, most of which have been at least the size of Jupiter. Over its three and a half year mission, Kepler will attempt to detect planets 30 to 600 timessmaller than Jupiter. Given that Earth-sized worlds do exist around stars like the sun, Kepler is expected to be thefirst to find them, and the first to measure their frequency. Locating rocky worlds like Earth, including those that lie in a star's habitable zone, could mean identifying planets where liquid water, and perhaps life, could exist. Using a 0.95-meter diameter telescope and an array of 42 charge-coupled devices - thelight-sensitive microchips at the heart of the most common digital cameras - Kepler will measure the change in brightnessthat occurs when a planet transits across the face of its parent star. From that light fluctuation in starlight - and time between transits -scientists can determine the size of the planet, the size of the planet's orbit, andeven approximate the planet's temperature. \"What we're interested in are light curves over time,\" Troeltzsch said. \"There are nopretty pictures\" like Hubble Space Telescope images or Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations, he said, but Kepler is perfectly optimized for itssearch duties. \"I grew up watching 'Star Trek,' so I'm confident that there are a lot of planets out there,\" Troeltzsch said. \"If we get no result, that's going tobe just as profound.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/6308-kepler-spacecraft-hunt-earth-worlds.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission To Seek Other Earths", "date": "2009-02-20", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft is ready to be moved to the launch pad today and will soon begin a journey to search for worlds that could potentially host life. Kepler is scheduled to blast into space from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., aboard a Delta II rocket on March 5 at 7:48 p.m. Pacific Time (10:48 p.m. Eastern Time). It is the first mission with the ability to find planets like Earth -- rocky planets that orbit sun-like stars in a warm zone where liquid water could be maintained on the surface. Liquid water is believed to be essential for the formation of life. \"Kepler is a critical component in NASA's broader efforts to ultimately find and study planets where Earth-like conditions may be present,\" said Jon Morse, the Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The planetary census Kepler takes will be very important for understanding the frequency of Earth-size planets in our galaxy and planning future missions that directly detect and characterize such worlds around nearby stars.\" The mission will spend three-and-a-half years surveying more than 100,000 sun-like stars in the Cygnus-Lyra region of our Milky Way galaxy. It is expected to find hundreds of planets the size of Earth and larger at various distances from their stars. If Earth-size planets are common in the habitable zone, Kepler could find dozens; if those planets are rare, Kepler might find none. In the end, the mission will be our first step toward answering a question posed by the ancient Greeks: are there other worlds like ours or are we alone? \"Finding that most stars have Earths implies that the conditions that support the development of life could be common throughout our galaxy,\" said William Borucki, Kepler's science principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. \"Finding few or no Earths indicates that we might be alone.\" The Kepler telescope is specially designed to detect the periodic dimming of stars that planets cause as they pass by. Some star systems are oriented in such a way that their planets cross in front of their stars, as seen from our Earthly point of view. As the planets pass by, they cause their stars' light to slightly dim, or wink. The telescope can detect even the faintest of these winks, registering changes in brightness of only 20 parts per million. To achieve this resolution, Kepler will use the largest camera ever launched into space, a 95-megapixel array of charged couple devices, known as CCDs. \"If Kepler were to look down at a small town on Earth at night from space, it would be able to detect the dimming of a porch light as somebody passed in front,\" said James Fanson, Kepler project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. By staring at one large patch of sky for the duration of its lifetime, Kepler will be able to watch planets periodically transit their stars over multiple cycles. This will allow astronomers to confirm the presence of planets. Earth-size planets in habitable zones would theoretically take about a year to complete one orbit, so Kepler will monitor those stars for at least three years to confirm the planets' presence. Ground-based telescopes and NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes will perform follow-up studies on the larger planets. \"Kepler is a critical cornerstone in understanding what types of planets are formed around other stars,\" said exoplanet hunter Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University in California. \"The discoveries that emerge will be used immediately to study the atmospheres of large, gas exoplanets with Spitzer.

The discovery will be published Friday, Aug. 7, in the journal Science. The find is based on a relatively short 10 days of test data collected before the official start of science operations. Kepler was launched March 6, 2009, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The observation demonstrates the extremely high precision of the measurements made by the telescope, even before its calibration and data analysis software were finished. \"As NASA's first exoplanets mission, Kepler has made a dramatic entrance on the planet-hunting scene,\" said Jon Morse, director of the Science Mission Directorate's Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Detecting this planet's atmosphere in just the first 10 days of data is only a taste of things to come. The planet hunt is on!\" Kepler team members say these new data indicate the mission is indeed capable of finding Earth-like planets, if they exist. Kepler will spend the next three-and-a-half years searching for planets as small as Earth, including those that orbit stars in a warm zone where there could be water. It will do this by looking for periodic dips in the brightness of stars, which occur when orbiting planets transit, or cross in front of, the stars. \"When the light curves from tens of thousands of stars were shown to the Kepler science team, everyone was awed; no one had ever seen such exquisitely detailed measurements of the light variations of so many different types of stars,\" said William Borucki, the principal science investigator and lead author of the paper. The observations were collected from a planet called HAT-P-7, known to transit a star located about 1,000 light years from Earth. The planet orbits the star in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun. Its orbit, combined with a mass somewhat larger than the planet Jupiter, classifies this planet as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It is so close to its star, the planet is as hot as the glowing red heating element on a stove. The Kepler measurements show the transit from the previously detected HAT-P-7. However, these new measurements are so precise, they also show a smooth rise and fall of the light between transits caused by the changing phases of the planet, similar to those of our moon. This is a combination of both the light emitted from the planet and the light reflected off the planet. The smooth rise and fall of light is also punctuated by a small drop in light, called an occultation, exactly halfway between each transit. An occultation happens when a planet passes behind a star. The new Kepler data can be used to study this hot Jupiter in unprecedented detail. The depth of the occultation and the shape and amplitude of the light curve show the planet has an atmosphere with a day-side temperature of about 4,310 degrees Fahrenheit. Little of this heat is carried to the cool night side. The occultation time compared to the main transit time shows the planet has a circular orbit. The discovery of light from this planet confirms the predictions by researchers and theoretical models that the emission would be detectable by Kepler. This new discovery also demonstrates Kepler has the precision to find Earth-size planets. The observed brightness variation is just one and a half times what is expected for a transit caused by an Earth-sized planet. Although this is already the highest precision ever obtained for an observation of this star, Kepler will be even more precise after analysis software being developed for the mission is completed. \"This early result shows the Kepler detection system is performing right on the mark,\" said David Koch, deputy principal investigator of NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. \"It bodes well for Kepler's prospects to be able to detect Earth-size planets.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-discovery.html"}, {"title": "Kepler telescope makes quick discovery", "date": "2009-08-09", "content": "NASA's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery, and its science operations aren't even officially under way yet.

The mission's science instrument, called a photometer, contains the largest camera ever flown in space -- its 42 charge-coupled devices (CCDs) will detect slight dips in starlight, which occur when planets passing in front of their stars partially block the light from Kepler's view. The telescope's oval-shaped dust cover, measuring 1.7 meters by 1.3 meters (67 inches by 52 inches), protected the photometer from contamination before and after launch. The dust cover also blocked stray light from entering the telescope during launch -- light that could have damaged its sensitive detectors. In addition, the cover was important for calibrating the photometer. Images taken in the dark helped characterize noise coming from the instrument's electronics, and this noise will later be removed from the actual science data. \"Now the photometer can see the stars and will soon start the task of detecting the planets,\" said Kepler's Science Principal Investigator William Borucki at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. \"We have thoroughly measured the background noise so that our photometer can detect minute changes in a star's brightness caused by planets.\" At 7:13 p.m. PDT on April 7, engineers at Kepler's mission operations center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, Boulder, Colo., sent commands to pass an electrical current through a \"burn wire\" to break the wire and release a latch holding the cover closed. The spring-loaded cover swung open on a fly-away hinge, before drifting away from the spacecraft. The cover is now in its own orbit around the sun, similar to Kepler's sun-centric orbit. With the cover off, starlight is entering the photometer and being imaged onto its focal plane. Engineers will continue calibrating the instrument using images of stars for another several weeks, after which science observations will begin.

The new \"first light\" images show the mission's target patch of sky, a vast starry field in the Cygnus-Lyra region of our Milky Way galaxy. One image shows millions of stars in Kepler's full field of view, while two others zoom in on portions of the larger region. \"Kepler's first glimpse of the sky is awe-inspiring,\" said Lia LaPiana, Kepler's program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"To be able to see millions of stars in a single snapshot is simply breathtaking.\" One new image from Kepler shows its entire field of view -- a 100-square-degree portion of the sky, equivalent to two side-by-side dips of the Big Dipper. The regions contain an estimated 14 millions stars, more than 100,000 of which were selected as ideal candidates for planet hunting. Two other views focus on just one-thousandth of the full field of view. In one image, a cluster of stars located about 13,000 light-years from Earth, called NGC 6791, can be seen in the lower left corner. The other image zooms in on a region containing a star, called Tres-2, with a known Jupiter-like planet orbiting every 2.5 days. \"It's thrilling to see this treasure trove of stars,\" said William Borucki, science principal investigator for Kepler at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. \"We expect to find hundreds of planets circling those stars, and for the first time, we can look for Earth-size planets in the habitable zones around other stars like the sun.\" Kepler will spend the next three-and-a-half years searching more than 100,000 pre-selected stars for signs of planets. It is expected to find a variety of worlds, from large, gaseous ones, to rocky ones as small as Earth. The mission is the first with the ability to find planets like ours -- small, rocky planets orbiting sun-like stars in the habitable zone, where temperatures are right for possible lakes and oceans of water. To find the planets, Kepler will stare at one large expanse of sky for the duration of its lifetime, looking for periodic dips in starlight that occur as planets circle in front of their stars and partially block the light. Its 95-megapixel camera, the largest ever launched into space, can detect tiny changes in a star's brightness of only 20 parts per million. Images from the camera are intentionally blurred to minimize the number of bright stars that saturate the detectors. While some of the slightly saturated stars are candidates for planet searches, heavily saturated stars are not. \"Everything about Kepler has been optimized to find Earth-size planets,\" said James Fanson, Kepler's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Our images are road maps that will allow us, in a few years, to point to a star and say a world like ours is there.\" Scientists and engineers will spend the next few weeks calibrating Kepler's science instrument, the photometer, and adjusting the telescope's alignment to achieve the best focus. Once these steps are complete, the planet hunt will begin. \"We've spent years designing this mission, so actually being able to see through its eyes is tremendously exciting,\" said Eric Bachtell, the lead Kepler systems engineer at Ball Aerospace & Technology Corp. in Boulder, Colo. Bachtell has been working on the design, development and testing of Kepler for nine years. Kepler is a NASA Discovery mission.

Kepler was launched March 6, 2009, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The observations were collected from a planet called HAT-P-7, known to transit a star located about 1,000 light years from Earth. The planet orbits the star in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun. Its orbit, combined with a mass somewhat larger than the planet Jupiter, classifies this planet as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It is so close to its star, the planet is as hot as the glowing red heating element on a stove. The Kepler measurements show the transit from the previously detected HAT-P-7. However, these new measurements are so precise, they also show a smooth rise and fall of the light between transits caused by the changing phases of the planet, similar to those of our moon. This is a combination of both the light emitted from the planet and the light reflected off the planet. The smooth rise and fall of light is also punctuated by a small drop in light, called an occultation, exactly halfway between each transit. An occultation happens when a planet passes behind a star. The new Kepler data can be used to study this hot Jupiter in unprecedented detail. The depth of the occultation and the shape and amplitude of the light curve show the planet has an atmosphere with a day-side temperature of about 4,310 degrees Fahrenheit. Little of this heat is carried to the cool night side. The occultation time compared to the main transit time shows the planet has a circular orbit. The discovery of light from this planet confirms the predictions by researchers and theoretical models that the emission would be detectable by Kepler. This new discovery also demonstrates Kepler has the precision to find Earth-size planets. The observed brightness variation is just one and a half times what is expected for a transit caused by an Earth-sized planet.

The planet orbits the star in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun. Its orbit, combined with a mass somewhat larger than the planet Jupiter, classifies this planet as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It is so close to its star, the planet is as hot as the glowing red heating element on a stove. The Kepler measurements show the transit from the previously detected HAT-P-7. However, these new measurements are so precise, they also show a smooth rise and fall of the light between transits caused by the changing phases of the planet, similar to those of our moon. This is a combination of both the light emitted from the planet and the light reflected off the planet. The smooth rise and fall of light is also punctuated by a small drop in light, called an occultation, exactly halfway between each transit. An occultation happens when a planet passes behind a star. The new Kepler data can be used to study this hot Jupiter in unprecedented detail. The depth of the occultation and the shape and amplitude of the light curve show the planet has an atmosphere with a day-side temperature of about 4,310 degrees Fahrenheit. Little of this heat is carried to the cool night side. The occultation time compared to the main transit time shows the planet has a circular orbit. The discovery of light from this planet confirms the predictions by researchers and theoretical models that the emission would be detectable by Kepler. This new discovery also demonstrates Kepler has the precision to find Earth-size planets. The observed brightness variation is just one and a half times what is expected for a transit caused by an Earth-sized planet. Although this is already the highest precision ever obtained for an observation of this star, Kepler will be even more precise after analysis software being developed for the mission is completed. \"This early result shows the Kepler detection system is performing right on the mark,\" said David Koch, deputy principal investigator of NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. \"It bodes well for Kepler's prospects to be able to detect Earth-size planets.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-discovery.html"}, {"title": "Kepler telescope makes quick discovery", "date": "2009-08-09", "content": "NASA's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery, and its science operations aren't even officially under way yet.

Kepler Spacecraft Finds 750 Exoplanet Candidates", "date": "2010-06-15", "content": "The Kepler spacecraft has found over 750 candidates for extrasolar planets, and that is just from data collected in the first 43 days of the spacecraft's observations. \"This is the biggest release of candidate planets that has ever happened,\" said William Borucki, Kepler's lead scientist. \"The number of candidate planets is actually greater than all the planets that have been discovered in the last 15 years.\" This is an astounding amount of potential exoplanets from data taken during such a short period of time, however Borucki added that they expect only about 50% of these candidates to actually turn out to be planets, as some may be eclipsing binary stars or other artifacts in the data. But still, even half would be the biggest group discovery of exoplanets ever. And the exciting part is that 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates with sizes from as small as Earth to around the size of Jupiter. The team says the majority have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The Kepler team has found so many candidates, they are sharing. They will keep the top 400 candidates to verify and confirm with observations using other telescopes - with observations done by Kepler team members. And today they have released the other 350 candidates, including five potential multiple planet systems. However, some astronomers are upset about this and think the Kepler team should release all of their findings from the first year, as is typically done with NASA data. Kepler launched on March 6, 2009, and has been on the hunt for exoplanets. Of course, the holy grail is finding an Earth-like or Earth-sized planet, especially those in the habitable zone of stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. In the spring of 2009 the Kepler Mission conducted high precision photometry on nearly 156,000 stars to detect the frequency and characteristics of small exoplanets. Kepler studied an area in the constellation Cygnus, looking for the small changes in light that would signal a planet passing in front of its star.

Two months ago today, Kepler scientists jubilantly announced the discovery of five exoplanets (planets located beyond our solar system) named Kepler 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b.

The Kepler Mission is designed to observe more than 150,000 stars continuously and simultaneously for signs of Earth-size planets until at least November 2012.

When planets cross in front of, or transit, their stars, they periodically block the starlight as seen from Earth.

The transit signatures of two distinct planets were seen in the data for the sun-like star designated Kepler-9. The planets were named Kepler-9b and 9c. The discovery incorporates seven months of observations of more than 156,000 stars as part of an ongoing search for Earth-sized planets outside our solar system. The findings will be published in Thursday's issue of the journal Science. Kepler's ultra-precise camera measures tiny decreases in the stars' brightness that occur when a planet transits them. The size of the planet can be derived from these temporary dips. The distance of the planet from the star can be calculated by measuring the time between successive dips as the planet orbits the star. Small variations in the regularity of these dips can be used to determine the masses of planets and detect other non-transiting planets in the system. In June, mission scientists submitted findings for peer review that identified more than 700 planet candidates in the first 43 days of Kepler data. The data included five additional candidate systems that appear to exhibit more than one transiting planet. The Kepler team recently identified a sixth target exhibiting multiple transits and accumulated enough follow-up data to confirm this multi-planet system. \"Kepler's high quality data and round-the-clock coverage of transiting objects enable a whole host of unique measurements to be made of the parent stars and their planetary systems,\" said Doug Hudgins, the Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Scientists refined the estimates of the masses of the planets using observations from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

Kepler-9b lies closest to the star with an orbit of about 19 days, while Kepler-9c has an orbit of about 38 days. By observing several transits by each planet over the seven months of data, the time between successive transits could be analyzed. \"This discovery is the first clear detection of significant changes in the intervals from one planetary transit to the next, what we call transit timing variations,\" said Matthew Holman, a Kepler mission scientist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. \"This is evidence of the gravitational interaction between the two planets as seen by the Kepler spacecraft.\" In addition to the two confirmed giant planets, Kepler scientists also have identified what appears to be a third, much smaller transit signature in the observations of Kepler-9.

They will keep the top 400 candidates to verify and confirm with observations using other telescopes - with observations done by Kepler team members.

However, some astronomers are upset about this and think the Kepler team should release all of their findings from the first year, as is typically done with NASA data. Kepler launched on March 6, 2009, and has been on the hunt for exoplanets. Of course, the holy grail is finding an Earth-like or Earth-sized planet, especially those in the habitable zone of stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. In the spring of 2009 the Kepler Mission conducted high precision photometry on nearly 156,000 stars to detect the frequency and characteristics of small exoplanets. Kepler studied an area in the constellation Cygnus, looking for the small changes in light that would signal a planet passing in front of its star. But it takes time to verify candidates and find out if they are actually exoplanets. Usually, confirming the transit of an extrasolar planet requires observations of three different transits. While NASA's policy requires astronomers to release their data from NASA instruments in a year, the Kepler team has worked out an agreement with the space agency so they can keep a certain portion of their data until they actually have time to verify this huge amount of exoplanet data. Between launch delays of other telescopes, cloudy nights for Earth based telescopes, and viewing a part of the sky that is only visible from the ground from April until September, they haven't had the observing time they needed to check out all their planet candidates. The extension of the deadline gives the Kepler team the time to make sure they have gone through and found all the false positives and other potential misinterpretations of the Kepler data. Dennis Overbye in the New York Times has written an article that delves more deeply into this little controversy. What is propriety data, and what is public? It's a tough argument either way: scientists who have put years of their life into building a spacecraft should have the time they need to verify their data. But others feel the science should be open and available, and a policy is a policy: the deadline for releasing the data is here.

The observations show Kepler-9b is the larger of the two planets, and both have masses similar to but less than Saturn. Kepler-9b lies closest to the star with an orbit of about 19 days, while Kepler-9c has an orbit of about 38 days. By observing several transits by each planet over the seven months of data, the time between successive transits could be analyzed. \"This discovery is the first clear detection of significant changes in the intervals from one planetary transit to the next, what we call transit timing variations,\" said Matthew Holman, a Kepler mission scientist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. \"This is evidence of the gravitational interaction between the two planets as seen by the Kepler spacecraft.\" In addition to the two confirmed giant planets, Kepler scientists also have identified what appears to be a third, much smaller transit signature in the observations of Kepler-9. That signature is consistent with the transits of a super-Earth-sized planet about 1.5 times the radius of Earth in a scorching, near-sun 1.6 day-orbit. Additional observations are required to determine whether this signal is indeed a planet or an astronomical phenomenon that mimics the appearance of a transit.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/two_planet_orbit.html"}, {"title": "Starquakes hold secrets of stellar evolution", "date": "2010-10-27", "content": "A NASA spacecraft designed to seek out alien worlds has also revealed new details about the structure and evolution of stars, and should help astronomers better understand the future of our own sun, researchers announced Oct. 26.

The potential planets Kepler has located range from worlds a bit smaller than Earth all the way up to giants several times the size of Jupiter. Similarly, some of the host stars are several times as large as the sun whereas some are much smaller. Follow-up and validation will be required before astronomers can firmly proclaim that the candidates are real planets and not some other phenomenon tricking Kepler's electronic eye. In the meantime, a member of the Kepler team has assembled a visualization of all the promising objects seen so far by the telescope-a variety of stars partially shadowed by a variety of likely planets. (Kepler spots exoplanets by tracking more than 150,000 stars, watching each for slight but periodic dimming that might indicate the presence of an orbiting companion passing in front of the star. The goal is to locate potentially habitable Earth-like worlds.) To make the image above, Jason Rowe of NASA Ames Research Center laid out by size all of the stars in Kepler's field of view that appear to host planets, along with tiny dark spots to indicate the relative size of the planetary candidate (or candidates) in orbit there. All stars and planets are to scale. The lone star in the upper right is not in Kepler's field of view; it is included for comparison only. That star is the sun; the dark shadow on its face is Jupiter. In an enlarged version of Rowe's solar diagram the tiny shadow of Earth is visible as well. That graphic makes plain the difficulty of Kepler's task-to identify Earth-size worlds orbiting sunlike stars only by the minuscule dimming effects those planets have on the much larger stars. But the mission is well on its way, and may in just a few years' time have identified the first Earth twins outside the solar system.", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/gallery/planet-palooza-visualization-reveals-panoply-of-the-kepler-space-telescopes-exoplanet-haul/"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler: Updated Census of Sun-like Stars", "date": "2011-04-11", "content": "NASA's Kepler Mission has detected changes in brightness in 500 sun-like stars, giving astronomers a much better idea about the nature and evolution of the stars. Prior to Kepler's launch in March 2009, astronomers had identified the changes in brightness, or oscillations, of about 25 stars similar to our sun in size, age, composition and location within the Milky Way galaxy. The discoveries are reported in a paper, \"Ensemble Asteroseismology of Solar-Type Stars with the NASA Kepler Mission,\" in the April 8 issue of the journal Science. The lead author of the paper is Bill Chaplin of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. The paper says Kepler is a big boost to asteroseismology, the study of stars by observations of their natural oscillations. Those oscillations provide clues about star basics such as mass, radius and age as well as clues about the internal structure of stars. \"This helps us understand more about the formation of stars and how they evolve,\" said Steve Kawaler, an Iowa State University professor of physics and astronomy, a co-author of the paper and a leader of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation. \"These new observations allow us to measure the detailed properties of stars at an accuracy that wasn't possible before.\" The Kepler spacecraft is orbiting the sun carrying a photometer, or light meter, to measure changes in star brightness. The photometer includes a telescope 37 inches in diameter connected to a 95 megapixel CCD camera. The instrument is continually pointed at the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way. It is expected to continuously observe about 170,000 stars for at least three and a half years. Kepler's primary job is to use tiny variations in the brightness of the stars within its view to find earth-like planets that might be able to support life. The Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation is using Kepler data to study different kinds of stars. The investigation is led by a four-member steering committee: Kawaler, Chair Ron Gilliland of the Space Telescope Science Institute based in Baltimore, Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard and Hans Kjeldsen, both of Aarhus University in Denmark. Kepler has provided astronomers with so much new information, the Science paper says they're \"entering a golden era for stellar physics.\" Data from 500 sun-like stars gives astronomers a much better understanding of the stars, their properties and their evolution. It also gives astronomers data to test their theories, models and predictions about the stars and the galaxy. And it gives astronomers enough data to make meaningful statistical studies of the stars. \"But this is just the start of things,\" Kawaler said. \"This is a first broad-brush analysis of the data we've seen. This is a preview of this new tool and the kind of detailed census that we'll be able to do.\" Among the projects to come, according to the Science paper, are studies to determine the ages of all these sun-like stars and studies of the host stars of the earth-like planets discovered by Kepler.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/nasas-kepler-updated-census-of-sun-like-stars/"}, {"title": "NASA Kepler Reaching into the Stars", "date": "2011-04-12", "content": "We are entering a golden era for \"stellar physics\" - a term coined to describe research about the formation, evolution, interior and the atmospheres of stars. Thanks to a partnership forged among stellar astrophysics, scientists and NASA's Kepler Mission, a goldmine of data is now available to support the world's efforts to detect planets in the habitable zone around other stars. The Kepler photometric data is a measurement of light's \"brightness,\" and provides an unprecedented opportunity for the emerging field of asteroseismology, the study of the internal structure of stars by observing minuscule pulsations in the star brightness. Asteroseismic research is giving insights into the fundamental properties of stars, including their mass, size, age and internal structure. Kepler enables studies of a large number of stars representing a broad range of types. This asteroseismic research will substantially improve our understanding of stellar evolution. It also will help determine the properties of stars that have planetary systems studied in the Kepler exoplanet program. The Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC) pushes the envelope in this field of study. Using the unparalleled precision and quality of Kepler data, the KASC research is contributing to stellar astrophysics in profound ways. The consortium is comprised of more than 400 scientists and is led by the Danish Asteroseismology Centre in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. The KASC recently presented new findings published in three papers in the journal Science. In combination, these latest results illustrate the power of the Kepler Space Telescope to probe the internal structure of distant stars. Kepler Listens to an Orchestra of Sun-like Stars to Tune the Galactic Models: The scientific investigation of sun-like stars has taken a major step forward thanks to the Kepler Mission. In addition to searching for exoplanets, it is providing exquisite data on stellar oscillations. \"The sound inside the stars makes them ring or vibrate like musical instruments,\" said Bill Chaplin from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy, the lead author of this paper. \"If you measure the pitch of the notes produced by an instrument it can tell you how big the instrument is. The bigger the instrument is, the lower the pitch and deeper the sound. This is how we can tell how big a star is - from its stellar music.\" Oscillation measurements are used to accurately determine fundamental stellar properties like mass, size, and age. This is where theory meets observation. Scientists can synthesize a snapshot of our galaxy and all the stars it contains using models based on everything we know about how much raw material there is in our galaxy for building stars, what types of stars are made, how they evolve with time, and how long they live. They can then compare the properties of stars in this synthetic snapshot with the properties of the sun-like stars in the asteroseismic survey. In essence, the team has taken a census and compared it to predictions, and found that the sizes of the stars are consistent with the predictions, but the masses are not. The asteroseismic survey suggests that the number of low mass stars is slightly larger than expected. This work sends theoreticians back to refine their models and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the structure and evolution of stars in our galaxy. \"Before Kepler we had asteroseismic data on only about 20 such stars - We now have an orchestra of stars to play with,\" said Hans Kjeldsen from Aarhus from the Danish Asteroseismology Centre in Aarhus, who coordinates KASC. \"This opens up huge possibilities for probing stellar evolution and obtaining a clearer picture of the past and future of our own sun and how our galaxy, and others like it, has evolved over time. We can, for example, pick out stars that have the same mass of the sun but have different ages, to, in effect, follow the sun in time.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/reach_into_stars.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Triplet Stars Found by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope", "date": "2011-01-12", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft, an observatory originally designed to hunt for alien planets, has stumbled upon an intriguing discovery: a set of triplet stars circling a massive stellar parent.

This is where theory meets observation. Scientists can synthesize a snapshot of our galaxy and all the stars it contains using models based on everything we know about how much raw material there is in our galaxy for building stars, what types of stars are made, how they evolve with time, and how long they live. They can then compare the properties of stars in this synthetic snapshot with the properties of the sun-like stars in the asteroseismic survey. In essence, the team has taken a census and compared it to predictions, and found that the sizes of the stars are consistent with the predictions, but the masses are not. The asteroseismic survey suggests that the number of low mass stars is slightly larger than expected. This work sends theoreticians back to refine their models and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the structure and evolution of stars in our galaxy. \"Before Kepler we had asteroseismic data on only about 20 such stars - We now have an orchestra of stars to play with,\" said Hans Kjeldsen from Aarhus from the Danish Asteroseismology Centre in Aarhus, who coordinates KASC. \"This opens up huge possibilities for probing stellar evolution and obtaining a clearer picture of the past and future of our own sun and how our galaxy, and others like it, has evolved over time.

So many planets, so little time. Two years into a 3-1/2-year mission, NASA's Kepler spacecraft, hunting for planets orbiting some 165,000 stars in the constellation Cygnus, is uncovering planet candidates by the hundreds. Many of these inhabit multi-planet systems that are unexpectedly flat - the inclination of the planets' orbits within each of these systems are essentially the same, a feature that may hold clues about how these systems formed and evolved. Not only is the team uncovering many more multi-planet systems than it had anticipated. But the systems hold the promise of allowing researchers to gain valuable information that can lead to an initial estimation of each planet's density and hence it's bulk composition - is it rocky, a water world, or something else? And they potentially can estimate these traits more quickly than previously thought.These multi-planet-system discoveries \"are very important to the success of the mission,\" said David Latham, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., and a member of the Kepler team. He spoke at a briefing May 23 at the American Astronomical Society's spring meeting underway in Boston. Kepler's ultimate goal is to gather a census of Earth-mass planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars - orbits at distances where the star warms a planet just enough to allow liquid water to remain stable on the surface. So far, the planets Kepler is finding are well inside that zone, where hot is the order of the day. Spitzer telescope helps confirm find: One of these is Kepler 10c, a new planet orbiting a 10-billion-year-old sun-like star some 564 light years from Earth. The team announced the discovery of its sibling, Kepler 10b, in January. This earlier discovery was striking because at 1.4 times Earth's mass, 10b was the smallest rocky planet found to date. Evidence for 10c turned out to be buried in 10b's discovery data - the fluctuations in the host star's light as the planet briefly eclipsed, or transited, the star with each orbit. But 10c didn't emerge as a strong planet candidate until the team used a second space telescope - NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory that is orbiting Earth - to track the dip the planet imposed on the star's light. The case for 10c's candidacy resulted from this dual observation, in which the dip in light the two spacecraft recorded was able to rule out the possibility that 10c had been another, perhaps dimmer, star. Comparing the data with what one might expect to see with a binary-star system rather then a planetary system, the team is 99.9998 percent certain they have a planet, according to Francois Fressin, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics. Many multi-planet systems found: The most striking multi-planet system so far is a system dubbed Kepler 11, whose discovery the team announced in February. Its six planets are orbiting a yellow dwarf star some 2,000 light years from Earth. These planets have been confirmed as such, and they seem to be made mostly of rock by mass, although gas appears to take up most of their volume. But Kepler's cosmic census-takers have found far more of these than anticipated. Of 1,235 planet candidates reported so far, 408 are divvied up among 107 multi-planet systems. \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many.... We thought we might see two or three,\" Dr. Latham says. Given the candidates found so far, it looks as though the number of planets of Neptune's mass or less are the most common, while planets with Jupiter's heft or greater are less common, although they are easier to find, Latham says. As the team gathers more data, it's becoming clear that it is discovering new tools for turning observations into results. Up to now, for instance, the team has relied on ground-based telescopes to use a second planet-detection method to confirm that a transit that Kepler spots is indeed the result of a planet eclipsing its host star. With ground-based telescopes, it takes time to carry out the observations needed for those confirmations. Kepler is observing its patch of the sky in Cygnus 24/7/365. But the big telescopes needed to confirm Kepler's observations tend to be in the Northern Hemisphere, whose night sky Cygnus vacates for part of the year. Telescopes such as Spitzer can conduct follow-up transit observations more quickly. In other cases, Kepler data themselves are opening the possibility for new tools - \"Kepler helping itself,\" as astrophysicist Soren Meibom describes it. Dr. Meibom, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and a Kepler team member, is working with Kepler data to develop a more-precise way of telling how old stars are in Kepler's field of view. Essentially, his team is using a star's rotation rate as a clock. Star's age impacts chance for life: The issue bears directly on the chance that an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of another star could harbor life. If a star is a billion years old, don't bet on much more than microbes. At 3 billion years, far more complex life could be present, but not so developed that it could phone home. At 4.6 billion years, however, life could evolve into technologically advanced civilizations, if Earth is any indication. But \"determining the age of a star is one of the most difficult tasks in astronomy; stars don't have birth certificates,\" Meibom says. The problem: After a sun-like star's first 500 million years or so, its mass, brightness, and temperature don't change much until billions of years later, when it teeters on the brink of its self-destruction, explains Dr. Meibom, But a star's rotation rate does slow with time as its stellar wind carries off material, in effect acting like the spinning ice skater who extends his or her arms to slow the spin. Astronomers can track a star's rotation by patterns in the periodic dimming that occurs with the coming and going of dark patches on stars - essentially their equivalents of sunspots. Younger stars tend to have larger spots and rotate faster than older stars, so their dimming is deeper and more frequent than that in older stars. Kepler scientists are using stars in star clusters of known ages to build a temporal yardstick for determining the ages of the stars that host planets.", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0523/Surprise-find-in-Kepler-planet-hunt-lots-of-multi-planet-systems"}, {"title": "The Kepler spacecraft's astounding haul of multiple-planet systems", "date": "2011-05-24", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft is proving itself to be a prolific planet hunter. Within just the first four months of data, astronomers have found evidence for more than 1,200 planetary candidates. Of those, 408 reside in systems containing two or more planets, and most of those look very different than our solar system. In particular, the Kepler systems with multiple planets are much flatter than our solar system. They have to be for Kepler to spot them. Kepler watches for a planet to cross in front of its star, blocking a tiny fraction of the star's light. By measuring how much the star dims during such a transit, astronomers can calculate the planet's size, and by observing the time between successive events they can derive the orbital period - how long it takes the planet to revolve around its star. To see a transit, the planet's orbit must be edge-on to our line of sight. To see multiple transiting planets, they all must be edge-on (or nearly so). \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many multiple-transit systems. We thought we might see two or three. Instead, we found more than 100,\" said Smithsonian astronomer David Latham (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). Latham presented the findings on Monday, May 23 in a press conference at the 218th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. In our solar system, some planet orbits are tilted by up to 7 degrees, meaning that an alien astronomer looking for transits wouldn't be able to detect all eight planets. (In particular, they would miss Mercury and Venus.) The systems spotted by Kepler are much flatter, with orbits tilted less than 1 degree. Why are they so flat? One clue comes from the planets themselves. The multiplanet systems found by Kepler are dominated by planets smaller than Neptune. They lack Jupiter-sized gas giants. Scientists believe that a gas giant's powerful gravity tends to disrupt planetary systems, tilting the orbits of neighboring worlds. \"Jupiters are the 800-pound gorillas stirring things up during the early history of these systems,\" explained Latham. \"Other studies have found plenty of systems with big planets, but they're not flat.\" Multiple-planet systems may offer a chance for confirming the densities of small, rocky worlds. The more massive a planet, the easier it is to detect using radial velocity measurements (essentially the star's wobble as a planet's gravity tugs it). Earth-sized worlds in Earth-sized orbits aren't massive enough to make a radial velocity signal that's detectable with present technology. In systems with more than one transiting planet, astronomers have another option: transit timing variations. They can measure how the time between successive transits changes from orbit to orbit due to mutual gravitational interactions between the planets. The size of the effect depends on the planets' masses. \"These planets are pulling and pushing on each other, and we can measure that,\" said Smithsonian astronomer Matthew Holman. \"Dozens of the systems Kepler found show signs of transit timing variations.\" As Kepler continues to gather data, it will be able to spot planets with wider orbits, including some in the habitable zones of their stars. Transit timing variations may play a key role in confirming the first rocky planets with the right temperature for water to be liquid on their surfaces.

The existence of this planet was suspected previously, but new analytical techniques were needed to confirm its existence. The Kepler Telescope team has found a new rocky planet, one they describe as a \"scorched, molten Earth.\" The planet is about 2 times the size of Earth, and is very close to the Sun-like star Kepler-10, completing an orbit in only 45 days. Being so close to its sun, the blazing-hot new planet is not expected to have any liquid water or life as we know it. The star Kepler-10 is located 564 light-years away, in the Draco constellation (although it is not bright enough to be seen with the naked eye). Named Kepler-10c, the new planet's existence was suspected when the Kepler team announced earlier this year that they'd found Kepler-10 b, a terrestrial planet orbiting the same star. However, the data was not conclusive enough for scientists to feel certain that what they were seeing was due to a planet. A new technique was required to rule out other possibilities. The Kepler telescope looks at dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of a star from our point of view -- an event called a planetary transit. But other objects, such as stars, can also pass in front of the observed star and block the light. To be sure the transit was not caused by eclipsing stars, the Kepler team combined a new computer simulation technique called \"Blender\" with infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Blender is light-curve fitting software that allows the scientists to rule out other possible causes of the dip in starlight. When astronomers are observing a star, the total light emitted by the star over time can be represented as a relatively flat line. A short-lived dip in this line, called a light curve, indicates some of the light has been blocked briefly. \"We try to exhaustively look at all the things that could cause a light curve,\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a member of the Kepler team. Blender results show that only a very small fraction of other objects can reproduce the exact same kind of light-curve as a planet. This helps give the scientists confidence that the light curve they are witnessing is due to the new planet Kepler-10c rather than something else. Fressin said that the Blender method can be used to help the Kepler team figure out if any of the 1,235 candidates they have found so far are rocky planets like the Earth. Bill Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, said hundreds more planet candidates are expected to be found before the end of the three-year mission. However, he noted that the Kepler team won't release more data sets until June 2012 because they need more time to observe the stars and rule out other explanations for the changes in starlight. Kepler's main goal is to discover how common are Earths in habitable zones around Sun-like stars.

Using high precision brightness measurements taken by the Kepler spacecraft, scientists have been able to distinguish profound differences inside the cores of stars that otherwise look the same on the surface. The discovery, published in the latest edition of the journal Nature and made possible by observations using NASA's powerful Kepler space telescope, is shedding new light on the evolution of stars, including our own sun. The paper's lead author, the University of Sydney's Professor Tim Bedding, explains, \"Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores that powers nuclear fusion, and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Towards the end of their lives, red giants begin burning the helium in their cores.\" The Kepler space telescope has allowed Professor Bedding and colleagues to continuously study starlight from hundreds of red giants at an unprecedented level of precision for nearly a year, opening up a window into the stars' cores. \"The changes in brightness at a star's surface is a result of turbulent motions inside that cause continuous star-quakes, creating sound waves that travel down through the interior and back to the surface,\" Professor Bedding said. \"Under the right conditions, these waves interact with other waves trapped inside the star's helium core. It is these 'mixed' oscillation modes that are the key to understanding a star's particular life stage. By carefully measuring very subtle features of the oscillations in a star's brightness, we can see that some stars have run out of hydrogen in the center and are now burning helium, and are therefore at a later stage of life.\" Astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, in a companion piece in the same Nature issue which highlights the discovery's significance, compares red giants to Hollywood stars, whose age is not always obvious from the surface. \"During certain phases in a star's life, its size and brightness are remarkably constant, even while profound transformations are taking place deep inside.\" Professor Bedding and his colleagues work in an expanding field called asteroseismology. \"In the same way that geologists use earthquakes to explore Earth's interior, we use star quakes to explore the internal structure of stars,\" he explained. Professor Bedding said: \"We are very excited about the results. We had some idea from theoretical models that these subtle oscillation patterns would be there, but this confirms our models. It allows us to tell red giants apart, and we will be able to compare the fraction of stars that are at the different stages of evolution in a way that we couldn't before.\" Daniel Huber, a PhD student working with Professor Bedding, added: \"This shows how wonderful the Kepler satellite really is.

They can then compare the properties of stars in this synthetic snapshot with the properties of the sun-like stars in the asteroseismic survey.

Two years into a 3-1/2-year mission, NASA's Kepler spacecraft, hunting for planets orbiting some 165,000 stars in the constellation Cygnus, is uncovering planet candidates by the hundreds. Many of these inhabit multi-planet systems that are unexpectedly flat - the inclination of the planets' orbits within each of these systems are essentially the same, a feature that may hold clues about how these systems formed and evolved. Not only is the team uncovering many more multi-planet systems than it had anticipated.

He spoke at a briefing May 23 at the American Astronomical Society's spring meeting underway in Boston. Kepler's ultimate goal is to gather a census of Earth-mass planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars - orbits at distances where the star warms a planet just enough to allow liquid water to remain stable on the surface. So far, the planets Kepler is finding are well inside that zone, where hot is the order of the day. Spitzer telescope helps confirm find: One of these is Kepler 10c, a new planet orbiting a 10-billion-year-old sun-like star some 564 light years from Earth. The team announced the discovery of its sibling, Kepler 10b, in January. This earlier discovery was striking because at 1.4 times Earth's mass, 10b was the smallest rocky planet found to date. Evidence for 10c turned out to be buried in 10b's discovery data - the fluctuations in the host star's light as the planet briefly eclipsed, or transited, the star with each orbit. But 10c didn't emerge as a strong planet candidate until the team used a second space telescope - NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory that is orbiting Earth - to track the dip the planet imposed on the star's light. The case for 10c's candidacy resulted from this dual observation, in which the dip in light the two spacecraft recorded was able to rule out the possibility that 10c had been another, perhaps dimmer, star. Comparing the data with what one might expect to see with a binary-star system rather then a planetary system, the team is 99.9998 percent certain they have a planet, according to Francois Fressin, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics. Many multi-planet systems found: The most striking multi-planet system so far is a system dubbed Kepler 11, whose discovery the team announced in February. Its six planets are orbiting a yellow dwarf star some 2,000 light years from Earth. These planets have been confirmed as such, and they seem to be made mostly of rock by mass, although gas appears to take up most of their volume. But Kepler's cosmic census-takers have found far more of these than anticipated. Of 1,235 planet candidates reported so far, 408 are divvied up among 107 multi-planet systems. \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many.... We thought we might see two or three,\" Dr. Latham says. Given the candidates found so far, it looks as though the number of planets of Neptune's mass or less are the most common, while planets with Jupiter's heft or greater are less common, although they are easier to find, Latham says. As the team gathers more data, it's becoming clear that it is discovering new tools for turning observations into results. Up to now, for instance, the team has relied on ground-based telescopes to use a second planet-detection method to confirm that a transit that Kepler spots is indeed the result of a planet eclipsing its host star. With ground-based telescopes, it takes time to carry out the observations needed for those confirmations. Kepler is observing its patch of the sky in Cygnus 24/7/365. But the big telescopes needed to confirm Kepler's observations tend to be in the Northern Hemisphere, whose night sky Cygnus vacates for part of the year. Telescopes such as Spitzer can conduct follow-up transit observations more quickly. In other cases, Kepler data themselves are opening the possibility for new tools - \"Kepler helping itself,\" as astrophysicist Soren Meibom describes it. Dr. Meibom, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and a Kepler team member, is working with Kepler data to develop a more-precise way of telling how old stars are in Kepler's field of view. Essentially, his team is using a star's rotation rate as a clock. Star's age impacts chance for life: The issue bears directly on the chance that an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of another star could harbor life. If a star is a billion years old, don't bet on much more than microbes. At 3 billion years, far more complex life could be present, but not so developed that it could phone home. At 4.6 billion years, however, life could evolve into technologically advanced civilizations, if Earth is any indication. But \"determining the age of a star is one of the most difficult tasks in astronomy; stars don't have birth certificates,\" Meibom says. The problem: After a sun-like star's first 500 million years or so, its mass, brightness, and temperature don't change much until billions of years later, when it teeters on the brink of its self-destruction, explains Dr. Meibom, But a star's rotation rate does slow with time as its stellar wind carries off material, in effect acting like the spinning ice skater who extends his or her arms to slow the spin. Astronomers can track a star's rotation by patterns in the periodic dimming that occurs with the coming and going of dark patches on stars - essentially their equivalents of sunspots. Younger stars tend to have larger spots and rotate faster than older stars, so their dimming is deeper and more frequent than that in older stars. Kepler scientists are using stars in star clusters of known ages to build a temporal yardstick for determining the ages of the stars that host planets.", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0523/Surprise-find-in-Kepler-planet-hunt-lots-of-multi-planet-systems"}, {"title": "The Kepler spacecraft's astounding haul of multiple-planet systems", "date": "2011-05-24", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft is proving itself to be a prolific planet hunter. Within just the first four months of data, astronomers have found evidence for more than 1,200 planetary candidates. Of those, 408 reside in systems containing two or more planets, and most of those look very different than our solar system. In particular, the Kepler systems with multiple planets are much flatter than our solar system. They have to be for Kepler to spot them. Kepler watches for a planet to cross in front of its star, blocking a tiny fraction of the star's light. By measuring how much the star dims during such a transit, astronomers can calculate the planet's size, and by observing the time between successive events they can derive the orbital period - how long it takes the planet to revolve around its star. To see a transit, the planet's orbit must be edge-on to our line of sight. To see multiple transiting planets, they all must be edge-on (or nearly so). \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many multiple-transit systems. We thought we might see two or three. Instead, we found more than 100,\" said Smithsonian astronomer David Latham (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). Latham presented the findings on Monday, May 23 in a press conference at the 218th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. In our solar system, some planet orbits are tilted by up to 7 degrees, meaning that an alien astronomer looking for transits wouldn't be able to detect all eight planets. (In particular, they would miss Mercury and Venus.) The systems spotted by Kepler are much flatter, with orbits tilted less than 1 degree. Why are they so flat? One clue comes from the planets themselves. The multiplanet systems found by Kepler are dominated by planets smaller than Neptune. They lack Jupiter-sized gas giants. Scientists believe that a gas giant's powerful gravity tends to disrupt planetary systems, tilting the orbits of neighboring worlds. \"Jupiters are the 800-pound gorillas stirring things up during the early history of these systems,\" explained Latham. \"Other studies have found plenty of systems with big planets, but they're not flat.\" Multiple-planet systems may offer a chance for confirming the densities of small, rocky worlds. The more massive a planet, the easier it is to detect using radial velocity measurements (essentially the star's wobble as a planet's gravity tugs it). Earth-sized worlds in Earth-sized orbits aren't massive enough to make a radial velocity signal that's detectable with present technology. In systems with more than one transiting planet, astronomers have another option: transit timing variations. They can measure how the time between successive transits changes from orbit to orbit due to mutual gravitational interactions between the planets. The size of the effect depends on the planets' masses. \"These planets are pulling and pushing on each other, and we can measure that,\" said Smithsonian astronomer Matthew Holman. \"Dozens of the systems Kepler found show signs of transit timing variations.\" As Kepler continues to gather data, it will be able to spot planets with wider orbits, including some in the habitable zones of their stars. Transit timing variations may play a key role in confirming the first rocky planets with the right temperature for water to be liquid on their surfaces.

The existence of this planet was suspected previously, but new analytical techniques were needed to confirm its existence. The Kepler Telescope team has found a new rocky planet, one they describe as a \"scorched, molten Earth.\" The planet is about 2 times the size of Earth, and is very close to the Sun-like star Kepler-10, completing an orbit in only 45 days. Being so close to its sun, the blazing-hot new planet is not expected to have any liquid water or life as we know it. The star Kepler-10 is located 564 light-years away, in the Draco constellation (although it is not bright enough to be seen with the naked eye). Named Kepler-10c, the new planet's existence was suspected when the Kepler team announced earlier this year that they'd found Kepler-10 b, a terrestrial planet orbiting the same star. However, the data was not conclusive enough for scientists to feel certain that what they were seeing was due to a planet. A new technique was required to rule out other possibilities. The Kepler telescope looks at dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of a star from our point of view -- an event called a planetary transit. But other objects, such as stars, can also pass in front of the observed star and block the light. To be sure the transit was not caused by eclipsing stars, the Kepler team combined a new computer simulation technique called \"Blender\" with infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Blender is light-curve fitting software that allows the scientists to rule out other possible causes of the dip in starlight. When astronomers are observing a star, the total light emitted by the star over time can be represented as a relatively flat line. A short-lived dip in this line, called a light curve, indicates some of the light has been blocked briefly. \"We try to exhaustively look at all the things that could cause a light curve,\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a member of the Kepler team. Blender results show that only a very small fraction of other objects can reproduce the exact same kind of light-curve as a planet. This helps give the scientists confidence that the light curve they are witnessing is due to the new planet Kepler-10c rather than something else. Fressin said that the Blender method can be used to help the Kepler team figure out if any of the 1,235 candidates they have found so far are rocky planets like the Earth. Bill Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, said hundreds more planet candidates are expected to be found before the end of the three-year mission. However, he noted that the Kepler team won't release more data sets until June 2012 because they need more time to observe the stars and rule out other explanations for the changes in starlight. Kepler's main goal is to discover how common are Earths in habitable zones around Sun-like stars. Whether they are rare or common, once such worlds are located, astronomers can try to study them in order to learn whether they have alien life.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2011-05-rocky-world-kepler-multi-planet.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Helps Reveal the Inner Secrets of Giant Stars for the First Time", "date": "2011-03-31", "content": "University of Sydney astrophysicists are behind a major breakthrough in the study of the senior citizens of our galaxy: stars known as Red Giants. Using high precision brightness measurements taken by the Kepler spacecraft, scientists have been able to distinguish profound differences inside the cores of stars that otherwise look the same on the surface. The discovery, published in the latest edition of the journal Nature and made possible by observations using NASA's powerful Kepler space telescope, is shedding new light on the evolution of stars, including our own sun. The paper's lead author, the University of Sydney's Professor Tim Bedding, explains, \"Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores that powers nuclear fusion, and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Towards the end of their lives, red giants begin burning the helium in their cores.\" The Kepler space telescope has allowed Professor Bedding and colleagues to continuously study starlight from hundreds of red giants at an unprecedented level of precision for nearly a year, opening up a window into the stars' cores. \"The changes in brightness at a star's surface is a result of turbulent motions inside that cause continuous star-quakes, creating sound waves that travel down through the interior and back to the surface,\" Professor Bedding said. \"Under the right conditions, these waves interact with other waves trapped inside the star's helium core. It is these 'mixed' oscillation modes that are the key to understanding a star's particular life stage. By carefully measuring very subtle features of the oscillations in a star's brightness, we can see that some stars have run out of hydrogen in the center and are now burning helium, and are therefore at a later stage of life.\" Astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, in a companion piece in the same Nature issue which highlights the discovery's significance, compares red giants to Hollywood stars, whose age is not always obvious from the surface. \"During certain phases in a star's life, its size and brightness are remarkably constant, even while profound transformations are taking place deep inside.\" Professor Bedding and his colleagues work in an expanding field called asteroseismology. \"In the same way that geologists use earthquakes to explore Earth's interior, we use star quakes to explore the internal structure of stars,\" he explained. Professor Bedding said: \"We are very excited about the results. We had some idea from theoretical models that these subtle oscillation patterns would be there, but this confirms our models. It allows us to tell red giants apart, and we will be able to compare the fraction of stars that are at the different stages of evolution in a way that we couldn't before.\" Daniel Huber, a PhD student working with Professor Bedding, added: \"This shows how wonderful the Kepler satellite really is.

The potential planets Kepler has located range from worlds a bit smaller than Earth all the way up to giants several times the size of Jupiter. Similarly, some of the host stars are several times as large as the sun whereas some are much smaller. Follow-up and validation will be required before astronomers can firmly proclaim that the candidates are real planets and not some other phenomenon tricking Kepler's electronic eye. In the meantime, a member of the Kepler team has assembled a visualization of all the promising objects seen so far by the telescope-a variety of stars partially shadowed by a variety of likely planets. (Kepler spots exoplanets by tracking more than 150,000 stars, watching each for slight but periodic dimming that might indicate the presence of an orbiting companion passing in front of the star. The goal is to locate potentially habitable Earth-like worlds.) To make the image above, Jason Rowe of NASA Ames Research Center laid out by size all of the stars in Kepler's field of view that appear to host planets, along with tiny dark spots to indicate the relative size of the planetary candidate (or candidates) in orbit there. All stars and planets are to scale. The lone star in the upper right is not in Kepler's field of view; it is included for comparison only. That star is the sun; the dark shadow on its face is Jupiter. In an enlarged version of Rowe's solar diagram the tiny shadow of Earth is visible as well. That graphic makes plain the difficulty of Kepler's task-to identify Earth-size worlds orbiting sunlike stars only by the minuscule dimming effects those planets have on the much larger stars.

The lead author of the paper is Bill Chaplin of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. The paper says Kepler is a big boost to asteroseismology, the study of stars by observations of their natural oscillations. Those oscillations provide clues about star basics such as mass, radius and age as well as clues about the internal structure of stars. \"This helps us understand more about the formation of stars and how they evolve,\" said Steve Kawaler, an Iowa State University professor of physics and astronomy, a co-author of the paper and a leader of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation. \"These new observations allow us to measure the detailed properties of stars at an accuracy that wasn't possible before.\" The Kepler spacecraft is orbiting the sun carrying a photometer, or light meter, to measure changes in star brightness. The photometer includes a telescope 37 inches in diameter connected to a 95 megapixel CCD camera. The instrument is continually pointed at the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way.

Within just the first four months of data, astronomers have found evidence for more than 1,200 planetary candidates. Of those, 408 reside in systems containing two or more planets, and most of those look very different than our solar system. In particular, the Kepler systems with multiple planets are much flatter than our solar system. They have to be for Kepler to spot them. Kepler watches for a planet to cross in front of its star, blocking a tiny fraction of the star's light. By measuring how much the star dims during such a transit, astronomers can calculate the planet's size, and by observing the time between successive events they can derive the orbital period - how long it takes the planet to revolve around its star. To see a transit, the planet's orbit must be edge-on to our line of sight. To see multiple transiting planets, they all must be edge-on (or nearly so). \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many multiple-transit systems. We thought we might see two or three. Instead, we found more than 100,\" said Smithsonian astronomer David Latham (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). Latham presented the findings on Monday, May 23 in a press conference at the 218th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. In our solar system, some planet orbits are tilted by up to 7 degrees, meaning that an alien astronomer looking for transits wouldn't be able to detect all eight planets. (In particular, they would miss Mercury and Venus.) The systems spotted by Kepler are much flatter, with orbits tilted less than 1 degree. Why are they so flat? One clue comes from the planets themselves. The multiplanet systems found by Kepler are dominated by planets smaller than Neptune. They lack Jupiter-sized gas giants. Scientists believe that a gas giant's powerful gravity tends to disrupt planetary systems, tilting the orbits of neighboring worlds. \"Jupiters are the 800-pound gorillas stirring things up during the early history of these systems,\" explained Latham. \"Other studies have found plenty of systems with big planets, but they're not flat.\" Multiple-planet systems may offer a chance for confirming the densities of small, rocky worlds. The more massive a planet, the easier it is to detect using radial velocity measurements (essentially the star's wobble as a planet's gravity tugs it). Earth-sized worlds in Earth-sized orbits aren't massive enough to make a radial velocity signal that's detectable with present technology. In systems with more than one transiting planet, astronomers have another option: transit timing variations. They can measure how the time between successive transits changes from orbit to orbit due to mutual gravitational interactions between the planets. The size of the effect depends on the planets' masses. \"These planets are pulling and pushing on each other, and we can measure that,\" said Smithsonian astronomer Matthew Holman. \"Dozens of the systems Kepler found show signs of transit timing variations.\" As Kepler continues to gather data, it will be able to spot planets with wider orbits, including some in the habitable zones of their stars.

The existence of this planet was suspected previously, but new analytical techniques were needed to confirm its existence. The Kepler Telescope team has found a new rocky planet, one they describe as a \"scorched, molten Earth.\" The planet is about 2 times the size of Earth, and is very close to the Sun-like star Kepler-10, completing an orbit in only 45 days. Being so close to its sun, the blazing-hot new planet is not expected to have any liquid water or life as we know it. The star Kepler-10 is located 564 light-years away, in the Draco constellation (although it is not bright enough to be seen with the naked eye). Named Kepler-10c, the new planet's existence was suspected when the Kepler team announced earlier this year that they'd found Kepler-10 b, a terrestrial planet orbiting the same star. However, the data was not conclusive enough for scientists to feel certain that what they were seeing was due to a planet. A new technique was required to rule out other possibilities. The Kepler telescope looks at dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of a star from our point of view -- an event called a planetary transit. But other objects, such as stars, can also pass in front of the observed star and block the light. To be sure the transit was not caused by eclipsing stars, the Kepler team combined a new computer simulation technique called \"Blender\" with infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Blender is light-curve fitting software that allows the scientists to rule out other possible causes of the dip in starlight. When astronomers are observing a star, the total light emitted by the star over time can be represented as a relatively flat line. A short-lived dip in this line, called a light curve, indicates some of the light has been blocked briefly. \"We try to exhaustively look at all the things that could cause a light curve,\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a member of the Kepler team. Blender results show that only a very small fraction of other objects can reproduce the exact same kind of light-curve as a planet. This helps give the scientists confidence that the light curve they are witnessing is due to the new planet Kepler-10c rather than something else. Fressin said that the Blender method can be used to help the Kepler team figure out if any of the 1,235 candidates they have found so far are rocky planets like the Earth. Bill Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, said hundreds more planet candidates are expected to be found before the end of the three-year mission. However, he noted that the Kepler team won't release more data sets until June 2012 because they need more time to observe the stars and rule out other explanations for the changes in starlight.

The potential planets Kepler has located range from worlds a bit smaller than Earth all the way up to giants several times the size of Jupiter. Similarly, some of the host stars are several times as large as the sun whereas some are much smaller. Follow-up and validation will be required before astronomers can firmly proclaim that the candidates are real planets and not some other phenomenon tricking Kepler's electronic eye. In the meantime, a member of the Kepler team has assembled a visualization of all the promising objects seen so far by the telescope-a variety of stars partially shadowed by a variety of likely planets. (Kepler spots exoplanets by tracking more than 150,000 stars, watching each for slight but periodic dimming that might indicate the presence of an orbiting companion passing in front of the star. The goal is to locate potentially habitable Earth-like worlds.) To make the image above, Jason Rowe of NASA Ames Research Center laid out by size all of the stars in Kepler's field of view that appear to host planets, along with tiny dark spots to indicate the relative size of the planetary candidate (or candidates) in orbit there. All stars and planets are to scale. The lone star in the upper right is not in Kepler's field of view; it is included for comparison only. That star is the sun; the dark shadow on its face is Jupiter. In an enlarged version of Rowe's solar diagram the tiny shadow of Earth is visible as well. That graphic makes plain the difficulty of Kepler's task-to identify Earth-size worlds orbiting sunlike stars only by the minuscule dimming effects those planets have on the much larger stars.

Prior to Kepler's launch in March 2009, astronomers had identified the changes in brightness, or oscillations, of about 25 stars similar to our sun in size, age, composition and location within the Milky Way galaxy. The discoveries are reported in a paper, \"Ensemble Asteroseismology of Solar-Type Stars with the NASA Kepler Mission,\" in the April 8 issue of the journal Science. The lead author of the paper is Bill Chaplin of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. The paper says Kepler is a big boost to asteroseismology, the study of stars by observations of their natural oscillations. Those oscillations provide clues about star basics such as mass, radius and age as well as clues about the internal structure of stars. \"This helps us understand more about the formation of stars and how they evolve,\" said Steve Kawaler, an Iowa State University professor of physics and astronomy, a co-author of the paper and a leader of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation. \"These new observations allow us to measure the detailed properties of stars at an accuracy that wasn't possible before.\" The Kepler spacecraft is orbiting the sun carrying a photometer, or light meter, to measure changes in star brightness. The photometer includes a telescope 37 inches in diameter connected to a 95 megapixel CCD camera. The instrument is continually pointed at the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way. It is expected to continuously observe about 170,000 stars for at least three and a half years. Kepler's primary job is to use tiny variations in the brightness of the stars within its view to find earth-like planets that might be able to support life. The Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation is using Kepler data to study different kinds of stars. The investigation is led by a four-member steering committee: Kawaler, Chair Ron Gilliland of the Space Telescope Science Institute based in Baltimore, Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard and Hans Kjeldsen, both of Aarhus University in Denmark. Kepler has provided astronomers with so much new information, the Science paper says they're \"entering a golden era for stellar physics.\" Data from 500 sun-like stars gives astronomers a much better understanding of the stars, their properties and their evolution. It also gives astronomers data to test their theories, models and predictions about the stars and the galaxy. And it gives astronomers enough data to make meaningful statistical studies of the stars. \"But this is just the start of things,\" Kawaler said. \"This is a first broad-brush analysis of the data we've seen. This is a preview of this new tool and the kind of detailed census that we'll be able to do.\" Among the projects to come, according to the Science paper, are studies to determine the ages of all these sun-like stars and studies of the host stars of the earth-like planets discovered by Kepler.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/nasas-kepler-updated-census-of-sun-like-stars/"}, {"title": "NASA Kepler Reaching into the Stars", "date": "2011-04-12", "content": "We are entering a golden era for \"stellar physics\" - a term coined to describe research about the formation, evolution, interior and the atmospheres of stars. Thanks to a partnership forged among stellar astrophysics, scientists and NASA's Kepler Mission, a goldmine of data is now available to support the world's efforts to detect planets in the habitable zone around other stars. The Kepler photometric data is a measurement of light's \"brightness,\" and provides an unprecedented opportunity for the emerging field of asteroseismology, the study of the internal structure of stars by observing minuscule pulsations in the star brightness. Asteroseismic research is giving insights into the fundamental properties of stars, including their mass, size, age and internal structure. Kepler enables studies of a large number of stars representing a broad range of types. This asteroseismic research will substantially improve our understanding of stellar evolution. It also will help determine the properties of stars that have planetary systems studied in the Kepler exoplanet program. The Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC) pushes the envelope in this field of study. Using the unparalleled precision and quality of Kepler data, the KASC research is contributing to stellar astrophysics in profound ways. The consortium is comprised of more than 400 scientists and is led by the Danish Asteroseismology Centre in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. The KASC recently presented new findings published in three papers in the journal Science. In combination, these latest results illustrate the power of the Kepler Space Telescope to probe the internal structure of distant stars. Kepler Listens to an Orchestra of Sun-like Stars to Tune the Galactic Models: The scientific investigation of sun-like stars has taken a major step forward thanks to the Kepler Mission. In addition to searching for exoplanets, it is providing exquisite data on stellar oscillations. \"The sound inside the stars makes them ring or vibrate like musical instruments,\" said Bill Chaplin from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy, the lead author of this paper. \"If you measure the pitch of the notes produced by an instrument it can tell you how big the instrument is. The bigger the instrument is, the lower the pitch and deeper the sound. This is how we can tell how big a star is - from its stellar music.\" Oscillation measurements are used to accurately determine fundamental stellar properties like mass, size, and age. This is where theory meets observation. Scientists can synthesize a snapshot of our galaxy and all the stars it contains using models based on everything we know about how much raw material there is in our galaxy for building stars, what types of stars are made, how they evolve with time, and how long they live. They can then compare the properties of stars in this synthetic snapshot with the properties of the sun-like stars in the asteroseismic survey. In essence, the team has taken a census and compared it to predictions, and found that the sizes of the stars are consistent with the predictions, but the masses are not. The asteroseismic survey suggests that the number of low mass stars is slightly larger than expected. This work sends theoreticians back to refine their models and will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the structure and evolution of stars in our galaxy. \"Before Kepler we had asteroseismic data on only about 20 such stars - We now have an orchestra of stars to play with,\" said Hans Kjeldsen from Aarhus from the Danish Asteroseismology Centre in Aarhus, who coordinates KASC. \"This opens up huge possibilities for probing stellar evolution and obtaining a clearer picture of the past and future of our own sun and how our galaxy, and others like it, has evolved over time. We can, for example, pick out stars that have the same mass of the sun but have different ages, to, in effect, follow the sun in time.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/reach_into_stars.html"}, {"title": "Surprise find in Kepler planet hunt: lots of multi-planet systems", "date": "2011-05-23", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which is searching for Earth-mass planets orbiting sun-like stars, is finding hundreds of candidate planets, and many more multi-planet systems than expected. So many planets, so little time. Two years into a 3-1/2-year mission, NASA's Kepler spacecraft, hunting for planets orbiting some 165,000 stars in the constellation Cygnus, is uncovering planet candidates by the hundreds. Many of these inhabit multi-planet systems that are unexpectedly flat - the inclination of the planets' orbits within each of these systems are essentially the same, a feature that may hold clues about how these systems formed and evolved. Not only is the team uncovering many more multi-planet systems than it had anticipated. But the systems hold the promise of allowing researchers to gain valuable information that can lead to an initial estimation of each planet's density and hence it's bulk composition - is it rocky, a water world, or something else? And they potentially can estimate these traits more quickly than previously thought.These multi-planet-system discoveries \"are very important to the success of the mission,\" said David Latham, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., and a member of the Kepler team. He spoke at a briefing May 23 at the American Astronomical Society's spring meeting underway in Boston. Kepler's ultimate goal is to gather a census of Earth-mass planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars - orbits at distances where the star warms a planet just enough to allow liquid water to remain stable on the surface. So far, the planets Kepler is finding are well inside that zone, where hot is the order of the day. Spitzer telescope helps confirm find: One of these is Kepler 10c, a new planet orbiting a 10-billion-year-old sun-like star some 564 light years from Earth. The team announced the discovery of its sibling, Kepler 10b, in January. This earlier discovery was striking because at 1.4 times Earth's mass, 10b was the smallest rocky planet found to date. Evidence for 10c turned out to be buried in 10b's discovery data - the fluctuations in the host star's light as the planet briefly eclipsed, or transited, the star with each orbit. But 10c didn't emerge as a strong planet candidate until the team used a second space telescope - NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory that is orbiting Earth - to track the dip the planet imposed on the star's light. The case for 10c's candidacy resulted from this dual observation, in which the dip in light the two spacecraft recorded was able to rule out the possibility that 10c had been another, perhaps dimmer, star. Comparing the data with what one might expect to see with a binary-star system rather then a planetary system, the team is 99.9998 percent certain they have a planet, according to Francois Fressin, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics. Many multi-planet systems found: The most striking multi-planet system so far is a system dubbed Kepler 11, whose discovery the team announced in February. Its six planets are orbiting a yellow dwarf star some 2,000 light years from Earth. These planets have been confirmed as such, and they seem to be made mostly of rock by mass, although gas appears to take up most of their volume. But Kepler's cosmic census-takers have found far more of these than anticipated. Of 1,235 planet candidates reported so far, 408 are divvied up among 107 multi-planet systems. \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many.... We thought we might see two or three,\" Dr. Latham says. Given the candidates found so far, it looks as though the number of planets of Neptune's mass or less are the most common, while planets with Jupiter's heft or greater are less common, although they are easier to find, Latham says. As the team gathers more data, it's becoming clear that it is discovering new tools for turning observations into results. Up to now, for instance, the team has relied on ground-based telescopes to use a second planet-detection method to confirm that a transit that Kepler spots is indeed the result of a planet eclipsing its host star. With ground-based telescopes, it takes time to carry out the observations needed for those confirmations. Kepler is observing its patch of the sky in Cygnus 24/7/365. But the big telescopes needed to confirm Kepler's observations tend to be in the Northern Hemisphere, whose night sky Cygnus vacates for part of the year. Telescopes such as Spitzer can conduct follow-up transit observations more quickly. In other cases, Kepler data themselves are opening the possibility for new tools - \"Kepler helping itself,\" as astrophysicist Soren Meibom describes it. Dr. Meibom, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and a Kepler team member, is working with Kepler data to develop a more-precise way of telling how old stars are in Kepler's field of view. Essentially, his team is using a star's rotation rate as a clock. Star's age impacts chance for life: The issue bears directly on the chance that an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of another star could harbor life. If a star is a billion years old, don't bet on much more than microbes. At 3 billion years, far more complex life could be present, but not so developed that it could phone home. At 4.6 billion years, however, life could evolve into technologically advanced civilizations, if Earth is any indication. But \"determining the age of a star is one of the most difficult tasks in astronomy; stars don't have birth certificates,\" Meibom says. The problem: After a sun-like star's first 500 million years or so, its mass, brightness, and temperature don't change much until billions of years later, when it teeters on the brink of its self-destruction, explains Dr. Meibom, But a star's rotation rate does slow with time as its stellar wind carries off material, in effect acting like the spinning ice skater who extends his or her arms to slow the spin. Astronomers can track a star's rotation by patterns in the periodic dimming that occurs with the coming and going of dark patches on stars - essentially their equivalents of sunspots. Younger stars tend to have larger spots and rotate faster than older stars, so their dimming is deeper and more frequent than that in older stars.

But 10c didn't emerge as a strong planet candidate until the team used a second space telescope - NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared observatory that is orbiting Earth - to track the dip the planet imposed on the star's light. The case for 10c's candidacy resulted from this dual observation, in which the dip in light the two spacecraft recorded was able to rule out the possibility that 10c had been another, perhaps dimmer, star. Comparing the data with what one might expect to see with a binary-star system rather then a planetary system, the team is 99.9998 percent certain they have a planet, according to Francois Fressin, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics. Many multi-planet systems found: The most striking multi-planet system so far is a system dubbed Kepler 11, whose discovery the team announced in February. Its six planets are orbiting a yellow dwarf star some 2,000 light years from Earth. These planets have been confirmed as such, and they seem to be made mostly of rock by mass, although gas appears to take up most of their volume. But Kepler's cosmic census-takers have found far more of these than anticipated. Of 1,235 planet candidates reported so far, 408 are divvied up among 107 multi-planet systems. \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many.... We thought we might see two or three,\" Dr. Latham says. Given the candidates found so far, it looks as though the number of planets of Neptune's mass or less are the most common, while planets with Jupiter's heft or greater are less common, although they are easier to find, Latham says. As the team gathers more data, it's becoming clear that it is discovering new tools for turning observations into results. Up to now, for instance, the team has relied on ground-based telescopes to use a second planet-detection method to confirm that a transit that Kepler spots is indeed the result of a planet eclipsing its host star. With ground-based telescopes, it takes time to carry out the observations needed for those confirmations. Kepler is observing its patch of the sky in Cygnus 24/7/365. But the big telescopes needed to confirm Kepler's observations tend to be in the Northern Hemisphere, whose night sky Cygnus vacates for part of the year. Telescopes such as Spitzer can conduct follow-up transit observations more quickly. In other cases, Kepler data themselves are opening the possibility for new tools - \"Kepler helping itself,\" as astrophysicist Soren Meibom describes it. Dr. Meibom, another researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and a Kepler team member, is working with Kepler data to develop a more-precise way of telling how old stars are in Kepler's field of view. Essentially, his team is using a star's rotation rate as a clock. Star's age impacts chance for life: The issue bears directly on the chance that an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of another star could harbor life. If a star is a billion years old, don't bet on much more than microbes. At 3 billion years, far more complex life could be present, but not so developed that it could phone home. At 4.6 billion years, however, life could evolve into technologically advanced civilizations, if Earth is any indication. But \"determining the age of a star is one of the most difficult tasks in astronomy; stars don't have birth certificates,\" Meibom says. The problem: After a sun-like star's first 500 million years or so, its mass, brightness, and temperature don't change much until billions of years later, when it teeters on the brink of its self-destruction, explains Dr. Meibom, But a star's rotation rate does slow with time as its stellar wind carries off material, in effect acting like the spinning ice skater who extends his or her arms to slow the spin. Astronomers can track a star's rotation by patterns in the periodic dimming that occurs with the coming and going of dark patches on stars - essentially their equivalents of sunspots. Younger stars tend to have larger spots and rotate faster than older stars, so their dimming is deeper and more frequent than that in older stars. Kepler scientists are using stars in star clusters of known ages to build a temporal yardstick for determining the ages of the stars that host planets.", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0523/Surprise-find-in-Kepler-planet-hunt-lots-of-multi-planet-systems"}, {"title": "The Kepler spacecraft's astounding haul of multiple-planet systems", "date": "2011-05-24", "content": "NASA's Kepler spacecraft is proving itself to be a prolific planet hunter. Within just the first four months of data, astronomers have found evidence for more than 1,200 planetary candidates. Of those, 408 reside in systems containing two or more planets, and most of those look very different than our solar system. In particular, the Kepler systems with multiple planets are much flatter than our solar system. They have to be for Kepler to spot them. Kepler watches for a planet to cross in front of its star, blocking a tiny fraction of the star's light. By measuring how much the star dims during such a transit, astronomers can calculate the planet's size, and by observing the time between successive events they can derive the orbital period - how long it takes the planet to revolve around its star. To see a transit, the planet's orbit must be edge-on to our line of sight. To see multiple transiting planets, they all must be edge-on (or nearly so). \"We didn't anticipate that we would find so many multiple-transit systems. We thought we might see two or three. Instead, we found more than 100,\" said Smithsonian astronomer David Latham (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics). Latham presented the findings on Monday, May 23 in a press conference at the 218th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. In our solar system, some planet orbits are tilted by up to 7 degrees, meaning that an alien astronomer looking for transits wouldn't be able to detect all eight planets. (In particular, they would miss Mercury and Venus.) The systems spotted by Kepler are much flatter, with orbits tilted less than 1 degree. Why are they so flat? One clue comes from the planets themselves. The multiplanet systems found by Kepler are dominated by planets smaller than Neptune. They lack Jupiter-sized gas giants. Scientists believe that a gas giant's powerful gravity tends to disrupt planetary systems, tilting the orbits of neighboring worlds. \"Jupiters are the 800-pound gorillas stirring things up during the early history of these systems,\" explained Latham. \"Other studies have found plenty of systems with big planets, but they're not flat.\" Multiple-planet systems may offer a chance for confirming the densities of small, rocky worlds. The more massive a planet, the easier it is to detect using radial velocity measurements (essentially the star's wobble as a planet's gravity tugs it). Earth-sized worlds in Earth-sized orbits aren't massive enough to make a radial velocity signal that's detectable with present technology. In systems with more than one transiting planet, astronomers have another option: transit timing variations. They can measure how the time between successive transits changes from orbit to orbit due to mutual gravitational interactions between the planets. The size of the effect depends on the planets' masses. \"These planets are pulling and pushing on each other, and we can measure that,\" said Smithsonian astronomer Matthew Holman. \"Dozens of the systems Kepler found show signs of transit timing variations.\" As Kepler continues to gather data, it will be able to spot planets with wider orbits, including some in the habitable zones of their stars. Transit timing variations may play a key role in confirming the first rocky planets with the right temperature for water to be liquid on their surfaces.

The existence of this planet was suspected previously, but new analytical techniques were needed to confirm its existence. The Kepler Telescope team has found a new rocky planet, one they describe as a \"scorched, molten Earth.\" The planet is about 2 times the size of Earth, and is very close to the Sun-like star Kepler-10, completing an orbit in only 45 days. Being so close to its sun, the blazing-hot new planet is not expected to have any liquid water or life as we know it. The star Kepler-10 is located 564 light-years away, in the Draco constellation (although it is not bright enough to be seen with the naked eye). Named Kepler-10c, the new planet's existence was suspected when the Kepler team announced earlier this year that they'd found Kepler-10 b, a terrestrial planet orbiting the same star. However, the data was not conclusive enough for scientists to feel certain that what they were seeing was due to a planet. A new technique was required to rule out other possibilities. The Kepler telescope looks at dips in starlight when a planet passes in front of a star from our point of view -- an event called a planetary transit. But other objects, such as stars, can also pass in front of the observed star and block the light. To be sure the transit was not caused by eclipsing stars, the Kepler team combined a new computer simulation technique called \"Blender\" with infrared data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Blender is light-curve fitting software that allows the scientists to rule out other possible causes of the dip in starlight. When astronomers are observing a star, the total light emitted by the star over time can be represented as a relatively flat line. A short-lived dip in this line, called a light curve, indicates some of the light has been blocked briefly. \"We try to exhaustively look at all the things that could cause a light curve,\" said Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a member of the Kepler team. Blender results show that only a very small fraction of other objects can reproduce the exact same kind of light-curve as a planet. This helps give the scientists confidence that the light curve they are witnessing is due to the new planet Kepler-10c rather than something else. Fressin said that the Blender method can be used to help the Kepler team figure out if any of the 1,235 candidates they have found so far are rocky planets like the Earth. Bill Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, said hundreds more planet candidates are expected to be found before the end of the three-year mission. However, he noted that the Kepler team won't release more data sets until June 2012 because they need more time to observe the stars and rule out other explanations for the changes in starlight. Kepler's main goal is to discover how common are Earths in habitable zones around Sun-like stars. Whether they are rare or common, once such worlds are located, astronomers can try to study them in order to learn whether they have alien life.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2011-05-rocky-world-kepler-multi-planet.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler finds Star Wars world", "date": "2011-09-15", "content": "NASA scientists have found a planet, in our own galaxy, and not so far far away, that has two suns just like Tatooine in Star Wars.

Kepler also has discovered more than 1,000 new planet candidates, nearly doubling its previously known count. Ten of these candidates are near-Earth-size and orbit in the habitable zone of their host star. Candidates require follow-up observations to verify they are actual planets. The newly confirmed planet, Kepler-22b, is the smallest yet found to orbit in the middle of the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun. The planet is about 2.4 times the radius of Earth. Scientists don't yet know if Kepler-22b has a predominantly rocky, gaseous or liquid composition, but its discovery is a step closer to finding Earth-like planets. Previous research hinted at the existence of near-Earth-size planets in habitable zones, but clear confirmation proved elusive. Two other small planets orbiting stars smaller and cooler than our sun recently were confirmed on the very edges of the habitable zone, with orbits more closely resembling those of Venus and Mars. \"This is a major milestone on the road to finding Earth's twin,\" said Douglas Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Kepler's results continue to demonstrate the importance of NASA's science missions, which aim to answer some of the biggest questions about our place in the universe.\" Kepler discovers planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets that cross in front, or \"transit,\" the stars. Kepler requires at least three transits to verify a signal as a planet. \"Fortune smiled upon us with the detection of this planet,\" said William Borucki, Kepler principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., who led the team that discovered Kepler-22b. \"The first transit was captured just three days after we declared the spacecraft operationally ready. We witnessed the defining third transit over the 2010 holiday season.\" The Kepler science team uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space Telescope to review observations on planet candidates the spacecraft finds. The star field that Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra can only be seen from ground-based observatories in spring through early fall. The data from these other observations help determine which candidates can be validated as planets. Kepler-22b is located 600 light-years away. While the planet is larger than Earth, its orbit of 290 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our world. The planet's host star belongs to the same class as our sun, called G-type, although it is slightly smaller and cooler. Of the 54 habitable zone planet candidates reported in February 2011, Kepler-22b is the first to be confirmed. This milestone will be published in The Astrophysical Journal. The Kepler team is hosting its inaugural science conference at Ames Dec. 5-9, announcing 1,094 new planet candidate discoveries. Since the last catalog was released in February, the number of planet candidates identified by Kepler has increased by 89 percent and now totals 2,326. Of these, 207 are approximately Earth-size, 680 are super Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. The findings, based on observations conducted May 2009 to September 2010, show a dramatic increase in the numbers of smaller-size planet candidates. Kepler observed many large planets in small orbits early in its mission, which were reflected in the February data release. Having had more time to observe three transits of planets with longer orbital periods, the new data suggest that planets one to four times the size of Earth may be abundant in the galaxy. The number of Earth-size and super Earth-size candidates has increased by more than 200 and 140 percent since February, respectively. There are 48 planet candidates in their star's habitable zone. While this is a decrease from the 54 reported in February, the Kepler team has applied a stricter definition of what constitutes a habitable zone in the new catalog, to account for the warming effect of atmospheres, which would move the zone away from the star, out to longer orbital periods. \"The tremendous growth in the number of Earth-size candidates tells us that we're honing in on the planets Kepler was designed to detect: those that are not only Earth-size, but also are potentially habitable,\" said Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead at San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif. \"The more data we collect, the keener our eye for finding the smallest planets out at longer orbital periods.\" NASA's Ames Research Center manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis.

In a solar system 1,000 light years away with at least five planets, the newly confirmed Earth-size worlds orbit too close to their star to support life. But proving the Kepler observatory can, in fact, spot worlds as small as Earth across the vast reaches of interstellar space gives astronomers confidence many more such planets are awaiting discovery among the 2,326 planet candidates found by the telescope to date. \"The first of these two planets has a diameter just 3 percent larger than the Earth, which makes it the closest object to the Earth in terms of size in the known universe,\" Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told reporters during a teleconference. \"The second planet is 13 percent smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of around 7,000 miles. It is also smaller than Venus, and this is, in fact, the smallest planetary body ever discovered in orbit around an Earth-like star. \"Most importantly, it is the first time we've crossed the Earth-size threshold. In other words, December 2011 could be remembered as the first time humanity has been able to detect a planet of Earth-size or smaller around another star.\" On Dec. 5, the Kepler team announced the discovery of a world twice the size of Earth orbiting in its star's habitable zone, where liquid water can exist, the first time a relatively Earth-size world had been found at the right distance to possibly support life. Kepler-20e and 20f share their parent star with at least three other Neptune-class planets, all of them orbiting closer than Mercury orbits the sun. Kepler-20e completes a trip around the star every 6.1 days and is believed to have a temperature of around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt glass. Kepler-20f completes a \"year\" every 19.6 days and has a surface temperature of around 800 degrees. The masses of the two planets, and thus their density and general composition, remain a mystery. Perhaps more important than finding two confirmed Earth-size worlds, the Kepler-20 solar system is at odds with current theories about how planetary systems form. \"Today, we are announcing five planets all orbiting this star, Kepler-20,\" said David Charbonneau, professor of astronomy at Harvard University. \"However, the architecture of that planetary system is crazy.\" In Earth's solar system, he said, there are two major types of planets: small, rocky worlds close to the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and large gas giants farther from the sun (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). \"In Earth's solar system, these two different kinds of planets don't mingle, they remain neatly separated from each other,\" Charbonneau said. \"In fact, all four of the rocky planets in the solar system lie relatively close to the sun and the four gas giants lie outside of this. This separation of rocky planets and gas giants in the solar system really drives our understanding of planet formation and is one of the key features that we try to explain when we try to understand the formation of the solar system.\" In the case of Kepler-20, a Neptune-size gas giant is the innermost of the five known worlds, followed by Kepler-20e, another Neptune-like world, Kepler-20f, and then another gas giant. \"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed and I think it's fair to say I need help,\" Charbonneau said. \"As a professor of astronomy, I'm actually teaching a course in the spring on planet formation and you can bet the freshman in my class are going to be quick to point out how the model of the formation of the solar system is deeply challenged by the discovery that's being presented today.\" Kepler, equipped with a 95-megapixel digital camera, was launched from Cape Canaveral on March 6, 2009. The camera is aimed at a patch of sky in the northern constellation Cygnus the size of an outstretched hand that contains more than 4.5 million detectable stars. Of that total, some 300,000 are believed to be the right age and to have the right composition and the proper brightness to host Earth-like planets. More than 156,000 of those, ranging from 600 to 3,000 light years away, will be actively monitored by Kepler over the life of its mission. To find candidate planets, the spacecraft's camera monitors the brightness of target stars in the instrument's wide field of view, on the lookout for slight changes that might indicate a world passing between the star and the telescope. By studying the slight dimming, and by timing repeated cycles, computers can identify potential extra-solar worlds even though the planets themselves cannot be seen. Before a candidate planet can be confirmed, the data must be reviewed by other astronomers and results compared to findings by other telescopes and satellites. As of today, Kepler has found 33 confirmed planets and 2,326 candidates. Astronomers expect many more confirmations as data analysis continues. \"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\" Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University, said in a NASA statement. \"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\" Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C., told reporters the big question underlying the Kepler research is \"are we alone in our universe? And so we ask, how are planets made, and when do they end up like the Earth, both in size and also in climate? This new Kepler finding has made a really big step in our understanding of these questions.\" She said astronomers believed solar systems likely followed the model seen in Earth's system, with small, rocky worlds orbiting close to their parent star and large gas giants orbiting much farther away, beyond the so-called \"ice line.\" Based on earlier observations that found multiple examples of Jupiter-class planets orbiting close to their parent stars, scientists believed such worlds could migrate inward over time, kicking out smaller planets closer in. \"But now, with this new Kepler finding comes a solar system that doesn't fit any mold we have,\" Elkins-Tanton said. \"The planets alternate big and little and are all so close to their star, this system forces us to change our ideas about how the planets are formed and how they reach stable orbits and where, indeed, there could be Earth-size rocky planets.\" Whether Earth's solar system is the exception or the rule remains to be seen.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepscicon-briefing.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler finds Star Wars world", "date": "2011-09-15", "content": "NASA scientists have found a planet, in our own galaxy, and not so far far away, that has two suns just like Tatooine in Star Wars.

But the similarity was great enough for NASA to invite a representative of the movie series' makers Lucasfilm to join the panel that announced the discovery to the world tonight.

Earlier this year, French astronomers found the first planet, a different one, which met the crucial requirements for potential human settlement However, Kepler 22b, which was first seen in 2009, is the first the US space agency has been able to confirm as a potential new home for mankind. Confirmation means that astronomers have seen it crossing in front of its star three times. However, it does not signify that astronomers know whether life actually exists there, simply that the conditions are right. Bill Borucki, Kepler principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center, said: \"We have now got good planet confirmation with Kepler 22b. \"We are certain that it is in the habitable zone and if it has a surface it ought to have a nice temperature.\" Spinning around its star some 600 light years away, Kepler 22b is 2.4 times the size of the Earth and orbits its sun-like star every 290 days. Scientists do not know, however, if the planet is rocky, gaseous or liquid. The planet's first \"transit\", or star crossover, was captured shortly after NASA launched its Kepler spacecraft in March 2009. NASA also announced that Kepler has uncovered 1,000 more potential planets, twice the number it previously had been tracking, according to research being presented at a conference in California this week. Kepler is NASA's first mission in search of Earth-like planets orbiting suns similar to ours. It is equipped with the largest camera ever sent into space - a 95-megapixel array of charge-coupled devices - and is expected to continue sending information back to Earth until at least November 2012. Kepler is searching for planets as small as Earth, including those orbiting stars in a warm, habitable zone where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet. The latest confirmed exoplanet - one outside Earth's solar system - that could support life brings to three the total number confirmed by global astronomers. In addition to French astronomers' confirmed finding of Gliese 581d in May, Swiss astronomers reported in August that another planet, HD 85512b, about 36 light years away seemed to be in the habitable zone of its star. According to an online catalog that indexes bodies outside our solar system by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) of the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, a total of 47 exoplanets and exomoons are potential habitable candidates.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/8937102/Nasas-Kepler-space-telescope-finds-possible-new-Earth.html?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_psc_ppc_us_news_dsa_generalnews&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmN2iBhCrARIsAG_G2i6_gtNPK0WU8d6zXdAJqdjbCFu3bYdXJ68EHBV3ejHUXAz_TomKM6QaAo50EALw_wcB"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Confirms Its First Planet in Habitable Zone of Sun-like Star", "date": "2011-12-05", "content": "NASA's Kepler mission has confirmed its first planet in the \"habitable zone,\" the region where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Kepler also has discovered more than 1,000 new planet candidates, nearly doubling its previously known count. Ten of these candidates are near-Earth-size and orbit in the habitable zone of their host star. Candidates require follow-up observations to verify they are actual planets. The newly confirmed planet, Kepler-22b, is the smallest yet found to orbit in the middle of the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun. The planet is about 2.4 times the radius of Earth. Scientists don't yet know if Kepler-22b has a predominantly rocky, gaseous or liquid composition, but its discovery is a step closer to finding Earth-like planets. Previous research hinted at the existence of near-Earth-size planets in habitable zones, but clear confirmation proved elusive. Two other small planets orbiting stars smaller and cooler than our sun recently were confirmed on the very edges of the habitable zone, with orbits more closely resembling those of Venus and Mars. \"This is a major milestone on the road to finding Earth's twin,\" said Douglas Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Kepler's results continue to demonstrate the importance of NASA's science missions, which aim to answer some of the biggest questions about our place in the universe.\" Kepler discovers planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets that cross in front, or \"transit,\" the stars. Kepler requires at least three transits to verify a signal as a planet. \"Fortune smiled upon us with the detection of this planet,\" said William Borucki, Kepler principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., who led the team that discovered Kepler-22b. \"The first transit was captured just three days after we declared the spacecraft operationally ready. We witnessed the defining third transit over the 2010 holiday season.\" The Kepler science team uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space Telescope to review observations on planet candidates the spacecraft finds. The star field that Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra can only be seen from ground-based observatories in spring through early fall. The data from these other observations help determine which candidates can be validated as planets. Kepler-22b is located 600 light-years away. While the planet is larger than Earth, its orbit of 290 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our world. The planet's host star belongs to the same class as our sun, called G-type, although it is slightly smaller and cooler. Of the 54 habitable zone planet candidates reported in February 2011, Kepler-22b is the first to be confirmed. This milestone will be published in The Astrophysical Journal. The Kepler team is hosting its inaugural science conference at Ames Dec. 5-9, announcing 1,094 new planet candidate discoveries. Since the last catalog was released in February, the number of planet candidates identified by Kepler has increased by 89 percent and now totals 2,326. Of these, 207 are approximately Earth-size, 680 are super Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. The findings, based on observations conducted May 2009 to September 2010, show a dramatic increase in the numbers of smaller-size planet candidates. Kepler observed many large planets in small orbits early in its mission, which were reflected in the February data release. Having had more time to observe three transits of planets with longer orbital periods, the new data suggest that planets one to four times the size of Earth may be abundant in the galaxy. The number of Earth-size and super Earth-size candidates has increased by more than 200 and 140 percent since February, respectively. There are 48 planet candidates in their star's habitable zone. While this is a decrease from the 54 reported in February, the Kepler team has applied a stricter definition of what constitutes a habitable zone in the new catalog, to account for the warming effect of atmospheres, which would move the zone away from the star, out to longer orbital periods. \"The tremendous growth in the number of Earth-size candidates tells us that we're honing in on the planets Kepler was designed to detect: those that are not only Earth-size, but also are potentially habitable,\" said Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead at San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif. \"The more data we collect, the keener our eye for finding the smallest planets out at longer orbital periods.\" NASA's Ames Research Center manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis.

In a solar system 1,000 light years away with at least five planets, the newly confirmed Earth-size worlds orbit too close to their star to support life. But proving the Kepler observatory can, in fact, spot worlds as small as Earth across the vast reaches of interstellar space gives astronomers confidence many more such planets are awaiting discovery among the 2,326 planet candidates found by the telescope to date. \"The first of these two planets has a diameter just 3 percent larger than the Earth, which makes it the closest object to the Earth in terms of size in the known universe,\" Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told reporters during a teleconference. \"The second planet is 13 percent smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of around 7,000 miles. It is also smaller than Venus, and this is, in fact, the smallest planetary body ever discovered in orbit around an Earth-like star. \"Most importantly, it is the first time we've crossed the Earth-size threshold. In other words, December 2011 could be remembered as the first time humanity has been able to detect a planet of Earth-size or smaller around another star.\" On Dec. 5, the Kepler team announced the discovery of a world twice the size of Earth orbiting in its star's habitable zone, where liquid water can exist, the first time a relatively Earth-size world had been found at the right distance to possibly support life. Kepler-20e and 20f share their parent star with at least three other Neptune-class planets, all of them orbiting closer than Mercury orbits the sun. Kepler-20e completes a trip around the star every 6.1 days and is believed to have a temperature of around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt glass. Kepler-20f completes a \"year\" every 19.6 days and has a surface temperature of around 800 degrees. The masses of the two planets, and thus their density and general composition, remain a mystery. Perhaps more important than finding two confirmed Earth-size worlds, the Kepler-20 solar system is at odds with current theories about how planetary systems form. \"Today, we are announcing five planets all orbiting this star, Kepler-20,\" said David Charbonneau, professor of astronomy at Harvard University. \"However, the architecture of that planetary system is crazy.\" In Earth's solar system, he said, there are two major types of planets: small, rocky worlds close to the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and large gas giants farther from the sun (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). \"In Earth's solar system, these two different kinds of planets don't mingle, they remain neatly separated from each other,\" Charbonneau said. \"In fact, all four of the rocky planets in the solar system lie relatively close to the sun and the four gas giants lie outside of this. This separation of rocky planets and gas giants in the solar system really drives our understanding of planet formation and is one of the key features that we try to explain when we try to understand the formation of the solar system.\" In the case of Kepler-20, a Neptune-size gas giant is the innermost of the five known worlds, followed by Kepler-20e, another Neptune-like world, Kepler-20f, and then another gas giant. \"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed and I think it's fair to say I need help,\" Charbonneau said. \"As a professor of astronomy, I'm actually teaching a course in the spring on planet formation and you can bet the freshman in my class are going to be quick to point out how the model of the formation of the solar system is deeply challenged by the discovery that's being presented today.\" Kepler, equipped with a 95-megapixel digital camera, was launched from Cape Canaveral on March 6, 2009. The camera is aimed at a patch of sky in the northern constellation Cygnus the size of an outstretched hand that contains more than 4.5 million detectable stars. Of that total, some 300,000 are believed to be the right age and to have the right composition and the proper brightness to host Earth-like planets. More than 156,000 of those, ranging from 600 to 3,000 light years away, will be actively monitored by Kepler over the life of its mission. To find candidate planets, the spacecraft's camera monitors the brightness of target stars in the instrument's wide field of view, on the lookout for slight changes that might indicate a world passing between the star and the telescope. By studying the slight dimming, and by timing repeated cycles, computers can identify potential extra-solar worlds even though the planets themselves cannot be seen. Before a candidate planet can be confirmed, the data must be reviewed by other astronomers and results compared to findings by other telescopes and satellites. As of today, Kepler has found 33 confirmed planets and 2,326 candidates. Astronomers expect many more confirmations as data analysis continues. \"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\" Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University, said in a NASA statement. \"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\" Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C., told reporters the big question underlying the Kepler research is \"are we alone in our universe? And so we ask, how are planets made, and when do they end up like the Earth, both in size and also in climate? This new Kepler finding has made a really big step in our understanding of these questions.\" She said astronomers believed solar systems likely followed the model seen in Earth's system, with small, rocky worlds orbiting close to their parent star and large gas giants orbiting much farther away, beyond the so-called \"ice line.\" Based on earlier observations that found multiple examples of Jupiter-class planets orbiting close to their parent stars, scientists believed such worlds could migrate inward over time, kicking out smaller planets closer in. \"But now, with this new Kepler finding comes a solar system that doesn't fit any mold we have,\" Elkins-Tanton said. \"The planets alternate big and little and are all so close to their star, this system forces us to change our ideas about how the planets are formed and how they reach stable orbits and where, indeed, there could be Earth-size rocky planets.\" Whether Earth's solar system is the exception or the rule remains to be seen.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepscicon-briefing.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Finds Three Smallest Exoplanets", "date": "2012-01-12", "content": "Astronomers using data from NASA's Kepler mission have discovered the three smallest planets yet detected orbiting a star beyond our sun. The planets orbit a single star, called KOI-961, and are 0.78, 0.73 and 0.57 times the radius of Earth. The smallest is about the size of Mars. All three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth, but orbit close to their star. That makes them too hot to be in the habitable zone, which is the region where liquid water could exist. Of the more than 700 planets confirmed to orbit other stars - called exoplanets - only a handful are known to be rocky. \"Astronomers are just beginning to confirm thousands of planet candidates uncovered by Kepler so far,\" said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\" Finding one as small as Mars is amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all around us.\" Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing, or transiting, planets. At least three transits are required to verify a signal as a planet. Follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes also are needed to confirm the discoveries. The latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The team used data publicly released by the Kepler mission, along with follow-up observations from the Palomar Observatory, near San Diego, and the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what originally was estimated. The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter. \"This is the tiniest solar system found so far,\" said John Johnson, the principal investigator of the research from NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"It's actually more similar to Jupiter and its moons in scale than any other planetary system. The discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.\" Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets. \"These types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe,\" said Phil Muirhead, lead author of the new study from Caltech. \"This is a really exciting time for planet hunters.\" The discovery follows a string of recent milestones for the Kepler mission. In December 2011, scientists announced the mission's first confirmed planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star: a planet 2.4 times the size of Earth called Kepler-22b. Later in the month, the team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system, called Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f. For the latest discovery, the team obtained the sizes of the three planets called KOI-961.01, KOI-961.02 and KOI-961.03 with the help of a well-studied twin star to KOI-961, or Barnard's Star. By better understanding the KOI-961 star, they then could determine how big the planets must be to have caused the observed dips in starlight. In addition to the Kepler observations and ground-based telescope measurements, the team used modeling techniques to confirm the planet discoveries.

This new Kepler finding has made a really big step in our understanding of these questions.\" She said astronomers believed solar systems likely followed the model seen in Earth's system, with small, rocky worlds orbiting close to their parent star and large gas giants orbiting much farther away, beyond the so-called \"ice line.\" Based on earlier observations that found multiple examples of Jupiter-class planets orbiting close to their parent stars, scientists believed such worlds could migrate inward over time, kicking out smaller planets closer in. \"But now, with this new Kepler finding comes a solar system that doesn't fit any mold we have,\" Elkins-Tanton said. \"The planets alternate big and little and are all so close to their star, this system forces us to change our ideas about how the planets are formed and how they reach stable orbits and where, indeed, there could be Earth-size rocky planets.\" Whether Earth's solar system is the exception or the rule remains to be seen.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepscicon-briefing.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Finds Three Smallest Exoplanets", "date": "2012-01-12", "content": "Astronomers using data from NASA's Kepler mission have discovered the three smallest planets yet detected orbiting a star beyond our sun. The planets orbit a single star, called KOI-961, and are 0.78, 0.73 and 0.57 times the radius of Earth. The smallest is about the size of Mars. All three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth, but orbit close to their star. That makes them too hot to be in the habitable zone, which is the region where liquid water could exist. Of the more than 700 planets confirmed to orbit other stars - called exoplanets - only a handful are known to be rocky. \"Astronomers are just beginning to confirm thousands of planet candidates uncovered by Kepler so far,\" said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\" Finding one as small as Mars is amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all around us.\" Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing, or transiting, planets. At least three transits are required to verify a signal as a planet. Follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes also are needed to confirm the discoveries. The latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The team used data publicly released by the Kepler mission, along with follow-up observations from the Palomar Observatory, near San Diego, and the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what originally was estimated. The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter. \"This is the tiniest solar system found so far,\" said John Johnson, the principal investigator of the research from NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"It's actually more similar to Jupiter and its moons in scale than any other planetary system. The discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.\" Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets. \"These types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe,\" said Phil Muirhead, lead author of the new study from Caltech. \"This is a really exciting time for planet hunters.\" The discovery follows a string of recent milestones for the Kepler mission. In December 2011, scientists announced the mission's first confirmed planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star: a planet 2.4 times the size of Earth called Kepler-22b. Later in the month, the team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system, called Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f. For the latest discovery, the team obtained the sizes of the three planets called KOI-961.01, KOI-961.02 and KOI-961.03 with the help of a well-studied twin star to KOI-961, or Barnard's Star. By better understanding the KOI-961 star, they then could determine how big the planets must be to have caused the observed dips in starlight. In addition to the Kepler observations and ground-based telescope measurements, the team used modeling techniques to confirm the planet discoveries.

Earlier this year, French astronomers found the first planet, a different one, which met the crucial requirements for potential human settlement However, Kepler 22b, which was first seen in 2009, is the first the US space agency has been able to confirm as a potential new home for mankind. Confirmation means that astronomers have seen it crossing in front of its star three times. However, it does not signify that astronomers know whether life actually exists there, simply that the conditions are right. Bill Borucki, Kepler principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center, said: \"We have now got good planet confirmation with Kepler 22b. \"We are certain that it is in the habitable zone and if it has a surface it ought to have a nice temperature.\" Spinning around its star some 600 light years away, Kepler 22b is 2.4 times the size of the Earth and orbits its sun-like star every 290 days. Scientists do not know, however, if the planet is rocky, gaseous or liquid. The planet's first \"transit\", or star crossover, was captured shortly after NASA launched its Kepler spacecraft in March 2009. NASA also announced that Kepler has uncovered 1,000 more potential planets, twice the number it previously had been tracking, according to research being presented at a conference in California this week. Kepler is NASA's first mission in search of Earth-like planets orbiting suns similar to ours. It is equipped with the largest camera ever sent into space - a 95-megapixel array of charge-coupled devices - and is expected to continue sending information back to Earth until at least November 2012. Kepler is searching for planets as small as Earth, including those orbiting stars in a warm, habitable zone where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet. The latest confirmed exoplanet - one outside Earth's solar system - that could support life brings to three the total number confirmed by global astronomers. In addition to French astronomers' confirmed finding of Gliese 581d in May, Swiss astronomers reported in August that another planet, HD 85512b, about 36 light years away seemed to be in the habitable zone of its star. According to an online catalog that indexes bodies outside our solar system by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL) of the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, a total of 47 exoplanets and exomoons are potential habitable candidates.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/8937102/Nasas-Kepler-space-telescope-finds-possible-new-Earth.html?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_psc_ppc_us_news_dsa_generalnews&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmN2iBhCrARIsAG_G2i6_gtNPK0WU8d6zXdAJqdjbCFu3bYdXJ68EHBV3ejHUXAz_TomKM6QaAo50EALw_wcB"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Confirms Its First Planet in Habitable Zone of Sun-like Star", "date": "2011-12-05", "content": "NASA's Kepler mission has confirmed its first planet in the \"habitable zone,\" the region where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Kepler also has discovered more than 1,000 new planet candidates, nearly doubling its previously known count. Ten of these candidates are near-Earth-size and orbit in the habitable zone of their host star. Candidates require follow-up observations to verify they are actual planets. The newly confirmed planet, Kepler-22b, is the smallest yet found to orbit in the middle of the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun. The planet is about 2.4 times the radius of Earth. Scientists don't yet know if Kepler-22b has a predominantly rocky, gaseous or liquid composition, but its discovery is a step closer to finding Earth-like planets. Previous research hinted at the existence of near-Earth-size planets in habitable zones, but clear confirmation proved elusive. Two other small planets orbiting stars smaller and cooler than our sun recently were confirmed on the very edges of the habitable zone, with orbits more closely resembling those of Venus and Mars. \"This is a major milestone on the road to finding Earth's twin,\" said Douglas Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Kepler's results continue to demonstrate the importance of NASA's science missions, which aim to answer some of the biggest questions about our place in the universe.\" Kepler discovers planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets that cross in front, or \"transit,\" the stars.

We witnessed the defining third transit over the 2010 holiday season.\" The Kepler science team uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space Telescope to review observations on planet candidates the spacecraft finds. The star field that Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra can only be seen from ground-based observatories in spring through early fall. The data from these other observations help determine which candidates can be validated as planets. Kepler-22b is located 600 light-years away. While the planet is larger than Earth, its orbit of 290 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our world. The planet's host star belongs to the same class as our sun, called G-type, although it is slightly smaller and cooler. Of the 54 habitable zone planet candidates reported in February 2011, Kepler-22b is the first to be confirmed. This milestone will be published in The Astrophysical Journal. The Kepler team is hosting its inaugural science conference at Ames Dec. 5-9, announcing 1,094 new planet candidate discoveries. Since the last catalog was released in February, the number of planet candidates identified by Kepler has increased by 89 percent and now totals 2,326. Of these, 207 are approximately Earth-size, 680 are super Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. The findings, based on observations conducted May 2009 to September 2010, show a dramatic increase in the numbers of smaller-size planet candidates. Kepler observed many large planets in small orbits early in its mission, which were reflected in the February data release. Having had more time to observe three transits of planets with longer orbital periods, the new data suggest that planets one to four times the size of Earth may be abundant in the galaxy. The number of Earth-size and super Earth-size candidates has increased by more than 200 and 140 percent since February, respectively. There are 48 planet candidates in their star's habitable zone. While this is a decrease from the 54 reported in February, the Kepler team has applied a stricter definition of what constitutes a habitable zone in the new catalog, to account for the warming effect of atmospheres, which would move the zone away from the star, out to longer orbital periods. \"The tremendous growth in the number of Earth-size candidates tells us that we're honing in on the planets Kepler was designed to detect: those that are not only Earth-size, but also are potentially habitable,\" said Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead at San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif. \"The more data we collect, the keener our eye for finding the smallest planets out at longer orbital periods.\" NASA's Ames Research Center manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis.

In a solar system 1,000 light years away with at least five planets, the newly confirmed Earth-size worlds orbit too close to their star to support life. But proving the Kepler observatory can, in fact, spot worlds as small as Earth across the vast reaches of interstellar space gives astronomers confidence many more such planets are awaiting discovery among the 2,326 planet candidates found by the telescope to date. \"The first of these two planets has a diameter just 3 percent larger than the Earth, which makes it the closest object to the Earth in terms of size in the known universe,\" Francois Fressin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told reporters during a teleconference. \"The second planet is 13 percent smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of around 7,000 miles.

In other words, December 2011 could be remembered as the first time humanity has been able to detect a planet of Earth-size or smaller around another star.\" On Dec. 5, the Kepler team announced the discovery of a world twice the size of Earth orbiting in its star's habitable zone, where liquid water can exist, the first time a relatively Earth-size world had been found at the right distance to possibly support life. Kepler-20e and 20f share their parent star with at least three other Neptune-class planets, all of them orbiting closer than Mercury orbits the sun. Kepler-20e completes a trip around the star every 6.1 days and is believed to have a temperature of around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt glass. Kepler-20f completes a \"year\" every 19.6 days and has a surface temperature of around 800 degrees. The masses of the two planets, and thus their density and general composition, remain a mystery. Perhaps more important than finding two confirmed Earth-size worlds, the Kepler-20 solar system is at odds with current theories about how planetary systems form. \"Today, we are announcing five planets all orbiting this star, Kepler-20,\" said David Charbonneau, professor of astronomy at Harvard University. \"However, the architecture of that planetary system is crazy.\" In Earth's solar system, he said, there are two major types of planets: small, rocky worlds close to the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and large gas giants farther from the sun (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). \"In Earth's solar system, these two different kinds of planets don't mingle, they remain neatly separated from each other,\" Charbonneau said. \"In fact, all four of the rocky planets in the solar system lie relatively close to the sun and the four gas giants lie outside of this. This separation of rocky planets and gas giants in the solar system really drives our understanding of planet formation and is one of the key features that we try to explain when we try to understand the formation of the solar system.\" In the case of Kepler-20, a Neptune-size gas giant is the innermost of the five known worlds, followed by Kepler-20e, another Neptune-like world, Kepler-20f, and then another gas giant. \"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed and I think it's fair to say I need help,\" Charbonneau said. \"As a professor of astronomy, I'm actually teaching a course in the spring on planet formation and you can bet the freshman in my class are going to be quick to point out how the model of the formation of the solar system is deeply challenged by the discovery that's being presented today.\" Kepler, equipped with a 95-megapixel digital camera, was launched from Cape Canaveral on March 6, 2009. The camera is aimed at a patch of sky in the northern constellation Cygnus the size of an outstretched hand that contains more than 4.5 million detectable stars. Of that total, some 300,000 are believed to be the right age and to have the right composition and the proper brightness to host Earth-like planets. More than 156,000 of those, ranging from 600 to 3,000 light years away, will be actively monitored by Kepler over the life of its mission. To find candidate planets, the spacecraft's camera monitors the brightness of target stars in the instrument's wide field of view, on the lookout for slight changes that might indicate a world passing between the star and the telescope. By studying the slight dimming, and by timing repeated cycles, computers can identify potential extra-solar worlds even though the planets themselves cannot be seen. Before a candidate planet can be confirmed, the data must be reviewed by other astronomers and results compared to findings by other telescopes and satellites. As of today, Kepler has found 33 confirmed planets and 2,326 candidates. Astronomers expect many more confirmations as data analysis continues. \"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\" Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University, said in a NASA statement. \"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\" Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C., told reporters the big question underlying the Kepler research is \"are we alone in our universe?

This separation of rocky planets and gas giants in the solar system really drives our understanding of planet formation and is one of the key features that we try to explain when we try to understand the formation of the solar system.\" In the case of Kepler-20, a Neptune-size gas giant is the innermost of the five known worlds, followed by Kepler-20e, another Neptune-like world, Kepler-20f, and then another gas giant. \"I really want to dare my fellow astronomers to try to explain how this system could have formed and I think it's fair to say I need help,\" Charbonneau said. \"As a professor of astronomy, I'm actually teaching a course in the spring on planet formation and you can bet the freshman in my class are going to be quick to point out how the model of the formation of the solar system is deeply challenged by the discovery that's being presented today.\" Kepler, equipped with a 95-megapixel digital camera, was launched from Cape Canaveral on March 6, 2009. The camera is aimed at a patch of sky in the northern constellation Cygnus the size of an outstretched hand that contains more than 4.5 million detectable stars. Of that total, some 300,000 are believed to be the right age and to have the right composition and the proper brightness to host Earth-like planets. More than 156,000 of those, ranging from 600 to 3,000 light years away, will be actively monitored by Kepler over the life of its mission. To find candidate planets, the spacecraft's camera monitors the brightness of target stars in the instrument's wide field of view, on the lookout for slight changes that might indicate a world passing between the star and the telescope. By studying the slight dimming, and by timing repeated cycles, computers can identify potential extra-solar worlds even though the planets themselves cannot be seen. Before a candidate planet can be confirmed, the data must be reviewed by other astronomers and results compared to findings by other telescopes and satellites. As of today, Kepler has found 33 confirmed planets and 2,326 candidates. Astronomers expect many more confirmations as data analysis continues. \"In the cosmic game of hide and seek, finding planets with just the right size and just the right temperature seems only a matter of time,\" Natalie Batalha, Kepler deputy science team lead and professor of astronomy and physics at San Jose State University, said in a NASA statement. \"We are on the edge of our seats knowing that Kepler's most anticipated discoveries are still to come.\" Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington, D.C., told reporters the big question underlying the Kepler research is \"are we alone in our universe? And so we ask, how are planets made, and when do they end up like the Earth, both in size and also in climate? This new Kepler finding has made a really big step in our understanding of these questions.\" She said astronomers believed solar systems likely followed the model seen in Earth's system, with small, rocky worlds orbiting close to their parent star and large gas giants orbiting much farther away, beyond the so-called \"ice line.\" Based on earlier observations that found multiple examples of Jupiter-class planets orbiting close to their parent stars, scientists believed such worlds could migrate inward over time, kicking out smaller planets closer in. \"But now, with this new Kepler finding comes a solar system that doesn't fit any mold we have,\" Elkins-Tanton said. \"The planets alternate big and little and are all so close to their star, this system forces us to change our ideas about how the planets are formed and how they reach stable orbits and where, indeed, there could be Earth-size rocky planets.\" Whether Earth's solar system is the exception or the rule remains to be seen.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepscicon-briefing.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Finds Three Smallest Exoplanets", "date": "2012-01-12", "content": "Astronomers using data from NASA's Kepler mission have discovered the three smallest planets yet detected orbiting a star beyond our sun. The planets orbit a single star, called KOI-961, and are 0.78, 0.73 and 0.57 times the radius of Earth. The smallest is about the size of Mars. All three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth, but orbit close to their star. That makes them too hot to be in the habitable zone, which is the region where liquid water could exist. Of the more than 700 planets confirmed to orbit other stars - called exoplanets - only a handful are known to be rocky. \"Astronomers are just beginning to confirm thousands of planet candidates uncovered by Kepler so far,\" said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\" Finding one as small as Mars is amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all around us.\" Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing, or transiting, planets. At least three transits are required to verify a signal as a planet. Follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes also are needed to confirm the discoveries. The latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The team used data publicly released by the Kepler mission, along with follow-up observations from the Palomar Observatory, near San Diego, and the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what originally was estimated. The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter. \"This is the tiniest solar system found so far,\" said John Johnson, the principal investigator of the research from NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"It's actually more similar to Jupiter and its moons in scale than any other planetary system. The discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.\" Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets. \"These types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe,\" said Phil Muirhead, lead author of the new study from Caltech. \"This is a really exciting time for planet hunters.\" The discovery follows a string of recent milestones for the Kepler mission. In December 2011, scientists announced the mission's first confirmed planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star: a planet 2.4 times the size of Earth called Kepler-22b. Later in the month, the team announced the discovery of the first Earth-size planets orbiting a sun-like star outside our solar system, called Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f. For the latest discovery, the team obtained the sizes of the three planets called KOI-961.01, KOI-961.02 and KOI-961.03 with the help of a well-studied twin star to KOI-961, or Barnard's Star. By better understanding the KOI-961 star, they then could determine how big the planets must be to have caused the observed dips in starlight.

Steve Kawaler, an Iowa State University professor of physics and astronomy, was part of the research team that provided information about the properties of the planets' host star. He and other researchers measured changes in the star's brightness to precisely identify the size, mass and age of the host star. Kawaler explained the importance of the discovery: \"Small, rocky planets should form in the hot part of the solar system, close to their host star - like Mercury, Venus and Earth in our Solar System. Bigger, less dense planets - Jupiter, Uranus - can only form farther away from their host, where it is cool enough for volatile material like water ice, and methane ice to collect. In some cases, these large planets can migrate close in after they form, during the last stages of planet formation, but in so doing they should eject or destroy the low-mass inner planets. \"Here, we have a pair of planets in nearby orbits but with very different densities. How they both got there and survived is a mystery.\" The discovery was made possible by NASA's Kepler Mission, a spacecraft launched in 2009 that's carrying a photometer to measure changes in star brightness. Its primary job is to use tiny variations in the brightness of the stars within its view to find earth-like planets that might be able to support life. The Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation is also using data from that photometer to study star oscillations, or changes in brightness, that offer clues to a star's interior structure. The investigation is led by a four-member steering committee: Kawaler, Chair Ron Gilliland of the Space Telescope Science Institute based in Baltimore, Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard and Hans Kjeldsen, both of Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark. Kawaler said the Kepler spacecraft was essential to discovering what the researchers called in their paper \"this puzzling pair of planets.\" \"The seismic signal is very small, and only Kepler has the sensitivity and persistence to reveal it,\" Kawaler said. \"Also, the transit signal from the planets crossing in front of the star is very small, and only visible with Kepler's level of sensitivity.\"", "url": "https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2012/06/21/kepler-36"}, {"title": "NASA's Kepler Space Telescope finds Multiple Planets orbiting two suns in the constellation cygnus", "date": "2012-08-29", "content": "Coming less than a year after the announcement of the first circumbinary planet, Kepler-16b, NASA's Kepler mission has discovered multiple transiting planets orbiting two suns for the first time.

This discovery proves that more than one planet can form and persist in the stressful realm of a binary star and demonstrates the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy. Astronomers detected two planets in the Kepler-47 system, a pair of orbiting stars that eclipse each other every 7.5 days from our vantage point on Earth. One star is similar to the sun in size, but only 84 percent as bright. The second star is diminutive, measuring only one-third the size of the sun and less than 1 percent as bright. \"In contrast to a single planet orbiting a single star, the planet in a circumbinary system must transit a 'moving target.'

While it cannot be directly viewed, it is thought to be a sweltering world, where the destruction of methane in its super-heated atmosphere might lead to a thick haze that could blanket the planet. At three times the radius of Earth, Kepler-47b is the smallest known transiting circumbinary planet. The outer planet, Kepler-47c, orbits its host pair every 303 days, placing it in the so-called \"habitable zone,\" the region in a planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of a planet. While not a world hospitable for life, Kepler-47c is thought to be a gaseous giant slightly larger than Neptune, where an atmosphere of thick bright water-vapor clouds might exist. \"Unlike our sun, many stars are part of multiple-star systems where two or more stars orbit one another.

Similar to a debris-trailing comet, the super Mercury-size planet candidate is theorized to fashion a dusty tail. But the tail won't last for long. Scientists calculate that, at the current rate of evaporation, the dusty world could be completely vaporized within 200 million years. A research team led by Saul Rappaport, professor emeritus of physics at MIT, Cambridge, Mass., has identified an unusual light pattern emanating from a star named KIC 12557548 in the Kepler space telescope's field-of-view. NASA's Kepler space telescope detects planets and planet candidates by measuring dips in the brightness of more than 150,000 stars to search for planets crossing in front, or transiting, their stars. \"The bizarre nature of the light output from this star with its precisely periodic transit-like features and highly variable depths exemplifies how Kepler is expanding the frontiers of science in unexpected ways,\" said Jon Jenkins, Kepler co-investigator at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. \"This discovery pulls back the curtain of how science works in the face of surprising data.\" Orbiting a star smaller and cooler than our sun, the planet candidate completes its orbit in less than 16 hours- making it one of the shortest orbits ever detected. At an orbital distance of only twice the diameter of its star, the surface temperature of the planet is estimated to be a smoldering 3,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists hypothesize that the star-facing side of the potentially rocky inferno is an ocean of seething magma. The surface melts and evaporates at such high temperatures that the energy from the resulting wind is enough to allow dust and gas to escape into space.

The findings are published in the journal Science. \"The presence of a full-fledged circumbinary planetary system orbiting Kepler-47 is an amazing discovery,\" said Greg Laughlin, professor of Astrophysics and Planetary Science at the University of California in Santa Cruz. \"These planets are very difficult to form using the currently accepted paradigm, and I believe that theorists, myself included, will be going back to the drawing board to try to improve our understanding of how planets are assembled in dusty circumbinary disks.\" Ames manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis.

The planets are located in a system called Kepler-37, about 210 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. The smallest planet, Kepler-37b, is slightly larger than our moon, measuring about one-third the size of Earth. It is smaller than Mercury, which made its detection a challenge. The moon-size planet and its two companion planets were found by scientists with NASA's Kepler mission, which is designed to find Earth-sized planets in or near the \"habitable zone,\" the region in a planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of an orbiting planet. However, while the star in Kepler-37 may be similar to our sun, the system appears quite unlike the solar system in which we live. Astronomers think Kepler-37b does not have an atmosphere and cannot support life as we know it. The tiny planet almost certainly is rocky in composition. Kepler-37c, the closer neighboring planet, is slightly smaller than Venus, measuring almost three-quarters the size of Earth. Kepler-37d, the farther planet, is twice the size of Earth. The first exoplanets found to orbit a normal star were giants. As technologies have advanced, smaller and smaller planets have been found, and Kepler has shown that even Earth-size exoplanets are common. \"Even Kepler can only detect such a tiny world around the brightest stars it observes,\" said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"The fact we've discovered tiny Kepler-37b suggests such little planets are common, and more planetary wonders await as we continue to gather and analyze additional data.\" Kepler-37's host star belongs to the same class as our sun, although it is slightly cooler and smaller. All three planets orbit the star at less than the distance Mercury is to the sun, suggesting they are very hot, inhospitable worlds. Kepler-37b orbits every 13 days at less than one-third Mercury's distance from the sun. The estimated surface temperature of this smoldering planet, at more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Kelvin), would be hot enough to melt the zinc in a penny. Kepler-37c and Kepler-37d, orbit every 21 days and 40 days, respectively. \"We uncovered a planet smaller than any in our solar system orbiting one of the few stars that is both bright and quiet, where signal detection was possible,\" said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Sonoma, Calif., and lead author of the new study published in the journal Nature. \"This discovery shows close-in planets can be smaller, as well as much larger, than planets orbiting our sun.\" The research team used data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To learn more about the properties of the star Kepler-37, scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star. They probed the interior structure of Kepler-37's star just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface. The waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Like bells in a steeple, small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. With the very high precision of the Kepler instrument, astronomers have reached a new milestone.

The Kepler-62 system has five planets; 62b, 62c, 62d, 62e and 62f. The Kepler-69 system has two planets; 69b and 69c. Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are the super-Earth-sized planets. Two of the newly discovered planets orbit a star smaller and cooler than the sun. Kepler-62f is only 40 percent larger than Earth, making it the exoplanet closest to the size of our planet known in the habitable zone of another star. Kepler-62f is likely to have a rocky composition. Kepler-62e, orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone and is roughly 60 percent larger than Earth. The third planet, Kepler-69c, is 70 percent larger than the size of Earth, and orbits in the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun. Astronomers are uncertain about the composition of Kepler-69c, but its orbit of 242 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our neighboring planet Venus.

Kepler-62b, Kepler-62c and Kepler-62d, orbit every five, 12, and 18 days, respectively, making them very hot and inhospitable for life as we know it. The five planets of the Kepler-62 system orbit a star classified as a K2 dwarf, measuring just two-thirds the size of the sun and only one-fifth as bright. At seven billion years old, the star is somewhat older than the sun. It is about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. A companion to Kepler-69c, known as Kepler-69b, is more than twice the size of Earth and whizzes around its star every 13 days.

The resulting dip in the brightness of the starlight reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. Using the transit method, Kepler has detected 2,740 candidates. Using various analysis techniques, ground telescopes and other space assets, 122 planets have been confirmed. Early in the mission, the Kepler telescope primarily found large, gaseous giants in very close orbits of their stars. Known as \"hot Jupiters,\" these are easier to detect due to their size and very short orbital periods. Earth would take three years to accomplish the three transits required to be accepted as a planet candidate.

But he and others said that if engineers could not restore the wheel or find some other way to keep the spacecraft's telescope precisely pointed, the failure could end one of the most romantic and successful of NASA's missions: the search for Earth-like planets in habitable orbits around other stars. Just last month, astronomers reported that Kepler had found two planets, only slightly larger than Earth, orbiting a star 1,200 light-years from here in the Goldilocks zone, where liquid water is possible. More potentially habitable planets, even smaller and more Earth-like, lurk in the pipeline, astronomers say, but have not yet been confirmed. \"We believe there are planets there that we haven't found yet,\" said William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Center, the founder and leader of the Kepler effort. As word leaked about the possible loss of Kepler, the mood in the astronomical community was grim. \"It was one of those things that was a gift to humanity,\" said one astronomer, who spoke on condition of anonymity before NASA made the news public. \"We're all going to lose, for sure.\" Kepler, launched in March 2009, orbits the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Its mission is to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earth-like planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns. The spacecraft has identified 130 planets and 2,740 other candidates. About 230 are the size of Earth, and 820 others are only twice as big as Earth and are probably rocky worlds similar to our own, Mr. Borucki said. Kepler's mission has cost $600 million so far. It was designed to operate for four years, but last year it was extended three more years, until 2016. Since the Earth transits the Sun only once a year, two more years would give astronomers a chance to see more transits of the planets they are looking for, ones with orbits similar to our own. Without the extra time, the data will be noisy, astronomers say, so the answer will be a little more uncertain than it might have been. Geoffrey Marcy, a Kepler astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said that without more data coming from Kepler, he thought astronomers would be \"right on the edge\" of answering the question of how common other Earths are, but with less statistical certainty than originally desired. In January, engineers noticed that one of the reaction wheels that keep the spacecraft pointed was experiencing too much friction. They shut down the spacecraft for a couple of weeks to give it a rest, in the hope that the wheel's lubricant would spread out and solve the problem. But when they turned it back on, the friction was still there. Until now, the problem had not interfered with observations, but on Tuesday, the spacecraft went into a so-called safe mode, and the engineers determined that the reaction wheel had stopped. Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, but one failed last year after showing signs of erratic friction. Three wheels are required to keep Kepler properly and precisely aimed, and now there are only two. The lack of three working wheels probably robs it of the ability to point precisely enough to detect Earth-size planets. Project managers hope to remedy the situation by rocking the wheel back and forth, or perhaps resurrecting the wheel that failed last year, an effort that will probably take several months, according to Kepler's deputy project manager, Charles Sobeck of the Ames Research Center. It would take that long as well to figure out what else the telescope, which is itself in fine condition, can be used for if it can no longer hunt planets. Mr. Borucki said that the Kepler project had been a long journey - and a phenomenal success - and that he was not ready to pronounce it over. When Kepler was conceived, he said, nobody knew if any other stars had planets; now we know that almost every star in the galaxy has a planet and that the nearest exoplanet might be only 10 light-years away. \"I'm delighted and surprised with what we have done,\" he said. For Mr. Grunsfeld, who played mechanic to the Hubble telescope during several lengthy spacewalks, the Kepler malfunction looked particularly frustrating. \"Unfortunately, it's not in a place where I can go and fix it,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/science/space/equipment-failure-may-cut-kepler-mission-short.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler Mission Discovers Tiny Planet System", "date": "2013-02-20", "content": "NASA's Kepler mission scientists have discovered a new planetary system that is home to the smallest planet yet found around a star similar to our sun. The planets are located in a system called Kepler-37, about 210 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. The smallest planet, Kepler-37b, is slightly larger than our moon, measuring about one-third the size of Earth. It is smaller than Mercury, which made its detection a challenge. The moon-size planet and its two companion planets were found by scientists with NASA's Kepler mission, which is designed to find Earth-sized planets in or near the \"habitable zone,\" the region in a planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of an orbiting planet. However, while the star in Kepler-37 may be similar to our sun, the system appears quite unlike the solar system in which we live. Astronomers think Kepler-37b does not have an atmosphere and cannot support life as we know it. The tiny planet almost certainly is rocky in composition. Kepler-37c, the closer neighboring planet, is slightly smaller than Venus, measuring almost three-quarters the size of Earth. Kepler-37d, the farther planet, is twice the size of Earth. The first exoplanets found to orbit a normal star were giants. As technologies have advanced, smaller and smaller planets have been found, and Kepler has shown that even Earth-size exoplanets are common. \"Even Kepler can only detect such a tiny world around the brightest stars it observes,\" said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"The fact we've discovered tiny Kepler-37b suggests such little planets are common, and more planetary wonders await as we continue to gather and analyze additional data.\" Kepler-37's host star belongs to the same class as our sun, although it is slightly cooler and smaller. All three planets orbit the star at less than the distance Mercury is to the sun, suggesting they are very hot, inhospitable worlds. Kepler-37b orbits every 13 days at less than one-third Mercury's distance from the sun. The estimated surface temperature of this smoldering planet, at more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Kelvin), would be hot enough to melt the zinc in a penny. Kepler-37c and Kepler-37d, orbit every 21 days and 40 days, respectively. \"We uncovered a planet smaller than any in our solar system orbiting one of the few stars that is both bright and quiet, where signal detection was possible,\" said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Sonoma, Calif., and lead author of the new study published in the journal Nature. \"This discovery shows close-in planets can be smaller, as well as much larger, than planets orbiting our sun.\" The research team used data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To learn more about the properties of the star Kepler-37, scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star. They probed the interior structure of Kepler-37's star just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface. The waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Like bells in a steeple, small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. With the very high precision of the Kepler instrument, astronomers have reached a new milestone. The star Kepler-37, with a radius just three-quarters of the sun, now is the smallest bell in the asteroseismology steeple. The radius of the star is known to three percent accuracy, which translates to exceptional accuracy in the planet's size.

The Kepler-62 system has five planets; 62b, 62c, 62d, 62e and 62f. The Kepler-69 system has two planets; 69b and 69c. Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are the super-Earth-sized planets. Two of the newly discovered planets orbit a star smaller and cooler than the sun. Kepler-62f is only 40 percent larger than Earth, making it the exoplanet closest to the size of our planet known in the habitable zone of another star. Kepler-62f is likely to have a rocky composition. Kepler-62e, orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone and is roughly 60 percent larger than Earth. The third planet, Kepler-69c, is 70 percent larger than the size of Earth, and orbits in the habitable zone of a star similar to our sun. Astronomers are uncertain about the composition of Kepler-69c, but its orbit of 242 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our neighboring planet Venus. Scientists do not know whether life could exist on the newfound planets, but their discovery signals we are another step closer to finding a world similar to Earth around a star like our sun. \"The Kepler spacecraft has certainly turned out to be a rock star of science,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The discovery of these rocky planets in the habitable zone brings us a bit closer to finding a place like home. It is only a matter of time before we know if the galaxy is home to a multitude of planets like Earth, or if we are a rarity.\" The Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars, is NASA's first mission capable of detecting Earth-size planets around stars like our sun. Orbiting its star every 122 days, Kepler-62e was the first of these habitable zone planets identified. Kepler-62f, with an orbital period of 267 days, was later found by Eric Agol, associate professor of astronomy at the University of Washington and co-author of a paper on the discoveries published in the journal Science. The size of Kepler-62f is now measured, but its mass and composition are not. However, based on previous studies of rocky exoplanets similar in size, scientists are able to estimate its mass by association. \"The detection and confirmation of planets is an enormously collaborative effort of talent and resources, and requires expertise from across the scientific community to produce these tremendous results,\" said William Borucki, Kepler science principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author of the Kepler-62 system paper in Science. \"Kepler has brought a resurgence of astronomical discoveries and we are making excellent progress toward determining if planets like ours are the exception or the rule.\" The two habitable zone worlds orbiting Kepler-62 have three companions in orbits closer to their star, two larger than the size of Earth and one about the size of Mars. Kepler-62b, Kepler-62c and Kepler-62d, orbit every five, 12, and 18 days, respectively, making them very hot and inhospitable for life as we know it. The five planets of the Kepler-62 system orbit a star classified as a K2 dwarf, measuring just two-thirds the size of the sun and only one-fifth as bright. At seven billion years old, the star is somewhat older than the sun. It is about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. A companion to Kepler-69c, known as Kepler-69b, is more than twice the size of Earth and whizzes around its star every 13 days. The Kepler-69 planets' host star belongs to the same class as our sun, called G-type. It is 93 percent the size of the sun and 80 percent as luminous and is located approximately 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. \"We only know of one star that hosts a planet with life, the sun.

Its mission is to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earth-like planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns. The spacecraft has identified 130 planets and 2,740 other candidates. About 230 are the size of Earth, and 820 others are only twice as big as Earth and are probably rocky worlds similar to our own, Mr. Borucki said. Kepler's mission has cost $600 million so far. It was designed to operate for four years, but last year it was extended three more years, until 2016. Since the Earth transits the Sun only once a year, two more years would give astronomers a chance to see more transits of the planets they are looking for, ones with orbits similar to our own. Without the extra time, the data will be noisy, astronomers say, so the answer will be a little more uncertain than it might have been. Geoffrey Marcy, a Kepler astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said that without more data coming from Kepler, he thought astronomers would be \"right on the edge\" of answering the question of how common other Earths are, but with less statistical certainty than originally desired. In January, engineers noticed that one of the reaction wheels that keep the spacecraft pointed was experiencing too much friction. They shut down the spacecraft for a couple of weeks to give it a rest, in the hope that the wheel's lubricant would spread out and solve the problem. But when they turned it back on, the friction was still there. Until now, the problem had not interfered with observations, but on Tuesday, the spacecraft went into a so-called safe mode, and the engineers determined that the reaction wheel had stopped. Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, but one failed last year after showing signs of erratic friction. Three wheels are required to keep Kepler properly and precisely aimed, and now there are only two. The lack of three working wheels probably robs it of the ability to point precisely enough to detect Earth-size planets. Project managers hope to remedy the situation by rocking the wheel back and forth, or perhaps resurrecting the wheel that failed last year, an effort that will probably take several months, according to Kepler's deputy project manager, Charles Sobeck of the Ames Research Center. It would take that long as well to figure out what else the telescope, which is itself in fine condition, can be used for if it can no longer hunt planets. Mr. Borucki said that the Kepler project had been a long journey - and a phenomenal success - and that he was not ready to pronounce it over. When Kepler was conceived, he said, nobody knew if any other stars had planets; now we know that almost every star in the galaxy has a planet and that the nearest exoplanet might be only 10 light-years away. \"I'm delighted and surprised with what we have done,\" he said.

That's because Kepler orbits the sun rather than Earth and is currently millions of miles from our planet. Looking ahead: The focus has now shifted to examining what Kepler can accomplish with just two healthy wheels and its thrusters, Hertz added.

Depending on the outcome of these studies, which are expected to be completed later this year, NASA will assess the scientific priority of a two-wheel Kepler mission. Such an assessment may include prioritization relative to other NASA astrophysics missions competing for operational funding at the NASA Senior Review board early next year. From the data collected in the first half of its mission, Kepler has confirmed 135 exoplanets and identified over 3,500 candidates. The team continues to analyze all four years of collected data, expecting hundreds, if not thousands, of new discoveries including the long-awaited Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars. Though the spacecraft will no longer operate with its unparalleled precision pointing, scientists expect Kepler's most interesting discoveries are still to come.  Meanwhile, preparations are underway for hosting the second Kepler Science Conference Nov. 4-8, at NASA's Ames Research Center.

NASA has given up hope of restoring the Kepler spacecraft to full health and is now attempting to determine what the observatory can accomplish in its compromised state, agency officials announced today (Aug. 15). \"We are now moving on to the next phase of Kepler's mission, because that's what the data requires us to do,\" Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, told reporters during a press conference today. \"This is not the last you'll hear from Kepler. There's a huge amount of data collected that we'll continue to analyze.\" Balky wheels: The $600 million Kepler mission launched in March 2009 on a 3.5-year prime mission to determine how commonly Earth-like planets occur around the Milky Way galaxy. Kepler detects exoplanets by noting the tiny brightness dips caused when these worlds cross in front of, or transit, their parent stars. The observatory needs three working reaction wheels - gyroscope-like devices that maintain Kepler's position in space - to do this precision work. Kepler had four of these wheels when it launched - three for immediate use and one spare. But one wheel, known as number 2, failed in July 2012. And then wheel four conked out on May 11 of this year, halting the spacecraft's planet hunt. Mission engineers have since managed to get those two malfunctioning wheels spinning again, but both of them still exhibit too much friction to support Kepler's fine-pointing work. So the observatory's original mission is over, officials said today. \"We do not believe that we can recover three-wheel operations, or Kepler's original science mission,\" Hertz said. Sending astronauts out to fix Kepler, as was done five times with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, is not an option. That's because Kepler orbits the sun rather than Earth and is currently millions of miles from our planet. Looking ahead: The focus has now shifted to examining what Kepler can accomplish with just two healthy wheels and its thrusters, Hertz added. To that end, NASA is conducting two separate studies: an engineering assessment to see what the spacecraft is capable of, and a science study to determine if a modified mission is worth funding. (It currently costs about $18 million per year to operate the telescope.) Both studies are due in the fall, Hertz said. \"NASA may use a senior review to help us prioritize a two-wheel Kepler mission against the continued operation of other NASA astrophysics missions,\" he said. \"Only after weighing these considerations will NASA be in a position to make a decision on the future of Kepler operations.\" There are a variety of possible uses for Kepler in the future, mission scientists say. The observatory could scan the heavens for asteroids, comets and supernova explosions, for example. And it may still be able to detect huge alien planets using a technique called gravitational microlensing. (In this method, astronomers watch what happens when a massive object passes in front of a star; the closer object's gravitational field bends and magnifies the star's light, acting like a lens.) But it's still to soon to tell which, of any, of these missions will pan out. \"Until we have analyzed the full capability of the mission and we have looked at what the requirements are in terms of guidance, we really have no way no way of knowing which of these missions would be practical,\" said Kepler principal investigator Bill Borucki, of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.", "url": "https://www.space.com/22387-nasa-planet-hunting-kepler-spacecraft-problems.html"}, {"title": "A Sunny Outlook for NASA Kepler's Second Light", "date": "2013-11-26", "content": "You may have thought that NASA's Kepler spacecraft was finished. Well, think again. A repurposed Kepler Space telescope may soon start searching the sky again. A new mission concept, dubbed K2, would continue Kepler's search for other worlds, and introduce new opportunities to observe star clusters, young and old stars, active galaxies and supernovae. In May, the Kepler spacecraft lost the second of four gyroscope-like reaction wheels, which are used to precisely point the spacecraft, ending new data collection for the original mission. The spacecraft required three functioning wheels to maintain the precision pointing necessary to detect the signal of small Earth-sized exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, orbiting stars like our sun in what's known as the habitable zone -- the range of distances from a star where the surface temperature of a planet might be suitable for liquid water. With the failure of a second reaction wheel, the spacecraft can no longer precisely point at the mission's original field of view. The culprit is none other than our own sun. The very body that provides Kepler with its energy needs also pushes the spacecraft around by the pressure exerted when the photons of sunlight strike the spacecraft. Without a third wheel to help counteract the solar pressure, the spacecraft's ultra-precise pointing capability cannot be controlled in all directions. However, Kepler mission and Ball Aerospace engineers have developed an innovative way of recovering pointing stability by maneuvering the spacecraft so that the solar pressure is evenly distributed across the surfaces of the spacecraft. To achieve this level of stability, the orientation of the spacecraft must be nearly parallel to its orbital path around the sun, which is slightly offset from the ecliptic, the orbital plane of Earth. The ecliptic plane defines the band of sky in which lie the constellations of the zodiac. This technique of using the sun as the 'third wheel' to control pointing is currently being tested on the spacecraft and early results are already coming in. During a pointing performance test in late October, a full frame image of the space telescope's full field of view was captured showing part of the constellation Sagittarius. Photons of light from a distant star field were collected over a 30-minute period and produced an image quality within five percent of the primary mission image quality, which used four reaction wheels to control pointing stability. Additional testing is underway to demonstrate the ability to maintain this level of pointing control for days and weeks. To capture the telltale signature of a distant planet as it crosses the face of its host star and temporarily blocks the amount of starlight collected by Kepler, the spacecraft must maintain pointing stability over these longer periods. \"This 'second light' image provides a successful first step in a process that may yet result in new observations and continued discoveries from the Kepler space telescope,\" said Charlie Sobeck, Kepler deputy project manager at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA.

A decision to proceed to the 2014 Senior Review - a biennial assessment of operating missions - and propose for budget to fly K2 is expected by the end of 2013. Kepler's original mission, which is still in progress to fully process the wealth of data collected, is to determine what percentage of stars like the sun harbor small planets the approximate size and surface temperature of Earth. For four years, the space telescope simultaneously and continuously monitored the brightness of more than 150,000 stars, recording a measurement every 30 minutes.

Two of Kepler's four gyroscope-like reaction wheels, which are used to precisely point the spacecraft, have failed. The first was lost in July 2012, and the second in May. Engineers' efforts to restore at least one of the wheels have been unsuccessful. Kepler completed its prime mission in November 2012 and began its four-year extended mission at that time. However, the spacecraft needs three functioning wheels to continue its search for Earth-sized exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, orbiting stars like our sun in what's known as the habitable zone -- the range of distances from a star where the surface temperature of a planet might be suitable for liquid water. As scientists analyze previously collected data, the Kepler team also is looking into whether the space telescope can conduct a different type of science program, potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters. \"Kepler has made extraordinary discoveries in finding exoplanets including several super-Earths in the habitable zone,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Knowing that Kepler has successfully collected all the data from its prime mission, I am confident that more amazing discoveries are on the horizon.\" On Aug. 8, engineers conducted a system-level performance test to evaluate Kepler's current capabilities. They determined wheel 2, which failed last year, can no longer provide the precision pointing necessary for science data collection. The spacecraft was returned to its point rest state, which is a stable configuration where Kepler uses thrusters to control its pointing with minimal fuel use. \"At the beginning of our mission, no one knew if Earth-size planets were abundant in the galaxy.

Known as K2, the proposed mission would use the hobbled space telescope, which launched in 2009 and lost most of its fine-pointing ability earlier this year when the second of its four reaction wheels broke down, to continue scanning for Earth-like planets orbiting the habitable zone of faraway stars. The K2 mission would be entirely operated by guest observers, who would compete for observing time on the roughly 1-meter diameter telescope. Under the yet-to-be-approved plan, Kepler would shift its focus from a narrow swath of sky to five or six fields of view aligned roughly with Earth's orbit, or ecliptic plane. In the K2 configuration, Kepler would scan one field of view for 80 days before beaming data back to Earth. The craft would depend on its thrusters and pressure from photons emanating from the sun to maneuver in space. However, the K2 plan will only work \"if we get through the senior review process and the panel agrees to fund us,\" Steven Howell, Kepler project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., said here Jan. 6 at a town hall forum held during the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting.

Thanks to NASA's Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes, scientists have made the most precise measurement ever of the radius of a planet outside our solar system. The size of the exoplanet, dubbed Kepler-93b, is now known to an uncertainty of just 74 miles (119 kilometers) on either side of the planetary body. The findings confirm Kepler-93b as a \"super-Earth\" that is about one-and-a-half times the size of our planet. Although super-Earths are common in the galaxy, none exist in our solar system. Exoplanets like Kepler-93b are therefore our only laboratories to study this major class of planet. With good limits on the sizes and masses of super-Earths, scientists can finally start to theorize about what makes up these weird worlds. Previous measurements, by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, had put Kepler-93b's mass at about 3.8 times that of Earth. The density of Kepler-93b, derived from its mass and newly obtained radius, indicates the planet is in fact very likely made of iron and rock, like Earth. \"With Kepler and Spitzer, we've captured the most precise measurement to date of an alien planet's size, which is critical for understanding these far-off worlds,\" said Sarah Ballard, a NASA Carl Sagan Fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle and lead author of a paper on the findings published in the Astrophysical Journal. \"The measurement is so precise that it's literally like being able to measure the height of a six-foot tall person to within three quarters of an inch -- if that person were standing on Jupiter,\" said Ballard. Kepler-93b orbits a star located about 300 light-years away, with approximately 90 percent of the sun's mass and radius. The exoplanet's orbital distance -- only about one-sixth that of Mercury's from the sun -- implies a scorching surface temperature around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit (760 degrees Celsius). Despite its newfound similarities in composition to Earth, Kepler-93b is far too hot for life. To make the key measurement about this toasty exoplanet's radius, the Kepler and Spitzer telescopes each watched Kepler-93b cross, or transit, the face of its star, eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight. Kepler's unflinching gaze also simultaneously tracked the dimming of the star caused by seismic waves moving within its interior. These readings encode precise information about the star's interior. The team leveraged them to narrowly gauge the star's radius, which is crucial for measuring the planetary radius. Spitzer, meanwhile, confirmed that the exoplanet's transit looked the same in infrared light as in Kepler's visible-light observations. These corroborating data from Spitzer -- some of which were gathered in a new, precision observing mode -- ruled out the possibility that Kepler's detection of the exoplanet was bogus, or a so-called false positive. Taken together, the data boast an error bar of just one percent of the radius of Kepler-93b. The measurements mean that the planet, estimated at about 11,700 miles (18,800 kilometers) in diameter, could be bigger or smaller by about 150 miles (240 kilometers), the approximate distance between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Spitzer racked up a total of seven transits of Kepler-93b between 2010 and 2011. Three of the transits were snapped using a \"peak-up\" observational technique. In 2011, Spitzer engineers repurposed the spacecraft's peak-up camera, originally used to point the telescope precisely, to control where light lands on individual pixels within Spitzer's infrared camera. The upshot of this rejiggering: Ballard and her colleagues were able to cut in half the range of uncertainty of the Spitzer measurements of the exoplanet radius, improving the agreement between the Spitzer and Kepler measurements. \"Ballard and her team have made a major scientific advance while demonstrating the power of Spitzer's new approach to exoplanet observations,\" said Michael Werner, project scientist for the Spitzer Space Telescope at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/the-most-precise-measurement-of-an-alien-worlds-size"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Exoplanet-Hunting Kepler Space Telescope Gets New Mission", "date": "2014-05-16", "content": "NASA's prolific Kepler spacecraft is back in action, a year after being sidelined by an equipment failure.

San Francisco State University astronomer Stephen Kane and a team of researchers presented today the definition of a \"Venus Zone,\" the area around a star in which a planet is likely to exhibit the unlivable conditions found on the planet Venus. The research will help astronomers determine which planets discovered with NASA's Kepler telescope - which has a primary mission of finding habitable planets similar to Earth - are actually more analogous to Earth's similarly-sized sister planet. Knowing how common Venus-like planets are elsewhere will also help astronomers understand why Earth's atmosphere evolved in ways vastly different from its neighbor. \"We believe the Earth and Venus had similar starts in terms of their atmospheric evolution,\" said Kane, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at SF State and lead author of the study published online today. \"Something changed at one point, and the obvious difference between the two is proximity to the Sun.\" The Kepler telescope is used to find planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets, located within or near the habitable zone in which a planet can hold liquid water on its surface. Earlier this year, Kane was part of an international team of researchers that discovered one such planet orbiting the dwarf star Kepler-186. The main way this search is conducted, however, is by looking for exoplanets that are roughly the same size as Earth. That, according to Kane, poses a problem because our own solar system contains two planets of the same size - Earth and Venus - that have vastly different atmospheric and surface conditions. \"The Earth is Dr. Jekyll and Venus is Mr. Hyde, and you can't distinguish between the two based only on size,\" said Kane, who runs a website tracking known exoplanets. \"So the question then is how do you define those differences, and how many 'Venuses' is Kepler actually finding?\" Kane and his fellow researchers at Penn State University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland used \"solar flux\" - or the amount of a star's energy that a planet receives - to define the inner and outer edges of the Venus Zone. The point at which a planet's atmosphere would experience runaway greenhouse-gas effects like those seen on Venus - a point located just inside Earth's orbit in our solar system - forms the outer boundary. The point at which the planet's atmosphere would be completely eroded away by the stellar energy marks the inner boundary. If Kepler astronomers discover a planet that is similar in size to Earth but located within the solar-flux range that makes up the Venus Zone, that could be a clue the planet is more like Venus than Earth, and therefore is uninhabitable. Future space-based telescopes will allow researchers to begin receiving data on these exoplanets' atmospheres, helping them confirm whether they are \"Venuses\" or \"Earths.\" \"If we find all of these planets in the Venus Zone have a runaway greenhouse-gas effect, then we know that the distance a planet is from its star is a major determining factor,\" Kane added. \"That's helpful to understanding the history between Venus and Earth.\" Future research will look at whether the amount of carbon in a planet's atmosphere impacts the boundaries of the Venus Zone, for example by pushing the outer boundary farther away from the star for planets with greater concentrations of carbon. \"This is ultimately about putting our solar system in context,\" according to Kane. \"We want to know if various aspects of our solar system are rare or common.\" \"On the frequency of potential Venus analogs from Kepler data\" by Stephen R.

Thanks to NASA's Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes, scientists have made the most precise measurement ever of the radius of a planet outside our solar system. The size of the exoplanet, dubbed Kepler-93b, is now known to an uncertainty of just 74 miles (119 kilometers) on either side of the planetary body. The findings confirm Kepler-93b as a \"super-Earth\" that is about one-and-a-half times the size of our planet. Although super-Earths are common in the galaxy, none exist in our solar system. Exoplanets like Kepler-93b are therefore our only laboratories to study this major class of planet. With good limits on the sizes and masses of super-Earths, scientists can finally start to theorize about what makes up these weird worlds. Previous measurements, by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, had put Kepler-93b's mass at about 3.8 times that of Earth. The density of Kepler-93b, derived from its mass and newly obtained radius, indicates the planet is in fact very likely made of iron and rock, like Earth. \"With Kepler and Spitzer, we've captured the most precise measurement to date of an alien planet's size, which is critical for understanding these far-off worlds,\" said Sarah Ballard, a NASA Carl Sagan Fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle and lead author of a paper on the findings published in the Astrophysical Journal. \"The measurement is so precise that it's literally like being able to measure the height of a six-foot tall person to within three quarters of an inch -- if that person were standing on Jupiter,\" said Ballard. Kepler-93b orbits a star located about 300 light-years away, with approximately 90 percent of the sun's mass and radius. The exoplanet's orbital distance -- only about one-sixth that of Mercury's from the sun -- implies a scorching surface temperature around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit (760 degrees Celsius). Despite its newfound similarities in composition to Earth, Kepler-93b is far too hot for life. To make the key measurement about this toasty exoplanet's radius, the Kepler and Spitzer telescopes each watched Kepler-93b cross, or transit, the face of its star, eclipsing a tiny portion of starlight. Kepler's unflinching gaze also simultaneously tracked the dimming of the star caused by seismic waves moving within its interior. These readings encode precise information about the star's interior. The team leveraged them to narrowly gauge the star's radius, which is crucial for measuring the planetary radius. Spitzer, meanwhile, confirmed that the exoplanet's transit looked the same in infrared light as in Kepler's visible-light observations. These corroborating data from Spitzer -- some of which were gathered in a new, precision observing mode -- ruled out the possibility that Kepler's detection of the exoplanet was bogus, or a so-called false positive.

Determining the size of an Earth-size exoplanet by the amount of starlight it blocks hundreds of light-years away once was the realm of science fiction. Measuring the mass of such a small planet based on its gravity was another level entirely, but astronomers have done just that for an exoplanet fifty percent the size of Earth. Researchers using NASA's Kepler mission data have measured the mass of a Mars-size exoplanet that is about one tenth the mass of Earth. Called Kepler-138b, it is the first exoplanet smaller than Earth to have both its mass and size measured. This significantly extends the range of planets with measured densities. To determine a planet's mass, astronomers typically measure the minuscule movement of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. For planets the mass of Earth detecting such a tiny tug is extraordinarily challenging with current technology. Fortunately, when a star hosts multiple planets that orbit closely together, scientists have developed another way to get at the planets' masses. Daniel Jontof-Hutter, a research associate at the Pennsylvania State University's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds, led a team of astronomers in a study to measure the mass of all three planets by precisely observing the times each planet passed in front of, or transited, the star Kepler-138. \"Each planet periodically slows down and accelerates ever so slightly from the gravity of its neighboring planets. The slight change in time between transits allows us to measure the masses of the planets,\" said Jontof-Hutter. Each time a planet transits a star it blocks a small fraction of the star's light, allowing astronomers to measure the size of the planet. This is how the Kepler spacecraft has detected thousands of planets around other stars. By measuring both the mass and size of an exoplanet, scientists can calculate the density and infer the bulk composition to determine if a planet is predominantly made of rock, water or gas. Tiny Kepler-138b's density is consistent with a rocky composition like Earth or Mars, but further observations are needed before astronomers can definitively say that it is a rocky world. Kepler-138b is the innermost of three planets that orbit Kepler-138, a star less than half the size of our sun and roughly 30 percent cooler. The Kepler-138 system is located about 200 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Lyra. The outer two planets, Kepler-138c and Kepler-138d, are approximately the size of Earth. Kepler-138c is likely to be rocky, whereas Kepler-138d is less dense and cannot be made of the same mix of material as Earth. All three planets orbit too close to their star for liquid water to exist on the surface and support life, as we know it. \"The substantial difference between the densities of the two larger planets tells us that not all planets similar to Earth in size are rocky,\" said Jack Lissauer, co-author and planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. \"Further study of small planets will help provide more understanding of the diversity that exists in nature, and will help determine if rocky planets like Earth are common or rare.\" Much like astronomers in the early 20th century studied a wide variety of stars to characterize and classify different types, astronomers in the 21st century are doing the same to understand the diversity and demographics of planet populations in our Milky Way galaxy.

A reaction wheel spins similar to a flywheel and is used to hold a spacecraft steady without the need for fuel. It makes a spacecraft lighter and can give them a much longer operational life. Kepler has four reaction wheels on board but needs three operational to be accurate. When the spacecraft lost two of its reaction wheels, the primary mission concluded.

Analysis of the combined data from the parent star and all three planets made the discovery possible. \"Each planet periodically slows down and accelerates ever so slightly from the gravity of its neighboring planets,\" said Jontof-Hutter, a research associate at the Pennsylvania State University's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds. \"The slight change in time between transits allows us to measure the masses of the planets.\" The new technique also allows scientists to accurately estimate the density of an exoplanet. With these combined measurements, scientists can infer the composition or material that makes up a particular object. High-density exoplanets are more likely to contain more metals than their less-dense counterparts. This type of discovery should allow scientists to look for ever smaller exoplanets transiting stars. By increasing the sensitivity of the measurements, scientists may one day be able to use the technique to determine with more certainty the habitability of any exoplanets that may be Earth-sized or smaller. Until this discovery, finding planets that were the size of the Earth was considered extremely difficult. Finding an Earth-sized or smaller exo-planet orbiting a star is far more challenging than finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. This new technique could, effectively, reduce the size of the haystack. The Kepler mission uses the transit method to discover these new worlds. This technique watches for the subtle changes in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it (as seen from Kepler's viewpoint). The technique has been used to find thousands of exoplanet candidates and has confirmed the existence of hundreds more. The spacecraft was launched in 2009 with a planned primary mission of 3.5 years. Kepler is equipped with a 3.1 ft (0.95 m) primary mirror and an X-band communications array. The main mission of the Kepler spacecraft ended in August 2013 when the number of reaction wheels dropped from the minimum needed to accurately lock onto candidate stars. A reaction wheel spins similar to a flywheel and is used to hold a spacecraft steady without the need for fuel. It makes a spacecraft lighter and can give them a much longer operational life. Kepler has four reaction wheels on board but needs three operational to be accurate. When the spacecraft lost two of its reaction wheels, the primary mission concluded. Engineers were not done with Kepler, however. They developed a new technique that allowed the spacecraft to remain stable enough for some observations using only two reaction wheels along with the assistance of the telescope's thrusters. The new mission was named K2, or \"Second Light\". This extended mission continues to find new planet candidates.", "url": "https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/space-observatories/kepler-data-helping-hone-in-on-other-earths/"}, {"title": "Nasa's Kepler mission discovers Earth's 'older and bigger cousin'", "date": "2015-07-23", "content": "Speaking at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Washington on Thursday, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate John Grunsfeld said the discovery of the exoplanet \"is a pretty close cousin of Earth.\" \"This exciting result brings us one step closer to finding an Earth 2.0,\" Grunsfeld said.

The weather forecast for faraway, blistering planets called \"hot Jupiters\" might go something like this: Cloudy nights and sunny days, with a high of 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,300 degrees Celsius, or 1,600 Kelvin). These mysterious worlds are too far away for us to see clouds in their atmospheres. But a recent study using NASA's Kepler space telescope and computer modeling techniques finds clues to where such clouds might gather and what they're likely made of. The study was published in the Astrophysical Journal. Hot Jupiters, among the first of the thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) discovered in our galaxy so far, orbit their stars so tightly that they are perpetually charbroiled. And while that might discourage galactic vacationers, the study represents a significant advance in understanding the structure of alien atmospheres. Endless days, endless nights: Hot Jupiters are tidally locked, meaning one side of the planet always faces its sun and the other is in permanent darkness. In most cases, the \"dayside\" would be largely cloud-free and the \"nightside\" heavily clouded, leaving partly cloudy skies for the zone in between, the study shows. \"The cloud formation is very different from what we know in the solar system,\" said Vivien Parmentier, a NASA Sagan Fellow and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, Tucson, who was the lead author of the study. A \"year\" on such a planet can be only a few Earth days long, the time the planet takes to whip once around its star. On a \"cooler\" hot Jupiter, temperatures of, say, 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit might prevail. But the extreme conditions on hot Jupiters worked to the scientists' advantage. \"The day-night radiation contrast is, in fact, easy to model,\" Parmentier said. \"[The hot Jupiters] are much easier to model than Jupiter itself.\" An eclipse, then blips: The scientists first created a variety of idealized hot Jupiters using global circulation models - simpler versions of the type of computer models used to simulate Earth's climate. Then they compared the models to the light Kepler detected from real hot Jupiters. Kepler, which is now operating in its K2 mission, was designed to register the extremely tiny dip in starlight when a planet passes in front of its star, which is called a \"transit.\" But in this case, researchers focused on the planets' \"phase curves,\" or changes in light as the planet passes through phases, like Earth's moon. Matching the modeled hot Jupiters to phase curves from real hot Jupiters revealed which curves were caused by the planet's heat, and which by light reflected by clouds in its atmosphere. By combining Kepler data with computer models, scientists were able to infer global cloud patterns on these distant worlds for the first time. The new cloud view allowed the team to draw conclusions about wind and temperature differences on the hot Jupiters they studied. Just before the hotter planets passed behind their stars - in a kind of eclipse - a blip in the planet's optical light curve revealed a \"hot spot\" on the planet's eastern side. And on cooler eclipsing planets, a blip was seen just after the planet re-emerged on the other side of the star, this time on the planet's western side. The early blip on hotter worlds reveals that powerful winds were pushing the hottest, cloud-free part of the atmosphere, normally found directly beneath its sun, to the east. Meanwhile, on cooler worlds, clouds could bunch up and reflect more light on the \"colder,\" western side of the planet, causing the post-eclipse blip. \"We're claiming that the west side of the planet's dayside is more cloudy than the east side,\" Parmentier said. While the puzzling pattern has been seen before, this research was the first to study all the hot Jupiters showing this behavior. This led to another first. By figuring out how clouds are distributed, which is intimately tied to the planet's overall temperature, scientists were able to determine what the clouds were probably made of. Just add manganese, and stir: Hot Jupiters are far too hot for water-vapor clouds like those on Earth. Instead, clouds on these planets are likely formed as exotic vapors condense to form minerals, chemical compounds like aluminum oxide, or even metals, like iron. The science team found that manganese sulfide clouds probably dominate on \"cooler\" hot Jupiters, while silicate clouds prevail at higher temperatures. On these planets, the silicates likely \"rain out\" into the planet's interior, vanishing from the observable atmosphere. In other words, a planet's average temperature, which depends on its distance from its star, governs the kinds of clouds that can form. That leads to different planets forming different types of clouds. \"Cloud composition changes with planet temperature,\" Parmentier said. \"The offsetting light curves tell the tale of cloud composition. It's super interesting, because cloud composition is very hard to get otherwise.\" The new results also show that clouds are not evenly distributed on hot Jupiters, echoing previous findings from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope suggesting that different parts of hot Jupiters have vastly different temperatures. The new findings come as we mark the 21st anniversary of exoplanet hunting. On October 6, 1995, a Swiss team announced the discovery of 51 Pegasi b, a hot Jupiter that was the first planet to be confirmed in orbit around a sun-like star. Parmentier and his team hope their revelations about the clouds on hot Jupiters could bring more detailed understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheres and their chemistry, a major goal of exoplanet atmospheric studies.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/kepler-helps-show-what-conditions-might-look-like-on-various-hot-jupiters/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Kepler discovers 'Tatooine' planet orbiting two suns", "date": "2016-06-15", "content": "Although we will never watch two suns rise and fall from the perspective of our own planet, like Luke Skywalker on Tatooine in the iconic scene from \"Star Wars: A New Hope,\" there's a newly discovered planet where aliens might do so.

The long-range global view of Kepler complements the close-in view of the Rosetta spacecraft, providing context for the high-resolution investigation Rosetta performed as it descended closer and closer to the comet. During the two-week period of study, Kepler took a picture of the comet every 30 minutes. The animation shows a period of 29.5 hours of observation from Sept. 17 through Sept. 18. The comet is seen passing through Kepler's field of view from top right to bottom left, as outlined by the diagonal strip.

The weather forecast for faraway, blistering planets called \"hot Jupiters\" might go something like this: Cloudy nights and sunny days, with a high of 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,300 degrees Celsius, or 1,600 Kelvin). These mysterious worlds are too far away for us to see clouds in their atmospheres. But a recent study using NASA's Kepler space telescope and computer modeling techniques finds clues to where such clouds might gather and what they're likely made of. The study was published in the Astrophysical Journal. Hot Jupiters, among the first of the thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) discovered in our galaxy so far, orbit their stars so tightly that they are perpetually charbroiled. And while that might discourage galactic vacationers, the study represents a significant advance in understanding the structure of alien atmospheres. Endless days, endless nights: Hot Jupiters are tidally locked, meaning one side of the planet always faces its sun and the other is in permanent darkness. In most cases, the \"dayside\" would be largely cloud-free and the \"nightside\" heavily clouded, leaving partly cloudy skies for the zone in between, the study shows. \"The cloud formation is very different from what we know in the solar system,\" said Vivien Parmentier, a NASA Sagan Fellow and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, Tucson, who was the lead author of the study. A \"year\" on such a planet can be only a few Earth days long, the time the planet takes to whip once around its star. On a \"cooler\" hot Jupiter, temperatures of, say, 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit might prevail. But the extreme conditions on hot Jupiters worked to the scientists' advantage. \"The day-night radiation contrast is, in fact, easy to model,\" Parmentier said. \"[The hot Jupiters] are much easier to model than Jupiter itself.\" An eclipse, then blips: The scientists first created a variety of idealized hot Jupiters using global circulation models - simpler versions of the type of computer models used to simulate Earth's climate. Then they compared the models to the light Kepler detected from real hot Jupiters. Kepler, which is now operating in its K2 mission, was designed to register the extremely tiny dip in starlight when a planet passes in front of its star, which is called a \"transit.\" But in this case, researchers focused on the planets' \"phase curves,\" or changes in light as the planet passes through phases, like Earth's moon. Matching the modeled hot Jupiters to phase curves from real hot Jupiters revealed which curves were caused by the planet's heat, and which by light reflected by clouds in its atmosphere. By combining Kepler data with computer models, scientists were able to infer global cloud patterns on these distant worlds for the first time. The new cloud view allowed the team to draw conclusions about wind and temperature differences on the hot Jupiters they studied. Just before the hotter planets passed behind their stars - in a kind of eclipse - a blip in the planet's optical light curve revealed a \"hot spot\" on the planet's eastern side. And on cooler eclipsing planets, a blip was seen just after the planet re-emerged on the other side of the star, this time on the planet's western side. The early blip on hotter worlds reveals that powerful winds were pushing the hottest, cloud-free part of the atmosphere, normally found directly beneath its sun, to the east. Meanwhile, on cooler worlds, clouds could bunch up and reflect more light on the \"colder,\" western side of the planet, causing the post-eclipse blip. \"We're claiming that the west side of the planet's dayside is more cloudy than the east side,\" Parmentier said. While the puzzling pattern has been seen before, this research was the first to study all the hot Jupiters showing this behavior. This led to another first. By figuring out how clouds are distributed, which is intimately tied to the planet's overall temperature, scientists were able to determine what the clouds were probably made of. Just add manganese, and stir: Hot Jupiters are far too hot for water-vapor clouds like those on Earth. Instead, clouds on these planets are likely formed as exotic vapors condense to form minerals, chemical compounds like aluminum oxide, or even metals, like iron. The science team found that manganese sulfide clouds probably dominate on \"cooler\" hot Jupiters, while silicate clouds prevail at higher temperatures. On these planets, the silicates likely \"rain out\" into the planet's interior, vanishing from the observable atmosphere. In other words, a planet's average temperature, which depends on its distance from its star, governs the kinds of clouds that can form. That leads to different planets forming different types of clouds. \"Cloud composition changes with planet temperature,\" Parmentier said. \"The offsetting light curves tell the tale of cloud composition. It's super interesting, because cloud composition is very hard to get otherwise.\" The new results also show that clouds are not evenly distributed on hot Jupiters, echoing previous findings from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope suggesting that different parts of hot Jupiters have vastly different temperatures. The new findings come as we mark the 21st anniversary of exoplanet hunting. On October 6, 1995, a Swiss team announced the discovery of 51 Pegasi b, a hot Jupiter that was the first planet to be confirmed in orbit around a sun-like star.

These planets are quite diverse and expected to play a large role in developing the research field of exoplanets and life in the Universe. The team involving researchers at the University of Tokyo and Astrobiology Center of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences investigated 227 exoplanet candidates based on data from second mission of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, as well as using other space telescopes and ground- based telescopes. They confirmed that 104 of them are really exoplanets.

About 170 million years later on February 4th, 2018, the light emanating from the explosion was received by an arsenal of high-powered telescopes. NASA's Kepler space telescope detected the unfurling light of SN 2018oh, as it has been labeled. The first ground-based facility to identify the signal was with the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova and soon observatories around the globe were monitoring the supernova as part of a unique scientific experiment designed to help solve the mystery of how stars explode. This image scenario leading to a particular kind of Type Ia supernova in which a single white dwarf siphons off so much material from its companion star that it can no longer sustain its own weight and blows up.It is one theory explaining the data from SN 2018oh.

When a massive star reaches the end of its life, a bright explosion expels stellar material into space, in what is known as a supernova. Using the now- retired Kepler telescope as well as ground-based telescopes, astronomers detected the bright light of a supernova called SN 2018oh on Feb. 4, 2018. While Kepler observed the star's minute changes in brightness during the very early moments of the stellar explosion, the ground-based telescopes tracked changes in color and the atomic composition of the dying star, according to a statement from NASA. \"With the combined data from these telescopes, astronomers achieved what they had hoped for - an unprecedented observation of the onset of a supernova,\" NASA officials said in the statement.
