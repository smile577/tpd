The Far West RTTC was a participant in the development of the Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal, one of three selected by NASA for further study. INSIDE Jupiter is a project proposed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The Far West RTTC will assist JPL with issues related to technology infusion, technology transfer and technology commercialization as they pertain to the INSIDE Jupiter mission. INSIDE Jupiter would send an orbiting spacecraft to Jupiter. The mission proposes to learn more about the internal structure of Jupiter by obtaining high-resolution maps of the magnetic and gravity fields. Total proposed mission cost is $296 million. Discovery supports lower-cost, highly focused rapid development scientific spacecraft missions. Each of the three selected proposals will receive $450,000 to conduct detailed mission concept and feasibility studies focusing on technical and management plans and costs. At the end of the feasibility study period, NASA will select one proposal to fly, with launch set for no later than 2006. Total mission costs under Discovery can not exceed $300 million. Other Discovery proposals selected for further feasibility analysis include NASA Ames Research Center's Kepler, a space telescope that would search for earth-sized planets around stars in the nearer reaches of our galaxy and Dawn, a UCLA-led mission to orbit Vesta and Ceres, two large asteroids. NASA also chose to fund one Mission of Opportunity under Discovery. This project, led by JPL, represents a U.S. contribution of scientific instruments to the French-led NetLander mission to Mars. In 2007, NetLander's orbiter and four landers will create the first science network on Mars to study the planet's internal structure. NASA has been operating its Discovery program since the mid-1990s. To date NASA has chosen to develop and fly eight Discovery missions. Among these are: Stardust, a JPL mission launched in 1999 and on course to rendezvous with comet Wild 2 in 2004 and return samples of dust gathered from the comet's tail. Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) is the first of the Discovery missions. Launched in 1996 NEAR has been orbiting the asteroid EROS for more than a year and taking photographs and scientific readings from as little as 4 miles above the surface of the asteroid. Deep Impact, another JPL mission that will fly to comet P/Tempel 1 and release a probe that will crash into the comet's surface and expose underlying material for analysis. Scheduled for launch in early 2004. Mars Pathfinder, the enormously successful and popular mission to the red planet carrying the small Sojourner robot. Sojourner roved about the Martian surface and returned imagery and data on chemical composition of the Martian soil and rocks.

The mission, named Juno, will be the first to perform an in-depth examination of the giant planet. The spacecraft will enter polar orbit around Jupiter to investigate whether the planet has an ice-rock core, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the atmosphere, study atmospheric convection and deep wind profiles, investigate the origin of the magnetic field and examine the polar magnetosphere. \"As the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter contains more matter than all the other planets combined,\" says Juno Principal Investigator Dr. Scott Bolton, director of the Space Science Department in the SwRI Space Science and Engineering Division. \"By determining how much water is in the planet, we complete the inventory of the key ingredients that make up the planet, and that will allow us to figure out the billion-year-old recipe that made the first planets in our solar system.\" The mission is the second in NASA's New Frontiers Program. Team members now begin a preliminary design study, leading up to a mission review to address schedule, technical and cost risks before NASA confirms the spacecraft for development. SwRI will also provide two science instruments for the mission. JADE, the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, will measure the auroral electron and ion populations along the planet's magnetic field lines and determine which particle populations create the jovian aurora. \"JADE will allow us to make the first direct measurements of the particles that precipitate into Jupiter's atmosphere and produce its stunning auroral displays,\" says Dr. David J. McComas, senior executive director of Space Science and Engineering, who serves as principal investigator of the instrument. The second instrument, the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS), will image ultraviolet emissions from the jovian aurora, allowing space scientists to relate these auroral observations with JADE observations of the particle populations that create them. \"The Juno UVS will provide Hubble-like images of Jupiter's powerful and dynamic aurora, but from the much better vantage points of directly above the north and south poles,\" says Dr. G. Randall Gladstone, an Institute scientist at SwRI who serves as the UVS principal investigator. For the Juno mission, SwRI is partnering with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which will manage the mission, and Lockheed Martin Space Systems, which will build the spacecraft. A number of U.S. and international scientists from other institutions will also participate. Launch of the $700 million mission will occur no later than June 30, 2010.

The mission is called Juno, and it is the second in NASA's New Frontiers Program. The mission will conduct an in-depth study of the giant planet. The mission proposes to place a spacecraft in a polar orbit around Jupiter to investigate the existence of an ice-rock core; determine the amount of global water and ammonia present in the atmosphere; study convection and deep wind profiles in the atmosphere; investigate the origin of the jovian magnetic field; and explore the polar magnetosphere. \"We are excited at the prospect of the new scientific understanding and discoveries by Juno in our continued exploration of the outer reaches of our solar system during the next decade,\" said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. At the end of the preliminary design study, the mission must pass a confirmation review that will address significant schedule, technical and cost risks before being confirmed for the development phase. Dr. Scott Bolton of Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, is the principal investigator. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., will provide mission project management. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, will build the spacecraft. NASA selected two proposed mission concepts for study in July 2004 from seven submitted in February 2004 in response to an agency Announcement of Opportunity. \"This was a very tough decision given the exciting and innovative nature of the two missions,\" Asrar added. The selected New Frontiers science mission must be ready for launch no later than June 30, 2010, within a mission cost cap of $700 million. The New Frontiers Program is designed to provide opportunities to conduct several of the medium-class missions identified as top priority objectives in the Decadal Solar System Exploration Survey, conducted by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council. The first NASA New Frontiers mission will fly by the Pluto-Charon system in 2014 and then target another Kuiper asteroid belt object.

The mission is called Juno, and its goal is to perform a detailed study of the giant planet Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft would be placed in a polar orbit around Jupiter. This would allow it to perform detailed gravitational measurements that could detect whether or not Jupiter has an ice-rock core beneath its clouds of hydrogen and helium. The mission will also study the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere, determining the amounts of water and ammonia present. Another investigation will be a study of convection within Jupiter's atmosphere and the profiles of deep winds. In addition, Juno will explore Jupiter's magnetosphere, especially in the unmapped polar regions, and attempt to determine the origin of the jovian magnetic field. The Principal Investigator for the Juno mission is Dr. Scott Bolton, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO. The mission's attempt to determine the amount of water present within Jupiter is especially intriguing, since Jupiter contains more matter than the rest of the planets in the solar system combined. Thus, once Jupiter's composition is more definitively known, scientists will have a better idea of how much water was available in the solar system during the early planet-building phases. Two instruments on the Juno mission are JADE, the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, and the Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS). JADE will study the population of particles which make up Jupiter's aurora by measuring electrons and ions along Jupiter's magnetic field lines. The UVS will work alongside JADE by taking images of the ultraviolet emissions of the aurora. Simultaneous observations will allow a synthesis that combines direct images of the aurora with detailed studies of the particles present at that point in time. The UVS will provide images taken directly above the north and south poles of Jupiter, a perfect vantage point to view the entire aurora at once. Juno will also have a variety of other instruments, including a magnetometer to study the magnetic field, a microwave spectrometer which will measure the amounts of ammonia and water, and an imager which will take movies of Jupiter's clouds. It is possible that the imager may also be able to provide images of some of Jupiter's closest moons, including Io and Amalthea. The current announcement means that Juno will enter a preliminary design phase. After this study is complete, the mission will have to pass a confirmation review that will determine whether or not the mission can meet certain scheduling, cost, and technical requirements before it can be confirmed for the development phase. Juno was selected over another mission that had been under consideration in the New Frontiers program, a lunar robotic sample return mission called Moonrise. To meet the terms of the New Frontiers program, Juno must be launched by June 30, 2010, and has a maximum mission cost of $700 million. The New Frontiers program is part of NASA's new initiative that allows PI-led medium-class missions. These missions are supposed to address important issues identified in the Decadal Solar System Exploration Study from the National Research Council that are not already covered by current NASA missions. Juno would be the second mission in NASA's New Frontiers Program, following the New Horizons mission to Pluto that is currently in development, and is scheduled to fly by the Pluto-Charon system in 2014.

Juno is the second of the new, medium-cost \"New Frontiers\" Solar System missions -- the first one being the New Horizons Pluto probe which has just successfully completed its gravity-assist flyby of Jupiter to catapult itself onwards to Pluto in 2015. Juno is one of those space missions that may not be very interesting to laymen, but is considered very important by many scientists. It will make virtually no observations of the planet's fascinating moons, and the one onboard camera planned for it until now is more for PR purposes than for science (although it will still send useful full-color images of Jupiter's polar cloud patterns). However, in October 2016 it will enter an elongated polar orbit around Jupiter -- farther away than the planet's moon Callisto at its farthest point, but swooping only 4300 km above Jupiter's cloud tops at its periapsis. This will let it \"thread the needle\" through Jupiter's most intense doughnut-shaped radiation belts -- enabling it to survive the planet's powerful radiation at short range for over a year, and even to use solar panels for its electrical power despite their sensitivity to radiation-- and it will also allow it to study some important questions which the \"Galileo\" orbiter could not answer from its much more distant equatorial orbit around Jupiter. Besides the \"Junocam\" camera (provided by Malin Space Science Systems), its experiments include: Extremely precise tracking of its orbit to allow precise mapping of Jupiter's gravity field, which in turn will allow us to determine how big a central core of rock and ice lies within its inner layers of super-compressed hydrogen and helium. There are two radically different theories of how the giant planets formed in the first place -- in one, the rock-ice core formed first, and finally grew to a size enabling its gravity to start hauling in more and more hydrogen and helium gas in a runaway manner from the nebula out of which the Solar System was forming; while in the other theory, \"density waves\" crammed rock and ice particles together with gas simultaneously in a mixed concentration. The central rock-ice core should be bigger if the first theory is true. Microwave measurments of the precise amount of water vapor and ammonia in Jupiter's atmosphere. The entry probe that the Galileo craft actually dropped into Jupiter in 1995 was spectacularly successful, and one of its discoveries was that Jupiter has a concentration of many of the gaseous elements heavier than helium that is about three times higher than that in the Sun. This was a surprise. It indicates that the chunks of water ice that became part of Jupiter contained more trapped gases than thought -- either because they were in a different chemical form (\"clathrates\") that had been thought, or because the ice that formed Jupiter actually drifted in from the coldest outermost parts of the Solar System. In fact, the possibility can't be quite ruled out that Jupiter and the other three giant planets themselves originally formed much farther from the Sun and then slowly migrated inwards before coming to a stop, just as we now know that many giant planets orbiting other stars have actually spiralled all the way inwards to within only a few million kilometers of their suns. But the Galileo probe had trouble making good measurements of water vapor and ammonia -- the latter being particularly important to decide whether the clathrate or the distant-origin theory of Jupiter's component ice is correct. This is mostly because, by pure bad luck, it happened to parachute down into one of the temporary \"dark spots\" that cover only about 8 percent of Jupiter's equatorial belt, where strong downdrafts blow dry air from the upper stratosphere down into the deeper atmosphere, removing clouds and water vapor from the air that the Galileo entry probe analyzed. Juno's microwave-radiometry maps will decisively settle the question of just how common water and ammonia realy are in its air. A magnetometer to make very detailed studies of the nature of the planet's magnetic field, and thus of the dynamo of super-compressed, electrically charged liquid metallic hydrogen in its deep interior that produces the field. This process is still pretty mysterious even for our own Earth and the magnetic field generated by its own core dynamo of molten iron. Four more instruments -- a mapping ultraviolet spectrometer, plasma analyzer, high-energy radiation detector, and plasma wave detector -- which, along with the magnetometer, will study Jupiter's complex magnetosphere in the polar regions where its intense charged-particle radiation actually plunges into the planet's atmosphere and produces powerful auroras. These eight American experiments by themselves would make a good, high-priority scientific planetary mission, despite its relative lack of charisma for nonscientists. But in 2005, ASI (the Italian Space Agency) proposed adding two more instruments to Juno:another visible-light camera (\"Itacam\") oriented both toward PR and cloud-pattern studies; and \"JIRAM\" -- a combined near-infrared camera and spectrometer that would both make further studies of Jupiter's auroras, and examine its weather patterns and storms (including those same \"dark spots\") in new detail. Juno's visible-light camera and microwave radiometer would also provide further studies of the planet's weather and wind patterns. And its sensitive gravity-field map may allow detection of winds -- or, more accurately for material at such great depths, currents -- as much as one-fifth of the way in from the planet's outer cloud layers to its core.) Italy also proposed to build the high-frequency Ka-band transponder which is an important part of the sensitive gravity tracking experiment. Italy has considerable experience in building radio and infrared instruments for space missions. The \"VIMS\" visible and near-infrared mapping spectrometer on the current Cassini Saturn orbiter is Italian, as is part of the craft's Titan-mapping radar system. NASA therefore took Italy's proposal very seriously, but not until this Feb. 12 did it officially decide to allow the team to incorporate both \"JIRAM\" and the Italian Ka-band transponder into Juno's payload, if their final technical checks confirm the feasibility of these instruments. If not, the US will have to build the Ka-band beacon itself. (\"Itacam\" was rejected, being redundant to the American \"Junocam\"). This means that Juno -- even though it will virtually ignore Jupiter's four big and fascinating major moons, which must instead be studied by the next mission to the Jupiter system -- will be able to make an even more detailed study of the planet itself than had been previously hoped.

Eight yearsfrom now, if all goes as planned, a spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter that should provide insightinto planet formation.

It will carry severalinstruments intended to determine the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere. Among theseis the Jovian Infra-Red Auroral Mapper, which will provide both imagesand spectra in the near infra-red of hot spots that are believed to provide awindow into Jupiter's lower atmosphere. Working in conjunction with a microwavesounding instrument, JIRAM should help determine the quantity of water in thelower atmosphere. Togetherwith accurate maps of Jupiter's gravity field, which will be developed by observing how Juno's orbit changesover time, this should settle once and for all whether the giant planet has asolid core, and how large it is. That will provide a direct test for one of twocurrently popular theories of planet formation, which predicts that Jupitershould have a substantial core of many times the mass of the Earth. JIRAM alsowill provide images of Jupiter's aurora, which is similar to, but much morepowerful than, Earth's familiar Northern Lights. The aurora forms when gas in the upper atmosphere is ionized by streams of chargedparticles trapped by a planetary magnetic field. Jupiter has the most powerfulmagnetic field of any planet in our solar system, and its auroral displays areso bright they have been seen using the Hubble Space Telescope. JIRAM willprovide a close-up look at Jupiter's aurora, which according to a recent paperpublished in the journal Astrobiology, \" ... provides a model systemfor potentially observable phenomena associated with Jupiter-mass andsuper-Jupiter-mass bodies around nearby stars.\" JonathanLunine, a professor at the University of Arizona's Lunar and PlanetaryLaboratory, is a member of the JIRAM research team, and has high hopes for theresults it will offer in conjunction with Juno's other instruments: \"Wewill obtain a detailed map of the Jovian gravity field, establishing once andfor all whether there's a core. Also, the oxygen and nitrogen abundances, onceaccurately established, provide a good test for determining the composition ofthe icy bodies that created Jupiter's supersolar abundance - not directly tiedto the issue of whether core formation occurred but it will help us determineconditions where Jupiter formed.\" Lunine alsobelieves JIRAM will help scientists understand Earth's Northern Lights:\"Looking at aurora formed in a hydrogen vs. nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere,and with different particle sources, we cantest theories of auroral formation under conditions very different from onEarth.\" To meetthese goals, a team of scientists and engineers, who developed instruments forNASA's Cassini and Dawn missions and ESA's Rosetta and Venus Express missions, built what amounts to two instruments in one: atwo- dimensional imaging detector that works like a digital camera, and aseparate grating spectrometer, which functions like a prism, breaking light upinto a spectrum. Both the imager and spectrometer share a common focal plane,looking through a single telescope. The designers faced a unique challengebecause Juno is designed to spin, which could smear images. In JIRAM, acompensating mirror will be used that rotates in the opposite direction to thespacecraft, giving the imager a stable picture for at least part of eachrotation cycle. DevelopingJIRAM was complicated by U.S. International Traffic in Arms regulations,which require an export license from the Department of State before foreignnationals can receive technical data about U.S. launch vehicles. Dr. AlbertoAdriani of the Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy said: \"Not being Americans, we JIRAMs had to work in quite difficultconditions where the flow of information necessary for the instrumentdevelopment was very slow and sometime limited.... In particular the conditionsin which JIRAM has to work were not well known: The spacecraft thermalenvironment, expected radiation environment around Jupiter, and vibrationsduring launch - key elements for proper structural design - were all unknownto us in the beginning.\" To make progress while waiting for information tocome from the U.S., Adriani and his colleagues assumed these factors would besimilar to those on previous missions - then modified their design whenJuno- specific data became available.

It will carry severalinstruments intended to determine the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere. Among theseis the Jovian Infra-Red Auroral Mapper, which will provide both imagesand spectra in the near infra-red of hot spots that are believed to provide awindow into Jupiter's lower atmosphere. Working in conjunction with a microwavesounding instrument, JIRAM should help determine the quantity of water in thelower atmosphere. Togetherwith accurate maps of Jupiter's gravity field, which will be developed by observing how Juno's orbit changesover time, this should settle once and for all whether the giant planet has asolid core, and how large it is. That will provide a direct test for one of twocurrently popular theories of planet formation, which predicts that Jupitershould have a substantial core of many times the mass of the Earth. JIRAM alsowill provide images of Jupiter's aurora, which is similar to, but much morepowerful than, Earth's familiar Northern Lights. The aurora forms when gas in the upper atmosphere is ionized by streams of chargedparticles trapped by a planetary magnetic field. Jupiter has the most powerfulmagnetic field of any planet in our solar system, and its auroral displays areso bright they have been seen using the Hubble Space Telescope. JIRAM willprovide a close-up look at Jupiter's aurora, which according to a recent paperpublished in the journal Astrobiology, \" ... provides a model systemfor potentially observable phenomena associated with Jupiter-mass andsuper-Jupiter-mass bodies around nearby stars.\" JonathanLunine, a professor at the University of Arizona's Lunar and PlanetaryLaboratory, is a member of the JIRAM research team, and has high hopes for theresults it will offer in conjunction with Juno's other instruments: \"Wewill obtain a detailed map of the Jovian gravity field, establishing once andfor all whether there's a core. Also, the oxygen and nitrogen abundances, onceaccurately established, provide a good test for determining the composition ofthe icy bodies that created Jupiter's supersolar abundance - not directly tiedto the issue of whether core formation occurred but it will help us determineconditions where Jupiter formed.\" Lunine alsobelieves JIRAM will help scientists understand Earth's Northern Lights:\"Looking at aurora formed in a hydrogen vs. nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere,and with different particle sources, we cantest theories of auroral formation under conditions very different from onEarth.\" To meetthese goals, a team of scientists and engineers, who developed instruments forNASA's Cassini and Dawn missions and ESA's Rosetta and Venus Express missions, built what amounts to two instruments in one: atwo- dimensional imaging detector that works like a digital camera, and aseparate grating spectrometer, which functions like a prism, breaking light upinto a spectrum. Both the imager and spectrometer share a common focal plane,looking through a single telescope. The designers faced a unique challengebecause Juno is designed to spin, which could smear images. In JIRAM, acompensating mirror will be used that rotates in the opposite direction to thespacecraft, giving the imager a stable picture for at least part of eachrotation cycle. DevelopingJIRAM was complicated by U.S. International Traffic in Arms regulations,which require an export license from the Department of State before foreignnationals can receive technical data about U.S. launch vehicles. Dr. AlbertoAdriani of the Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy said: \"Not being Americans, we JIRAMs had to work in quite difficultconditions where the flow of information necessary for the instrumentdevelopment was very slow and sometime limited.... In particular the conditionsin which JIRAM has to work were not well known: The spacecraft thermalenvironment, expected radiation environment around Jupiter, and vibrationsduring launch - key elements for proper structural design - were all unknownto us in the beginning.\" To make progress while waiting for information tocome from the U.S., Adriani and his colleagues assumed these factors would besimilar to those on previous missions - then modified their design whenJuno- specific data became available. Juno isscheduled for launch in August 2011, and should arrive at Jupiter 61 monthslater.

The spacecraft will orbit Jupiter 32 times, skimming about 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles) over the planet's cloud tops for approximately one year. The mission will be the first solar powered spacecraft designed to operate despite the great distance from the sun. \"Jupiter is more than 644 million kilometers (400 million miles) from the sun or five times further than Earth,\" Bolton said. \"Juno is engineered to be extremely energy efficient.\" The spacecraft will use a camera and nine science instruments to study the hidden world beneath Jupiter's colorful clouds. The suite of science instruments will investigate the existence of an ice-rock core, Jupiter's intense magnetic field, water and ammonia clouds in the deep atmosphere, and explore the planet's aurora borealis. \"In Greek and Roman mythology, Jupiter's wife Juno peered through Jupiter's veil of clouds to watch over her husband's mischief,\" said Professor Toby Owen, co-investigator at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. \"Our Juno looks through Jupiter's clouds to see what the planet is up to, not seeking signs of misbehavior, but searching for whispers of water, the ultimate essence of life.\" Understanding the formation of Jupiter is essential to understanding the processes that led to the development of the rest of our solar system and what the conditions were that led to Earth and humankind. Similar to the sun, Jupiter is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. A small percentage of the planet is composed of heavier elements. However, Jupiter has a larger percentage of these heavier elements than the sun. \"Juno's extraordinarily accurate determination of the gravity and magnetic fields of Jupiter will enable us to understand what is going on deep down in the planet,\" said Professor Dave Stevenson, co-investigator at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"These and other measurements will inform us about how Jupiter's constituents are distributed, how Jupiter formed and how it evolved, which is a central part of our growing understanding of the nature of our solar system.\" Deep in Jupiter's atmosphere, under great pressure, hydrogen gas is squeezed into a fluid known as metallic hydrogen. At these great depths, the hydrogen acts like an electrically conducting metal which is believed to be the source of the planet's intense magnetic field. Jupiter also may have a rocky solid core at the center. \"Juno gives us a fantastic opportunity to get a picture of the structure of Jupiter in a way never before possible,\" said James Green, director of NASA's Planetary Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"It will allow us to take a giant step forward in our understanding on how giant planets form and the role that plays in putting the rest of the solar system together. \" The Juno mission is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program.

In a specially filtered cleanroom in Denver, where Juno is being assembled, engineers recently added a unique protective shield around its sensitive electronics. New pictures of the assembly were released today. \"Juno is basically an armored tank going to Jupiter,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, based at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"Without its protective shield, or radiation vault, Juno's brain would get fried on the very first pass near Jupiter.\" An invisible force field filled with high-energy particles coming off from Jupiter and its moons surrounds the largest planet in our solar system. This magnetic force field, similar to a less powerful one around Earth, shields Jupiter from charged particles flying off the sun. The electrons, protons and ions around Jupiter are energized by the planet's super-fast rotation, sped up to nearly the speed of light. Jupiter's radiation belts are shaped like a huge doughnut around the planet's equatorial region and extend out past the moon Europa, about 650,000 kilometers out from the top of Jupiter's clouds. \"For the 15 months Juno orbits Jupiter, the spacecraft will have to withstand the equivalent of more than 100 million dental X-rays,\" said Bill McAlpine, Juno's radiation control manager, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"In the same way human beings need to protect their organs during an X-ray exam, we have to protect Juno's brain and heart.\" The strategy? Give Juno a kind of six-sided lead apron on steroids. With guidance from JPL and the principal investigator, engineers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems designed and built a special radiation vault made of titanium for a centralized electronics hub. While other materials exist that make good radiation blockers, engineers chose titanium because lead is too soft to withstand the vibrations of launch, and some other materials were too difficult to work with. Each titanium wall measures nearly a square meter in area, about 1 centimeter in thickness, and 18 kilograms in mass. This titanium box -- about the size of an SUV's trunk - encloses Juno's command and data handling box, power and data distribution unit and about 20 other electronic assemblies. The whole vault weighs about 200 kilograms. The vault is not designed to completely prevent every Jovian electron, ion or proton from hitting the system, but it will dramatically slow down the aging effect radiation has on electronics for the duration of the mission. \"The centralized radiation vault is the first of its kind,\" Bolton said. \"We basically designed it from the ground up.\" When NASA's Galileo spacecraft visited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, its electronics were shielded by special components designed to be resistant to radiation. Galileo also didn't need to survive the harshest radiation regions, where Juno will operate. But Juno isn't relying solely on the radiation vault. Scientists designed a path that takes Juno around Jupiter's poles, spending as little time as possible in the sizzling radiation belts around Jupiter's equator. Engineers also used designs for electronics already approved for the Martian radiation environment, which is harsher than Earth's, though not as harsh as Jupiter's. Parts of the electronics were made from tantalum, or tungsten, another radiation-resistant metal. Some assemblies also have their own mini-vaults for protection. Packing the assemblies next to each other allows them to shield their neighbors. In addition, engineers wrapped copper and stainless steel braids like chain mail around wires connecting the electronics to other parts of the spacecraft. JPL tested pieces of the vault in a radiation environment similar to Jupiter's to make sure the design will be able to handle the stress of space flight and the Jupiter environment, McAlpine said. In a special lead-lined testing tub there, they battered pieces of the spacecraft with gamma rays from radioactive cobalt pellets and analyzed the results for Juno's expedition. The vault was lifted onto Juno's propulsion module on May 19 at Lockheed Martin's high-bay cleanroom. It will undergo further testing once the whole spacecraft is put together.

These were designed and built by a team led by John Jorgensen at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, Denmark. \"Juno's magnetometers will measure Jupiter's magnetic field with extraordinary precision and give us a detailed picture of what the field looks like both around the planet and deep within,\" says Goddard's Jack Connerney, the mission's Deputy Principal Investigator and head of the magnetometer team. \"This will be the first time we've mapped the magnetic field all around Jupiter-it will be the most complete map of its kind ever obtained about any planet with an active dynamo, except, of course, our Earth.\" Scheduled for launch in 2011, Juno is the second mission in NASA's New Frontiers program. The mission will improve our understanding of the solar system by advancing studies of the origin and evolution of Jupiter. The spacecraft will carry nine instruments to investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. \"The magnetometers play a unique and important role in Juno's investigation of the formation and evolution of Jupiter,\" says Juno's Principal Investigator, Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"They provide one of the ways that Juno will see deep inside the giant planet, and this will help us understand how and where Jupiter's powerful magnetic field is generated.\" The Juno magnetometers will study Jupiter's powerful magnetic field, which is nearly 20,000 times as strong as Earth's. The field is generated deep within the planet's atmosphere, where the intense pressure compresses hydrogen gas into an electrically conductive fluid. Fluid motion within the planet drives electric currents in this liquid hydrogen, and these currents generate the magnetic field. If a map were drawn of the magnetic field lines running between Jupiter's north and south poles, the region of space filled by the lines (called the magnetosphere) would be enormous. Jupiter's magnetosphere extends up to 3 million kilometers (nearly 2 million miles) toward the sun and as far as Saturn's orbit in the other direction. \"From a distance, Jupiter's magnetic field has two poles, north and south, like Earth's. But looking closer, below Jupiter's surface, the magnetic field is thought to be quite complex and tangled,\" says Connerney. \"Juno will give us a detailed picture of the magnetic field extending down to the surface of the dynamo, or engine, that generates it.\" Jupiter's powerful magnetic environment also creates the brightest auroras in the solar system, as charged particles get trapped by the field and rain down into the atmosphere. Juno will directly sample the charged particles and magnetic fields near Jupiter's poles for the first time, while simultaneously observing the auroras at ultraviolet wavelengths of light. These investigations will greatly improve the understanding of this remarkable phenomenon and of similar magnetic objects, such as young stars that have their own planetary systems. \"With Juno, we will learn much more about the structure and evolution of Jupiter, and this will help us understand our own solar system,\" says Connerney. \"But astronomers have now found many other giant planets outside our solar system. What we learn about Jupiter also will help us understand the planets orbiting other stars.\" ", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/news/magnetometers20101027.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Juno Armored Up to Go to Jupiter", "date": "2010-07-12", "content": "NASA's Juno spacecraft will be forging ahead into a treacherous environment at Jupiter with more radiation than any other place NASA has ever sent a spacecraft, except the sun. In a specially filtered cleanroom in Denver, where Juno is being assembled, engineers recently added a unique protective shield around its sensitive electronics. New pictures of the assembly were released today. \"Juno is basically an armored tank going to Jupiter,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, based at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"Without its protective shield, or radiation vault, Juno's brain would get fried on the very first pass near Jupiter.\" An invisible force field filled with high-energy particles coming off from Jupiter and its moons surrounds the largest planet in our solar system. This magnetic force field, similar to a less powerful one around Earth, shields Jupiter from charged particles flying off the sun. The electrons, protons and ions around Jupiter are energized by the planet's super-fast rotation, sped up to nearly the speed of light. Jupiter's radiation belts are shaped like a huge doughnut around the planet's equatorial region and extend out past the moon Europa, about 650,000 kilometers out from the top of Jupiter's clouds. \"For the 15 months Juno orbits Jupiter, the spacecraft will have to withstand the equivalent of more than 100 million dental X-rays,\" said Bill McAlpine, Juno's radiation control manager, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"In the same way human beings need to protect their organs during an X-ray exam, we have to protect Juno's brain and heart.\" The strategy? Give Juno a kind of six-sided lead apron on steroids. With guidance from JPL and the principal investigator, engineers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems designed and built a special radiation vault made of titanium for a centralized electronics hub. While other materials exist that make good radiation blockers, engineers chose titanium because lead is too soft to withstand the vibrations of launch, and some other materials were too difficult to work with. Each titanium wall measures nearly a square meter in area, about 1 centimeter in thickness, and 18 kilograms in mass. This titanium box -- about the size of an SUV's trunk - encloses Juno's command and data handling box, power and data distribution unit and about 20 other electronic assemblies. The whole vault weighs about 200 kilograms. The vault is not designed to completely prevent every Jovian electron, ion or proton from hitting the system, but it will dramatically slow down the aging effect radiation has on electronics for the duration of the mission. \"The centralized radiation vault is the first of its kind,\" Bolton said. \"We basically designed it from the ground up.\" When NASA's Galileo spacecraft visited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, its electronics were shielded by special components designed to be resistant to radiation. Galileo also didn't need to survive the harshest radiation regions, where Juno will operate. But Juno isn't relying solely on the radiation vault. Scientists designed a path that takes Juno around Jupiter's poles, spending as little time as possible in the sizzling radiation belts around Jupiter's equator. Engineers also used designs for electronics already approved for the Martian radiation environment, which is harsher than Earth's, though not as harsh as Jupiter's. Parts of the electronics were made from tantalum, or tungsten, another radiation-resistant metal. Some assemblies also have their own mini-vaults for protection. Packing the assemblies next to each other allows them to shield their neighbors. In addition, engineers wrapped copper and stainless steel braids like chain mail around wires connecting the electronics to other parts of the spacecraft. JPL tested pieces of the vault in a radiation environment similar to Jupiter's to make sure the design will be able to handle the stress of space flight and the Jupiter environment, McAlpine said. In a special lead-lined testing tub there, they battered pieces of the spacecraft with gamma rays from radioactive cobalt pellets and analyzed the results for Juno's expedition. The vault was lifted onto Juno's propulsion module on May 19 at Lockheed Martin's high-bay cleanroom. It will undergo further testing once the whole spacecraft is put together. The assembly and testing process, which also includes installing solar panels for the first-ever solar-powered mission to Jupiter, is expected to last through next spring. Juno is expected to launch in August 2011. \"The Juno assembly is proceeding well,\" said Tim Gasparrini, Lockheed Martin program manager. \"We have a number of the flight and test unit spacecraft avionics components installed into the radiation vault for system testing and we have also just installed the first instrument, the microwave radiometer.\" JPL manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of Southwest Research Institute at San Antonio, Texas. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, Colo., is building the spacecraft. The Italian Space Agency in Rome is contributing an infrared spectrometer instrument and a portion of the radio science experiment.

About the size of an SUV's trunk - the vault encloses Juno's command and data handling box, power and data distribution unit and about 20 other electronic assemblies, according to NASA. \"For the 15 months Juno orbits Jupiter, the spacecraft will have to withstand the equivalent of more than 100 million dental X-rays,\" said Bill McAlpine, Juno's radiation control manager, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in a release.

Deep in Jupiter's atmosphere, under great pressure, hydrogen gas is squeezed into a fluid known as metallic hydrogen. At these great depths, the hydrogen acts like an electrically conducting metal which is believed to be the source of the planet's intense magnetic field. This powerful magnetic environment creates the brightest auroras in our solar system, as charged particles precipitate down into the planet's atmosphere. Juno will directly sample the charged particles and magnetic fields near Jupiter's poles for the first time, while simultaneously observing the auroras in ultraviolet light produced by the extraordinary amounts of energy crashing into the polar regions, NASA said. NASA's Juno mission is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program. The first was the Pluto New Horizons mission. Launched into space in January 2006 and has been hurtling toward Pluto at about 50,000 mph. Even at that rate the 1,054lb satellite will get it close to the dwarf planet sometime around July 2015.

For example, scientists are still unsure how large the core is and what it is made up of, or if the planet even has a solid surface. To learn more about the gas giant, NASA is preparing Juno to take off next August from Cape Canaveral onboard an Atlas V-551 rocket.

They will remain continuously in sunlight from the time they are unfurled after launch through the end of the mission. \"The Juno spacecraft and the team have come a long way since this project was first conceived in 2003,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, based at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, in a statement. \"We're only a few months away from a mission of discovery that could very well rewrite the books on not only how Jupiter was born, but how our solar system came into being.\" Juno is slated to launch aboard the most powerful version of the Atlas V rocket - augmented by 5 solid rocket boosters - from Cape Canaveral, Fla. on August 5. The launch window extends through August 26. Juno is the second mission in NASA's New Frontiers program. NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover will follow Juno to the Atlas launch pad, and is scheduled to liftoff in late November 2011. Read my stories about Curiosity here and here. Because of cuts to NASA's budget by politicians in Washington, the long hoped for mission to investigate the Jovian moon Europa may be axed, along with other high priority science missions. Europa may harbor subsurface oceans of liquid water and is a prime target in NASA's search for life beyond Earth.

Technicians also carefully deployed the probe's three solar panels to make sure they're ready for flight. Everything checked out, according to Tim Gasparrini, Juno program manager at Lockheed Martin Corp. \"Completing the testing and stow of solar panels is always a big pre-launch milestone, and with Juno, you could say really big because our panels are really big,\" said Jan Chodas, Juno project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mission is aiming to uncover clues about the origin of Jupiter, potentially yielding insight into the formation of the whole solar system. Juno has three solar panels to generate electricity. The arrays will be folded up for launch, then unfurled like an accordian moments after the spacecraft leaves its Atlas rocket in space. Fully deployed, each wing measures about 9 feet wide and 29 feet long. One array has a magnetometer boom on the end for one of Juno's research investigations. Using a string of lights in place of the sun, Lockheed Martin employees illuminated each of the probe's three extended solar panels to verify they will produce enough electricity at the mind-boggling distance of Jupiter. Because of their size, only one of Juno's solar wings can be extended at a time on the ground. Lockheed Martin's factory in Denver and the clean room in Florida are not large enough accommodate the simultaneous extension of all three wings. The arrays are positioned on three plates of the six-sided core of the spacecraft, forming a triangular shape when they are deployed together in space. All together, the panels have an area of about 635 square feet, larger than most studio apartments. \"I like to tell my kids the spacecraft would almost stretch rim to rim on a basketball court,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno's deputy project manager at JPL. The solar array \"walk-out\" and illumination tests were a repeat from a similar check at the spacecraft's factory in Denver. But the solar panels were removed from Juno for the shipment to Florida, so officials wanted to ensure everything still worked when the components were put together again. Engineers checked the current from the arrays when the light stand cast an eerie glow on the violet-colored panels. Officials were happy with the results, giving the all-clear to fold up the solar panels into their launch configuration and passing another milestone on the road to blastoff. Next up will be fueling of Juno with rocket propellant, a spin test and mating of the spacecraft with launch vehicle. Positioned five times further from the sun than Earth, the king of planets is a foreboding place. Jupiter is surrounded by dangerous radiation belts, and just a fraction of the sun's light and heat reach that far into the solar system. Up to now, robotic probes daring enough to venture to travel to Jupiter or beyond have always been powered by a nuclear generator. The $1 billion Juno mission will blast off Aug. 5 on an Atlas 5 rocket. Its five-year journey from Earth to Jupiter will rely solely on sunlight, setting a new distance record for a solar-powered spacecraft when it is tugged into orbit in July 2016. Its solar panels could generate up to 18 kilowatts of electricity with the bright sunlight at Earth, but that value falls to about 450 watts at Jupiter's distance. That's equivalent to about five standard light bulbs. \"If you had a 100-watt lightbulb at Earth, it turns into a nightlight at Jupiter,\" Gasparrini said. Half of Juno's electricity budget goes to its thermal system to keep the spacecraft at a comfortable temperature. The balance goes toward communications, computers, propulsion and operating the probe's seven scientific instruments and color camera. Juno will reach nearly twice as far from the sun as NASA's Dawn asteroid chaser, another ambitious mission exploring new frontiers with two huge solar panels. The European Space Agency's Rosetta comet probe is also pushing the solar power envelope, but it won't quite reach Jupiter's distance. That all makes for a tall challenge for Juno's electrical engineers. \"The one thing enabling this mission is the efficiency of the solar cells,\" said Jeff Coyne, Lockheed Martin's chief engineer for Juno's power subsystem. Without finding a way to power Juno on sunlight, the mission likely would not have made it beyond a PowerPoint slide. That's the consensus view among the team of contractor and government engineers helping prepare the helicopter-shaped probe for liftoff. For one thing, U.S. reserves of plutonium fuel are dwindling for nuclear-powered spacecraft, and nearly all of what's left is already spoken for by future missions. Even if plutonium was available, the nuclear power generator would introduce regulatory hurdles that might have complicated development. Instead, Lockheed Martin came up with a solar-powered concept that could still accomplish all of Juno's objectives at Jupiter. \"I started doing a lot of calculations using manufacturers' publicized information, and we came up with an array that would work,\" Kindt said. Kindt played a key role in the decision to go with solar power on Juno a half-decade ago. He says engineers had to prove the solar cells and electrical circuitry could withstand Jupiter's hazardous radiation field and still be efficient producers of power. Engineers came up with a novel design using 18,600 solar cells handpicked from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of Boeing Co. based in Los Angeles. Made of gallium arsenide, each cell measures approximately 3.7 inches by 2.25 inches. \"We're the first mission to do solar power at the distances of Jupiter, but the solar cell technology has evolved over the last few decades,\" Chodas said in an interview. \"We have every confidence that our arrays will provide enough power.\" Lockheed Martin and Spectrolab put each of Juno's solar cells through multiple tests to check their expected performance at simulated solar distances from the launch from Earth to the science phase at Jupiter. Designers also devised additional radiation testing to make sure the cells, computers and wiring will survive Jupiter's radiation belts, which give off enough electrons, protons and other high-energy charged particles to zap Juno's unprotected brains on its first orbit. But it will take 30 trips around Jupiter for the probe to collect the data scientists need to map the giant planet's magnetic field and peer deep into its swirling inhospitable atmosphere. Juno will fly through Jupiter's doughnut-shaped radiation belts on each orbit, exposing itself to an environment that will eventually get the best of the spacecraft, ending its mission after just 15 months at the gas giant. NASA's Galileo probe lasted for nearly eight years in the vicinity of Jupiter, but Juno will fly through the planet's worst radiation with more regularity, approaching within 2,500 miles of Jupiter's turbulent cloud tops on each pass. Officials liken the experience to receiving 100 million dental X-rays in a little over a year. Juno's flight computers, avionics and commanding system are wrapped inside a solid titanium box on top of the spacecraft. Known as the vault, the container is about the size of a microwave oven and weighs nearly 500 pounds fully loaded, Gasparrini. Engineers chose to build a radiation-shielding vault early on in Juno's development. They knew it was heading for an environment never before explored, encountering the most intense space radiation of any mission in history. Some energetic particles will still penetrate the vault, but it is sturdy enough to keep the spacecraft alive through the planned mission. After about 15 months, engineers expect Juno will start to succumb to the radiation. They plan to dive the probe into Jupiter's atmosphere in a fiery sendoff to avoid the off-chance it could collide with one of the planet's inner moons, which are potential targets for subsequent missions. \"All the challenges were recognized early, so work was going on long ago to design a spacecraft to survive in that environment,\" Chodas said. \"It was a well-planned mission from the start.\" But some of the challenges aren't so obvious to an armchair observer. Juno's circuitry and power system is unable to work with the 18 kilowatts of electricty the probe's solar panels could generate right after launch. So engineers crafted a clever way to tie together solar cells into strings, giving ground controllers the ability to route just some of the copious power into the heart of Juno. \"At Jupiter, we only need to be able to handle a certain amount of current, and when you're sitting there with 18 kilowatts, you've got a lot of current,\" Kindt said. \"It's a thermal issue for the electronics, so we back off to manage the amount of current we have.\" As Juno ventures further away from the sun, controllers will add more strings to the power system, calling on a larger portion of the solar panels' collecting area for electricity as needed. Radiation will also threaten the efficiency of Juno's solar arrays. Unable to protect the panels in the craft's titanium vault, engineers doubled the thickness of the cover glass over each cell. \"Radiation is a big degradation factor for our solar arrays,\" Coyne said. \"We think we've avoided radiation at first, but the mission's later orbits take Juno deeper into the radiation belt. That's a big hit on the solar cells.\" Juno's off-the-shelf solar cells were not designed to withstand the radiation at Jupiter, but testing shows they should do the trick long enough to collect the mission's science data. Solar cells on satellites near Earth typically last decades. Even taking away the low-light and harsh radiation environment at Jupiter, the solar cells still have to handle the violent vibrations and fluctuating hot and cold temperatures of every space mission. The craft will see temperatures ranging from minus 220 degrees to 266 degrees Fahrenheit. The solar arrays should be able to take even more extreme temperatures, Kindt said. \"They will all function,\" Kindt said. \"We have gone through all the thermal and acoustic enviroments. We're highly confident we're not going to have any problems with the arrays.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1105/29junosolar/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Solar Powered Jupiter bound JUNO lands at Kennedy Space Center for blastoff", "date": "2011-04-17", "content": "Juno, NASA's next big mission bound for the outer planets, has arrived at the Kennedy Space Center to kick off the final leg of launch preparations in anticipation of blastoff for Jupiter this summer.

Technicians wheeled NASA's Juno probe to its launch pad at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station this morning (July 27), then mated the craft to its Atlas 5 launch vehicle. The event marked a key milestone for the $1.1 billion Juno mission, which aims to shed light on the origin and evolution of the solar system's largest planet. The rocket will launch Juno probe toward Jupiter on Friday, Aug. 5, mission scientists said. \"We're about to start our journey to Jupiter to unlock the secrets of the early solar system,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, in a statement. \"After eight years of development, the spacecraft is ready for its important mission.\" Closest-ever look at Jupiter. Juno will get closer to Jupiter than any other spacecraft in history - but not for a while. After its launch, the probe will cruise through the solar system for five years, finally arriving at the gas giant in July 2016. Once there, Juno will undertake a year-long science campaign, studying Jupiter's structure, composition and magnetosphere, among other things, researchers said. The overall aim is to get a better idea of how, and when, the solar system's biggest planet formed. Jupiter holds about twice as much mass as the rest of the solar system combined, not counting the sun. And it was the first planet to coalesce after the sun formed, gobbling up most of the dust and gas left in the early solar system. That's part of the reason it's so interesting, according to Bolton. \"If we want to go back in time and understand where we came from and how the planets were made, Jupiter holds the secret, because it's got most of the leftovers after the sun formed,\" Bolton told reporters today. \"We want to know that ingredient list. What we're really after is discovering the recipe for making planets.\" Juno will make a variety of observations in an attempt to determine that recipe. For example, the spacecraft will measure the amount of water contained in Jupiter's thick, swirling atmosphere. Relatively large amounts of water might suggest that Jupiter first formed farther out in the solar system, then migrated into its present position, Bolton said. And scientists still aren't sure if Jupiter has a solid core of heavy elements, or if it's made entirely of gas. Juno will look into that question as well, by measuring Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields. \"Juno's prepared to be able to help constrain those answers, and help provide that information so that we can discriminate among models of how Jupiter formed and, in fact, what the history of our early solar systemwas,\" Bolton said. An armored tank of a spacecraft. Juno will settle into a highly elliptical polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016, coming as close as 3,107 miles (5,000 kilometers) from the gas giant's cloud-tops. This proximity will afford great looks at the giant planet, but it's dangerous for Juno, too. Jupiter possesses the strongest radiation environmentof any solar system body beyond the sun. So mission planners have encased Juno's sensitive instruments and electronics inside a titanium \"vault\" for protection. \"We're basically an armored tank going to Jupiter,\" Bolton said. Jupiter's strong radiation also dictated the particulars of Juno's orbit, requiring mission managers to slot the spacecraft precisely between several dangerous belts on its laps around the planet. \"This is like threading a needle,\" Bolton said. \"We're going right through the only safe haven.\" Juno weighs about 8,000 pounds (3,627 kilograms), but about half of that is fuel, researchers said. For power, the spacecraft relies on three huge solar arrays, each the size of a tractor-trailer. The arrays' 18,698 solar cells will generate about 400 watts of power out at Jupiter, which sits about 400 million miles (644 million km) farther from the sun than Earth does. Out there, sunlight is 25 times less intense than it is here on our home planet. Juno will make 33 orbits of Jupiter over its year-long operational life, then be crashed intentionally into the giant planet. Researchers want to make sure Juno doesn't slam into - and contaminate - any of Jupiter's moons, some of which scientists think may be capable of supporting life. But the mission's end is far off in the future, as are the beginnings of its observations at Jupiter. For now, the mission team is looking forward to just getting the spacecraft off the ground. \"It's really exciting,\" Bolton said. \"We're just a few days away from our launch.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/12448-nasa-set-launch-spacecraft-jupiter-week.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Solar Powered Jupiter bound JUNO lands at Kennedy Space Center for blastoff", "date": "2011-04-17", "content": "Juno, NASA's next big mission bound for the outer planets, has arrived at the Kennedy Space Center to kick off the final leg of launch preparations in anticipation of blastoff for Jupiter this summer.

The arrays will be folded up for launch, then unfurled like an accordian moments after the spacecraft leaves its Atlas rocket in space. Fully deployed, each wing measures about 9 feet wide and 29 feet long. One array has a magnetometer boom on the end for one of Juno's research investigations. Using a string of lights in place of the sun, Lockheed Martin employees illuminated each of the probe's three extended solar panels to verify they will produce enough electricity at the mind-boggling distance of Jupiter. Because of their size, only one of Juno's solar wings can be extended at a time on the ground. Lockheed Martin's factory in Denver and the clean room in Florida are not large enough accommodate the simultaneous extension of all three wings. The arrays are positioned on three plates of the six-sided core of the spacecraft, forming a triangular shape when they are deployed together in space. All together, the panels have an area of about 635 square feet, larger than most studio apartments. \"I like to tell my kids the spacecraft would almost stretch rim to rim on a basketball court,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno's deputy project manager at JPL. The solar array \"walk-out\" and illumination tests were a repeat from a similar check at the spacecraft's factory in Denver. But the solar panels were removed from Juno for the shipment to Florida, so officials wanted to ensure everything still worked when the components were put together again. Engineers checked the current from the arrays when the light stand cast an eerie glow on the violet-colored panels. Officials were happy with the results, giving the all-clear to fold up the solar panels into their launch configuration and passing another milestone on the road to blastoff. Next up will be fueling of Juno with rocket propellant, a spin test and mating of the spacecraft with launch vehicle. Positioned five times further from the sun than Earth, the king of planets is a foreboding place. Jupiter is surrounded by dangerous radiation belts, and just a fraction of the sun's light and heat reach that far into the solar system. Up to now, robotic probes daring enough to venture to travel to Jupiter or beyond have always been powered by a nuclear generator. The $1 billion Juno mission will blast off Aug. 5 on an Atlas 5 rocket. Its five-year journey from Earth to Jupiter will rely solely on sunlight, setting a new distance record for a solar-powered spacecraft when it is tugged into orbit in July 2016. Its solar panels could generate up to 18 kilowatts of electricity with the bright sunlight at Earth, but that value falls to about 450 watts at Jupiter's distance. That's equivalent to about five standard light bulbs. \"If you had a 100-watt lightbulb at Earth, it turns into a nightlight at Jupiter,\" Gasparrini said. Half of Juno's electricity budget goes to its thermal system to keep the spacecraft at a comfortable temperature. The balance goes toward communications, computers, propulsion and operating the probe's seven scientific instruments and color camera. Juno will reach nearly twice as far from the sun as NASA's Dawn asteroid chaser, another ambitious mission exploring new frontiers with two huge solar panels. The European Space Agency's Rosetta comet probe is also pushing the solar power envelope, but it won't quite reach Jupiter's distance. That all makes for a tall challenge for Juno's electrical engineers. \"The one thing enabling this mission is the efficiency of the solar cells,\" said Jeff Coyne, Lockheed Martin's chief engineer for Juno's power subsystem. Without finding a way to power Juno on sunlight, the mission likely would not have made it beyond a PowerPoint slide. That's the consensus view among the team of contractor and government engineers helping prepare the helicopter-shaped probe for liftoff. For one thing, U.S. reserves of plutonium fuel are dwindling for nuclear-powered spacecraft, and nearly all of what's left is already spoken for by future missions. Even if plutonium was available, the nuclear power generator would introduce regulatory hurdles that might have complicated development. Instead, Lockheed Martin came up with a solar-powered concept that could still accomplish all of Juno's objectives at Jupiter. \"I started doing a lot of calculations using manufacturers' publicized information, and we came up with an array that would work,\" Kindt said. Kindt played a key role in the decision to go with solar power on Juno a half-decade ago. He says engineers had to prove the solar cells and electrical circuitry could withstand Jupiter's hazardous radiation field and still be efficient producers of power. Engineers came up with a novel design using 18,600 solar cells handpicked from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of Boeing Co. based in Los Angeles. Made of gallium arsenide, each cell measures approximately 3.7 inches by 2.25 inches. \"We're the first mission to do solar power at the distances of Jupiter, but the solar cell technology has evolved over the last few decades,\" Chodas said in an interview. \"We have every confidence that our arrays will provide enough power.\" Lockheed Martin and Spectrolab put each of Juno's solar cells through multiple tests to check their expected performance at simulated solar distances from the launch from Earth to the science phase at Jupiter. Designers also devised additional radiation testing to make sure the cells, computers and wiring will survive Jupiter's radiation belts, which give off enough electrons, protons and other high-energy charged particles to zap Juno's unprotected brains on its first orbit. But it will take 30 trips around Jupiter for the probe to collect the data scientists need to map the giant planet's magnetic field and peer deep into its swirling inhospitable atmosphere. Juno will fly through Jupiter's doughnut-shaped radiation belts on each orbit, exposing itself to an environment that will eventually get the best of the spacecraft, ending its mission after just 15 months at the gas giant. NASA's Galileo probe lasted for nearly eight years in the vicinity of Jupiter, but Juno will fly through the planet's worst radiation with more regularity, approaching within 2,500 miles of Jupiter's turbulent cloud tops on each pass. Officials liken the experience to receiving 100 million dental X-rays in a little over a year. Juno's flight computers, avionics and commanding system are wrapped inside a solid titanium box on top of the spacecraft. Known as the vault, the container is about the size of a microwave oven and weighs nearly 500 pounds fully loaded, Gasparrini. Engineers chose to build a radiation-shielding vault early on in Juno's development. They knew it was heading for an environment never before explored, encountering the most intense space radiation of any mission in history. Some energetic particles will still penetrate the vault, but it is sturdy enough to keep the spacecraft alive through the planned mission. After about 15 months, engineers expect Juno will start to succumb to the radiation. They plan to dive the probe into Jupiter's atmosphere in a fiery sendoff to avoid the off-chance it could collide with one of the planet's inner moons, which are potential targets for subsequent missions. \"All the challenges were recognized early, so work was going on long ago to design a spacecraft to survive in that environment,\" Chodas said. \"It was a well-planned mission from the start.\" But some of the challenges aren't so obvious to an armchair observer. Juno's circuitry and power system is unable to work with the 18 kilowatts of electricty the probe's solar panels could generate right after launch. So engineers crafted a clever way to tie together solar cells into strings, giving ground controllers the ability to route just some of the copious power into the heart of Juno. \"At Jupiter, we only need to be able to handle a certain amount of current, and when you're sitting there with 18 kilowatts, you've got a lot of current,\" Kindt said. \"It's a thermal issue for the electronics, so we back off to manage the amount of current we have.\" As Juno ventures further away from the sun, controllers will add more strings to the power system, calling on a larger portion of the solar panels' collecting area for electricity as needed. Radiation will also threaten the efficiency of Juno's solar arrays. Unable to protect the panels in the craft's titanium vault, engineers doubled the thickness of the cover glass over each cell. \"Radiation is a big degradation factor for our solar arrays,\" Coyne said. \"We think we've avoided radiation at first, but the mission's later orbits take Juno deeper into the radiation belt. That's a big hit on the solar cells.\" Juno's off-the-shelf solar cells were not designed to withstand the radiation at Jupiter, but testing shows they should do the trick long enough to collect the mission's science data. Solar cells on satellites near Earth typically last decades. Even taking away the low-light and harsh radiation environment at Jupiter, the solar cells still have to handle the violent vibrations and fluctuating hot and cold temperatures of every space mission. The craft will see temperatures ranging from minus 220 degrees to 266 degrees Fahrenheit. The solar arrays should be able to take even more extreme temperatures, Kindt said. \"They will all function,\" Kindt said. \"We have gone through all the thermal and acoustic enviroments. We're highly confident we're not going to have any problems with the arrays.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1105/29junosolar/"}, {"title": "NASA Set to Launch Spacecraft Toward Jupiter Next Week", "date": "2011-07-28", "content": "NASA has attached its next spacecraft bound to explore Jupiter to the rocket that will launch the unmanned probe toward the gas giant next week. Technicians wheeled NASA's Juno probe to its launch pad at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station this morning (July 27), then mated the craft to its Atlas 5 launch vehicle. The event marked a key milestone for the $1.1 billion Juno mission, which aims to shed light on the origin and evolution of the solar system's largest planet. The rocket will launch Juno probe toward Jupiter on Friday, Aug. 5, mission scientists said. \"We're about to start our journey to Jupiter to unlock the secrets of the early solar system,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, in a statement. \"After eight years of development, the spacecraft is ready for its important mission.\" Closest-ever look at Jupiter. Juno will get closer to Jupiter than any other spacecraft in history - but not for a while. After its launch, the probe will cruise through the solar system for five years, finally arriving at the gas giant in July 2016. Once there, Juno will undertake a year-long science campaign, studying Jupiter's structure, composition and magnetosphere, among other things, researchers said. The overall aim is to get a better idea of how, and when, the solar system's biggest planet formed. Jupiter holds about twice as much mass as the rest of the solar system combined, not counting the sun. And it was the first planet to coalesce after the sun formed, gobbling up most of the dust and gas left in the early solar system. That's part of the reason it's so interesting, according to Bolton. \"If we want to go back in time and understand where we came from and how the planets were made, Jupiter holds the secret, because it's got most of the leftovers after the sun formed,\" Bolton told reporters today. \"We want to know that ingredient list. What we're really after is discovering the recipe for making planets.\" Juno will make a variety of observations in an attempt to determine that recipe. For example, the spacecraft will measure the amount of water contained in Jupiter's thick, swirling atmosphere. Relatively large amounts of water might suggest that Jupiter first formed farther out in the solar system, then migrated into its present position, Bolton said. And scientists still aren't sure if Jupiter has a solid core of heavy elements, or if it's made entirely of gas. Juno will look into that question as well, by measuring Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields. \"Juno's prepared to be able to help constrain those answers, and help provide that information so that we can discriminate among models of how Jupiter formed and, in fact, what the history of our early solar systemwas,\" Bolton said. An armored tank of a spacecraft. Juno will settle into a highly elliptical polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016, coming as close as 3,107 miles (5,000 kilometers) from the gas giant's cloud-tops. This proximity will afford great looks at the giant planet, but it's dangerous for Juno, too. Jupiter possesses the strongest radiation environmentof any solar system body beyond the sun. So mission planners have encased Juno's sensitive instruments and electronics inside a titanium \"vault\" for protection. \"We're basically an armored tank going to Jupiter,\" Bolton said. Jupiter's strong radiation also dictated the particulars of Juno's orbit, requiring mission managers to slot the spacecraft precisely between several dangerous belts on its laps around the planet. \"This is like threading a needle,\" Bolton said. \"We're going right through the only safe haven.\" Juno weighs about 8,000 pounds (3,627 kilograms), but about half of that is fuel, researchers said. For power, the spacecraft relies on three huge solar arrays, each the size of a tractor-trailer. The arrays' 18,698 solar cells will generate about 400 watts of power out at Jupiter, which sits about 400 million miles (644 million km) farther from the sun than Earth does. Out there, sunlight is 25 times less intense than it is here on our home planet. Juno will make 33 orbits of Jupiter over its year-long operational life, then be crashed intentionally into the giant planet. Researchers want to make sure Juno doesn't slam into - and contaminate - any of Jupiter's moons, some of which scientists think may be capable of supporting life. But the mission's end is far off in the future, as are the beginnings of its observations at Jupiter. For now, the mission team is looking forward to just getting the spacecraft off the ground. \"It's really exciting,\" Bolton said. \"We're just a few days away from our launch.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/12448-nasa-set-launch-spacecraft-jupiter-week.html"}, {"title": "NASA probe blasts off for Jupiter after launch-pad snags", "date": "2011-08-06", "content": "A sun-powered robotic explorer named Juno is rocketing toward Jupiter on a fresh quest to discover the secret recipe for making planets. The rocket lifted off on Friday almost an hour later than planned, following a suspenseful countdown. A helium leak in a ground system for the probe's Atlas 5 launch vehicle caused the first delay. Then officials needed to confirm that wayward boat was clear of the rocket's offshore launch range. Both issues were resolved in time to send the unmanned rocket spaceward before its 69-minute launch window closed. Hundreds of scientists and their families and friends cheered and yelled \"Go Juno!\" as the Atlas 5 rocket rose into a clear midday sky. It will take five years to reach Jupiter, the solar system's most massive and ancient planet. \"Next stop is Jupiter,\" exulted Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"It's fantastic!\" said Fran Bagenal, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who is also part of the NASA project. \"Huge relief all around.\" Within an hour of liftoff, Juno hurtled out of Earth's orbit at 24,000 mph (38,000 kilometers per hour) on a roundabout course for Jupiter. It was expected to whip past the orbit of the moon in half a day, or early Saturday morning. 1.7 billion-mile voyage. It is the first step in Juno's 1.7 billion-mile (2.7 billion-kilometer) voyage to the gas giant Jupiter, just two planets away but altogether different from Earth and next-door neighbor Mars. Juno is solar-powered, a first for a spacecraft meant to roam so far from the sun. The three huge solar panels popped open an hour into the flight, each one stretching as long and wide as a tractor-trailer. Previous spacecraft to the outer planets have relied on nuclear energy. With Juno, scientists hope to answer some of the most fundamental questions of our solar system. \"How Jupiter formed. How it evolved. What really happened early in the solar system that eventually led to all of us,\" Bolton said earlier in the week. Bolton said Jupiter is like a time capsule. It got most of the leftovers from the sun's creation nearly 5 billion years ago - hence the planet's immense size - and its enormous gravity field has enabled it to hold onto that original material. Jupiter is so big it could contain everything in the solar system, minus the sun, and still be twice as massive. Astronomers say it probably was the first planet in the solar system to form. Juno will venture much closer to Jupiter than any of the eight spacecraft that have visited since the 1970s, most of them just passing by. It's by far the most focused and elaborate Jupiter mission. \"We look deeper. We go much closer. We're going over the poles. So we're doing a lot of new things that have never been done, and we're going to get all this brand-new information,\" Bolton said. Flurry of astronomy missions.

Then comes the $2.5 billion Curiosity, a six-wheeled, jeep-size rover that will blast off for Mars at the end of November in search of environments conducive to life.

With the end of the space shuttle program just two weeks ago, Juno's liftoff created more buzz than usual. Several thousand invited guests jammed Kennedy Space Center to watch the Atlas V blast off with Juno from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station next door. Until Americans start flying into space again from U.S. soil, NASA's science missions will provide the launch excitement. The goal is to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the mid-2030s. \"The public ... needs to understand that NASA's more than about the shuttle,\" Bolton said. A few special passengers actually are riding aboard Juno. Attached to the probe are three little Lego figures specially made of space-grade aluminum. They represent the Italian physicist Galileo, who discovered Jupiter's four biggest moons; the Roman god Jupiter; and his wife, Juno, for whom the spacecraft is named. If all goes well, Juno will go into orbit around Jupiter's poles - a first - on July 4, 2016. The oblong orbit will put Juno within 3,100 miles of the cloud tops and right over the most-powerful auroras in the solar system. In fact, that's how the spacecraft got its name - Juno peered through clouds to keep tabs on her husband, Jupiter. Juno will circle the planet 33 times, each orbit lasting 11 days for a grand total of one year. By mission's end, \"we've essentially dropped a net around the planet with all of our measurements,\" Bolton said. That's crucial for understanding Jupiter's invisible gravity and magnetic force fields. Radiation is so intense around Jupiter that Bolton and his team put Juno's most sensitive electronics inside a titanium vault.

Once there, Juno will undertake a year-long science campaign, studying Jupiter's structure, composition and magnetosphere, among other things, researchers said. The overall aim is to get a better idea of how, and when, the solar system's biggest planet formed. Jupiter holds about twice as much mass as the rest of the solar system combined, not counting the sun. And it was the first planet to coalesce after the sun formed, gobbling up most of the dust and gas left in the early solar system. That's part of the reason it's so interesting, according to Bolton. \"If we want to go back in time and understand where we came from and how the planets were made, Jupiter holds the secret, because it's got most of the leftovers after the sun formed,\" Bolton told reporters today. \"We want to know that ingredient list. What we're really after is discovering the recipe for making planets.\" Juno will make a variety of observations in an attempt to determine that recipe. For example, the spacecraft will measure the amount of water contained in Jupiter's thick, swirling atmosphere. Relatively large amounts of water might suggest that Jupiter first formed farther out in the solar system, then migrated into its present position, Bolton said. And scientists still aren't sure if Jupiter has a solid core of heavy elements, or if it's made entirely of gas. Juno will look into that question as well, by measuring Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields. \"Juno's prepared to be able to help constrain those answers, and help provide that information so that we can discriminate among models of how Jupiter formed and, in fact, what the history of our early solar systemwas,\" Bolton said. An armored tank of a spacecraft. Juno will settle into a highly elliptical polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016, coming as close as 3,107 miles (5,000 kilometers) from the gas giant's cloud-tops. This proximity will afford great looks at the giant planet, but it's dangerous for Juno, too. Jupiter possesses the strongest radiation environmentof any solar system body beyond the sun. So mission planners have encased Juno's sensitive instruments and electronics inside a titanium \"vault\" for protection. \"We're basically an armored tank going to Jupiter,\" Bolton said. Jupiter's strong radiation also dictated the particulars of Juno's orbit, requiring mission managers to slot the spacecraft precisely between several dangerous belts on its laps around the planet. \"This is like threading a needle,\" Bolton said. \"We're going right through the only safe haven.\" Juno weighs about 8,000 pounds (3,627 kilograms), but about half of that is fuel, researchers said. For power, the spacecraft relies on three huge solar arrays, each the size of a tractor-trailer. The arrays' 18,698 solar cells will generate about 400 watts of power out at Jupiter, which sits about 400 million miles (644 million km) farther from the sun than Earth does. Out there, sunlight is 25 times less intense than it is here on our home planet. Juno will make 33 orbits of Jupiter over its year-long operational life, then be crashed intentionally into the giant planet. Researchers want to make sure Juno doesn't slam into - and contaminate - any of Jupiter's moons, some of which scientists think may be capable of supporting life. But the mission's end is far off in the future, as are the beginnings of its observations at Jupiter. For now, the mission team is looking forward to just getting the spacecraft off the ground. \"It's really exciting,\" Bolton said. \"We're just a few days away from our launch.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/12448-nasa-set-launch-spacecraft-jupiter-week.html"}, {"title": "NASA probe blasts off for Jupiter after launch-pad snags", "date": "2011-08-06", "content": "A sun-powered robotic explorer named Juno is rocketing toward Jupiter on a fresh quest to discover the secret recipe for making planets.

Several thousand invited guests jammed Kennedy Space Center to watch the Atlas V blast off with Juno from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station next door. Until Americans start flying into space again from U.S. soil, NASA's science missions will provide the launch excitement.

Exploring the solar system is all about \"unlocking the mysteries of how we got here\" and is worth the money it takes to get those answers, said Jim Adams, NASA's deputy director of planetary science. \"These investments are really in ourselves,\" added Bolton. With the end of the space shuttle program just two weeks ago, Juno's liftoff created more buzz than usual. Several thousand invited guests jammed Kennedy Space Center to watch the Atlas V blast off with Juno from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station next door. Until Americans start flying into space again from U.S. soil, NASA's science missions will provide the launch excitement. The goal is to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the mid-2030s. \"The public ... needs to understand that NASA's more than about the shuttle,\" Bolton said. A few special passengers actually are riding aboard Juno. Attached to the probe are three little Lego figures specially made of space-grade aluminum. They represent the Italian physicist Galileo, who discovered Jupiter's four biggest moons; the Roman god Jupiter; and his wife, Juno, for whom the spacecraft is named. If all goes well, Juno will go into orbit around Jupiter's poles - a first - on July 4, 2016. The oblong orbit will put Juno within 3,100 miles of the cloud tops and right over the most-powerful auroras in the solar system. In fact, that's how the spacecraft got its name - Juno peered through clouds to keep tabs on her husband, Jupiter. Juno will circle the planet 33 times, each orbit lasting 11 days for a grand total of one year. By mission's end, \"we've essentially dropped a net around the planet with all of our measurements,\" Bolton said. That's crucial for understanding Jupiter's invisible gravity and magnetic force fields. Radiation is so intense around Jupiter that Bolton and his team put Juno's most sensitive electronics inside a titanium vault. Juno's experiments also will attempt to ascertain the abundance of water and oxygen in Jupiter's atmosphere and determine whether the core of the planet is solid or gaseous.", "url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/aug/06/nasa-launches-juno-journey-jupiter-20110806/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Juno Spacecraft Refines its Path to Jupiter", "date": "2012-02-03", "content": "NASA's solar-powered Juno spacecraft successfully refined its flight path Wednesday with the mission's first trajectory correction maneuver.

That means the spacecraft is halfway to Jupiter, at least in terms of distance traveled, they added. The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and will arrive at the Jovian system in July 2016.

Similarly, NASA's Juno spacecraft will be passing within some 350 miles of Earth's surface Wednesday, Oct. 9, before it slingshots off into space on a historic exploration of Jupiter. It's all part of a scientific investigation that began with an August 2011 launch. The mission will begin in earnest when Juno arrives at Jupiter in July 2016. Bill Kurth, University of Iowa research scientist and lead investigator for one of Juno's nine scientific instruments, the Waves instrument, says that the two years spent moving outward past the orbit of Mars before swinging past the Earth makes the trip to Jupiter possible. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" says Kurth, who has been involved with the mission since the beginning. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" says Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Kurth and colleagues UI Professor Don Gurnett and research scientist George Hospodarsky note that the real science will begin when Juno begins orbiting Jupiter some 33 times over the course of a year. Juno will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter over its poles. The orbit will be highly eccentric, taking Juno from just above the cloud tops to a distance of about 1.75 million miles from Jupiter, every 11 days. The UI-designed-and-built Waves instrument will examine a variety of phenomena within Jupiter's polar magnetosphere by measuring radio and plasma waves. It's one of nine experiments to be undertaken of the gas giant. In particular, Juno will explore the solar system's most powerful auroras-Jupiter's northern and southern lights-by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. \"Jupiter has the largest and most energetic magnetosphere, and to finally get an opportunity to study the nature of its auroras and the role radio and plasma waves play in their generation makes Juno a really exciting mission for me,\" says Kurth. Juno's other major objectives are to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system's largest planet by: Determining the amount of water and ammonia present in the atmosphere. Observing the dynamics of Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Mapping the planet's magnetic and gravity fields to learn more about its deep interior including the size of its core. Gurnett, a world leader in the field of space plasma physics, says the Juno spacecraft and its unique orbit will expand upon Jupiter data gathered by previous UI instruments. Juno's destiny is a fiery entry into Jupiter's atmosphere at the end of its one-year science phase as a means of guaranteeing it doesn't impact Europa and possibly contaminate that icy world with microbes from Earth. This would jeopardize future missions to that moon designed to determine whether life had begun there on its own. The Juno Waves instrument will be the eighth UI instrument to make the trek to Jupiter. Previous Iowa instruments were carried aboard Pioneers 10 and 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo (including two UI instruments), and Cassini, currently in orbit around Saturn. The Waves instrument was built at the UI by a group of about a dozen scientists, engineers, and technicians, led by research engineer Donald Kirchner. Terry Averkamp, Chris Piker, and William Robinson assist in the operation of the Waves instrument and in the data processing. The Juno project is a collaborative enterprise, led by Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, including the UI and many other organizations and individuals. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Bolton. The Juno mission is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, built and operates the spacecraft. Launch management for the mission was the responsibility of NASA's Launch Services Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The Juno spacecraft will be within 350 miles of Earth when it zooms by our planet at 3:21 p.m. EDT. It will be passing over South Africa during its closest approach to Earth. Since its 2011 launch on an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket, NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter has followed a circuitous route toward Jupiter. This pass around Earth will give it the boost it needs to make it the rest of the way to the solar system's largest planet, accelerating the spacecraft from its current speed -78,000 mph with respect to the sun - to a speed of 87,000 mph. \"Juno is a large, massive spacecraft,\" Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, said in a statement. \"Even a large rocket couldn't provide enough propulsion to get us all the way to Jupiter, so we are flying by the Earth for a gravity-assist that will provide about 70 percent of the initial boost provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. The gravity assist essentially provides as much propulsion as a second rocket launch.\" SwRI officials released a video of the Juno probe's Earth flyby to describe how the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity to help it reach Jupiter. Although 97 percent of NASA staff members are furloughed due to the government shutdown, Juno's mission-critical Earth flyby operations have not been affected. The 8,000-pound Juno probe is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore the outer solar system, and has three large solar arrays, each of which is the size of a tractor-trailer. It also holds a titanium vault to protect sensitive electronic equipment from the harsh environment around Jupiter. \"While we are primarily using Earth as a means to get us to Jupiter, the flight team is also going to check and calibrate Juno's science instruments,\" Bolton said in the statement. There's a bonus, too. Juno is approaching Earth from the planet's sunlit side, which means it is in a prime position to photograph its home planet from deep space. \"Juno will take never-before-seen images of the Earth-Moon system, giving us a chance to see what we look like from Mars or Jupiter,\" Bolton said. The $1.1 billion Juno spacecraft launched in August 2011 and will reach the Jovian system on July 4, 2016.

The time of closest approach is approximately 19:21 UTC (3:21 pm U.S. Eastern time). During the flyby Juno will come to within 347 miles (559 kilometers) of Earth. The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on August 5, 2011 toward Jupiter. Juno's rocket, the Atlas 551, was only capable of giving Juno enough energy or speed to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the Sun's gravity pulled Juno back toward the inner solar system. The Earth flyby gravity assist was planned as part of Juno's trajectory to increase the spacecraft's speed relative to the Sun so that it is sufficient to reach Jupiter. (The spacecraft's speed relative to Earth remains constant.) Because of the flyby, Juno's velocity relative to the Sun increases from 78,000 miles (126,000 kilometers) per hour to 93,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) per hour. Juno is moving much faster than satellites that orbit the Earth because Juno is orbiting the Sun, not Earth. Juno will receive a huge boost from Earth's gravity equivalent to about 70 percent of the total change in velocity, or delta-v, provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. Thus, the boost from the flyby is almost as powerful as a second rocket launch. The spacecraft passes over the ocean off the coast of South Africa at the point of closest approach. About two minutes before this point, Juno will pass into Earth's shadow for about 20 minutes. Juno emerges from the planet's shadow when it is about 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) above Earth at approximately 19:39 UTC when it is over the east coast of India. Juno arrives at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, to study the giant planet's interior, atmosphere and giant magnetosphere. Its main objective is to improve our understanding of how Jupiter formed. What we learn from Juno will teach us about the early stages of our solar system and how Earth and our neighbor planets formed. Juno will even help us understand how the planets around other stars form.

Viewers can also ask questions via Twitter using the hashtag #nasajuno. \"Besides watching on Slooh, viewers near Cape Town, South Africa, will have the best opportunity to view the spacecraft traveling across the sky,\" Slooh officials said. \"The spacecraft will most likely not be visible to the unaided eye, but binoculars or a small telescope with a wide field should provide an opportunity to view.\" Observers in India and other locations also may be able to spot Juno with a binoculars or a small telescope during the flyby. Check Sky & Telescope and Heavens Above for the details. In addition, NASA is inviting amateur radio operators to say \"Hi\" to Juno in a coordinated Morse code message starting at 2 p.m. ET. NASA launched the Juno in August 2011 on a mission to study Jupiter in unprecedented detail when it arrives at the gas giant planet on July 4, 2016. The $1.1 billion Juno mission to Jupiter will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter to reveal glimpses into the planet's origin, structure, atmosphere and magnetic field. It is named after Juno, the mythological wife of the god Jupiter who used special powers to learn the secrets Jupiter had hidden beneath cloud cover. But first, the Juno spacecraft has to get to Jupiter. NASA used an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket to launch Juno in 2011, but the rocket was not powerful enough to send the spacecraft all the way to Jupiter. Instead, it sent Juno on a looping trajectory that carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and back so it could around Earth on Wednesday in what scientists call a \"gravity assist.\" Juno is currently streaking through the solar system at a speed of 78,000 mph, with respect to the sun. During the gravity-assist speed boost, Earth's gravity will cause Juno to accelerate as it approaches the planet. Once Juno completes the flyby, it will be traveling at about 87,000 mph. Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, has likened the maneuver to a \"second rocket launch.\" While 97 percent of NASA is currently on furlough because of the ongoing government shutdown, the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - which manages the Juno mission - remains on duty for now. During Juno's Earth flyby, the spacecraft is expected to test its science instruments and snap photos of Earth and the moon. \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" Bolton said in a statement. The probe will also flex its scientific muscle in other ways. \"We'll exercise the science instruments, since Juno's instruments will be operating in a magnetospheric environment for the first time,\" said spacecraft engineer Jeff Lewis, Juno operations lead for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"The Earth's magnetic field will allow a number of the instruments to be tested. We're also using the flyby of the moon as an opportunity to gauge how the spacecraft operates. Since Juno is a spinning spacecraft, we need to sense the right time to take data as the moon, or Jupiter, passes through the instruments' fields of view.\" But the star of Wednesday's Earth flyby is the gravity assist maneuver itself, scientists said. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" said research scientist Bill Kurth of the University of Iowa, who is the lead investigator for two of Juno's instruments. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" The Slooh webcast of the Juno flyby of Earth can be tracked directly from the Slooh Space Camera website and via the Slooh iPad app. ", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/how-watch-nasas-juno-zip-earth-its-mission-jupiter-8c11363338"}, {"title": "NASA Jupiter Probe Still In 'Safe Mode' After Earth Flyby Glitch", "date": "2013-10-12", "content": "A NASA Jupiter probe remains in a protective \"safe mode\" two days after completing a speed-boosting flyby of Earth, but mission officials have expressed confidence that the issue will be solved soon.

The probe's handlers are still trying to figure out what exactly happened, but they suspect a minor glitch rather than a big mission-threatening problem. \"We have a couple of candidates,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"None of them suggest a serious problem, and we haven't seen any indication that there is a serious problem.\" The main goal of the flyby was achieved despite the glitch, and Juno is now on the proper trajectory to Jupiter, Bolton added. The Juno spacecraft is in a healthy and stable state, with its tractor-trailer-size solar panels pointed toward the sun. The mission team is in communication with Juno and has seen no sign of any failures in the probe's subsystems or components, said project manager Rick Nybakken of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. So Juno's handlers plan to take their time and do a thorough investigation before attempting to bring all of the spacecraft's systems back online. \"There's nothing that's rushing us to do this, so we might as well be very careful and do our homework, and just, say, turn everything on nice and slow,\" Bolton told SPACE.com. \"We're not missing anything that we need right now, and we're on our way safely to Jupiter.\" The Juno team is already going through the probe's engineering data, as well as the science observations and images captured during the flyby, Nybakken said. All off this information should have been received by Thursday evening (Oct. 10), barring any transmission issues, he added. \"So we're looking at that data, and we're starting to develop a plan to bring the spacecraft back into operational status,\" Nybakken told SPACE.com. \"Developing that plan will probably take us over the weekend.\" The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and is slated to arrive in orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.

Juno is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds (3,267 kilograms) - that it needed a post-liftoff speed boost to get to Jupiter, so mission managers decided to get a \"gravity assist\" from Earth. Wednesday's flyby, which was highlighted by a close approach that brought Juno within just 347 miles (558 kilometers) of Earth at 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT), was designed to ramp the probe up from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph (126,000 to 140,000 km/h). While boosting Juno's speed was the main goal, mission team members also planned to check out Juno's science instruments and take some photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby. The glitch caused some data to be lost, but the team should end up getting the vast majority of it, Bolton said. \"I expect we'll have some cool images and a cool movie and all that to release,\" he said.

It's all part of a scientific investigation that began with an August 2011 launch. The mission will begin in earnest when Juno arrives at Jupiter in July 2016. Bill Kurth, University of Iowa research scientist and lead investigator for one of Juno's nine scientific instruments, the Waves instrument, says that the two years spent moving outward past the orbit of Mars before swinging past the Earth makes the trip to Jupiter possible. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" says Kurth, who has been involved with the mission since the beginning. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" says Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Kurth and colleagues UI Professor Don Gurnett and research scientist George Hospodarsky note that the real science will begin when Juno begins orbiting Jupiter some 33 times over the course of a year. Juno will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter over its poles. The orbit will be highly eccentric, taking Juno from just above the cloud tops to a distance of about 1.75 million miles from Jupiter, every 11 days. The UI-designed-and-built Waves instrument will examine a variety of phenomena within Jupiter's polar magnetosphere by measuring radio and plasma waves. It's one of nine experiments to be undertaken of the gas giant. In particular, Juno will explore the solar system's most powerful auroras-Jupiter's northern and southern lights-by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. \"Jupiter has the largest and most energetic magnetosphere, and to finally get an opportunity to study the nature of its auroras and the role radio and plasma waves play in their generation makes Juno a really exciting mission for me,\" says Kurth. Juno's other major objectives are to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system's largest planet by: Determining the amount of water and ammonia present in the atmosphere. Observing the dynamics of Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Mapping the planet's magnetic and gravity fields to learn more about its deep interior including the size of its core. Gurnett, a world leader in the field of space plasma physics, says the Juno spacecraft and its unique orbit will expand upon Jupiter data gathered by previous UI instruments. Juno's destiny is a fiery entry into Jupiter's atmosphere at the end of its one-year science phase as a means of guaranteeing it doesn't impact Europa and possibly contaminate that icy world with microbes from Earth. This would jeopardize future missions to that moon designed to determine whether life had begun there on its own. The Juno Waves instrument will be the eighth UI instrument to make the trek to Jupiter. Previous Iowa instruments were carried aboard Pioneers 10 and 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo (including two UI instruments), and Cassini, currently in orbit around Saturn. The Waves instrument was built at the UI by a group of about a dozen scientists, engineers, and technicians, led by research engineer Donald Kirchner. Terry Averkamp, Chris Piker, and William Robinson assist in the operation of the Waves instrument and in the data processing. The Juno project is a collaborative enterprise, led by Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, including the UI and many other organizations and individuals. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Bolton.

The Juno spacecraft will be within 350 miles of Earth when it zooms by our planet at 3:21 p.m. EDT. It will be passing over South Africa during its closest approach to Earth. Since its 2011 launch on an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket, NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter has followed a circuitous route toward Jupiter. This pass around Earth will give it the boost it needs to make it the rest of the way to the solar system's largest planet, accelerating the spacecraft from its current speed -78,000 mph with respect to the sun - to a speed of 87,000 mph. \"Juno is a large, massive spacecraft,\" Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, said in a statement. \"Even a large rocket couldn't provide enough propulsion to get us all the way to Jupiter, so we are flying by the Earth for a gravity-assist that will provide about 70 percent of the initial boost provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. The gravity assist essentially provides as much propulsion as a second rocket launch.\" SwRI officials released a video of the Juno probe's Earth flyby to describe how the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity to help it reach Jupiter. Although 97 percent of NASA staff members are furloughed due to the government shutdown, Juno's mission-critical Earth flyby operations have not been affected. The 8,000-pound Juno probe is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore the outer solar system, and has three large solar arrays, each of which is the size of a tractor-trailer. It also holds a titanium vault to protect sensitive electronic equipment from the harsh environment around Jupiter. \"While we are primarily using Earth as a means to get us to Jupiter, the flight team is also going to check and calibrate Juno's science instruments,\" Bolton said in the statement. There's a bonus, too. Juno is approaching Earth from the planet's sunlit side, which means it is in a prime position to photograph its home planet from deep space. \"Juno will take never-before-seen images of the Earth-Moon system, giving us a chance to see what we look like from Mars or Jupiter,\" Bolton said. The $1.1 billion Juno spacecraft launched in August 2011 and will reach the Jovian system on July 4, 2016. Juno will then orbit around Jupiter for a full Earth year, studying the planet's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with nine different science instruments, according to the statement. The mission is named after the goddess Juno, from Greek and Roman mythology. In the myth, the god Jupiter used clouds to hide his mischievousness, but his wife Juno was able to peer through the veil to see her husband's antics, according to a NASA description.

The time of closest approach is approximately 19:21 UTC (3:21 pm U.S. Eastern time). During the flyby Juno will come to within 347 miles (559 kilometers) of Earth. The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on August 5, 2011 toward Jupiter. Juno's rocket, the Atlas 551, was only capable of giving Juno enough energy or speed to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the Sun's gravity pulled Juno back toward the inner solar system. The Earth flyby gravity assist was planned as part of Juno's trajectory to increase the spacecraft's speed relative to the Sun so that it is sufficient to reach Jupiter. (The spacecraft's speed relative to Earth remains constant.) Because of the flyby, Juno's velocity relative to the Sun increases from 78,000 miles (126,000 kilometers) per hour to 93,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) per hour. Juno is moving much faster than satellites that orbit the Earth because Juno is orbiting the Sun, not Earth. Juno will receive a huge boost from Earth's gravity equivalent to about 70 percent of the total change in velocity, or delta-v, provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. Thus, the boost from the flyby is almost as powerful as a second rocket launch. The spacecraft passes over the ocean off the coast of South Africa at the point of closest approach. About two minutes before this point, Juno will pass into Earth's shadow for about 20 minutes. Juno emerges from the planet's shadow when it is about 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) above Earth at approximately 19:39 UTC when it is over the east coast of India. Juno arrives at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, to study the giant planet's interior, atmosphere and giant magnetosphere. Its main objective is to improve our understanding of how Jupiter formed. What we learn from Juno will teach us about the early stages of our solar system and how Earth and our neighbor planets formed. Juno will even help us understand how the planets around other stars form. On the map & geometry images provided below, the red segments of the spacecraft's path indicate the time when Juno is within Earth's shadow.

NASA's Juno probe will be a mere 347 miles from Earth and over South Africa when it makes its closest approach at 3:21 p.m. ET. Later tonight, at 9:30 p.m. ET, the online Slooh Space Camera will track the Juno spacecraft's Earth flyby live in a free webcast. You can watch the Juno flyby webcast live on Space.com, courtesy of Slooh. Viewers can also ask questions via Twitter using the hashtag #nasajuno. \"Besides watching on Slooh, viewers near Cape Town, South Africa, will have the best opportunity to view the spacecraft traveling across the sky,\" Slooh officials said. \"The spacecraft will most likely not be visible to the unaided eye, but binoculars or a small telescope with a wide field should provide an opportunity to view.\" Observers in India and other locations also may be able to spot Juno with a binoculars or a small telescope during the flyby. Check Sky & Telescope and Heavens Above for the details. In addition, NASA is inviting amateur radio operators to say \"Hi\" to Juno in a coordinated Morse code message starting at 2 p.m. ET. NASA launched the Juno in August 2011 on a mission to study Jupiter in unprecedented detail when it arrives at the gas giant planet on July 4, 2016. The $1.1 billion Juno mission to Jupiter will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter to reveal glimpses into the planet's origin, structure, atmosphere and magnetic field. It is named after Juno, the mythological wife of the god Jupiter who used special powers to learn the secrets Jupiter had hidden beneath cloud cover. But first, the Juno spacecraft has to get to Jupiter. NASA used an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket to launch Juno in 2011, but the rocket was not powerful enough to send the spacecraft all the way to Jupiter. Instead, it sent Juno on a looping trajectory that carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and back so it could around Earth on Wednesday in what scientists call a \"gravity assist.\" Juno is currently streaking through the solar system at a speed of 78,000 mph, with respect to the sun. During the gravity-assist speed boost, Earth's gravity will cause Juno to accelerate as it approaches the planet. Once Juno completes the flyby, it will be traveling at about 87,000 mph. Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, has likened the maneuver to a \"second rocket launch.\" While 97 percent of NASA is currently on furlough because of the ongoing government shutdown, the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - which manages the Juno mission - remains on duty for now. During Juno's Earth flyby, the spacecraft is expected to test its science instruments and snap photos of Earth and the moon. \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" Bolton said in a statement. The probe will also flex its scientific muscle in other ways. \"We'll exercise the science instruments, since Juno's instruments will be operating in a magnetospheric environment for the first time,\" said spacecraft engineer Jeff Lewis, Juno operations lead for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"The Earth's magnetic field will allow a number of the instruments to be tested. We're also using the flyby of the moon as an opportunity to gauge how the spacecraft operates. Since Juno is a spinning spacecraft, we need to sense the right time to take data as the moon, or Jupiter, passes through the instruments' fields of view.\" But the star of Wednesday's Earth flyby is the gravity assist maneuver itself, scientists said. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" said research scientist Bill Kurth of the University of Iowa, who is the lead investigator for two of Juno's instruments. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" The Slooh webcast of the Juno flyby of Earth can be tracked directly from the Slooh Space Camera website and via the Slooh iPad app. ", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/how-watch-nasas-juno-zip-earth-its-mission-jupiter-8c11363338"}, {"title": "NASA Jupiter Probe Still In 'Safe Mode' After Earth Flyby Glitch", "date": "2013-10-12", "content": "A NASA Jupiter probe remains in a protective \"safe mode\" two days after completing a speed-boosting flyby of Earth, but mission officials have expressed confidence that the issue will be solved soon. NASA's Juno spacecraft detected an anomalous condition and went into safe mode Wednesday afternoon (Oct. 9), just 10 minutes after making its closest approach to Earth in a slingshot maneuver designed to build momentum for the long trip to the solar system's largest planet. The probe's handlers are still trying to figure out what exactly happened, but they suspect a minor glitch rather than a big mission-threatening problem. \"We have a couple of candidates,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"None of them suggest a serious problem, and we haven't seen any indication that there is a serious problem.\" The main goal of the flyby was achieved despite the glitch, and Juno is now on the proper trajectory to Jupiter, Bolton added. The Juno spacecraft is in a healthy and stable state, with its tractor-trailer-size solar panels pointed toward the sun. The mission team is in communication with Juno and has seen no sign of any failures in the probe's subsystems or components, said project manager Rick Nybakken of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. So Juno's handlers plan to take their time and do a thorough investigation before attempting to bring all of the spacecraft's systems back online. \"There's nothing that's rushing us to do this, so we might as well be very careful and do our homework, and just, say, turn everything on nice and slow,\" Bolton told SPACE.com. \"We're not missing anything that we need right now, and we're on our way safely to Jupiter.\" The Juno team is already going through the probe's engineering data, as well as the science observations and images captured during the flyby, Nybakken said. All off this information should have been received by Thursday evening (Oct. 10), barring any transmission issues, he added. \"So we're looking at that data, and we're starting to develop a plan to bring the spacecraft back into operational status,\" Nybakken told SPACE.com. \"Developing that plan will probably take us over the weekend.\" The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and is slated to arrive in orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.

Juno is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds (3,267 kilograms) - that it needed a post-liftoff speed boost to get to Jupiter, so mission managers decided to get a \"gravity assist\" from Earth. Wednesday's flyby, which was highlighted by a close approach that brought Juno within just 347 miles (558 kilometers) of Earth at 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT), was designed to ramp the probe up from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph (126,000 to 140,000 km/h). While boosting Juno's speed was the main goal, mission team members also planned to check out Juno's science instruments and take some photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby. The glitch caused some data to be lost, but the team should end up getting the vast majority of it, Bolton said. \"I expect we'll have some cool images and a cool movie and all that to release,\" he said.

Since its 2011 launch on an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket, NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter has followed a circuitous route toward Jupiter. This pass around Earth will give it the boost it needs to make it the rest of the way to the solar system's largest planet, accelerating the spacecraft from its current speed -78,000 mph with respect to the sun - to a speed of 87,000 mph. \"Juno is a large, massive spacecraft,\" Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, said in a statement. \"Even a large rocket couldn't provide enough propulsion to get us all the way to Jupiter, so we are flying by the Earth for a gravity-assist that will provide about 70 percent of the initial boost provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. The gravity assist essentially provides as much propulsion as a second rocket launch.\" SwRI officials released a video of the Juno probe's Earth flyby to describe how the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity to help it reach Jupiter. Although 97 percent of NASA staff members are furloughed due to the government shutdown, Juno's mission-critical Earth flyby operations have not been affected. The 8,000-pound Juno probe is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore the outer solar system, and has three large solar arrays, each of which is the size of a tractor-trailer. It also holds a titanium vault to protect sensitive electronic equipment from the harsh environment around Jupiter. \"While we are primarily using Earth as a means to get us to Jupiter, the flight team is also going to check and calibrate Juno's science instruments,\" Bolton said in the statement. There's a bonus, too. Juno is approaching Earth from the planet's sunlit side, which means it is in a prime position to photograph its home planet from deep space. \"Juno will take never-before-seen images of the Earth-Moon system, giving us a chance to see what we look like from Mars or Jupiter,\" Bolton said. The $1.1 billion Juno spacecraft launched in August 2011 and will reach the Jovian system on July 4, 2016. Juno will then orbit around Jupiter for a full Earth year, studying the planet's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with nine different science instruments, according to the statement. The mission is named after the goddess Juno, from Greek and Roman mythology. In the myth, the god Jupiter used clouds to hide his mischievousness, but his wife Juno was able to peer through the veil to see her husband's antics, according to a NASA description.

The time of closest approach is approximately 19:21 UTC (3:21 pm U.S. Eastern time). During the flyby Juno will come to within 347 miles (559 kilometers) of Earth. The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on August 5, 2011 toward Jupiter. Juno's rocket, the Atlas 551, was only capable of giving Juno enough energy or speed to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the Sun's gravity pulled Juno back toward the inner solar system. The Earth flyby gravity assist was planned as part of Juno's trajectory to increase the spacecraft's speed relative to the Sun so that it is sufficient to reach Jupiter. (The spacecraft's speed relative to Earth remains constant.) Because of the flyby, Juno's velocity relative to the Sun increases from 78,000 miles (126,000 kilometers) per hour to 93,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) per hour. Juno is moving much faster than satellites that orbit the Earth because Juno is orbiting the Sun, not Earth. Juno will receive a huge boost from Earth's gravity equivalent to about 70 percent of the total change in velocity, or delta-v, provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. Thus, the boost from the flyby is almost as powerful as a second rocket launch. The spacecraft passes over the ocean off the coast of South Africa at the point of closest approach. About two minutes before this point, Juno will pass into Earth's shadow for about 20 minutes. Juno emerges from the planet's shadow when it is about 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) above Earth at approximately 19:39 UTC when it is over the east coast of India. Juno arrives at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, to study the giant planet's interior, atmosphere and giant magnetosphere. Its main objective is to improve our understanding of how Jupiter formed. What we learn from Juno will teach us about the early stages of our solar system and how Earth and our neighbor planets formed. Juno will even help us understand how the planets around other stars form.

Check Sky & Telescope and Heavens Above for the details. In addition, NASA is inviting amateur radio operators to say \"Hi\" to Juno in a coordinated Morse code message starting at 2 p.m. ET. NASA launched the Juno in August 2011 on a mission to study Jupiter in unprecedented detail when it arrives at the gas giant planet on July 4, 2016. The $1.1 billion Juno mission to Jupiter will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter to reveal glimpses into the planet's origin, structure, atmosphere and magnetic field. It is named after Juno, the mythological wife of the god Jupiter who used special powers to learn the secrets Jupiter had hidden beneath cloud cover. But first, the Juno spacecraft has to get to Jupiter. NASA used an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket to launch Juno in 2011, but the rocket was not powerful enough to send the spacecraft all the way to Jupiter. Instead, it sent Juno on a looping trajectory that carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and back so it could around Earth on Wednesday in what scientists call a \"gravity assist.\" Juno is currently streaking through the solar system at a speed of 78,000 mph, with respect to the sun. During the gravity-assist speed boost, Earth's gravity will cause Juno to accelerate as it approaches the planet. Once Juno completes the flyby, it will be traveling at about 87,000 mph. Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, has likened the maneuver to a \"second rocket launch.\" While 97 percent of NASA is currently on furlough because of the ongoing government shutdown, the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - which manages the Juno mission - remains on duty for now. During Juno's Earth flyby, the spacecraft is expected to test its science instruments and snap photos of Earth and the moon. \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" Bolton said in a statement. The probe will also flex its scientific muscle in other ways. \"We'll exercise the science instruments, since Juno's instruments will be operating in a magnetospheric environment for the first time,\" said spacecraft engineer Jeff Lewis, Juno operations lead for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"The Earth's magnetic field will allow a number of the instruments to be tested. We're also using the flyby of the moon as an opportunity to gauge how the spacecraft operates. Since Juno is a spinning spacecraft, we need to sense the right time to take data as the moon, or Jupiter, passes through the instruments' fields of view.\" But the star of Wednesday's Earth flyby is the gravity assist maneuver itself, scientists said. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" said research scientist Bill Kurth of the University of Iowa, who is the lead investigator for two of Juno's instruments. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" The Slooh webcast of the Juno flyby of Earth can be tracked directly from the Slooh Space Camera website and via the Slooh iPad app. ", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/how-watch-nasas-juno-zip-earth-its-mission-jupiter-8c11363338"}, {"title": "NASA Jupiter Probe Still In 'Safe Mode' After Earth Flyby Glitch", "date": "2013-10-12", "content": "A NASA Jupiter probe remains in a protective \"safe mode\" two days after completing a speed-boosting flyby of Earth, but mission officials have expressed confidence that the issue will be solved soon. NASA's Juno spacecraft detected an anomalous condition and went into safe mode Wednesday afternoon (Oct. 9), just 10 minutes after making its closest approach to Earth in a slingshot maneuver designed to build momentum for the long trip to the solar system's largest planet. The probe's handlers are still trying to figure out what exactly happened, but they suspect a minor glitch rather than a big mission-threatening problem. \"We have a couple of candidates,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"None of them suggest a serious problem, and we haven't seen any indication that there is a serious problem.\" The main goal of the flyby was achieved despite the glitch, and Juno is now on the proper trajectory to Jupiter, Bolton added. The Juno spacecraft is in a healthy and stable state, with its tractor-trailer-size solar panels pointed toward the sun. The mission team is in communication with Juno and has seen no sign of any failures in the probe's subsystems or components, said project manager Rick Nybakken of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. So Juno's handlers plan to take their time and do a thorough investigation before attempting to bring all of the spacecraft's systems back online. \"There's nothing that's rushing us to do this, so we might as well be very careful and do our homework, and just, say, turn everything on nice and slow,\" Bolton told SPACE.com. \"We're not missing anything that we need right now, and we're on our way safely to Jupiter.\" The Juno team is already going through the probe's engineering data, as well as the science observations and images captured during the flyby, Nybakken said. All off this information should have been received by Thursday evening (Oct. 10), barring any transmission issues, he added. \"So we're looking at that data, and we're starting to develop a plan to bring the spacecraft back into operational status,\" Nybakken told SPACE.com. \"Developing that plan will probably take us over the weekend.\" The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and is slated to arrive in orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. Once there, the probe will circle the gas giant for a full Earth year, studying Jupiter's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with nine science instruments. Juno is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds (3,267 kilograms) - that it needed a post-liftoff speed boost to get to Jupiter, so mission managers decided to get a \"gravity assist\" from Earth. Wednesday's flyby, which was highlighted by a close approach that brought Juno within just 347 miles (558 kilometers) of Earth at 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT), was designed to ramp the probe up from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph (126,000 to 140,000 km/h). While boosting Juno's speed was the main goal, mission team members also planned to check out Juno's science instruments and take some photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby. The glitch caused some data to be lost, but the team should end up getting the vast majority of it, Bolton said. \"I expect we'll have some cool images and a cool movie and all that to release,\" he said.

The spacecraft is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds, or 3,267 kilograms - that it needed a gravity assist from Earth after its August 2011 launch. Mission team members also checked out Juno's science equipment and took photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby.

The space probe's flyby of Earth on Oct. 9 was intended to give it a speed boost from our planet's gravity and put it on the correct path toward Jupiter.

According to Donald Kirchner, University of Iowa research engineer on Juno and one of the coordinators of the all-volunteer \"Say Hi to Juno\" project, all licensed amateur radio operators were invited to participate by visiting a website and following posted instructions. \"The idea was to coordinate the efforts of amateur radio operators all over the world, and send a message in Morse code that could be received by the University of Iowa-designed-and-built instrument on the Juno spacecraft,\" he says. \"We know that over a thousand participated, and probably many more than that.\" The technology used to key in the message was old school. Interestingly, Juno did not return the greeting or even decode the message itself. Rather, after the amateur radio operators' messages were sent, the Juno team evaluated the Waves instrument data containing the messages after the Oct. 9 flyby. The message was visible early in the event when the spacecraft was still over 37,000 kilometers-about 23,000 miles-from the Earth. Kirchner notes that although previous space missions-Galileo on its way to Jupiter and Cassini while headed for Saturn-were able to detect shortwave radio transmissions during their Earth encounters, it was not possible to decode intelligent information using the data from those spacecraft. According to Bill Kurth, UI research scientist and lead investigator for the Waves instrument: \"We believe this was the first intelligent information to be transmitted to a passing interplanetary space instrument, as simple as the message may seem,\" he says. \"This was a way to involve a large number of people-those not usually associated with Juno-in a small portion of the mission. This raises awareness, and we've already heard from some that they'll be motivated to follow the Juno mission through its science phase at Jupiter.\" Kurth is scheduled to participate in a press conference on the scientific information gathered during Juno's Earth fly-by, as well as the success of the \"Say Hi to Juno\" project, at 10:30 a.m. or 12:30 p.m. today, Tuesday, Dec. 10 during the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. Kirchner says that the project originated when public outreach staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., wanted to know if the UI receiver was able to pick up a voice message. Although that isn't possible, Kurth and Kirchner came up with the idea that a slow Morse code message should work. Kirchner is an amateur radio operator, himself, and took the lead in designing the project. His usual ham activities include being an assistant emergency coordinator with the Johnson County Amateur Radio Emergency Service, which works closely with the Johnson County Emergency Management Agency to provide backup and auxiliary communications. To make the transmission to Juno, he enlisted a student organization, the UI Amateur Radio Club, to set up a temporary station on the roof of Van Allen Hall. Operating for a few days up to the flyby, he and other club members contacted hundreds of stations in 40 states and 17 countries to raise awareness of the project. The \"say Hi\" project was made possible by the fact that Juno passed within 350 miles of the Earth's surface on Oct. 9 in a maneuver to gain momentum for its July 2016 encounter with Jupiter. Plans call for Juno to orbit Jupiter 33 times. Among a variety of investigations, Juno will explore Jupiter's northern and southern lights by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. The Waves instrument was built at the UI by a group of about a dozen scientists, engineers, and technicians, led by Kurth and Kirchner. Terry Averkamp, Chris Piker, and William Robinson, also an amateur radio operator, assist in the operation of the Waves instrument and in the data processing.

One of Juno's sensors, a special kind of camera optimized to track faint stars, also had a unique view of the Earth-moon system. The result was an intriguing, low-resolution glimpse of what our world would look like to a visitor from afar. \"If Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise said, 'Take us home, Scotty,' this is what the crew would see,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio. \"In the movie, you ride aboard Juno as it approaches Earth and then soars off into the blackness of space. No previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of Earth and moon.\" The cameras that took the images for the movie are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft's three solar-array arms. They are part of Juno's Magnetic Field Investigation (MAG) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors. These cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array, so as the spacecraft approached, the system's four cameras pointed toward Earth. Earth and the moon came into view when Juno was about 600,000 miles (966,000 kilometers) away -- about three times the Earth-moon separation. During the flyby, timing was everything. Juno was traveling about twice as fast as a typical satellite, and the spacecraft itself was spinning at 2 rpm. To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant. The frames were sent to Earth, where they were processed into video format. \"Everything we humans are and everything we do is represented in that view,\" said the star tracker's designer, John J\u00f8rgensen of the Danish Technical University, near Copenhagen. Also during the flyby, Juno's Waves instrument, which is tasked with measuring radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere, recorded amateur radio signals. This was part of a public outreach effort involving ham radio operators from around the world. They were invited to say \"HI\" to Juno by coordinating radio transmissions that carried the same Morse-coded message. Operators from every continent, including Antarctica, participated. \"With the Earth flyby completed, Juno is now on course for arrival at Jupiter on July 4, 2016,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

Juno's launch vehicle was capable of giving the spacecraft only enough energy to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the sun's gravity pulled it back toward the inner solar system. Mission planners designed the swing by Earth as a gravity assist to increase the spacecraft's speed relative to the sun, so that it could reach Jupiter. (The spacecraft's speed relative to Earth before and after the flyby is unchanged.) After Juno arrives and enters into orbit around Jupiter in 2016, the spacecraft will circle the planet 33 times, from pole to pole, and use its collection of science instruments to probe beneath the gas giant's obscuring cloud cover. Scientists will learn about Jupiter's origins, internal structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere. Juno's name comes from Greek and Roman mythology.

Juno will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter over its poles. The orbit will be highly eccentric, taking Juno from just above the cloud tops to a distance of about 1.75 million miles from Jupiter, every 11 days. The UI-designed-and-built Waves instrument will examine a variety of phenomena within Jupiter's polar magnetosphere by measuring radio and plasma waves. It's one of nine experiments to be undertaken of the gas giant. In particular, Juno will explore the solar system's most powerful auroras-Jupiter's northern and southern lights-by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. \"Jupiter has the largest and most energetic magnetosphere, and to finally get an opportunity to study the nature of its auroras and the role radio and plasma waves play in their generation makes Juno a really exciting mission for me,\" says Kurth. Juno's other major objectives are to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system's largest planet by: Determining the amount of water and ammonia present in the atmosphere. Observing the dynamics of Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Mapping the planet's magnetic and gravity fields to learn more about its deep interior including the size of its core. Gurnett, a world leader in the field of space plasma physics, says the Juno spacecraft and its unique orbit will expand upon Jupiter data gathered by previous UI instruments. Juno's destiny is a fiery entry into Jupiter's atmosphere at the end of its one-year science phase as a means of guaranteeing it doesn't impact Europa and possibly contaminate that icy world with microbes from Earth. This would jeopardize future missions to that moon designed to determine whether life had begun there on its own.

This pass around Earth will give it the boost it needs to make it the rest of the way to the solar system's largest planet, accelerating the spacecraft from its current speed -78,000 mph with respect to the sun - to a speed of 87,000 mph. \"Juno is a large, massive spacecraft,\" Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, said in a statement. \"Even a large rocket couldn't provide enough propulsion to get us all the way to Jupiter, so we are flying by the Earth for a gravity-assist that will provide about 70 percent of the initial boost provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. The gravity assist essentially provides as much propulsion as a second rocket launch.\" SwRI officials released a video of the Juno probe's Earth flyby to describe how the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity to help it reach Jupiter. Although 97 percent of NASA staff members are furloughed due to the government shutdown, Juno's mission-critical Earth flyby operations have not been affected. The 8,000-pound Juno probe is the first solar-powered spacecraft to explore the outer solar system, and has three large solar arrays, each of which is the size of a tractor-trailer. It also holds a titanium vault to protect sensitive electronic equipment from the harsh environment around Jupiter. \"While we are primarily using Earth as a means to get us to Jupiter, the flight team is also going to check and calibrate Juno's science instruments,\" Bolton said in the statement. There's a bonus, too. Juno is approaching Earth from the planet's sunlit side, which means it is in a prime position to photograph its home planet from deep space. \"Juno will take never-before-seen images of the Earth-Moon system, giving us a chance to see what we look like from Mars or Jupiter,\" Bolton said. The $1.1 billion Juno spacecraft launched in August 2011 and will reach the Jovian system on July 4, 2016. Juno will then orbit around Jupiter for a full Earth year, studying the planet's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with nine different science instruments, according to the statement. The mission is named after the goddess Juno, from Greek and Roman mythology. In the myth, the god Jupiter used clouds to hide his mischievousness, but his wife Juno was able to peer through the veil to see her husband's antics, according to a NASA description.

The time of closest approach is approximately 19:21 UTC (3:21 pm U.S. Eastern time). During the flyby Juno will come to within 347 miles (559 kilometers) of Earth. The Juno spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on August 5, 2011 toward Jupiter. Juno's rocket, the Atlas 551, was only capable of giving Juno enough energy or speed to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the Sun's gravity pulled Juno back toward the inner solar system. The Earth flyby gravity assist was planned as part of Juno's trajectory to increase the spacecraft's speed relative to the Sun so that it is sufficient to reach Jupiter. (The spacecraft's speed relative to Earth remains constant.) Because of the flyby, Juno's velocity relative to the Sun increases from 78,000 miles (126,000 kilometers) per hour to 93,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) per hour. Juno is moving much faster than satellites that orbit the Earth because Juno is orbiting the Sun, not Earth. Juno will receive a huge boost from Earth's gravity equivalent to about 70 percent of the total change in velocity, or delta-v, provided by the Atlas V 551 rocket. Thus, the boost from the flyby is almost as powerful as a second rocket launch. The spacecraft passes over the ocean off the coast of South Africa at the point of closest approach. About two minutes before this point, Juno will pass into Earth's shadow for about 20 minutes. Juno emerges from the planet's shadow when it is about 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) above Earth at approximately 19:39 UTC when it is over the east coast of India. Juno arrives at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, to study the giant planet's interior, atmosphere and giant magnetosphere. Its main objective is to improve our understanding of how Jupiter formed. What we learn from Juno will teach us about the early stages of our solar system and how Earth and our neighbor planets formed. Juno will even help us understand how the planets around other stars form.

NASA's Juno probe will be a mere 347 miles from Earth and over South Africa when it makes its closest approach at 3:21 p.m. ET. Later tonight, at 9:30 p.m. ET, the online Slooh Space Camera will track the Juno spacecraft's Earth flyby live in a free webcast.

Viewers can also ask questions via Twitter using the hashtag #nasajuno. \"Besides watching on Slooh, viewers near Cape Town, South Africa, will have the best opportunity to view the spacecraft traveling across the sky,\" Slooh officials said. \"The spacecraft will most likely not be visible to the unaided eye, but binoculars or a small telescope with a wide field should provide an opportunity to view.\" Observers in India and other locations also may be able to spot Juno with a binoculars or a small telescope during the flyby. Check Sky & Telescope and Heavens Above for the details. In addition, NASA is inviting amateur radio operators to say \"Hi\" to Juno in a coordinated Morse code message starting at 2 p.m. ET. NASA launched the Juno in August 2011 on a mission to study Jupiter in unprecedented detail when it arrives at the gas giant planet on July 4, 2016. The $1.1 billion Juno mission to Jupiter will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter to reveal glimpses into the planet's origin, structure, atmosphere and magnetic field. It is named after Juno, the mythological wife of the god Jupiter who used special powers to learn the secrets Jupiter had hidden beneath cloud cover. But first, the Juno spacecraft has to get to Jupiter. NASA used an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket to launch Juno in 2011, but the rocket was not powerful enough to send the spacecraft all the way to Jupiter. Instead, it sent Juno on a looping trajectory that carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and back so it could around Earth on Wednesday in what scientists call a \"gravity assist.\" Juno is currently streaking through the solar system at a speed of 78,000 mph, with respect to the sun. During the gravity-assist speed boost, Earth's gravity will cause Juno to accelerate as it approaches the planet. Once Juno completes the flyby, it will be traveling at about 87,000 mph. Juno mission principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, has likened the maneuver to a \"second rocket launch.\" While 97 percent of NASA is currently on furlough because of the ongoing government shutdown, the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory - which manages the Juno mission - remains on duty for now. During Juno's Earth flyby, the spacecraft is expected to test its science instruments and snap photos of Earth and the moon. \"One of Juno's activities during the Earth flyby will be to make a movie of the Earth-moon system that will be the first to show Earth spinning on its axis from a distance,\" Bolton said in a statement. The probe will also flex its scientific muscle in other ways. \"We'll exercise the science instruments, since Juno's instruments will be operating in a magnetospheric environment for the first time,\" said spacecraft engineer Jeff Lewis, Juno operations lead for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"The Earth's magnetic field will allow a number of the instruments to be tested. We're also using the flyby of the moon as an opportunity to gauge how the spacecraft operates. Since Juno is a spinning spacecraft, we need to sense the right time to take data as the moon, or Jupiter, passes through the instruments' fields of view.\" But the star of Wednesday's Earth flyby is the gravity assist maneuver itself, scientists said. \"Juno will be really smoking as it passes Earth at a speed of about 25 miles per second relative to the sun. But it will need every bit of this speed to get to Jupiter for its July 4, 2016 capture into polar orbit about Jupiter,\" said research scientist Bill Kurth of the University of Iowa, who is the lead investigator for two of Juno's instruments. \"The first half of its journey has been simply to set up this gravity assist with Earth.\" The Slooh webcast of the Juno flyby of Earth can be tracked directly from the Slooh Space Camera website and via the Slooh iPad app. ", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/how-watch-nasas-juno-zip-earth-its-mission-jupiter-8c11363338"}, {"title": "NASA Jupiter Probe Still In 'Safe Mode' After Earth Flyby Glitch", "date": "2013-10-12", "content": "A NASA Jupiter probe remains in a protective \"safe mode\" two days after completing a speed-boosting flyby of Earth, but mission officials have expressed confidence that the issue will be solved soon. NASA's Juno spacecraft detected an anomalous condition and went into safe mode Wednesday afternoon (Oct. 9), just 10 minutes after making its closest approach to Earth in a slingshot maneuver designed to build momentum for the long trip to the solar system's largest planet. The probe's handlers are still trying to figure out what exactly happened, but they suspect a minor glitch rather than a big mission-threatening problem. \"We have a couple of candidates,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"None of them suggest a serious problem, and we haven't seen any indication that there is a serious problem.\" The main goal of the flyby was achieved despite the glitch, and Juno is now on the proper trajectory to Jupiter, Bolton added. The Juno spacecraft is in a healthy and stable state, with its tractor-trailer-size solar panels pointed toward the sun. The mission team is in communication with Juno and has seen no sign of any failures in the probe's subsystems or components, said project manager Rick Nybakken of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. So Juno's handlers plan to take their time and do a thorough investigation before attempting to bring all of the spacecraft's systems back online. \"There's nothing that's rushing us to do this, so we might as well be very careful and do our homework, and just, say, turn everything on nice and slow,\" Bolton told SPACE.com. \"We're not missing anything that we need right now, and we're on our way safely to Jupiter.\" The Juno team is already going through the probe's engineering data, as well as the science observations and images captured during the flyby, Nybakken said. All off this information should have been received by Thursday evening (Oct. 10), barring any transmission issues, he added. \"So we're looking at that data, and we're starting to develop a plan to bring the spacecraft back into operational status,\" Nybakken told SPACE.com. \"Developing that plan will probably take us over the weekend.\" The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and is slated to arrive in orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. Once there, the probe will circle the gas giant for a full Earth year, studying Jupiter's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with nine science instruments. Juno is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds (3,267 kilograms) - that it needed a post-liftoff speed boost to get to Jupiter, so mission managers decided to get a \"gravity assist\" from Earth. Wednesday's flyby, which was highlighted by a close approach that brought Juno within just 347 miles (558 kilometers) of Earth at 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT), was designed to ramp the probe up from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph (126,000 to 140,000 km/h). While boosting Juno's speed was the main goal, mission team members also planned to check out Juno's science instruments and take some photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby. The glitch caused some data to be lost, but the team should end up getting the vast majority of it, Bolton said. \"I expect we'll have some cool images and a cool movie and all that to release,\" he said.

Juno went into safe mode on Wednesday (Oct. 9), just 10 minutes after zooming within 347 miles (558 kilometers) of Earth during a flyby designed to boost the spacecraft's speed from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph (126,000 to 140,000 km/h). Juno team members had expressed confidence that the probe would recover fully from the still-mysterious glitch, and their optimism was borne out, as Juno has now resumed full flight operations. Further, the main goal of the flyby was accomplished, putting Juno on the correct trajectory to Jupiter, officials said. The spacecraft is so heavy - about 8,000 pounds, or 3,267 kilograms - that it needed a gravity assist from Earth after its August 2011 launch. Mission team members also checked out Juno's science equipment and took photos of the Earth-moon system during the flyby. Scientists are still analyzing these data and images, most of which were returned to Earth before Juno went into safe mode. When Juno arrives in orbit around Jupiter, it will study the gas giant's atmosphere, gravitational field and magnetic field with its nine science instruments over the course of a full Earth year.

According to Donald Kirchner, University of Iowa research engineer on Juno and one of the coordinators of the all-volunteer \"Say Hi to Juno\" project, all licensed amateur radio operators were invited to participate by visiting a website and following posted instructions. \"The idea was to coordinate the efforts of amateur radio operators all over the world, and send a message in Morse code that could be received by the University of Iowa-designed-and-built instrument on the Juno spacecraft,\" he says. \"We know that over a thousand participated, and probably many more than that.\" The technology used to key in the message was old school. Interestingly, Juno did not return the greeting or even decode the message itself. Rather, after the amateur radio operators' messages were sent, the Juno team evaluated the Waves instrument data containing the messages after the Oct. 9 flyby. The message was visible early in the event when the spacecraft was still over 37,000 kilometers-about 23,000 miles-from the Earth.

Kirchner says that the project originated when public outreach staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., wanted to know if the UI receiver was able to pick up a voice message. Although that isn't possible, Kurth and Kirchner came up with the idea that a slow Morse code message should work. Kirchner is an amateur radio operator, himself, and took the lead in designing the project. His usual ham activities include being an assistant emergency coordinator with the Johnson County Amateur Radio Emergency Service, which works closely with the Johnson County Emergency Management Agency to provide backup and auxiliary communications. To make the transmission to Juno, he enlisted a student organization, the UI Amateur Radio Club, to set up a temporary station on the roof of Van Allen Hall. Operating for a few days up to the flyby, he and other club members contacted hundreds of stations in 40 states and 17 countries to raise awareness of the project. The \"say Hi\" project was made possible by the fact that Juno passed within 350 miles of the Earth's surface on Oct. 9 in a maneuver to gain momentum for its July 2016 encounter with Jupiter. Plans call for Juno to orbit Jupiter 33 times. Among a variety of investigations, Juno will explore Jupiter's northern and southern lights by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. The Waves instrument was built at the UI by a group of about a dozen scientists, engineers, and technicians, led by Kurth and Kirchner.

One of Juno's sensors, a special kind of camera optimized to track faint stars, also had a unique view of the Earth-moon system. The result was an intriguing, low-resolution glimpse of what our world would look like to a visitor from afar. \"If Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise said, 'Take us home, Scotty,' this is what the crew would see,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio. \"In the movie, you ride aboard Juno as it approaches Earth and then soars off into the blackness of space. No previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of Earth and moon.\" The cameras that took the images for the movie are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft's three solar-array arms. They are part of Juno's Magnetic Field Investigation (MAG) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors. These cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array, so as the spacecraft approached, the system's four cameras pointed toward Earth. Earth and the moon came into view when Juno was about 600,000 miles (966,000 kilometers) away -- about three times the Earth-moon separation. During the flyby, timing was everything. Juno was traveling about twice as fast as a typical satellite, and the spacecraft itself was spinning at 2 rpm. To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant. The frames were sent to Earth, where they were processed into video format. \"Everything we humans are and everything we do is represented in that view,\" said the star tracker's designer, John J\u00f8rgensen of the Danish Technical University, near Copenhagen. Also during the flyby, Juno's Waves instrument, which is tasked with measuring radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere, recorded amateur radio signals. This was part of a public outreach effort involving ham radio operators from around the world. They were invited to say \"HI\" to Juno by coordinating radio transmissions that carried the same Morse-coded message.

Juno was traveling about twice as fast as a typical satellite, and the spacecraft itself was spinning at 2 rpm. To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant.

Juno's launch vehicle was capable of giving the spacecraft only enough energy to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the sun's gravity pulled it back toward the inner solar system.

According to Donald Kirchner, University of Iowa research engineer on Juno and one of the coordinators of the all-volunteer \"Say Hi to Juno\" project, all licensed amateur radio operators were invited to participate by visiting a website and following posted instructions. \"The idea was to coordinate the efforts of amateur radio operators all over the world, and send a message in Morse code that could be received by the University of Iowa-designed-and-built instrument on the Juno spacecraft,\" he says. \"We know that over a thousand participated, and probably many more than that.\" The technology used to key in the message was old school. Interestingly, Juno did not return the greeting or even decode the message itself. Rather, after the amateur radio operators' messages were sent, the Juno team evaluated the Waves instrument data containing the messages after the Oct. 9 flyby. The message was visible early in the event when the spacecraft was still over 37,000 kilometers-about 23,000 miles-from the Earth. Kirchner notes that although previous space missions-Galileo on its way to Jupiter and Cassini while headed for Saturn-were able to detect shortwave radio transmissions during their Earth encounters, it was not possible to decode intelligent information using the data from those spacecraft. According to Bill Kurth, UI research scientist and lead investigator for the Waves instrument: \"We believe this was the first intelligent information to be transmitted to a passing interplanetary space instrument, as simple as the message may seem,\" he says. \"This was a way to involve a large number of people-those not usually associated with Juno-in a small portion of the mission. This raises awareness, and we've already heard from some that they'll be motivated to follow the Juno mission through its science phase at Jupiter.\" Kurth is scheduled to participate in a press conference on the scientific information gathered during Juno's Earth fly-by, as well as the success of the \"Say Hi to Juno\" project, at 10:30 a.m. or 12:30 p.m. today, Tuesday, Dec. 10 during the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. Kirchner says that the project originated when public outreach staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., wanted to know if the UI receiver was able to pick up a voice message. Although that isn't possible, Kurth and Kirchner came up with the idea that a slow Morse code message should work. Kirchner is an amateur radio operator, himself, and took the lead in designing the project. His usual ham activities include being an assistant emergency coordinator with the Johnson County Amateur Radio Emergency Service, which works closely with the Johnson County Emergency Management Agency to provide backup and auxiliary communications. To make the transmission to Juno, he enlisted a student organization, the UI Amateur Radio Club, to set up a temporary station on the roof of Van Allen Hall. Operating for a few days up to the flyby, he and other club members contacted hundreds of stations in 40 states and 17 countries to raise awareness of the project. The \"say Hi\" project was made possible by the fact that Juno passed within 350 miles of the Earth's surface on Oct. 9 in a maneuver to gain momentum for its July 2016 encounter with Jupiter. Plans call for Juno to orbit Jupiter 33 times. Among a variety of investigations, Juno will explore Jupiter's northern and southern lights by flying directly through the electrical current systems that generate them. The Waves instrument was built at the UI by a group of about a dozen scientists, engineers, and technicians, led by Kurth and Kirchner. Terry Averkamp, Chris Piker, and William Robinson, also an amateur radio operator, assist in the operation of the Waves instrument and in the data processing. UI researchers are Kurth and colleagues UI professor Don Gurnett and research scientist George Hospodarsky. The Juno project is a collaborative enterprise led by Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, including the UI and many other organizations and individuals. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Bolton.

The probe, the first to have a shot at polar orbiting a giant gas planet, will help unravel multiple mysteries including the structure and chemical composition of Jupiter and its lemony-orange haze of swirling clouds, streaked with bands of red. Zipping along at the record speed of more than 25 kilometres a second, relative to Earth, Juno has travelled more than 2.3 billion kilometres - with more than 400 million kilometres to go before entering orbit in July 2016. The hexagonal spacecraft - at 3625 kilograms, one of the heaviest unmanned probes ever built - is almost as remarkable as the planet it will visit. By rotating on its axis twice every minute, the spin-stabilised craft enjoys excellent pointing stability, with each of its instruments getting a chance to face the planet. It is also the first outer-planetary probe to be powered entirely by solar energy. (Jupiter, on average, is 778 million kilometres from the sun - about five times further away than the Earth - so it gets roughly 25 times less sunlight than we do. Most craft venturing that far generate power from the decay of radioactive elements.) To steer clear of the worst of Jupiter's radiation emissions, which are strong enough to fry inadequately shielded hardware, the spacecraft will use a highly elliptical polar orbit to thread its way gingerly between the planet's cloud tops and the innermost of the two equatorial radiation belts. At its closest approach, Juno will skim as low as 4600 kilometres above the clouds.

Juno is making history by leveraging advanced solar-cell technology and an energy-efficient spacecraft and science gear. The probe's mission and orbit design will also help, allowing Juno to avoid Jupiter's shadow and minimizing the spacecraft's exposure to the giant planet's harsh radiation environment, NASA officials said. The $1.1 billion Juno mission, which launched on Aug. 5, 2011, will continue adding to the distance record for a while yet.

Rosetta caught the comet in August 2014, and in November of that year, the probe dropped a lander called Philae onto the icy object's surface. Rosetta is still orbiting Comet 67P, which made its closest approach to the sun in August 2015 and is now zooming back toward the outer solar system. The comet and Rosetta are currently about 196.4 million miles (316 million km) from the sun, according to the European Space Agency's Rosetta-tracking website. Rosetta will not get a chance to break Juno's record.

Juno broke the record previously held by the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft on 13 January as it flew about 793 million kilometres from the sun, NASA said in a press release announcing the milestone. When it enters orbit around Jupiter on 4 July, the Juno spacecraft will become the first solar-powered mission to reach the gas giant, beginning 20 months of commissioning and science observations aimed at studying the structure of the planet's interior and atmosphere. Juno carries three large solar panels, each one 2.7 metres wide and 8.8 metres long, to generate electricity. Shortly after the mission's launch in 2011, the solar power system could convert sunlight into 14 kilowatts of energy. When Juno reaches Jupiter, which orbits five times farther from the sun than Earth, the spacecraft must operate on 500 watts. Half of Juno's electricity budget goes to its thermal system to keep the spacecraft at a comfortable temperature. The balance goes toward communications, computers, propulsion and operating the probe's seven scientific instruments and color camera. All eight probes that previously explored the realm of the solar system now occupied by Juno relied on nuclear power sources, but the U.S. government's stockpile of space-grade plutonium was diminishing when engineers designed Juno, prompting a decision to build three huge solar panels for the spacecraft. Juno's solar panels are arranged in a triangular shape in space. All together, the panels have an area of about 635 square feet, larger than most studio apartments. Juno's solar panels consist of 18,698 individual cells, each measuring approximately 9.4 centimetres by 5.7 centimetres inches. The rectangular cells are made of silicon and gallium arsenide. A rocket firing will steer the Juno spacecraft into a polar orbit around Jupiter, kicking off about 20 months of science observations comprising more than 30 laps around the huge gas giant. Juno will initially be captured in a long, egg-shaped orbit that takes 53.5 days to complete one trip around Jupiter. A follow-up maneuver in October will reduce the high point of Juno's orbit, moving it closer to the planet to allow the craft to complete one lap every 14 days. That is a change from Juno's original flight plan, which called for the probe to first go into a 107-day orbit, then switch to an 11-day orbit. Scientists say the new plan allows Juno to complete a first look at meeting the mission's science goals, which are centered on Jupiter's interior, atmosphere and magnetic field, in shorter time than previously anticipated. But it means Juno will need 20 months, five months longer than originally planned, to collect the mission's full data set. Besides the challenges imposed by the distance from the sun to Jupiter, engineers had to account for the harsh radiation environment around the giant planet. Engineers conducted extra testing before Juno's launch to ensure the solar cells, computers and wiring in the spacecraft's power and control system can endure Jupiter's doughnut-shaped radiation belts as it passes as close as 3,100 miles over the planet's cloud tops, closer than any mission before. Juno will encounter radiation equivalent to receiving 100 million dental X-rays during its mission at Jupiter. Juno's flight computers, avionics and commanding system are wrapped inside a solid titanium box on top of the spacecraft. Known as the vault, the radiation-shielding container is about the size of a microwave oven and weighs nearly 227 kg fully loaded. But the solar panels could not be put in the vault, so engineers doubled the thickness of the cover glass over each cell to protect them from radiation. Otherwise, Juno's solar cells are off the shelf, meeting the same qualification levels required for other space missions. Engineers expect the solar cells to degrade over time as they are zapped by radiation, but not within Juno's 20-month primary mission. Future robotic missions to Jupiter will also employ solar panels, building on technologies demonstrated by Juno. ESA's first spacecraft to visit the outer solar system, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, set for launch in 2022 will rely on solar power for its mission to study three of the planet's largest moons. JUICE will eventually swing into orbit around Ganymede, becoming the first mission to enter orbit around one of Jupiter's moons. NASA's Europa mission, an uncrewed probe in development to repeatedly fly past Jupiter's most famous moon, will also use solar power generators.

But unlike previous space missions, professional scientists will not be the ones producing the processed views, or even choosing which images to capture. Instead, the public will act as a virtual imaging team, participating in key steps of the process, from identifying features of interest to sharing the finished images online. \"This is really the public's camera. We are hoping students and whole classrooms will get involved and join our team,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. The Juno team has kicked off the first stage of JunoCam activity with the launch of a new Web platform on the mission's website. Now and throughout the mission, amateur astronomers are invited to submit images of Jupiter from their own telescopes. These views will be the basis for online discussions about which of Jupiter's swirls, bands and spots JunoCam should image as it makes repeated, close passes over the planet. The ground-based views will be essential for identifying and tracking changes in the planet's cloud features as Juno approaches. \"In between our close Jupiter flybys, Juno goes far from the planet, and Jupiter will shrink in JunoCam's field of view to a size too small to be useful for choosing which features to capture. So we really are counting on having help from ground-based observers,\" said Candy Hansen, a member of the Juno science team who leads planning for the camera. Juno will get closer to Jupiter than any previous orbiting spacecraft, giving JunoCam the best close-up views yet of the planet's colorful cloud bands. Every 14 days, the spinning, solar-powered spacecraft will dive past the planet in just a couple of hours, gathering huge amounts of science data, plus about a dozen JunoCam images. At closest approach, Juno will snap photos from only 3,100 miles above Jupiter's clouds. NASA's Juno spacecraft passes in front of Jupiter in this artist's depiction. Juno, the second mission in NASA's New Frontiers program, will improve our understanding of the solar system by advancing studies of the origin and evolution of Jupiter. \"JunoCam will capture high-resolution color views of Jupiter's bands, but that's only part of the story,\" said Diane Brown, Juno program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"We'll also be treated to the first-ever views of Jupiter's north and south poles, which have never been imaged before.\" Unlike most spacecraft cameras, JunoCam was specially designed to work on a spinning spacecraft. Typically, spacecraft must point very precisely at their subjects while taking a picture to avoid smearing their images. Since Juno rotates twice per minute, the Juno team designed a camera that images several lines of pixels at a time, at the right speed to cancel out the rotation and avoid smear. Previously, the best images of Jupiter were taken by NASA's two Voyager spacecraft, which flew past the planet in 1979. JunoCam's field of view is much wider than that of Voyager's narrow-angle camera. This means every JunoCam image is a kind of panorama, and its highest-resolution images will show wide swaths of clouds. The camera also benefits from decades of technology advancement, making it lighter, less power-hungry and lower in cost. After JunoCam data arrive on Earth, members of the public will process the images to create color pictures. The Juno team successfully tested this approach when JunoCam acquired its first high-resolution views, showing our home planet during the spacecraft's Earth flyby in October 2013. Since the mission's beginnings, JunoCam was intended almost entirely as a public outreach tool, in contrast to the spacecraft's other instruments that will address Juno's core science questions. Juno scientists will ensure JunoCam returns a few great shots of Jupiter's polar regions, but the overwhelming majority of the camera's image targets will be chosen by the public, with the data being processed by them as well. \"We want to give people an opportunity to participate with NASA, and public involvement is key to JunoCam's success,\" said Bolton. \"This is citizen science at its best.\" ", "url": "https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2015/12/06/nasas-juno-spacecraft-to-take-high-resolution-images-of-jupiter-using-junocam/"}, {"title": "NASA Needs Your Help Snapping and Processing Images of Jupiter", "date": "2015-12-07", "content": "NASA's known for its mad photography skills-its satellites and spacecraft are equipped with some of the best cameras in existence. But when it comes to taking and processing photos of the Juno mission's upcoming Jupiter flyby, it's missing one thing: you. The agency recently announced that it's recruiting members of the public to help direct its photography efforts in space and process the images taken by JunoCam. The high- res camera was designed not only to take stunning, scientifically useful photos of Jupiter, but to get the public involved, too. Since Juno spins along its route, JunoCam was designed to take pictures in strips. It snaps photos through red, green and blue filters in one rotation, near-infrared on the next. Then, computers and technicians back on earth stitch the photos together into a composite image. To see how it works, check out this gallery of images of the moon and Earth gathered as the spacecraft began its spinning trajectory towards Jupiter. But JunoCam can't take pictures if it doesn't know what to pinpoint. NASA is now asking amateur astronomers to visit the camera's website to help decide which areas of Jupiter to photograph by submitting telescopic images of the planet from back on Earth. During a discussion period, members of the community will comment on the suggestions, then vote on the best areas of Jupiter's atmosphere to photograph.

Scientists say the new plan allows Juno to complete a first look at meeting the mission's science goals, which are centered on Jupiter's interior, atmosphere and magnetic field, in shorter time than previously anticipated. But it means Juno will need 20 months, five months longer than originally planned, to collect the mission's full data set. Besides the challenges imposed by the distance from the sun to Jupiter, engineers had to account for the harsh radiation environment around the giant planet. Engineers conducted extra testing before Juno's launch to ensure the solar cells, computers and wiring in the spacecraft's power and control system can endure Jupiter's doughnut-shaped radiation belts as it passes as close as 3,100 miles over the planet's cloud tops, closer than any mission before. Juno will encounter radiation equivalent to receiving 100 million dental X-rays during its mission at Jupiter. Juno's flight computers, avionics and commanding system are wrapped inside a solid titanium box on top of the spacecraft. Known as the vault, the radiation-shielding container is about the size of a microwave oven and weighs nearly 227 kg fully loaded. But the solar panels could not be put in the vault, so engineers doubled the thickness of the cover glass over each cell to protect them from radiation. Otherwise, Juno's solar cells are off the shelf, meeting the same qualification levels required for other space missions. Engineers expect the solar cells to degrade over time as they are zapped by radiation, but not within Juno's 20-month primary mission. Future robotic missions to Jupiter will also employ solar panels, building on technologies demonstrated by Juno. ESA's first spacecraft to visit the outer solar system, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, set for launch in 2022 will rely on solar power for its mission to study three of the planet's largest moons. JUICE will eventually swing into orbit around Ganymede, becoming the first mission to enter orbit around one of Jupiter's moons. NASA's Europa mission, an uncrewed probe in development to repeatedly fly past Jupiter's most famous moon, will also use solar power generators. Managers chose solar power over nuclear power for the mission in 2014.

Soon, Jupiter will come into even better focus when Juno enters into orbit around the planet and starts beaming back images. When the June 21 photo was taken, Juno was about 6.8 million miles from Jupiter. On July 4, Juno is expected to fly just 2,900 miles above the tops of the planet's clouds, just about the same distance as the diameter of the continental United States. Juno, which was launched from Earth in August of 2011, is designed to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere and evolution by studying its auroras and magnetic field. The spacecraft should make 37 close approaches through the course of its nearly two-year mission, giving scientists plenty of data to analyze. This mission won't be easy on Juno. The radiation environment near Jupiter -- due to the unique inner workings of the massive planet -- is so intense that the spacecraft's instruments won't be able to function for very long in that part of space. Mission managers have designed the craft's close approaches of Jupiter to minimize the harmful impacts of that radiation on Juno's hardware, but even so, the mission will only last for about 20 months because of the harsh environment. \"Over the life of the mission, Juno will be exposed to the equivalent of over 100 million dental X-rays,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager, said in a statement(Opens in a new tab). \"But, we are ready.

Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars. With its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. \"I view Jupiter as a missing link,\" says Barry Mauk of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"Jupiter is the link between the nearby space environments we study at planets like Earth, and distant astrophysical systems where magnetic fields hold sway, such as early-stage star forming regions, and hyper-energetic radiation regions like the Crab Nebula. Juno is not only going to help us better understand Jupiter, it's going to help us better understand the universe around us and our place in it.\" Mauk leads the investigation team for the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument, or JEDI, which was built by APL and is part of Juno's payload. JEDI consists of three shoebox-sized detectors, each of which views a three- dimensional, 120-degree-by-12-degree \"slice\" of the sky; the units are positioned to provide a continuous 360-degree sampling view of the space around Juno. These detectors will provide data on particles with energies in the 30 to roughly 1,000 kiloelectron volt range that surround the planet and help create the enormous and powerful auroras surrounding Jupiter's polar regions. JEDI detects electrons and ions such as protons, helium, oxygen, and sulfur that interact with Jupiter's atmosphere in creating the aurora; it also measures energetic neutral atoms emanating from Jupiter's auroral atmosphere. \"A unique aspect of JEDI is its ability to simultaneously measure incoming particles from many directions, allowing JEDI to obtain nearly instantaneous snapshots of the complete particle distributions,\" says Dennis Haggerty, APL's instrument scientist for the JEDI investigation. \"This capability is crucial for revealing the fundamental physics of Jupiter's aurora because of the extremely rapid speed of the Juno spacecraft as it passes over Jupiter's poles.\" Juno will be moving at more than 30 miles a second across auroral structures known to be as narrow as 50 miles wide. Each JEDI instrument combines a time-of-flight chamber with a series of solid- state detectors to determine the direction of motion, the speed, and the energy of energetic particles entering JEDI. These combined measurements also allow JEDI to determine the mass composition of the incoming particles. That new information will help scientists in their quest to learn more about where the particles come from, how they are energized, and what triggers the release of energy from these particles into brilliant auroral displays. \"Jupiter has the most intense and interesting aurora in the entire solar system,\" says Mauk, who has studied particle systems at Earth, other planets, and throughout the solar system on NASA missions including Voyager, Galileo, the Van Allen Probes, Cassini, and Magnetospheric Multiscale. \"Jupiter's aurora has a power density 10 times greater than Earth's and an overall power that is a factor of 100 greater. What we want to know is, how is this system energized?\" Along with JEDI, a second particle instrument called the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, or JADE, will study lower energy particles involved in the same processes. JADE was built by the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, two other instruments play a role in the fields and particles investigation: the Magnetometer Experiment, which will visualize Jupiter's magnetic field in 3-D; and the Waves instrument, which will measure radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The particle populations-electrons and ions-around Jupiter are powered in a different way than those at Earth. The solar wind provides the energy to the particles surrounding our planet, some of which are trapped in twin donut- shaped regions called radiation belts. At Jupiter, rotational forces produce the driving energy for the system-Jupiter rotates at a much higher speed than Earth; a Jupiter day lasts about 10 hours. \"From NASA's Van Allen Probes mission, we learned how high energy particles are accelerated at Earth,\" Mauk says. \"Will it be different at Jupiter? We're going to find out.\" Juno, which launched on Aug. 5, 2011, is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program.

Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles. The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move. \"Juno, welcome to Jupiter,\" said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons. Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission. The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant - a ball of hydrogen and helium - unlike rocky Earth and Mars. With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed. Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter. Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth. Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking. The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles, took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles of Jupiter's clouds - closer than previous missions - to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup. Juno is an armored spacecraft - its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission. Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates - a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons.

We are finally able to see with real video, with real pictures, this movement and we have only been able to imagine it up until today.\" All non-essential equipment was turned off for the approach, but the first post-orbit pictures from the spacecraft's on-board camera should arrive in a few days, NASA said. \"The spacecraft worked perfectly, which is always nice when you're driving a vehicle with 1.7 billion miles on the odometer,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Juno's inaugural lap around the solar system's most massive planet - the fifth from the sun - will last 53 days. Subsequent orbits will be shorter, about two weeks each. The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter's clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the deity of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions. Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life. Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989. That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge toward Jupiter in 2003. Juno's orbital track is closer than Galileo's - this time within 3,100 miles above the cloud tops. With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years. On Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \"into the scariest part of the scariest place... part of Jupiter's radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\" A leading concern has been radiation levels - as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained. Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \"will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"So we did a lot about it,\" she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down.

Juno successfully began to orbit Jupiter on Monday night. At the precisely calculated moment, 8:18 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the craft's main engine ignited to start a maneuver called orbit insertion. Juno, which was approaching the planet at 130,000 mph, slowed down and dropped neatly into the planet's orbit at 8:53 p.m. When the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab received the signal that Juno was in optimal orbit, the room of scientists roared with excitement, clapping and leaning over desks to high-five comrades. Monday's orbit insertion was one of the most crucial moments in the Juno mission. The engine burned precisely 35 minutes, long enough to put Jupiter into a close orbit that will take 53 days to complete. If the burn had been any shorter, but still more than 20 minutes, the minimum needed to reach orbit, the craft would have taken much longer to circle Jupiter and limited what scientists could learn about the planet. But scientists will still have to wait for Juno to complete its first highly elliptical orbit before the craft can begin collecting any data. That's because as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the science instruments capable of taking measurements of the planet were turned off for insertion. The main engine burn would skew any measurements taken, Hubbard said. \"I'm really looking forward to the science,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission, during live coverage Monday streamed online. \"I'm so curious about the discoveries that we can make, learning about our beginnings and what Jupiter can tell us about how the solar system was made.\" Hubbard, who is a co-investigator for the mission, shared Bolton's sentiment. Hubbard, 75, said he was relieved when Juno entered Jupiter's orbit because \"now we can do the science.\" Hubbard helped design a science instrument that will be used in a key experiment. The tool will analyze both Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields in an effort to learn more about the planet's interior and possibly solid core. \"I'm hoping that we'll get a good enough set of gravity data that we can really get a good picture of how active the planet is inside,\" he told the Arizona Republic. \"That's the kind of science experiment that will be fun.\" Juno launched in August 2011 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Since blastoff, the spacecraft has voyaged through 1.7 billion miles of space to arrive at Jupiter. On Monday, Juno flew about 2,800 miles over the planet's clouds. The Galileo mission, Juno's predecessor, came within about only 260,000 miles of Jupiter. About halfway through the burn, Hubbard also worried about Juno's passage through Jupiter's equatorial plane and ring system. \" has a lot of particles that orbit it in its equatorial plane,\" he said, \"so when you go through that, that's where you would be most likely to hit a ring particle or even a fairly large dust particle.\" The maneuver was made even more tricky because during insertion, Juno had to turn away from its source of power - the sun. Valdez: Juno? Who cares about space science? Juno is equipped with three massive winglike solar arrays, making the craft larger than an NBA basketball court. It's also the first mission to an outer planet that's primarily solar-powered. However, Juno ran off battery power during the main engine burn. The craft's orientation was adjusted away from the sun so that the burn would adequately slow it down. Juno also began rotating faster as it prepared for insertion, increasing from two revolutions per minute to five. \"It's like a bicycle wheel,\" said Stuart Stephens of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, which is managing Juno. \"The faster you spin it, the more stable it is.\" As soon as the insertion was complete, the spacecraft reduced its revolutions to two per minute again and turned back to face the sun \"so the juices start flowing through Juno's veins again,\" Bolton said. The spacecraft will continue to circle Jupiter 37 times over 20 months, collecting data and sending it back to scientists at JPL. But before Juno can begin sending data, the spacecraft has to survive the most dangerous place in space. \"Jupiter has the scariest radiation environment of any planet in the solar system,\" said Heidi Becker, the radiation-monitoring-investigation lead for the mission, during an earlier press conference. \"It's the harshest, it's the most intense, and it hasn't been fully explored yet.\" Most of the instruments aboard Juno are sealed in a 400-pound titanium vault to protect them from the planet's radiation. The electronics are sensitive to the powerful radiation, which is 60 million times stronger than what is experienced on Earth. Along with being the most hazardous planet, Jupiter is also the largest and oldest in the solar system. Jupiter's age, scientists say, is what makes it such an interesting planet to study. Because it was the first planet in our system to form, its chemical makeup might give researchers insight into how solar systems are born. One ingredient in the solar system \"recipe\" is water. A science instrument aboard Juno, called a microwave radiometer, will analyze Jupiter for the compound. Scientists want to know both how much water Jupiter has and what state - vapor or ice - it is in. The amount of water found on Jupiter is \"the single most important number that Juno is going to bring back,\" said Steve Levin, a project scientist for the Juno mission. \"It's crucial to understanding how the solar system formed,\" he said earlier. Data isn't the only thing Juno will be sending back to Earth. A specialized camera, called JunoCam, is mounted atop the spacecraft and expected to take amazing up-close photos of Jupiter. What pictures the camera takes, however, aren't completely up to NASA's scientists. Bolton called JunoCam an \"outreach camera\" because space enthusiasts will be able to go online and vote for where it should point. \"It's great to see citizen science,\" Bolton said Monday. \"The public is joining our team.\" Ordinary citizens aren't the only unusual addition to the mission. Some hitchhikers also caught a ride to Jupiter. Three Lego figurines, crafted out of space-grade aluminium, were jointly designed by the toy company and NASA as part of an educational-outreach program and mounted inside the spacecraft's vault. \"They're getting the ride of their life, and they've got the best view of any of us,\" Bolton joked. One depicts Galileo, the Italian astronomer who first observed the orbits of Jupiter's moons. The second is Jupiter, the Roman god the planet is named for, built holding a lightning bolt. The last figure is Juno, who is Jupiter's mythological wife. The goddess is the mission's namesake because of her ability to see through the clouds her husband often used to obscure his actions. NASA, too, hopes to peer through Jupiter's clouds and uncover the secrets of the planet's interior.

Bolton works at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. At 8:53 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time last night, scientists received a signal from Juno confirming the orbit insertion. \"Tonight, through tones, Juno sang to us, and it was a song of perfection,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from JPL. \"After a 1.7-billion-mile 2.7-billion-kilometer journey, we hit our burn targets within 1 second on a target that was just tens of kilometers large.\" A 20-Month Long Investigation. Juno's science instruments, which scientists had shut down several days before the spacecraft entered into orbit around Jupiter, will go back on again in a couple of days, according to Bolton. Then Juno will spend the next 20 months studying Jupiter's core, mapping its magnetic field, and measuring the amount of water and ammonia in the Jovian atmosphere. Juno will circle Jupiter in elliptical polar orbits to avoid an intense radiation region around Jupiter's equator and to limit damage to the craft's titanium-shielded instruments. Steven Levin, Juno project scientist from JPL, said he looks forward to 27 August, 53 days from yesterday, when, with all of Juno's instruments turned on, \"we'll get our first really good look at Jupiter from close up and learn how Jupiter is going to surprise us.\" Levin said he hopes the mission also can help answer bigger questions about the origins of the giant planet and the solar system. During its final approach to Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft captured the time- lapse movie below of the largest of Jupiter's moons orbiting the planet, with their motions sped up from 17 days to about 3 minutes. From innermost to outermost, the moons seen are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The movie begins with images taken on 12 June when Juno was 16 million kilometers from Jupiter and ends on 29 June, 4.8 million kilometers from Jupiter.

Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, had admitted to being \"nervous\" and \"scared\" about the fate of the $1.1 billion spacecraft, which was traveling at a speed of more than 150,000 miles per hour toward what he called \"the king of the solar system.\" Juno slowed down in order to be captured by Jupiter's gravity and pulled into its orbit 3,000 miles above the clouds. Juno was precisely positioned, ignited its main engine at exactly the right moment and kept it burning for 35 minutes to lose enough speed. Throughout its 37 orbits, over 20 months, Juno's titanium cover must endure massive amounts of radiation - the equivalent of 100 million dental x-rays. Juno's aim is to map Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, and determine whether the planet has a dense core beneath its clouds. For its grand finale - its final orbit - Juno will dive into Jupiter's atmosphere, where it will be crushed and vaporized. Among the questions scientists Juno will help answer are: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Bolton said. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot, which appears to be a massive, centuries-old storm which is larger than the earth. Juno is the first spacecraft to travel so far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. Three massive solar wings stick out from Juno like blades from a windmill. They house 18,698 solar cells, which generate 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. Jupiter's sheer size gives it immense gravity, which it exerts by packing two- and-a-half times the mass of all the other planets in our solar system combined. Its mass and gravitational force is believed to have helped shield Earth from bombardment of comets and asteroids - an astronomical lightning rod, so to speak.

The Juno mission's spacecraft knocked one out of the park, all the way to Jupiter. The spacecraft, which has been traveling since August 2011, reached Jupiter's orbit at around 9 p.m. on Independence Day. Space nerds everywhere cheered in unison. Juno made a 1.8 billion-mile trek to the gas giant and it took some serious brains and guts to make it happen. Engineers had to slow the craft down 1,200 mph before it could be sucked into Jupiter's orbit. Nailed it. Now Juno is on its way to studying the planet, but it will take a few more risks in the process. It has to get below Jupiter's intense radiation belts next. \"Juno's close approaches will expose it to enough radiation to fry most modern electronics, so the craft will dip in just once every two weeks for a few hours to minimize exposure. Juno is also outfitted with a radiation-shielded titanium vault that houses most of its sensitive equipment,\" USA TODAY'S Michael Kofsky writes. The end goal? To figure out how the solar system was formed. That's some deep existential stuff right there. Godspeed, Juno, enjoy those drops of Jupiter in your hair. Well, it just isn't a successful Fourth of July unless somebody blows off a body part, right? Fingers, hands, arms, butt cheeks. ... all common victims of home fireworks. Certainly Brevard couldn't let us down this year, right? Right. There were two firework-involved injuries in Brevard, one in West Melbourne and one in Titusville. The Titusville incident involved a 13-year-old boy whose hand took a beating from a firework explosive. Good news, though. He did not lose any limbs. Unfortunately, the West Melbourne incident didn't have such a happy ending. A 50-year-old man lost a portion of his hand. Yikes. I know I'm making fun of these two, but in all seriousness, I wish them both a speedy recovery. Also, let it be a reminder that fireworks are SUPER dangerous. This is why we can't have nice things, Brevard. Celebrations took place across the county and if there was one true common denominator between them all it was this - trash. Seriously, though, so much trash. We're talking wrappers, beer bottles, dirty diapers. ... Luckily, we have this great organization called Keep Brevard Beautiful that comes behind us and picks up our garbage. KBB sent out 19 volunteers after the festivities who gathered trash off the beaches and from area parks. Also, a shout out to the city personnel who picked up trash in their respective areas. It's a dirty job. Hats off to you. Yesterday, a 4-year-old started a fire in his room with a cigarette lighter, thus burning up the home and displacing the family. Everyone was able to make it out of the home safely, and the pet cat was even saved from harm. The fire happened at a duplex on Third Avenue in Titusville. Firefighters were quick to get there and contain the fire. Yay, firefighters! However ... HOW THE HECK DID A 4-YEAR-OLD GET A CIGARETTE LIGHTER?! I digress. The Red Cross is helping the family find a place to stay and the child may \"be recommended to a special program for juveniles involved with setting fires, officials reported,\" reporter J.D. Gallop writes. Will we commit? There's a pretty big plan on the table to fix up some of Brevard's beaches. The county is considering a 50-year, $551 million \"nourishment\" project to revamp beaches in Satellite Beach and Indian Harbour Beach. The area includes a 7.8-mile stretch from Pineda Causeway south to Flug Avenue. How would we pay for it? It involves dipping into the 5-percent tourism tax on hotel rooms. Other money will come from the federal government and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, The county would work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the project and officials say the economic benefits are three times the worth of the initial price. Reporter Dave \"The Berm\" Berman writes: \"... The Midreach Project will help preserve the beach areas for recreation and tourism; will help protect nearby homes, businesses, roads and other infrastructure from potential storm damage; and will help preserve sea turtle nesting areas.\" The project includes an artificial reef, what would be constructed on land in early 2017, then placed offshore in the summer of 2017. Brevard County Commissioners will discuss the issue July 12. I, too, have a \"nourishment\" project underway. It includes free dinner for me. Who's buying?

Soon, Jupiter will come into even better focus when Juno enters into orbit around the planet and starts beaming back images. When the June 21 photo was taken, Juno was about 6.8 million miles from Jupiter. On July 4, Juno is expected to fly just 2,900 miles above the tops of the planet's clouds, just about the same distance as the diameter of the continental United States.

The spacecraft should make 37 close approaches through the course of its nearly two-year mission, giving scientists plenty of data to analyze. This mission won't be easy on Juno. The radiation environment near Jupiter -- due to the unique inner workings of the massive planet -- is so intense that the spacecraft's instruments won't be able to function for very long in that part of space. Mission managers have designed the craft's close approaches of Jupiter to minimize the harmful impacts of that radiation on Juno's hardware, but even so, the mission will only last for about 20 months because of the harsh environment. \"Over the life of the mission, Juno will be exposed to the equivalent of over 100 million dental X-rays,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager, said in a statement(Opens in a new tab). \"But, we are ready.

Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars. With its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. \"I view Jupiter as a missing link,\" says Barry Mauk of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"Jupiter is the link between the nearby space environments we study at planets like Earth, and distant astrophysical systems where magnetic fields hold sway, such as early-stage star forming regions, and hyper-energetic radiation regions like the Crab Nebula. Juno is not only going to help us better understand Jupiter, it's going to help us better understand the universe around us and our place in it.\" Mauk leads the investigation team for the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument, or JEDI, which was built by APL and is part of Juno's payload. JEDI consists of three shoebox-sized detectors, each of which views a three- dimensional, 120-degree-by-12-degree \"slice\" of the sky; the units are positioned to provide a continuous 360-degree sampling view of the space around Juno. These detectors will provide data on particles with energies in the 30 to roughly 1,000 kiloelectron volt range that surround the planet and help create the enormous and powerful auroras surrounding Jupiter's polar regions. JEDI detects electrons and ions such as protons, helium, oxygen, and sulfur that interact with Jupiter's atmosphere in creating the aurora; it also measures energetic neutral atoms emanating from Jupiter's auroral atmosphere. \"A unique aspect of JEDI is its ability to simultaneously measure incoming particles from many directions, allowing JEDI to obtain nearly instantaneous snapshots of the complete particle distributions,\" says Dennis Haggerty, APL's instrument scientist for the JEDI investigation. \"This capability is crucial for revealing the fundamental physics of Jupiter's aurora because of the extremely rapid speed of the Juno spacecraft as it passes over Jupiter's poles.\" Juno will be moving at more than 30 miles a second across auroral structures known to be as narrow as 50 miles wide. Each JEDI instrument combines a time-of-flight chamber with a series of solid- state detectors to determine the direction of motion, the speed, and the energy of energetic particles entering JEDI. These combined measurements also allow JEDI to determine the mass composition of the incoming particles. That new information will help scientists in their quest to learn more about where the particles come from, how they are energized, and what triggers the release of energy from these particles into brilliant auroral displays. \"Jupiter has the most intense and interesting aurora in the entire solar system,\" says Mauk, who has studied particle systems at Earth, other planets, and throughout the solar system on NASA missions including Voyager, Galileo, the Van Allen Probes, Cassini, and Magnetospheric Multiscale. \"Jupiter's aurora has a power density 10 times greater than Earth's and an overall power that is a factor of 100 greater. What we want to know is, how is this system energized?\" Along with JEDI, a second particle instrument called the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, or JADE, will study lower energy particles involved in the same processes. JADE was built by the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, two other instruments play a role in the fields and particles investigation: the Magnetometer Experiment, which will visualize Jupiter's magnetic field in 3-D; and the Waves instrument, which will measure radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The particle populations-electrons and ions-around Jupiter are powered in a different way than those at Earth. The solar wind provides the energy to the particles surrounding our planet, some of which are trapped in twin donut- shaped regions called radiation belts. At Jupiter, rotational forces produce the driving energy for the system-Jupiter rotates at a much higher speed than Earth; a Jupiter day lasts about 10 hours. \"From NASA's Van Allen Probes mission, we learned how high energy particles are accelerated at Earth,\" Mauk says. \"Will it be different at Jupiter? We're going to find out.\" Juno, which launched on Aug. 5, 2011, is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program. The first, the _New Horizons_ mission to Pluto, flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015 after a nine-and-a-half-year flight. The New Frontiers Program is managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of Southwest Research Institute.

Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles. The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move. \"Juno, welcome to Jupiter,\" said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons. Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission. The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant - a ball of hydrogen and helium - unlike rocky Earth and Mars. With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed. Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter. Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth. Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking. The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles, took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles of Jupiter's clouds - closer than previous missions - to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup. Juno is an armored spacecraft - its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission. Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates - a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, erupted in cheers as the solar observatory entered its aimed-for orbit around the biggest planet in our cosmic neighborhood at 11:53 p.m.. \"We are there. We are in orbit. We conquered Jupiter,\" said Scott Bolton, NASA's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"It is almost like a dream coming true.\" Juno launched five years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and has traveled 1.7 billion miles since then. Its arrival marks the start of a 20-month mission during which scientists hope to find out more about how much water Jupiter holds and the makeup of its core to figure out how the gas giant - and other planets including Earth - formed billions of years ago. \"This amazing universe that we see, how does that work and how did it begin?\" asked NASA project scientist Steve Levin. \"That is one of the amazing things about working for NASA and working on big projects. You get to answer big questions.\" The spacecraft is equipped with nine science instruments, including a camera, which prior to orbit captured a video of Jupiter and its moons gliding around it at different speeds. \"In all of history we've never really been able to see the motion of any heavenly body against another,\" said Bolton, after showing the video during a post-orbit press conference for the first time. \"This is the king of our solar system and its disciples going around it,\" he said. \"To me, it is very significant. We are finally able to see with real video, with real pictures, this movement and we have only been able to imagine it up until today.\" All non-essential equipment was turned off for the approach, but the first post-orbit pictures from the spacecraft's on-board camera should arrive in a few days, NASA said. \"The spacecraft worked perfectly, which is always nice when you're driving a vehicle with 1.7 billion miles on the odometer,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Juno's inaugural lap around the solar system's most massive planet - the fifth from the sun - will last 53 days. Subsequent orbits will be shorter, about two weeks each. The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter's clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the deity of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions. Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life. Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989. That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge toward Jupiter in 2003. Juno's orbital track is closer than Galileo's - this time within 3,100 miles above the cloud tops. With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years. On Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \"into the scariest part of the scariest place... part of Jupiter's radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\" A leading concern has been radiation levels - as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained. Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \"will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"So we did a lot about it,\" she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down.

Juno successfully began to orbit Jupiter on Monday night. At the precisely calculated moment, 8:18 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the craft's main engine ignited to start a maneuver called orbit insertion. Juno, which was approaching the planet at 130,000 mph, slowed down and dropped neatly into the planet's orbit at 8:53 p.m. When the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab received the signal that Juno was in optimal orbit, the room of scientists roared with excitement, clapping and leaning over desks to high-five comrades. Monday's orbit insertion was one of the most crucial moments in the Juno mission. The engine burned precisely 35 minutes, long enough to put Jupiter into a close orbit that will take 53 days to complete. If the burn had been any shorter, but still more than 20 minutes, the minimum needed to reach orbit, the craft would have taken much longer to circle Jupiter and limited what scientists could learn about the planet. But scientists will still have to wait for Juno to complete its first highly elliptical orbit before the craft can begin collecting any data. That's because as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the science instruments capable of taking measurements of the planet were turned off for insertion. The main engine burn would skew any measurements taken, Hubbard said. \"I'm really looking forward to the science,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission, during live coverage Monday streamed online. \"I'm so curious about the discoveries that we can make, learning about our beginnings and what Jupiter can tell us about how the solar system was made.\" Hubbard, who is a co-investigator for the mission, shared Bolton's sentiment. Hubbard, 75, said he was relieved when Juno entered Jupiter's orbit because \"now we can do the science.\" Hubbard helped design a science instrument that will be used in a key experiment. The tool will analyze both Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields in an effort to learn more about the planet's interior and possibly solid core. \"I'm hoping that we'll get a good enough set of gravity data that we can really get a good picture of how active the planet is inside,\" he told the Arizona Republic. \"That's the kind of science experiment that will be fun.\" Juno launched in August 2011 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Since blastoff, the spacecraft has voyaged through 1.7 billion miles of space to arrive at Jupiter. On Monday, Juno flew about 2,800 miles over the planet's clouds. The Galileo mission, Juno's predecessor, came within about only 260,000 miles of Jupiter. About halfway through the burn, Hubbard also worried about Juno's passage through Jupiter's equatorial plane and ring system. \" has a lot of particles that orbit it in its equatorial plane,\" he said, \"so when you go through that, that's where you would be most likely to hit a ring particle or even a fairly large dust particle.\" The maneuver was made even more tricky because during insertion, Juno had to turn away from its source of power - the sun. Valdez: Juno? Who cares about space science? Juno is equipped with three massive winglike solar arrays, making the craft larger than an NBA basketball court. It's also the first mission to an outer planet that's primarily solar-powered. However, Juno ran off battery power during the main engine burn. The craft's orientation was adjusted away from the sun so that the burn would adequately slow it down. Juno also began rotating faster as it prepared for insertion, increasing from two revolutions per minute to five. \"It's like a bicycle wheel,\" said Stuart Stephens of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, which is managing Juno. \"The faster you spin it, the more stable it is.\" As soon as the insertion was complete, the spacecraft reduced its revolutions to two per minute again and turned back to face the sun \"so the juices start flowing through Juno's veins again,\" Bolton said. The spacecraft will continue to circle Jupiter 37 times over 20 months, collecting data and sending it back to scientists at JPL. But before Juno can begin sending data, the spacecraft has to survive the most dangerous place in space. \"Jupiter has the scariest radiation environment of any planet in the solar system,\" said Heidi Becker, the radiation-monitoring-investigation lead for the mission, during an earlier press conference. \"It's the harshest, it's the most intense, and it hasn't been fully explored yet.\" Most of the instruments aboard Juno are sealed in a 400-pound titanium vault to protect them from the planet's radiation. The electronics are sensitive to the powerful radiation, which is 60 million times stronger than what is experienced on Earth. Along with being the most hazardous planet, Jupiter is also the largest and oldest in the solar system. Jupiter's age, scientists say, is what makes it such an interesting planet to study. Because it was the first planet in our system to form, its chemical makeup might give researchers insight into how solar systems are born. One ingredient in the solar system \"recipe\" is water. A science instrument aboard Juno, called a microwave radiometer, will analyze Jupiter for the compound. Scientists want to know both how much water Jupiter has and what state - vapor or ice - it is in. The amount of water found on Jupiter is \"the single most important number that Juno is going to bring back,\" said Steve Levin, a project scientist for the Juno mission. \"It's crucial to understanding how the solar system formed,\" he said earlier. Data isn't the only thing Juno will be sending back to Earth. A specialized camera, called JunoCam, is mounted atop the spacecraft and expected to take amazing up-close photos of Jupiter. What pictures the camera takes, however, aren't completely up to NASA's scientists. Bolton called JunoCam an \"outreach camera\" because space enthusiasts will be able to go online and vote for where it should point. \"It's great to see citizen science,\" Bolton said Monday. \"The public is joining our team.\" Ordinary citizens aren't the only unusual addition to the mission. Some hitchhikers also caught a ride to Jupiter. Three Lego figurines, crafted out of space-grade aluminium, were jointly designed by the toy company and NASA as part of an educational-outreach program and mounted inside the spacecraft's vault. \"They're getting the ride of their life, and they've got the best view of any of us,\" Bolton joked. One depicts Galileo, the Italian astronomer who first observed the orbits of Jupiter's moons. The second is Jupiter, the Roman god the planet is named for, built holding a lightning bolt. The last figure is Juno, who is Jupiter's mythological wife. The goddess is the mission's namesake because of her ability to see through the clouds her husband often used to obscure his actions. NASA, too, hopes to peer through Jupiter's clouds and uncover the secrets of the planet's interior.

Juno's science instruments, which scientists had shut down several days before the spacecraft entered into orbit around Jupiter, will go back on again in a couple of days, according to Bolton. Then Juno will spend the next 20 months studying Jupiter's core, mapping its magnetic field, and measuring the amount of water and ammonia in the Jovian atmosphere. Juno will circle Jupiter in elliptical polar orbits to avoid an intense radiation region around Jupiter's equator and to limit damage to the craft's titanium-shielded instruments. Steven Levin, Juno project scientist from JPL, said he looks forward to 27 August, 53 days from yesterday, when, with all of Juno's instruments turned on, \"we'll get our first really good look at Jupiter from close up and learn how Jupiter is going to surprise us.\" Levin said he hopes the mission also can help answer bigger questions about the origins of the giant planet and the solar system. During its final approach to Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft captured the time- lapse movie below of the largest of Jupiter's moons orbiting the planet, with their motions sped up from 17 days to about 3 minutes. From innermost to outermost, the moons seen are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, had admitted to being \"nervous\" and \"scared\" about the fate of the $1.1 billion spacecraft, which was traveling at a speed of more than 150,000 miles per hour toward what he called \"the king of the solar system.\" Juno slowed down in order to be captured by Jupiter's gravity and pulled into its orbit 3,000 miles above the clouds. Juno was precisely positioned, ignited its main engine at exactly the right moment and kept it burning for 35 minutes to lose enough speed. Throughout its 37 orbits, over 20 months, Juno's titanium cover must endure massive amounts of radiation - the equivalent of 100 million dental x-rays. Juno's aim is to map Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, and determine whether the planet has a dense core beneath its clouds. For its grand finale - its final orbit - Juno will dive into Jupiter's atmosphere, where it will be crushed and vaporized.

Jupiter's sheer size gives it immense gravity, which it exerts by packing two- and-a-half times the mass of all the other planets in our solar system combined.

The spacecraft, which has been traveling since August 2011, reached Jupiter's orbit at around 9 p.m. on Independence Day. Space nerds everywhere cheered in unison. Juno made a 1.8 billion-mile trek to the gas giant and it took some serious brains and guts to make it happen. Engineers had to slow the craft down 1,200 mph before it could be sucked into Jupiter's orbit. Nailed it. Now Juno is on its way to studying the planet, but it will take a few more risks in the process. It has to get below Jupiter's intense radiation belts next. \"Juno's close approaches will expose it to enough radiation to fry most modern electronics, so the craft will dip in just once every two weeks for a few hours to minimize exposure.

The Titusville incident involved a 13-year-old boy whose hand took a beating from a firework explosive. Good news, though. He did not lose any limbs. Unfortunately, the West Melbourne incident didn't have such a happy ending. A 50-year-old man lost a portion of his hand. Yikes. I know I'm making fun of these two, but in all seriousness, I wish them both a speedy recovery. Also, let it be a reminder that fireworks are SUPER dangerous. This is why we can't have nice things, Brevard. Celebrations took place across the county and if there was one true common denominator between them all it was this - trash. Seriously, though, so much trash. We're talking wrappers, beer bottles, dirty diapers. ... Luckily, we have this great organization called Keep Brevard Beautiful that comes behind us and picks up our garbage. KBB sent out 19 volunteers after the festivities who gathered trash off the beaches and from area parks. Also, a shout out to the city personnel who picked up trash in their respective areas. It's a dirty job. Hats off to you. Yesterday, a 4-year-old started a fire in his room with a cigarette lighter, thus burning up the home and displacing the family.

The Midreach Project will help preserve the beach areas for recreation and tourism; will help protect nearby homes, businesses, roads and other infrastructure from potential storm damage; and will help preserve sea turtle nesting areas.\" The project includes an artificial reef, what would be constructed on land in early 2017, then placed offshore in the summer of 2017.

They ensure that the images will include high-resolution views of Jupiter's atmosphere and glimpses of the planet's north and south poles. \"We are in an orbit nobody has ever been in before, and these images give us a whole new perspective on this gas-giant world,\" said Bolton. We can also look forward to 35 more orbital flybys over the coming months, which will contain just as much data to analyze before Juno's mission will end in February 2018.

On Friday, Juno crossed a gravitational boundary between Jupiter and the sun, and the gas giant began pulling the spacecraft in ahead of a planned July 4 arrival, NASA officials said. \"As of tomorrow May 28, and for the rest of the mission, we project Jupiter's gravity will dominate as the trajectory-perturbing effects by other celestial bodies are reduced to insignificant roles,\" Juno project manager Rick Nybakken, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. Juno launched in August 2011. Since then, three gravitational forces have markedly influenced the spacecraft's trek - those of the sun, the Earth and Jupiter. At the beginning stages of Juno's trip, Earth was most influential; more recently, the sun has had the biggest impact on the spacecraft's trajectory, NASA officials said. On July 4, the basketball-court-size Juno will fire its main engine for 35 minutes, changing the probe's velocity and allowing it to slide into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter. Once Juno is in orbit, the spacecraft will fly around Jupiter at least 37 times, coming within just 3,100 miles of the planet's cloud tops during its closest approaches. Juno will study the gas giant's auroras and gather a variety of data that should shed light on Jupiter's formation, structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere, NASA officials have said. Science operations at Jupiter are scheduled to last for at least one year. Juno will be the second probe ever to orbit Jupiter, after NASA's Galileo spacecraft, which studied the gas giant up close from 1995 through 2003. Unlike the nuclear-powered Galileo, Juno uses solar energy and is equipped with the largest solar arrays ever flown on an interplanetary spacecraft.

The Jupiter-bound satellite is expected to enter orbit around the huge planet on July 4, but it's already beamed back an image of the giant planet and some of its largest moons. The new photo, taken on June 21, shows hints of Jupiter's bands of clouds along with the moons Ganymede, Io, Europa and Callisto clustered to the left of the large world. Soon, Jupiter will come into even better focus when Juno enters into orbit around the planet and starts beaming back images. When the June 21 photo was taken, Juno was about 6.8 million miles from Jupiter. On July 4, Juno is expected to fly just 2,900 miles above the tops of the planet's clouds, just about the same distance as the diameter of the continental United States. Juno, which was launched from Earth in August of 2011, is designed to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere and evolution by studying its auroras and magnetic field. The spacecraft should make 37 close approaches through the course of its nearly two-year mission, giving scientists plenty of data to analyze. This mission won't be easy on Juno. The radiation environment near Jupiter -- due to the unique inner workings of the massive planet -- is so intense that the spacecraft's instruments won't be able to function for very long in that part of space. Mission managers have designed the craft's close approaches of Jupiter to minimize the harmful impacts of that radiation on Juno's hardware, but even so, the mission will only last for about 20 months because of the harsh environment. \"Over the life of the mission, Juno will be exposed to the equivalent of over 100 million dental X-rays,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager, said in a statement(Opens in a new tab). \"But, we are ready. We designed an orbit around Jupiter that minimizes exposure to Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. This orbit allows us to survive long enough to obtain the tantalizing science data that we have traveled so far to get,\" Nybakken said. The source of the radiation that will doom Juno is thought to lie beneath the planet's clouds, in a layer of hydrogen that is under \"such incredible pressure it acts as an electrical conductor,\" NASA states on its website(Opens in a new tab). Earth-based tools are aiding Juno in its research mission. For example, new photos taken by a telescope in Chile show the planet shining in infrared light. The images are part of a campaign aimed at mapping Jupiter more fully before Juno arrives next week. \"These maps will help set the scene for what Juno will witness in the coming months,\" said Leigh Fletcher, the team leader for these observations, in a statement(Opens in a new tab).

Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars. With its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. \"I view Jupiter as a missing link,\" says Barry Mauk of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"Jupiter is the link between the nearby space environments we study at planets like Earth, and distant astrophysical systems where magnetic fields hold sway, such as early-stage star forming regions, and hyper-energetic radiation regions like the Crab Nebula. Juno is not only going to help us better understand Jupiter, it's going to help us better understand the universe around us and our place in it.\" Mauk leads the investigation team for the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument, or JEDI, which was built by APL and is part of Juno's payload. JEDI consists of three shoebox-sized detectors, each of which views a three- dimensional, 120-degree-by-12-degree \"slice\" of the sky; the units are positioned to provide a continuous 360-degree sampling view of the space around Juno. These detectors will provide data on particles with energies in the 30 to roughly 1,000 kiloelectron volt range that surround the planet and help create the enormous and powerful auroras surrounding Jupiter's polar regions. JEDI detects electrons and ions such as protons, helium, oxygen, and sulfur that interact with Jupiter's atmosphere in creating the aurora; it also measures energetic neutral atoms emanating from Jupiter's auroral atmosphere. \"A unique aspect of JEDI is its ability to simultaneously measure incoming particles from many directions, allowing JEDI to obtain nearly instantaneous snapshots of the complete particle distributions,\" says Dennis Haggerty, APL's instrument scientist for the JEDI investigation. \"This capability is crucial for revealing the fundamental physics of Jupiter's aurora because of the extremely rapid speed of the Juno spacecraft as it passes over Jupiter's poles.\" Juno will be moving at more than 30 miles a second across auroral structures known to be as narrow as 50 miles wide. Each JEDI instrument combines a time-of-flight chamber with a series of solid- state detectors to determine the direction of motion, the speed, and the energy of energetic particles entering JEDI. These combined measurements also allow JEDI to determine the mass composition of the incoming particles. That new information will help scientists in their quest to learn more about where the particles come from, how they are energized, and what triggers the release of energy from these particles into brilliant auroral displays. \"Jupiter has the most intense and interesting aurora in the entire solar system,\" says Mauk, who has studied particle systems at Earth, other planets, and throughout the solar system on NASA missions including Voyager, Galileo, the Van Allen Probes, Cassini, and Magnetospheric Multiscale. \"Jupiter's aurora has a power density 10 times greater than Earth's and an overall power that is a factor of 100 greater. What we want to know is, how is this system energized?\" Along with JEDI, a second particle instrument called the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, or JADE, will study lower energy particles involved in the same processes. JADE was built by the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, two other instruments play a role in the fields and particles investigation: the Magnetometer Experiment, which will visualize Jupiter's magnetic field in 3-D; and the Waves instrument, which will measure radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The particle populations-electrons and ions-around Jupiter are powered in a different way than those at Earth. The solar wind provides the energy to the particles surrounding our planet, some of which are trapped in twin donut- shaped regions called radiation belts. At Jupiter, rotational forces produce the driving energy for the system-Jupiter rotates at a much higher speed than Earth; a Jupiter day lasts about 10 hours. \"From NASA's Van Allen Probes mission, we learned how high energy particles are accelerated at Earth,\" Mauk says. \"Will it be different at Jupiter? We're going to find out.\" Juno, which launched on Aug. 5, 2011, is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program. The first, the _New Horizons_ mission to Pluto, flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015 after a nine-and-a-half-year flight. The New Frontiers Program is managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of Southwest Research Institute.

Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles. The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move. \"Juno, welcome to Jupiter,\" said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons. Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission. The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant - a ball of hydrogen and helium - unlike rocky Earth and Mars. With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed. Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter. Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth. Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking. The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles, took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles of Jupiter's clouds - closer than previous missions - to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup. Juno is an armored spacecraft - its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission. Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates - a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, erupted in cheers as the solar observatory entered its aimed-for orbit around the biggest planet in our cosmic neighborhood at 11:53 p.m.. \"We are there. We are in orbit. We conquered Jupiter,\" said Scott Bolton, NASA's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"It is almost like a dream coming true.\" Juno launched five years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and has traveled 1.7 billion miles since then. Its arrival marks the start of a 20-month mission during which scientists hope to find out more about how much water Jupiter holds and the makeup of its core to figure out how the gas giant - and other planets including Earth - formed billions of years ago. \"This amazing universe that we see, how does that work and how did it begin?\" asked NASA project scientist Steve Levin. \"That is one of the amazing things about working for NASA and working on big projects. You get to answer big questions.\" The spacecraft is equipped with nine science instruments, including a camera, which prior to orbit captured a video of Jupiter and its moons gliding around it at different speeds. \"In all of history we've never really been able to see the motion of any heavenly body against another,\" said Bolton, after showing the video during a post-orbit press conference for the first time. \"This is the king of our solar system and its disciples going around it,\" he said. \"To me, it is very significant. We are finally able to see with real video, with real pictures, this movement and we have only been able to imagine it up until today.\" All non-essential equipment was turned off for the approach, but the first post-orbit pictures from the spacecraft's on-board camera should arrive in a few days, NASA said. \"The spacecraft worked perfectly, which is always nice when you're driving a vehicle with 1.7 billion miles on the odometer,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Juno's inaugural lap around the solar system's most massive planet - the fifth from the sun - will last 53 days. Subsequent orbits will be shorter, about two weeks each. The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter's clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the deity of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions. Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life. Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989. That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge toward Jupiter in 2003. Juno's orbital track is closer than Galileo's - this time within 3,100 miles above the cloud tops. With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years. On Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \"into the scariest part of the scariest place... part of Jupiter's radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\" A leading concern has been radiation levels - as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained. Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \"will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"So we did a lot about it,\" she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down.

Juno successfully began to orbit Jupiter on Monday night. At the precisely calculated moment, 8:18 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the craft's main engine ignited to start a maneuver called orbit insertion. Juno, which was approaching the planet at 130,000 mph, slowed down and dropped neatly into the planet's orbit at 8:53 p.m. When the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab received the signal that Juno was in optimal orbit, the room of scientists roared with excitement, clapping and leaning over desks to high-five comrades. Monday's orbit insertion was one of the most crucial moments in the Juno mission. The engine burned precisely 35 minutes, long enough to put Jupiter into a close orbit that will take 53 days to complete. If the burn had been any shorter, but still more than 20 minutes, the minimum needed to reach orbit, the craft would have taken much longer to circle Jupiter and limited what scientists could learn about the planet. But scientists will still have to wait for Juno to complete its first highly elliptical orbit before the craft can begin collecting any data. That's because as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the science instruments capable of taking measurements of the planet were turned off for insertion. The main engine burn would skew any measurements taken, Hubbard said. \"I'm really looking forward to the science,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission, during live coverage Monday streamed online. \"I'm so curious about the discoveries that we can make, learning about our beginnings and what Jupiter can tell us about how the solar system was made.\" Hubbard, who is a co-investigator for the mission, shared Bolton's sentiment. Hubbard, 75, said he was relieved when Juno entered Jupiter's orbit because \"now we can do the science.\" Hubbard helped design a science instrument that will be used in a key experiment. The tool will analyze both Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields in an effort to learn more about the planet's interior and possibly solid core. \"I'm hoping that we'll get a good enough set of gravity data that we can really get a good picture of how active the planet is inside,\" he told the Arizona Republic. \"That's the kind of science experiment that will be fun.\" Juno launched in August 2011 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Since blastoff, the spacecraft has voyaged through 1.7 billion miles of space to arrive at Jupiter. On Monday, Juno flew about 2,800 miles over the planet's clouds. The Galileo mission, Juno's predecessor, came within about only 260,000 miles of Jupiter. About halfway through the burn, Hubbard also worried about Juno's passage through Jupiter's equatorial plane and ring system. \" has a lot of particles that orbit it in its equatorial plane,\" he said, \"so when you go through that, that's where you would be most likely to hit a ring particle or even a fairly large dust particle.\" The maneuver was made even more tricky because during insertion, Juno had to turn away from its source of power - the sun. Valdez: Juno? Who cares about space science? Juno is equipped with three massive winglike solar arrays, making the craft larger than an NBA basketball court. It's also the first mission to an outer planet that's primarily solar-powered. However, Juno ran off battery power during the main engine burn. The craft's orientation was adjusted away from the sun so that the burn would adequately slow it down. Juno also began rotating faster as it prepared for insertion, increasing from two revolutions per minute to five. \"It's like a bicycle wheel,\" said Stuart Stephens of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, which is managing Juno. \"The faster you spin it, the more stable it is.\" As soon as the insertion was complete, the spacecraft reduced its revolutions to two per minute again and turned back to face the sun \"so the juices start flowing through Juno's veins again,\" Bolton said. The spacecraft will continue to circle Jupiter 37 times over 20 months, collecting data and sending it back to scientists at JPL. But before Juno can begin sending data, the spacecraft has to survive the most dangerous place in space. \"Jupiter has the scariest radiation environment of any planet in the solar system,\" said Heidi Becker, the radiation-monitoring-investigation lead for the mission, during an earlier press conference. \"It's the harshest, it's the most intense, and it hasn't been fully explored yet.\" Most of the instruments aboard Juno are sealed in a 400-pound titanium vault to protect them from the planet's radiation. The electronics are sensitive to the powerful radiation, which is 60 million times stronger than what is experienced on Earth. Along with being the most hazardous planet, Jupiter is also the largest and oldest in the solar system. Jupiter's age, scientists say, is what makes it such an interesting planet to study. Because it was the first planet in our system to form, its chemical makeup might give researchers insight into how solar systems are born. One ingredient in the solar system \"recipe\" is water. A science instrument aboard Juno, called a microwave radiometer, will analyze Jupiter for the compound. Scientists want to know both how much water Jupiter has and what state - vapor or ice - it is in. The amount of water found on Jupiter is \"the single most important number that Juno is going to bring back,\" said Steve Levin, a project scientist for the Juno mission. \"It's crucial to understanding how the solar system formed,\" he said earlier. Data isn't the only thing Juno will be sending back to Earth. A specialized camera, called JunoCam, is mounted atop the spacecraft and expected to take amazing up-close photos of Jupiter. What pictures the camera takes, however, aren't completely up to NASA's scientists. Bolton called JunoCam an \"outreach camera\" because space enthusiasts will be able to go online and vote for where it should point. \"It's great to see citizen science,\" Bolton said Monday. \"The public is joining our team.\" Ordinary citizens aren't the only unusual addition to the mission. Some hitchhikers also caught a ride to Jupiter. Three Lego figurines, crafted out of space-grade aluminium, were jointly designed by the toy company and NASA as part of an educational-outreach program and mounted inside the spacecraft's vault. \"They're getting the ride of their life, and they've got the best view of any of us,\" Bolton joked. One depicts Galileo, the Italian astronomer who first observed the orbits of Jupiter's moons. The second is Jupiter, the Roman god the planet is named for, built holding a lightning bolt. The last figure is Juno, who is Jupiter's mythological wife. The goddess is the mission's namesake because of her ability to see through the clouds her husband often used to obscure his actions. NASA, too, hopes to peer through Jupiter's clouds and uncover the secrets of the planet's interior.

Juno's science instruments, which scientists had shut down several days before the spacecraft entered into orbit around Jupiter, will go back on again in a couple of days, according to Bolton. Then Juno will spend the next 20 months studying Jupiter's core, mapping its magnetic field, and measuring the amount of water and ammonia in the Jovian atmosphere. Juno will circle Jupiter in elliptical polar orbits to avoid an intense radiation region around Jupiter's equator and to limit damage to the craft's titanium-shielded instruments.

It has to get below Jupiter's intense radiation belts next. \"Juno's close approaches will expose it to enough radiation to fry most modern electronics, so the craft will dip in just once every two weeks for a few hours to minimize exposure. Juno is also outfitted with a radiation-shielded titanium vault that houses most of its sensitive equipment,\" USA TODAY'S Michael Kofsky writes. The end goal? To figure out how the solar system was formed. That's some deep existential stuff right there. Godspeed, Juno, enjoy those drops of Jupiter in your hair. Well, it just isn't a successful Fourth of July unless somebody blows off a body part, right? Fingers, hands, arms, butt cheeks. ... all common victims of home fireworks. Certainly Brevard couldn't let us down this year, right? Right. There were two firework-involved injuries in Brevard, one in West Melbourne and one in Titusville. The Titusville incident involved a 13-year-old boy whose hand took a beating from a firework explosive. Good news, though. He did not lose any limbs. Unfortunately, the West Melbourne incident didn't have such a happy ending. A 50-year-old man lost a portion of his hand. Yikes. I know I'm making fun of these two, but in all seriousness, I wish them both a speedy recovery. Also, let it be a reminder that fireworks are SUPER dangerous. This is why we can't have nice things, Brevard. Celebrations took place across the county and if there was one true common denominator between them all it was this - trash. Seriously, though, so much trash. We're talking wrappers, beer bottles, dirty diapers. ... Luckily, we have this great organization called Keep Brevard Beautiful that comes behind us and picks up our garbage. KBB sent out 19 volunteers after the festivities who gathered trash off the beaches and from area parks. Also, a shout out to the city personnel who picked up trash in their respective areas. It's a dirty job. Hats off to you. Yesterday, a 4-year-old started a fire in his room with a cigarette lighter, thus burning up the home and displacing the family. Everyone was able to make it out of the home safely, and the pet cat was even saved from harm. The fire happened at a duplex on Third Avenue in Titusville. Firefighters were quick to get there and contain the fire. Yay, firefighters! However ... HOW THE HECK DID A 4-YEAR-OLD GET A CIGARETTE LIGHTER?! I digress. The Red Cross is helping the family find a place to stay and the child may \"be recommended to a special program for juveniles involved with setting fires, officials reported,\" reporter J.D. Gallop writes. Will we commit? There's a pretty big plan on the table to fix up some of Brevard's beaches. The county is considering a 50-year, $551 million \"nourishment\" project to revamp beaches in Satellite Beach and Indian Harbour Beach. The area includes a 7.8-mile stretch from Pineda Causeway south to Flug Avenue. How would we pay for it? It involves dipping into the 5-percent tourism tax on hotel rooms. Other money will come from the federal government and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, The county would work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the project and officials say the economic benefits are three times the worth of the initial price. Reporter Dave \"The Berm\" Berman writes: \"... The Midreach Project will help preserve the beach areas for recreation and tourism; will help protect nearby homes, businesses, roads and other infrastructure from potential storm damage; and will help preserve sea turtle nesting areas.\" The project includes an artificial reef, what would be constructed on land in early 2017, then placed offshore in the summer of 2017. Brevard County Commissioners will discuss the issue July 12. I, too, have a \"nourishment\" project underway. It includes free dinner for me. Who's buying?

At 3:41 p.m. EDT today, Juno will reach the farthest point in its 53-day orbit around Jupiter - a spot about 5 million miles away from the solar system's largest planet, NASA officials said. Then, Jupiter's powerful gravity will pull Juno back in, and the spacecraft will begin zooming toward an Aug. 27 close approach that will take it within just 2,600 miles of the planet's cloud tops. The Aug. 27 pass should return the first real scientific bounty of the mission, team members have said. \"We're in an excellent state of health, with the spacecraft and all the instruments fully checked out and ready for our first up-close look at Jupiter,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. Juno launched on Aug. 5, 2011, on a $1.1 billion mission to map out Jupiter's magnetic and gravitational fields, and determine the planet's interior structure and composition, among other goals. The spacecraft's observations should shed light on Jupiter's formation and evolution, which, in turn, should help researchers learn about how the solar system itself came together, team members have said. After a looping deep-space journey that included a speed-boosting flyby of Earth in October 2013, the solar-powered Juno finally arrived at Jupiter on the night of July 4, settling into its initial orbit after a perfectly executed 35-minute-long engine burn. Juno will conduct another 53-day orbit after the Aug. 27 close approach. Then, in October, the probe will perform one more engine burn to shift into a 14-day orbit. At that point, the probe's science mission will officially begin. Juno will loop around Jupiter more than 30 times, observing the gas giant with its suite of science instruments. The mission is scheduled to end in February 2018 with an intentional death dive into Jupiter's thick atmosphere. \"For five years, we've been focused on getting to Jupiter.

The images show storm systems and weather activity unlike anything previously seen on any of our solar system's gas-giant planets. Juno successfully executed the first of 36 orbital flybys on Aug. 27 when the spacecraft came about 2,500 miles above Jupiter's swirling clouds. The download of six megabytes of data collected during the six-hour transit, from above Jupiter's north pole to below its south pole, took one-and-a-half days. While analysis of this first data collection is ongoing, some unique discoveries have already made themselves visible. \"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"It's bluer in color up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms. There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zone and belts that we are used to -- this image is hardly recognizable as Jupiter. We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\" One of the most notable findings of these first-ever pictures of Jupiter's north and south poles is something that the JunoCam imager did not see. \"Saturn has a hexagon at the north pole,\" said Bolton. \"There is nothing on Jupiter that anywhere near resembles that. The largest planet in our solar system is truly unique. We have 36 more flybys to study just how unique it really is.\" Along with JunoCam snapping pictures during the flyby, all eight of Juno's science instruments were energized and collecting data. The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, supplied by the Italian Space Agency, acquired some remarkable images of Jupiter at its north and south polar regions in infrared wavelengths. \"JIRAM is getting under Jupiter's skin, giving us our first infrared close-ups of the planet,\" said Alberto Adriani, JIRAM co-investigator from Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, Rome. \"These first infrared views of Jupiter's north and south poles are revealing warm and hot spots that have never been seen before. And while we knew that the first-ever infrared views of Jupiter's south pole could reveal the planet's southern aurora, we were amazed to see it for the first time. No other instruments, both from Earth or space, have been able to see the southern aurora. Now, with JIRAM, we see that it appears to be very bright and well-structured. The high level of detail in the images will tell us more about the aurora's morphology and dynamics.\" Among the more unique data sets collected by Juno during its first scientific sweep by Jupiter was that acquired by the mission's Radio/Plasma Wave Experiment, which recorded ghostly-sounding transmissions emanating from above the planet. These radio emissions from Jupiter have been known about since the 1950s but had never been analyzed from such a close vantage point. \"Jupiter is talking to us in a way only gas-giant worlds can,\" said Bill Kurth, co-investigator for the Waves instrument from the University of Iowa, Iowa City. \"Waves detected the signature emissions of the energetic particles that generate the massive auroras which encircle Jupiter's north pole. These emissions are the strongest in the solar system.

On Friday, Juno crossed a gravitational boundary between Jupiter and the sun, and the gas giant began pulling the spacecraft in ahead of a planned July 4 arrival, NASA officials said. \"As of tomorrow May 28, and for the rest of the mission, we project Jupiter's gravity will dominate as the trajectory-perturbing effects by other celestial bodies are reduced to insignificant roles,\" Juno project manager Rick Nybakken, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. Juno launched in August 2011. Since then, three gravitational forces have markedly influenced the spacecraft's trek - those of the sun, the Earth and Jupiter. At the beginning stages of Juno's trip, Earth was most influential; more recently, the sun has had the biggest impact on the spacecraft's trajectory, NASA officials said. On July 4, the basketball-court-size Juno will fire its main engine for 35 minutes, changing the probe's velocity and allowing it to slide into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter. Once Juno is in orbit, the spacecraft will fly around Jupiter at least 37 times, coming within just 3,100 miles of the planet's cloud tops during its closest approaches.

Juno will be the second probe ever to orbit Jupiter, after NASA's Galileo spacecraft, which studied the gas giant up close from 1995 through 2003.

The Jupiter-bound satellite is expected to enter orbit around the huge planet on July 4, but it's already beamed back an image of the giant planet and some of its largest moons. The new photo, taken on June 21, shows hints of Jupiter's bands of clouds along with the moons Ganymede, Io, Europa and Callisto clustered to the left of the large world. Soon, Jupiter will come into even better focus when Juno enters into orbit around the planet and starts beaming back images. When the June 21 photo was taken, Juno was about 6.8 million miles from Jupiter. On July 4, Juno is expected to fly just 2,900 miles above the tops of the planet's clouds, just about the same distance as the diameter of the continental United States. Juno, which was launched from Earth in August of 2011, is designed to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere and evolution by studying its auroras and magnetic field. The spacecraft should make 37 close approaches through the course of its nearly two-year mission, giving scientists plenty of data to analyze. This mission won't be easy on Juno. The radiation environment near Jupiter -- due to the unique inner workings of the massive planet -- is so intense that the spacecraft's instruments won't be able to function for very long in that part of space. Mission managers have designed the craft's close approaches of Jupiter to minimize the harmful impacts of that radiation on Juno's hardware, but even so, the mission will only last for about 20 months because of the harsh environment. \"Over the life of the mission, Juno will be exposed to the equivalent of over 100 million dental X-rays,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager, said in a statement(Opens in a new tab). \"But, we are ready. We designed an orbit around Jupiter that minimizes exposure to Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. This orbit allows us to survive long enough to obtain the tantalizing science data that we have traveled so far to get,\" Nybakken said.

Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that governed our solar system during its formation. As our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also provide critical knowledge for understanding the planetary systems being discovered around other stars. With its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. \"I view Jupiter as a missing link,\" says Barry Mauk of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \"Jupiter is the link between the nearby space environments we study at planets like Earth, and distant astrophysical systems where magnetic fields hold sway, such as early-stage star forming regions, and hyper-energetic radiation regions like the Crab Nebula. Juno is not only going to help us better understand Jupiter, it's going to help us better understand the universe around us and our place in it.\" Mauk leads the investigation team for the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument, or JEDI, which was built by APL and is part of Juno's payload. JEDI consists of three shoebox-sized detectors, each of which views a three- dimensional, 120-degree-by-12-degree \"slice\" of the sky; the units are positioned to provide a continuous 360-degree sampling view of the space around Juno. These detectors will provide data on particles with energies in the 30 to roughly 1,000 kiloelectron volt range that surround the planet and help create the enormous and powerful auroras surrounding Jupiter's polar regions. JEDI detects electrons and ions such as protons, helium, oxygen, and sulfur that interact with Jupiter's atmosphere in creating the aurora; it also measures energetic neutral atoms emanating from Jupiter's auroral atmosphere. \"A unique aspect of JEDI is its ability to simultaneously measure incoming particles from many directions, allowing JEDI to obtain nearly instantaneous snapshots of the complete particle distributions,\" says Dennis Haggerty, APL's instrument scientist for the JEDI investigation. \"This capability is crucial for revealing the fundamental physics of Jupiter's aurora because of the extremely rapid speed of the Juno spacecraft as it passes over Jupiter's poles.\" Juno will be moving at more than 30 miles a second across auroral structures known to be as narrow as 50 miles wide. Each JEDI instrument combines a time-of-flight chamber with a series of solid- state detectors to determine the direction of motion, the speed, and the energy of energetic particles entering JEDI. These combined measurements also allow JEDI to determine the mass composition of the incoming particles. That new information will help scientists in their quest to learn more about where the particles come from, how they are energized, and what triggers the release of energy from these particles into brilliant auroral displays. \"Jupiter has the most intense and interesting aurora in the entire solar system,\" says Mauk, who has studied particle systems at Earth, other planets, and throughout the solar system on NASA missions including Voyager, Galileo, the Van Allen Probes, Cassini, and Magnetospheric Multiscale. \"Jupiter's aurora has a power density 10 times greater than Earth's and an overall power that is a factor of 100 greater. What we want to know is, how is this system energized?\" Along with JEDI, a second particle instrument called the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment, or JADE, will study lower energy particles involved in the same processes. JADE was built by the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, two other instruments play a role in the fields and particles investigation: the Magnetometer Experiment, which will visualize Jupiter's magnetic field in 3-D; and the Waves instrument, which will measure radio and plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The particle populations-electrons and ions-around Jupiter are powered in a different way than those at Earth. The solar wind provides the energy to the particles surrounding our planet, some of which are trapped in twin donut- shaped regions called radiation belts. At Jupiter, rotational forces produce the driving energy for the system-Jupiter rotates at a much higher speed than Earth; a Jupiter day lasts about 10 hours. \"From NASA's Van Allen Probes mission, we learned how high energy particles are accelerated at Earth,\" Mauk says. \"Will it be different at Jupiter? We're going to find out.\" Juno, which launched on Aug. 5, 2011, is the second spacecraft designed under NASA's New Frontiers Program. The first, the _New Horizons_ mission to Pluto, flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015 after a nine-and-a-half-year flight. The New Frontiers Program is managed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles. The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move. \"Juno, welcome to Jupiter,\" said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons. Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission. The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant - a ball of hydrogen and helium - unlike rocky Earth and Mars. With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed. Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter. Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth. Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking. The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles, took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles of Jupiter's clouds - closer than previous missions - to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup. Juno is an armored spacecraft - its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission. Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates - a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons.

The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter's clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the deity of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions. Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life. Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989. That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge toward Jupiter in 2003. Juno's orbital track is closer than Galileo's - this time within 3,100 miles above the cloud tops. With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years. On Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \"into the scariest part of the scariest place... part of Jupiter's radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\" A leading concern has been radiation levels - as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained. Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \"will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"So we did a lot about it,\" she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down.

Juno successfully began to orbit Jupiter on Monday night. At the precisely calculated moment, 8:18 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the craft's main engine ignited to start a maneuver called orbit insertion. Juno, which was approaching the planet at 130,000 mph, slowed down and dropped neatly into the planet's orbit at 8:53 p.m. When the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab received the signal that Juno was in optimal orbit, the room of scientists roared with excitement, clapping and leaning over desks to high-five comrades. Monday's orbit insertion was one of the most crucial moments in the Juno mission. The engine burned precisely 35 minutes, long enough to put Jupiter into a close orbit that will take 53 days to complete. If the burn had been any shorter, but still more than 20 minutes, the minimum needed to reach orbit, the craft would have taken much longer to circle Jupiter and limited what scientists could learn about the planet. But scientists will still have to wait for Juno to complete its first highly elliptical orbit before the craft can begin collecting any data. That's because as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the science instruments capable of taking measurements of the planet were turned off for insertion. The main engine burn would skew any measurements taken, Hubbard said. \"I'm really looking forward to the science,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission, during live coverage Monday streamed online. \"I'm so curious about the discoveries that we can make, learning about our beginnings and what Jupiter can tell us about how the solar system was made.\" Hubbard, who is a co-investigator for the mission, shared Bolton's sentiment. Hubbard, 75, said he was relieved when Juno entered Jupiter's orbit because \"now we can do the science.\" Hubbard helped design a science instrument that will be used in a key experiment. The tool will analyze both Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields in an effort to learn more about the planet's interior and possibly solid core. \"I'm hoping that we'll get a good enough set of gravity data that we can really get a good picture of how active the planet is inside,\" he told the Arizona Republic. \"That's the kind of science experiment that will be fun.\" Juno launched in August 2011 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Since blastoff, the spacecraft has voyaged through 1.7 billion miles of space to arrive at Jupiter. On Monday, Juno flew about 2,800 miles over the planet's clouds. The Galileo mission, Juno's predecessor, came within about only 260,000 miles of Jupiter. About halfway through the burn, Hubbard also worried about Juno's passage through Jupiter's equatorial plane and ring system. \" has a lot of particles that orbit it in its equatorial plane,\" he said, \"so when you go through that, that's where you would be most likely to hit a ring particle or even a fairly large dust particle.\" The maneuver was made even more tricky because during insertion, Juno had to turn away from its source of power - the sun. Valdez: Juno? Who cares about space science? Juno is equipped with three massive winglike solar arrays, making the craft larger than an NBA basketball court. It's also the first mission to an outer planet that's primarily solar-powered. However, Juno ran off battery power during the main engine burn. The craft's orientation was adjusted away from the sun so that the burn would adequately slow it down. Juno also began rotating faster as it prepared for insertion, increasing from two revolutions per minute to five. \"It's like a bicycle wheel,\" said Stuart Stephens of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, which is managing Juno. \"The faster you spin it, the more stable it is.\" As soon as the insertion was complete, the spacecraft reduced its revolutions to two per minute again and turned back to face the sun \"so the juices start flowing through Juno's veins again,\" Bolton said. The spacecraft will continue to circle Jupiter 37 times over 20 months, collecting data and sending it back to scientists at JPL. But before Juno can begin sending data, the spacecraft has to survive the most dangerous place in space. \"Jupiter has the scariest radiation environment of any planet in the solar system,\" said Heidi Becker, the radiation-monitoring-investigation lead for the mission, during an earlier press conference. \"It's the harshest, it's the most intense, and it hasn't been fully explored yet.\" Most of the instruments aboard Juno are sealed in a 400-pound titanium vault to protect them from the planet's radiation. The electronics are sensitive to the powerful radiation, which is 60 million times stronger than what is experienced on Earth. Along with being the most hazardous planet, Jupiter is also the largest and oldest in the solar system. Jupiter's age, scientists say, is what makes it such an interesting planet to study. Because it was the first planet in our system to form, its chemical makeup might give researchers insight into how solar systems are born. One ingredient in the solar system \"recipe\" is water. A science instrument aboard Juno, called a microwave radiometer, will analyze Jupiter for the compound. Scientists want to know both how much water Jupiter has and what state - vapor or ice - it is in. The amount of water found on Jupiter is \"the single most important number that Juno is going to bring back,\" said Steve Levin, a project scientist for the Juno mission. \"It's crucial to understanding how the solar system formed,\" he said earlier. Data isn't the only thing Juno will be sending back to Earth. A specialized camera, called JunoCam, is mounted atop the spacecraft and expected to take amazing up-close photos of Jupiter. What pictures the camera takes, however, aren't completely up to NASA's scientists. Bolton called JunoCam an \"outreach camera\" because space enthusiasts will be able to go online and vote for where it should point. \"It's great to see citizen science,\" Bolton said Monday. \"The public is joining our team.\" Ordinary citizens aren't the only unusual addition to the mission. Some hitchhikers also caught a ride to Jupiter. Three Lego figurines, crafted out of space-grade aluminium, were jointly designed by the toy company and NASA as part of an educational-outreach program and mounted inside the spacecraft's vault. \"They're getting the ride of their life, and they've got the best view of any of us,\" Bolton joked. One depicts Galileo, the Italian astronomer who first observed the orbits of Jupiter's moons. The second is Jupiter, the Roman god the planet is named for, built holding a lightning bolt. The last figure is Juno, who is Jupiter's mythological wife. The goddess is the mission's namesake because of her ability to see through the clouds her husband often used to obscure his actions. NASA, too, hopes to peer through Jupiter's clouds and uncover the secrets of the planet's interior.

Bolton works at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. At 8:53 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time last night, scientists received a signal from Juno confirming the orbit insertion. \"Tonight, through tones, Juno sang to us, and it was a song of perfection,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from JPL. \"After a 1.7-billion-mile 2.7-billion-kilometer journey, we hit our burn targets within 1 second on a target that was just tens of kilometers large.\" A 20-Month Long Investigation. Juno's science instruments, which scientists had shut down several days before the spacecraft entered into orbit around Jupiter, will go back on again in a couple of days, according to Bolton. Then Juno will spend the next 20 months studying Jupiter's core, mapping its magnetic field, and measuring the amount of water and ammonia in the Jovian atmosphere. Juno will circle Jupiter in elliptical polar orbits to avoid an intense radiation region around Jupiter's equator and to limit damage to the craft's titanium-shielded instruments. Steven Levin, Juno project scientist from JPL, said he looks forward to 27 August, 53 days from yesterday, when, with all of Juno's instruments turned on, \"we'll get our first really good look at Jupiter from close up and learn how Jupiter is going to surprise us.\" Levin said he hopes the mission also can help answer bigger questions about the origins of the giant planet and the solar system. During its final approach to Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft captured the time- lapse movie below of the largest of Jupiter's moons orbiting the planet, with their motions sped up from 17 days to about 3 minutes. From innermost to outermost, the moons seen are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The movie begins with images taken on 12 June when Juno was 16 million kilometers from Jupiter and ends on 29 June, 4.8 million kilometers from Jupiter.

Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, had admitted to being \"nervous\" and \"scared\" about the fate of the $1.1 billion spacecraft, which was traveling at a speed of more than 150,000 miles per hour toward what he called \"the king of the solar system.\" Juno slowed down in order to be captured by Jupiter's gravity and pulled into its orbit 3,000 miles above the clouds. Juno was precisely positioned, ignited its main engine at exactly the right moment and kept it burning for 35 minutes to lose enough speed. Throughout its 37 orbits, over 20 months, Juno's titanium cover must endure massive amounts of radiation - the equivalent of 100 million dental x-rays. Juno's aim is to map Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, and determine whether the planet has a dense core beneath its clouds. For its grand finale - its final orbit - Juno will dive into Jupiter's atmosphere, where it will be crushed and vaporized. Among the questions scientists Juno will help answer are: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Bolton said. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot, which appears to be a massive, centuries-old storm which is larger than the earth. Juno is the first spacecraft to travel so far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. Three massive solar wings stick out from Juno like blades from a windmill. They house 18,698 solar cells, which generate 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. Jupiter's sheer size gives it immense gravity, which it exerts by packing two- and-a-half times the mass of all the other planets in our solar system combined. Its mass and gravitational force is believed to have helped shield Earth from bombardment of comets and asteroids - an astronomical lightning rod, so to speak.

The Juno mission's spacecraft knocked one out of the park, all the way to Jupiter. The spacecraft, which has been traveling since August 2011, reached Jupiter's orbit at around 9 p.m. on Independence Day. Space nerds everywhere cheered in unison. Juno made a 1.8 billion-mile trek to the gas giant and it took some serious brains and guts to make it happen. Engineers had to slow the craft down 1,200 mph before it could be sucked into Jupiter's orbit. Nailed it. Now Juno is on its way to studying the planet, but it will take a few more risks in the process. It has to get below Jupiter's intense radiation belts next. \"Juno's close approaches will expose it to enough radiation to fry most modern electronics, so the craft will dip in just once every two weeks for a few hours to minimize exposure. Juno is also outfitted with a radiation-shielded titanium vault that houses most of its sensitive equipment,\" USA TODAY'S Michael Kofsky writes. The end goal? To figure out how the solar system was formed. That's some deep existential stuff right there. Godspeed, Juno, enjoy those drops of Jupiter in your hair. Well, it just isn't a successful Fourth of July unless somebody blows off a body part, right? Fingers, hands, arms, butt cheeks. ... all common victims of home fireworks. Certainly Brevard couldn't let us down this year, right? Right. There were two firework-involved injuries in Brevard, one in West Melbourne and one in Titusville. The Titusville incident involved a 13-year-old boy whose hand took a beating from a firework explosive. Good news, though. He did not lose any limbs. Unfortunately, the West Melbourne incident didn't have such a happy ending. A 50-year-old man lost a portion of his hand. Yikes. I know I'm making fun of these two, but in all seriousness, I wish them both a speedy recovery. Also, let it be a reminder that fireworks are SUPER dangerous. This is why we can't have nice things, Brevard. Celebrations took place across the county and if there was one true common denominator between them all it was this - trash. Seriously, though, so much trash. We're talking wrappers, beer bottles, dirty diapers. ... Luckily, we have this great organization called Keep Brevard Beautiful that comes behind us and picks up our garbage. KBB sent out 19 volunteers after the festivities who gathered trash off the beaches and from area parks. Also, a shout out to the city personnel who picked up trash in their respective areas. It's a dirty job. Hats off to you. Yesterday, a 4-year-old started a fire in his room with a cigarette lighter, thus burning up the home and displacing the family. Everyone was able to make it out of the home safely, and the pet cat was even saved from harm. The fire happened at a duplex on Third Avenue in Titusville. Firefighters were quick to get there and contain the fire. Yay, firefighters! However ... HOW THE HECK DID A 4-YEAR-OLD GET A CIGARETTE LIGHTER?! I digress. The Red Cross is helping the family find a place to stay and the child may \"be recommended to a special program for juveniles involved with setting fires, officials reported,\" reporter J.D. Gallop writes. Will we commit? There's a pretty big plan on the table to fix up some of Brevard's beaches. The county is considering a 50-year, $551 million \"nourishment\" project to revamp beaches in Satellite Beach and Indian Harbour Beach. The area includes a 7.8-mile stretch from Pineda Causeway south to Flug Avenue. How would we pay for it? It involves dipping into the 5-percent tourism tax on hotel rooms. Other money will come from the federal government and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, The county would work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the project and officials say the economic benefits are three times the worth of the initial price. Reporter Dave \"The Berm\" Berman writes: \"... The Midreach Project will help preserve the beach areas for recreation and tourism; will help protect nearby homes, businesses, roads and other infrastructure from potential storm damage; and will help preserve sea turtle nesting areas.\" The project includes an artificial reef, what would be constructed on land in early 2017, then placed offshore in the summer of 2017. Brevard County Commissioners will discuss the issue July 12. I, too, have a \"nourishment\" project underway. It includes free dinner for me. Who's buying?

The largest planet in our solar system is truly unique. We have 36 more flybys to study just how unique it really is.\" Along with JunoCam snapping pictures during the flyby, all eight of Juno's science instruments were energized and collecting data. The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, supplied by the Italian Space Agency, acquired some remarkable images of Jupiter at its north and south polar regions in infrared wavelengths. \"JIRAM is getting under Jupiter's skin, giving us our first infrared close-ups of the planet,\" said Alberto Adriani, JIRAM co-investigator from Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, Rome. \"These first infrared views of Jupiter's north and south poles are revealing warm and hot spots that have never been seen before.

These radio emissions from Jupiter have been known about since the 1950s but had never been analyzed from such a close vantage point. \"Jupiter is talking to us in a way only gas-giant worlds can,\" said Bill Kurth, co-investigator for the Waves instrument from the University of Iowa, Iowa City. \"Waves detected the signature emissions of the energetic particles that generate the massive auroras which encircle Jupiter's north pole.

According to NASA, the Juno mission team decided to postpone the burn after two valves on the spacecraft's main engine failed to properly open. The spacecraft needs to be at its closest to Jupiter for the engine burn to achieve the proper acceleration and trajectory, so the team will have to wait until December 11, when Juno completes a full orbit at its current speed, to attempt to fire the engine again and insert into its trajectory for its main science mission. \"Telemetry indicates that two helium check valves that play an important role in the firing of the spacecraft's main engine did not operate as expected during a command sequence that was initiated yesterday,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager, in a NASA press release. \"The valves should have opened in a few seconds, but it took several minutes.

As Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission, points out, \"the mission is very flexible\" due to the fact that the close flybys are when the spacecraft is expected to learn the most. \"It is important to note that the orbital period does not affect the quality of the science that takes place during one of Juno's close flybys of Jupiter,\" he says. \"The data we collected during our first flyby on August 27 was a revelation, and I fully anticipate a similar result from Juno's October 19 flyby.\" It is still unclear what exactly caused the engine's helium check valves to open more slowly than anticipated, but hopefully the issue is not systemic of a larger problem on the big Jovian orbiter.

The probe went into a protective \"safe mode\" at 1:47 a.m. EDT this morning, preventing the spacecraft from gathering any data during today's highly anticipated second close flyby of the solar system's largest planet, NASA officials said. \"At the time safe mode was entered, the spacecraft was more than 13 hours from its closest approach to Jupiter,\" Juno project manager Rick Nybakken, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement today. \"We were still quite a ways from the planet's more intense radiation belts and magnetic fields,\" Nybakken added in the same statement. \"The spacecraft is healthy, and we are working our standard recovery procedure.\" Juno went into safe mode when a \"software-performance monitor\" caused the probe's onboard computer to reboot, NASA officials said. The issue is not related to an apparent problem with a set of valves in Juno's propulsion system, the officials added. The valve issue, which was publicly disclosed Friday, caused Juno's handlers to postpone the spacecraft's final engine burn. The maneuver was originally scheduled to take place during today's close Jupiter flyby; it would have shifted Juno from the spacecraft's current, highly elliptical, 53-day orbit to a 14-day path - the probe's final science orbit. The earliest this burn can now be performed is Dec. 11, during Juno's next Jupiter close encounter, NASA officials have said. The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and arrived at the gas giant this past July 4. Juno's main science goal involves mapping out Jupiter's internal structure, composition, gravity and magnetic fields in detail. This information should reveal key insights about how Jupiter, and the rest of the solar system, formed and evolved, mission team members have said. The original plan calls for Juno to circle Jupiter more than 30 times in the final 14-day orbit before the mission wraps up in February 2018. The spacecraft gathers most of its useful data during each orbit's close flyby; at most other times, Juno is quite far from Jupiter. Juno's first close flyby occurred on Aug. 27.

Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles. The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move. \"Juno, welcome to Jupiter,\" said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons. Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission. The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant - a ball of hydrogen and helium - unlike rocky Earth and Mars. With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed. Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter. Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth. Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system? \"What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,\" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. \"We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.\" There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking. The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles, took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments. In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles of Jupiter's clouds - closer than previous missions - to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup. Juno is an armored spacecraft - its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission. Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates - a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, erupted in cheers as the solar observatory entered its aimed-for orbit around the biggest planet in our cosmic neighborhood at 11:53 p.m.. \"We are there. We are in orbit. We conquered Jupiter,\" said Scott Bolton, NASA's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"It is almost like a dream coming true.\" Juno launched five years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and has traveled 1.7 billion miles since then. Its arrival marks the start of a 20-month mission during which scientists hope to find out more about how much water Jupiter holds and the makeup of its core to figure out how the gas giant - and other planets including Earth - formed billions of years ago. \"This amazing universe that we see, how does that work and how did it begin?\" asked NASA project scientist Steve Levin. \"That is one of the amazing things about working for NASA and working on big projects. You get to answer big questions.\" The spacecraft is equipped with nine science instruments, including a camera, which prior to orbit captured a video of Jupiter and its moons gliding around it at different speeds. \"In all of history we've never really been able to see the motion of any heavenly body against another,\" said Bolton, after showing the video during a post-orbit press conference for the first time. \"This is the king of our solar system and its disciples going around it,\" he said. \"To me, it is very significant. We are finally able to see with real video, with real pictures, this movement and we have only been able to imagine it up until today.\" All non-essential equipment was turned off for the approach, but the first post-orbit pictures from the spacecraft's on-board camera should arrive in a few days, NASA said. \"The spacecraft worked perfectly, which is always nice when you're driving a vehicle with 1.7 billion miles on the odometer,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager from Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Juno's inaugural lap around the solar system's most massive planet - the fifth from the sun - will last 53 days. Subsequent orbits will be shorter, about two weeks each. The first mission designed to see beneath Jupiter's clouds, Juno is named after the Roman goddess who was the wife of Jupiter, the deity of the sky in ancient mythology. The spacecraft orbits Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions. Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life. Although Juno is not the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, NASA says its path will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989. That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge toward Jupiter in 2003. Juno's orbital track is closer than Galileo's - this time within 3,100 miles above the cloud tops. With an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years. On Monday, Heidi Becker, senior engineer on radiation effects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described the close approach as going \"into the scariest part of the scariest place... part of Jupiter's radiation environment where nobody has ever been.\" A leading concern has been radiation levels - as high as 100 million X-rays in the course of a year, she explained. Those high-energy electrons, moving at the speed of light, \"will go right through a spacecraft and strip the atoms apart inside your electronics and fry your brain if you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"So we did a lot about it,\" she added, describing the half-inch-thick layer of titanium that protects the electronics in a vault to bring the radiation dose down.

Juno successfully began to orbit Jupiter on Monday night. At the precisely calculated moment, 8:18 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, the craft's main engine ignited to start a maneuver called orbit insertion. Juno, which was approaching the planet at 130,000 mph, slowed down and dropped neatly into the planet's orbit at 8:53 p.m. When the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab received the signal that Juno was in optimal orbit, the room of scientists roared with excitement, clapping and leaning over desks to high-five comrades. Monday's orbit insertion was one of the most crucial moments in the Juno mission. The engine burned precisely 35 minutes, long enough to put Jupiter into a close orbit that will take 53 days to complete. If the burn had been any shorter, but still more than 20 minutes, the minimum needed to reach orbit, the craft would have taken much longer to circle Jupiter and limited what scientists could learn about the planet. But scientists will still have to wait for Juno to complete its first highly elliptical orbit before the craft can begin collecting any data. That's because as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the science instruments capable of taking measurements of the planet were turned off for insertion. The main engine burn would skew any measurements taken, Hubbard said. \"I'm really looking forward to the science,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission, during live coverage Monday streamed online. \"I'm so curious about the discoveries that we can make, learning about our beginnings and what Jupiter can tell us about how the solar system was made.\" Hubbard, who is a co-investigator for the mission, shared Bolton's sentiment. Hubbard, 75, said he was relieved when Juno entered Jupiter's orbit because \"now we can do the science.\" Hubbard helped design a science instrument that will be used in a key experiment. The tool will analyze both Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields in an effort to learn more about the planet's interior and possibly solid core. \"I'm hoping that we'll get a good enough set of gravity data that we can really get a good picture of how active the planet is inside,\" he told the Arizona Republic. \"That's the kind of science experiment that will be fun.\" Juno launched in August 2011 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Since blastoff, the spacecraft has voyaged through 1.7 billion miles of space to arrive at Jupiter. On Monday, Juno flew about 2,800 miles over the planet's clouds. The Galileo mission, Juno's predecessor, came within about only 260,000 miles of Jupiter. About halfway through the burn, Hubbard also worried about Juno's passage through Jupiter's equatorial plane and ring system. \" has a lot of particles that orbit it in its equatorial plane,\" he said, \"so when you go through that, that's where you would be most likely to hit a ring particle or even a fairly large dust particle.\" The maneuver was made even more tricky because during insertion, Juno had to turn away from its source of power - the sun. Valdez: Juno? Who cares about space science? Juno is equipped with three massive winglike solar arrays, making the craft larger than an NBA basketball court. It's also the first mission to an outer planet that's primarily solar-powered. However, Juno ran off battery power during the main engine burn. The craft's orientation was adjusted away from the sun so that the burn would adequately slow it down. Juno also began rotating faster as it prepared for insertion, increasing from two revolutions per minute to five. \"It's like a bicycle wheel,\" said Stuart Stephens of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, which is managing Juno. \"The faster you spin it, the more stable it is.\" As soon as the insertion was complete, the spacecraft reduced its revolutions to two per minute again and turned back to face the sun \"so the juices start flowing through Juno's veins again,\" Bolton said. The spacecraft will continue to circle Jupiter 37 times over 20 months, collecting data and sending it back to scientists at JPL. But before Juno can begin sending data, the spacecraft has to survive the most dangerous place in space. \"Jupiter has the scariest radiation environment of any planet in the solar system,\" said Heidi Becker, the radiation-monitoring-investigation lead for the mission, during an earlier press conference. \"It's the harshest, it's the most intense, and it hasn't been fully explored yet.\" Most of the instruments aboard Juno are sealed in a 400-pound titanium vault to protect them from the planet's radiation. The electronics are sensitive to the powerful radiation, which is 60 million times stronger than what is experienced on Earth. Along with being the most hazardous planet, Jupiter is also the largest and oldest in the solar system. Jupiter's age, scientists say, is what makes it such an interesting planet to study. Because it was the first planet in our system to form, its chemical makeup might give researchers insight into how solar systems are born. One ingredient in the solar system \"recipe\" is water. A science instrument aboard Juno, called a microwave radiometer, will analyze Jupiter for the compound. Scientists want to know both how much water Jupiter has and what state - vapor or ice - it is in. The amount of water found on Jupiter is \"the single most important number that Juno is going to bring back,\" said Steve Levin, a project scientist for the Juno mission. \"It's crucial to understanding how the solar system formed,\" he said earlier. Data isn't the only thing Juno will be sending back to Earth. A specialized camera, called JunoCam, is mounted atop the spacecraft and expected to take amazing up-close photos of Jupiter. What pictures the camera takes, however, aren't completely up to NASA's scientists. Bolton called JunoCam an \"outreach camera\" because space enthusiasts will be able to go online and vote for where it should point. \"It's great to see citizen science,\" Bolton said Monday. \"The public is joining our team.\" Ordinary citizens aren't the only unusual addition to the mission. Some hitchhikers also caught a ride to Jupiter. Three Lego figurines, crafted out of space-grade aluminium, were jointly designed by the toy company and NASA as part of an educational-outreach program and mounted inside the spacecraft's vault. \"They're getting the ride of their life, and they've got the best view of any of us,\" Bolton joked. One depicts Galileo, the Italian astronomer who first observed the orbits of Jupiter's moons. The second is Jupiter, the Roman god the planet is named for, built holding a lightning bolt. The last figure is Juno, who is Jupiter's mythological wife. The goddess is the mission's namesake because of her ability to see through the clouds her husband often used to obscure his actions. NASA, too, hopes to peer through Jupiter's clouds and uncover the secrets of the planet's interior.

Juno's science instruments, which scientists had shut down several days before the spacecraft entered into orbit around Jupiter, will go back on again in a couple of days, according to Bolton. Then Juno will spend the next 20 months studying Jupiter's core, mapping its magnetic field, and measuring the amount of water and ammonia in the Jovian atmosphere. Juno will circle Jupiter in elliptical polar orbits to avoid an intense radiation region around Jupiter's equator and to limit damage to the craft's titanium-shielded instruments. Steven Levin, Juno project scientist from JPL, said he looks forward to 27 August, 53 days from yesterday, when, with all of Juno's instruments turned on, \"we'll get our first really good look at Jupiter from close up and learn how Jupiter is going to surprise us.\" Levin said he hopes the mission also can help answer bigger questions about the origins of the giant planet and the solar system. During its final approach to Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft captured the time- lapse movie below of the largest of Jupiter's moons orbiting the planet, with their motions sped up from 17 days to about 3 minutes. From innermost to outermost, the moons seen are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, had admitted to being \"nervous\" and \"scared\" about the fate of the $1.1 billion spacecraft, which was traveling at a speed of more than 150,000 miles per hour toward what he called \"the king of the solar system.\" Juno slowed down in order to be captured by Jupiter's gravity and pulled into its orbit 3,000 miles above the clouds. Juno was precisely positioned, ignited its main engine at exactly the right moment and kept it burning for 35 minutes to lose enough speed. Throughout its 37 orbits, over 20 months, Juno's titanium cover must endure massive amounts of radiation - the equivalent of 100 million dental x-rays. Juno's aim is to map Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, and determine whether the planet has a dense core beneath its clouds. For its grand finale - its final orbit - Juno will dive into Jupiter's atmosphere, where it will be crushed and vaporized.

Jupiter's sheer size gives it immense gravity, which it exerts by packing two- and-a-half times the mass of all the other planets in our solar system combined.

Unfortunately, the West Melbourne incident didn't have such a happy ending. A 50-year-old man lost a portion of his hand. Yikes. I know I'm making fun of these two, but in all seriousness, I wish them both a speedy recovery. Also, let it be a reminder that fireworks are SUPER dangerous.

Luckily, we have this great organization called Keep Brevard Beautiful that comes behind us and picks up our garbage. KBB sent out 19 volunteers after the festivities who gathered trash off the beaches and from area parks. Also, a shout out to the city personnel who picked up trash in their respective areas.

According to NASA, the Juno mission team decided to postpone the burn after two valves on the spacecraft's main engine failed to properly open. The spacecraft needs to be at its closest to Jupiter for the engine burn to achieve the proper acceleration and trajectory, so the team will have to wait until December 11, when Juno completes a full orbit at its current speed, to attempt to fire the engine again and insert into its trajectory for its main science mission. \"Telemetry indicates that two helium check valves that play an important role in the firing of the spacecraft's main engine did not operate as expected during a command sequence that was initiated yesterday,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager, in a NASA press release. \"The valves should have opened in a few seconds, but it took several minutes.

The orbital burn went perfectly, but a potentially serious problem arose. In October, after two complete orbits, the main engine was scheduled to fire once again. It was supposed to change Juno's orbit from the initial looping trajectory that took it as close as 4,200 kilometers over Jupiter's poles to over eight million kilometers out, to the new \"science orbit\" that was supposed to be only 14 days long. However, just before the burn, telemetry indicated that a pair of valves had failed to work properly. The orbit reduction maneuver was at first postponed until Dec. 11, but then it was decided to postpone it again until at least the next perijove, which is in February 2017. The spacecraft is working, and collecting good data, so engineers decided it would be better to work the problem longer to make as sure as they can that the maneuver will be performed properly. The image above is from a few hours after the last pass in December, called Perijove 3. It shows the south pole of Jupiter to the bottom, and from this vantage we're looking \"up\" at the Great Red Spot. The smaller red storm to the lower right is called Oval BA, but it's hardly small: It's about the same diameter as Earth! It formed in 2000 when three smaller storms merged. The image was processed by master planetary photographer Damian Peach, and it's so, well, _odd_. Jupiter orbits the Sun in roughly the same plane as Earth, and its rotational axis is pretty much perpendicular to that plane. That means, from Earth, we tend to be looking down on Jupiter's equator, with the belts and zones stretching across horizontally. From this angle everything is tilty; it's a view we cannot get from Earth. If you want to see Jupiter this way, you have to go there. Which is another reason Juno is so cool. Another Juno image Peach put together from the raw data graced the Astronomy Picture of the Day site recently as well. This last pass of Jupiter by Juno was the first to take gravity data. One of the main purposes of the Juno mission is to map the interior of Jupiter. As it passes very close to the planet, the layers of material beneath the surface of the planet pull on the spacecraft differently, affecting its orbital trajectory minutely. These changes can be used to determine the density of those layers, which in turn reveals the internal structure of Jupiter. Weirdly, it's not clear if Jupiter has a distinct core or not ; different physical models for how it formed yield different results. Juno may be able to help scientists determine which is correct. In the meantime, Juno will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetic field, returning information about that as well. Hopefully, over the next few weeks scientists and engineers will be more confident they can put Juno into the correct science orbit. Until then, it's still doing good work, and we can enjoy the literally unearthly view.

The images show storm systems and weather activity unlike anything previously seen on any of our solar system's gas-giant planets. Juno successfully executed the first of 36 orbital flybys on Aug. 27 when the spacecraft came about 2,500 miles above Jupiter's swirling clouds. The download of six megabytes of data collected during the six-hour transit, from above Jupiter's north pole to below its south pole, took one-and-a-half days. While analysis of this first data collection is ongoing, some unique discoveries have already made themselves visible. \"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"It's bluer in color up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms. There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zone and belts that we are used to -- this image is hardly recognizable as Jupiter. We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\" One of the most notable findings of these first-ever pictures of Jupiter's north and south poles is something that the JunoCam imager did not see. \"Saturn has a hexagon at the north pole,\" said Bolton. \"There is nothing on Jupiter that anywhere near resembles that. The largest planet in our solar system is truly unique. We have 36 more flybys to study just how unique it really is.\" Along with JunoCam snapping pictures during the flyby, all eight of Juno's science instruments were energized and collecting data. The Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, supplied by the Italian Space Agency, acquired some remarkable images of Jupiter at its north and south polar regions in infrared wavelengths. \"JIRAM is getting under Jupiter's skin, giving us our first infrared close-ups of the planet,\" said Alberto Adriani, JIRAM co-investigator from Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, Rome. \"These first infrared views of Jupiter's north and south poles are revealing warm and hot spots that have never been seen before. And while we knew that the first-ever infrared views of Jupiter's south pole could reveal the planet's southern aurora, we were amazed to see it for the first time. No other instruments, both from Earth or space, have been able to see the southern aurora. Now, with JIRAM, we see that it appears to be very bright and well-structured. The high level of detail in the images will tell us more about the aurora's morphology and dynamics.\" Among the more unique data sets collected by Juno during its first scientific sweep by Jupiter was that acquired by the mission's Radio/Plasma Wave Experiment, which recorded ghostly-sounding transmissions emanating from above the planet. These radio emissions from Jupiter have been known about since the 1950s but had never been analyzed from such a close vantage point. \"Jupiter is talking to us in a way only gas-giant worlds can,\" said Bill Kurth, co-investigator for the Waves instrument from the University of Iowa, Iowa City. \"Waves detected the signature emissions of the energetic particles that generate the massive auroras which encircle Jupiter's north pole. These emissions are the strongest in the solar system. Now we are going to try to figure out where the electrons come from that are generating them.\" The Juno spacecraft launched on Aug. 5, 2011, from Cape Canaveral, Florida and arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016.

The engine burn was intended to accelerate the spacecraft so it could orbit Jupiter in just 14 days, after which the main science phase of the mission was going to begin and the majority of the data taken. According to NASA, the Juno mission team decided to postpone the burn after two valves on the spacecraft's main engine failed to properly open. The spacecraft needs to be at its closest to Jupiter for the engine burn to achieve the proper acceleration and trajectory, so the team will have to wait until December 11, when Juno completes a full orbit at its current speed, to attempt to fire the engine again and insert into its trajectory for its main science mission. \"Telemetry indicates that two helium check valves that play an important role in the firing of the spacecraft's main engine did not operate as expected during a command sequence that was initiated yesterday,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager, in a NASA press release. \"The valves should have opened in a few seconds, but it took several minutes. We need to better understand this issue before moving forward with a burn of the main engine.\" It is not clear how the delay will affect Juno's overall mission going forward, considering the bombardment of radiation from Jupiter puts a hard limit on the spacecraft's lifetime. The mission is currently scheduled to end by impacting Juno into Jupiter in February 2018, and any delays to the main data-gathering portion of the mission could result in less information ultimately gleaned from the orbiter. The engine malfunction isn't all bad, however. The spacecraft was origionally scheduled to shut down most of its science instruments for the engine burn, but now it will be able to gather data as it makes a close pass of Jupiter on Wednesday. As Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission, points out, \"the mission is very flexible\" due to the fact that the close flybys are when the spacecraft is expected to learn the most. \"It is important to note that the orbital period does not affect the quality of the science that takes place during one of Juno's close flybys of Jupiter,\" he says. \"The data we collected during our first flyby on August 27 was a revelation, and I fully anticipate a similar result from Juno's October 19 flyby.\" It is still unclear what exactly caused the engine's helium check valves to open more slowly than anticipated, but hopefully the issue is not systemic of a larger problem on the big Jovian orbiter.

The probe went into a protective \"safe mode\" at 1:47 a.m. EDT this morning, preventing the spacecraft from gathering any data during today's highly anticipated second close flyby of the solar system's largest planet, NASA officials said. \"At the time safe mode was entered, the spacecraft was more than 13 hours from its closest approach to Jupiter,\" Juno project manager Rick Nybakken, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement today. \"We were still quite a ways from the planet's more intense radiation belts and magnetic fields,\" Nybakken added in the same statement. \"The spacecraft is healthy, and we are working our standard recovery procedure.\" Juno went into safe mode when a \"software-performance monitor\" caused the probe's onboard computer to reboot, NASA officials said. The issue is not related to an apparent problem with a set of valves in Juno's propulsion system, the officials added. The valve issue, which was publicly disclosed Friday, caused Juno's handlers to postpone the spacecraft's final engine burn. The maneuver was originally scheduled to take place during today's close Jupiter flyby; it would have shifted Juno from the spacecraft's current, highly elliptical, 53-day orbit to a 14-day path - the probe's final science orbit. The earliest this burn can now be performed is Dec. 11, during Juno's next Jupiter close encounter, NASA officials have said. The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and arrived at the gas giant this past July 4. Juno's main science goal involves mapping out Jupiter's internal structure, composition, gravity and magnetic fields in detail. This information should reveal key insights about how Jupiter, and the rest of the solar system, formed and evolved, mission team members have said. The original plan calls for Juno to circle Jupiter more than 30 times in the final 14-day orbit before the mission wraps up in February 2018. The spacecraft gathers most of its useful data during each orbit's close flyby; at most other times, Juno is quite far from Jupiter. Juno's first close flyby occurred on Aug. 27.

Still in a 53-day orbit, the spacecraft is not due to make another close pass until Feb. 2, 2017. The moment of closest approach to Jupiter's cloud tops occurred at precisely 9:04 a.m. PST on Sunday when the spacecraft was traveling at the breakneck speed of 129,000 miles per hour. The point of closest approach in Juno's orbit - known as \"perijove\" - brought the solar-powered spacecraft around 2,580 miles from the gas giant's atmosphere, allowing the mission to gather incredibly precise measurements of the planet's magnetic field, gravity and chemical composition. Seven of its eight instruments were operational during perijove and NASA expects the close encounter data to be beamed back to Earth over the next few days for analysis. According to the Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, this was the first time the mission was used to fully investigate Jupiter's internal structure by measuring the planet's gravitational field. \"We are looking forward to what Jupiter's gravity may reveal about the gas giant's past and its future,\" he said before Sunday's encounter. The only instrument not powered-up during perijove was the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, which was offline while the Juno team completed a software update that processes science data. JIRAM is expected to be fully operational for its fourth perijove in February. According to a NASA statement, mission scientists are still weighing up options as to how the spacecraft's 53-day orbit will affect operations. In October there were plans for Juno to carry out an engine burn that would have slowed the spacecraft, placing it into a shorter 14-day orbit. But during routine checks before the maneuver, a glitch was uncovered in two of the engine fuel valves. The decision was taken not to risk firing the spacecraft's main engines and instead commit to a longer 53-day loop around the Jovian system. Juno is expected to remain in orbit for 20 months, adding a wealth of information to our knowledge not only about how Jupiter came to be, but also add more detail to how other planets form in our solar system and around other stars. Though its sensitive electronics are protected in a special enclosure, Juno isn't expected to live much beyond its planned mission lifespan. The volume surrounding the gas giant is one of the most radioactive regions of the solar system, filled with ionizing particles that will eventually erode the spacecraft's systems. Before irreparable damage occurs, to protect Jupiter's moons from biological contamination from a crashing spacecraft, Juno will be commanded to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at the end of its mission, taking data as it burns up, ultimately becoming one with the planet's atmospheric gases.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016. Both satellites had to use backup thrusters to finish the job. Nybakken said those engine failures were unrelated to the issue aboard Juno, and engineers with JPL and Lockheed Martin - Juno's prime contractor - cleared the Leros 1b engine on the Jupiter orbiter in October, before encountering the sticky check valves. \"There were a couple of failures last fall that we looked into, and we were able to determine that those failures did not represent any sort of increased risk to Juno,\" Nybakken said. \"And after we completed that investigation, we were, in fact, planning to go ahead with this maneuver.\" One benefit of Juno's predicament is the higher 53-day orbit will keep the spacecraft away from the worst of Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which harbour hazards that mission designers believed would limit the mission's duration to some time in 2018. \"It turns out in the 53-day orbits, we cross the equator, where the radiation belts are, much farther out, so we have much less radiation dose,\" Nybakken said. \"Of course, with the orbits being larger, the dose as a function of time is much slower as well.\" Juno's next close pass by Jupiter is set for March 27, completing its fifth orbit of the planet since last year's arrival. \"Juno is healthy, its science instruments are fully operational, and the data and images we've received are nothing short of amazing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, in a statement. \"The decision to forego the burn is the right thing to do - preserving a valuable asset so that Juno can continue its exciting journey of discovery.\" The Juno mission is funded through July 2018, for a total of 12 science orbits, down from the 32 science orbits originally planned, NASA said in a statement. Juno's science team can then propose to continue the mission for another two years as part of NASA's senior review process, in which a panel of independent researchers recommend to the agency which of its planetary science missions should continue to receive federal funding. \"Juno is providing spectacular results, and we are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work,\" said Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The science will be just as spectacular as with our original plan.\" \"We're very excited about what we've seen so far, and every time we fly by the planet it's like Christmas time,\" Nybakken said. \"The data is stunning.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/02/21/nasa-juno-spacecraft-to-remain-in-current-orbit-around-jupiter/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Juno Spacecraft Malfunctioned While In Orbit Around Jupiter", "date": "2016-10-17", "content": "A main engine burn on the Juno spacecraft scheduled for Wednesday October 19 has been postponed until Juno completes another orbit around Jupiter, a trip that currently takes 53.4 days. The engine burn was intended to accelerate the spacecraft so it could orbit Jupiter in just 14 days, after which the main science phase of the mission was going to begin and the majority of the data taken. According to NASA, the Juno mission team decided to postpone the burn after two valves on the spacecraft's main engine failed to properly open. The spacecraft needs to be at its closest to Jupiter for the engine burn to achieve the proper acceleration and trajectory, so the team will have to wait until December 11, when Juno completes a full orbit at its current speed, to attempt to fire the engine again and insert into its trajectory for its main science mission. \"Telemetry indicates that two helium check valves that play an important role in the firing of the spacecraft's main engine did not operate as expected during a command sequence that was initiated yesterday,\" said Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager, in a NASA press release. \"The valves should have opened in a few seconds, but it took several minutes. We need to better understand this issue before moving forward with a burn of the main engine.\" It is not clear how the delay will affect Juno's overall mission going forward, considering the bombardment of radiation from Jupiter puts a hard limit on the spacecraft's lifetime. The mission is currently scheduled to end by impacting Juno into Jupiter in February 2018, and any delays to the main data-gathering portion of the mission could result in less information ultimately gleaned from the orbiter. The engine malfunction isn't all bad, however. The spacecraft was origionally scheduled to shut down most of its science instruments for the engine burn, but now it will be able to gather data as it makes a close pass of Jupiter on Wednesday. As Scott Bolton, principal investigator for the Juno mission, points out, \"the mission is very flexible\" due to the fact that the close flybys are when the spacecraft is expected to learn the most. \"It is important to note that the orbital period does not affect the quality of the science that takes place during one of Juno's close flybys of Jupiter,\" he says. \"The data we collected during our first flyby on August 27 was a revelation, and I fully anticipate a similar result from Juno's October 19 flyby.\" It is still unclear what exactly caused the engine's helium check valves to open more slowly than anticipated, but hopefully the issue is not systemic of a larger problem on the big Jovian orbiter.

The probe went into a protective \"safe mode\" at 1:47 a.m. EDT this morning, preventing the spacecraft from gathering any data during today's highly anticipated second close flyby of the solar system's largest planet, NASA officials said. \"At the time safe mode was entered, the spacecraft was more than 13 hours from its closest approach to Jupiter,\" Juno project manager Rick Nybakken, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement today. \"We were still quite a ways from the planet's more intense radiation belts and magnetic fields,\" Nybakken added in the same statement. \"The spacecraft is healthy, and we are working our standard recovery procedure.\" Juno went into safe mode when a \"software-performance monitor\" caused the probe's onboard computer to reboot, NASA officials said. The issue is not related to an apparent problem with a set of valves in Juno's propulsion system, the officials added. The valve issue, which was publicly disclosed Friday, caused Juno's handlers to postpone the spacecraft's final engine burn. The maneuver was originally scheduled to take place during today's close Jupiter flyby; it would have shifted Juno from the spacecraft's current, highly elliptical, 53-day orbit to a 14-day path - the probe's final science orbit. The earliest this burn can now be performed is Dec. 11, during Juno's next Jupiter close encounter, NASA officials have said. The $1.1 billion Juno mission launched in August 2011 and arrived at the gas giant this past July 4. Juno's main science goal involves mapping out Jupiter's internal structure, composition, gravity and magnetic fields in detail. This information should reveal key insights about how Jupiter, and the rest of the solar system, formed and evolved, mission team members have said. The original plan calls for Juno to circle Jupiter more than 30 times in the final 14-day orbit before the mission wraps up in February 2018. The spacecraft gathers most of its useful data during each orbit's close flyby; at most other times, Juno is quite far from Jupiter. Juno's first close flyby occurred on Aug. 27.

Still in a 53-day orbit, the spacecraft is not due to make another close pass until Feb. 2, 2017. The moment of closest approach to Jupiter's cloud tops occurred at precisely 9:04 a.m. PST on Sunday when the spacecraft was traveling at the breakneck speed of 129,000 miles per hour. The point of closest approach in Juno's orbit - known as \"perijove\" - brought the solar-powered spacecraft around 2,580 miles from the gas giant's atmosphere, allowing the mission to gather incredibly precise measurements of the planet's magnetic field, gravity and chemical composition. Seven of its eight instruments were operational during perijove and NASA expects the close encounter data to be beamed back to Earth over the next few days for analysis. According to the Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, this was the first time the mission was used to fully investigate Jupiter's internal structure by measuring the planet's gravitational field. \"We are looking forward to what Jupiter's gravity may reveal about the gas giant's past and its future,\" he said before Sunday's encounter. The only instrument not powered-up during perijove was the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, which was offline while the Juno team completed a software update that processes science data. JIRAM is expected to be fully operational for its fourth perijove in February. According to a NASA statement, mission scientists are still weighing up options as to how the spacecraft's 53-day orbit will affect operations. In October there were plans for Juno to carry out an engine burn that would have slowed the spacecraft, placing it into a shorter 14-day orbit. But during routine checks before the maneuver, a glitch was uncovered in two of the engine fuel valves. The decision was taken not to risk firing the spacecraft's main engines and instead commit to a longer 53-day loop around the Jovian system. Juno is expected to remain in orbit for 20 months, adding a wealth of information to our knowledge not only about how Jupiter came to be, but also add more detail to how other planets form in our solar system and around other stars. Though its sensitive electronics are protected in a special enclosure, Juno isn't expected to live much beyond its planned mission lifespan. The volume surrounding the gas giant is one of the most radioactive regions of the solar system, filled with ionizing particles that will eventually erode the spacecraft's systems. Before irreparable damage occurs, to protect Jupiter's moons from biological contamination from a crashing spacecraft, Juno will be commanded to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at the end of its mission, taking data as it burns up, ultimately becoming one with the planet's atmospheric gases.

A series of round, white storms spans across this crescent view of Jupiter. In total, Jupiter currently has eight of these storms, which are known as the \"string of pearls,\" NASA officials said.

Launched in 2011, Juno passed by the Earth in October 2013 to pick up some energy and fling itself to Jupiter. Once it arrived, it burned its main engine for over a half hour, slowing enough to place itself into a highly elongated orbit that took it over Jupiter's poles. The orbital burn went perfectly, but a potentially serious problem arose. In October, after two complete orbits, the main engine was scheduled to fire once again. It was supposed to change Juno's orbit from the initial looping trajectory that took it as close as 4,200 kilometers over Jupiter's poles to over eight million kilometers out, to the new \"science orbit\" that was supposed to be only 14 days long. However, just before the burn, telemetry indicated that a pair of valves had failed to work properly. The orbit reduction maneuver was at first postponed until Dec. 11, but then it was decided to postpone it again until at least the next perijove, which is in February 2017. The spacecraft is working, and collecting good data, so engineers decided it would be better to work the problem longer to make as sure as they can that the maneuver will be performed properly. The image above is from a few hours after the last pass in December, called Perijove 3. It shows the south pole of Jupiter to the bottom, and from this vantage we're looking \"up\" at the Great Red Spot. The smaller red storm to the lower right is called Oval BA, but it's hardly small: It's about the same diameter as Earth! It formed in 2000 when three smaller storms merged. The image was processed by master planetary photographer Damian Peach, and it's so, well, _odd_. Jupiter orbits the Sun in roughly the same plane as Earth, and its rotational axis is pretty much perpendicular to that plane. That means, from Earth, we tend to be looking down on Jupiter's equator, with the belts and zones stretching across horizontally. From this angle everything is tilty; it's a view we cannot get from Earth. If you want to see Jupiter this way, you have to go there. Which is another reason Juno is so cool. Another Juno image Peach put together from the raw data graced the Astronomy Picture of the Day site recently as well. This last pass of Jupiter by Juno was the first to take gravity data. One of the main purposes of the Juno mission is to map the interior of Jupiter. As it passes very close to the planet, the layers of material beneath the surface of the planet pull on the spacecraft differently, affecting its orbital trajectory minutely. These changes can be used to determine the density of those layers, which in turn reveals the internal structure of Jupiter. Weirdly, it's not clear if Jupiter has a distinct core or not ; different physical models for how it formed yield different results. Juno may be able to help scientists determine which is correct. In the meantime, Juno will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetic field, returning information about that as well. Hopefully, over the next few weeks scientists and engineers will be more confident they can put Juno into the correct science orbit. Until then, it's still doing good work, and we can enjoy the literally unearthly view.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time. The spacecraft was gliding about 63,400 miles above the clouds, offering up a perfect vantage point of the pole.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016. Both satellites had to use backup thrusters to finish the job. Nybakken said those engine failures were unrelated to the issue aboard Juno, and engineers with JPL and Lockheed Martin - Juno's prime contractor - cleared the Leros 1b engine on the Jupiter orbiter in October, before encountering the sticky check valves. \"There were a couple of failures last fall that we looked into, and we were able to determine that those failures did not represent any sort of increased risk to Juno,\" Nybakken said. \"And after we completed that investigation, we were, in fact, planning to go ahead with this maneuver.\" One benefit of Juno's predicament is the higher 53-day orbit will keep the spacecraft away from the worst of Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which harbour hazards that mission designers believed would limit the mission's duration to some time in 2018. \"It turns out in the 53-day orbits, we cross the equator, where the radiation belts are, much farther out, so we have much less radiation dose,\" Nybakken said. \"Of course, with the orbits being larger, the dose as a function of time is much slower as well.\" Juno's next close pass by Jupiter is set for March 27, completing its fifth orbit of the planet since last year's arrival. \"Juno is healthy, its science instruments are fully operational, and the data and images we've received are nothing short of amazing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, in a statement. \"The decision to forego the burn is the right thing to do - preserving a valuable asset so that Juno can continue its exciting journey of discovery.\" The Juno mission is funded through July 2018, for a total of 12 science orbits, down from the 32 science orbits originally planned, NASA said in a statement.

The point of closest approach in Juno's orbit - known as \"perijove\" - brought the solar-powered spacecraft around 2,580 miles from the gas giant's atmosphere, allowing the mission to gather incredibly precise measurements of the planet's magnetic field, gravity and chemical composition. Seven of its eight instruments were operational during perijove and NASA expects the close encounter data to be beamed back to Earth over the next few days for analysis. According to the Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, this was the first time the mission was used to fully investigate Jupiter's internal structure by measuring the planet's gravitational field. \"We are looking forward to what Jupiter's gravity may reveal about the gas giant's past and its future,\" he said before Sunday's encounter. The only instrument not powered-up during perijove was the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, which was offline while the Juno team completed a software update that processes science data. JIRAM is expected to be fully operational for its fourth perijove in February.

In October there were plans for Juno to carry out an engine burn that would have slowed the spacecraft, placing it into a shorter 14-day orbit. But during routine checks before the maneuver, a glitch was uncovered in two of the engine fuel valves. The decision was taken not to risk firing the spacecraft's main engines and instead commit to a longer 53-day loop around the Jovian system. Juno is expected to remain in orbit for 20 months, adding a wealth of information to our knowledge not only about how Jupiter came to be, but also add more detail to how other planets form in our solar system and around other stars. Though its sensitive electronics are protected in a special enclosure, Juno isn't expected to live much beyond its planned mission lifespan. The volume surrounding the gas giant is one of the most radioactive regions of the solar system, filled with ionizing particles that will eventually erode the spacecraft's systems. Before irreparable damage occurs, to protect Jupiter's moons from biological contamination from a crashing spacecraft, Juno will be commanded to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at the end of its mission, taking data as it burns up, ultimately becoming one with the planet's atmospheric gases.

Launched in 2011, Juno passed by the Earth in October 2013 to pick up some energy and fling itself to Jupiter. Once it arrived, it burned its main engine for over a half hour, slowing enough to place itself into a highly elongated orbit that took it over Jupiter's poles. The orbital burn went perfectly, but a potentially serious problem arose. In October, after two complete orbits, the main engine was scheduled to fire once again. It was supposed to change Juno's orbit from the initial looping trajectory that took it as close as 4,200 kilometers over Jupiter's poles to over eight million kilometers out, to the new \"science orbit\" that was supposed to be only 14 days long. However, just before the burn, telemetry indicated that a pair of valves had failed to work properly. The orbit reduction maneuver was at first postponed until Dec. 11, but then it was decided to postpone it again until at least the next perijove, which is in February 2017. The spacecraft is working, and collecting good data, so engineers decided it would be better to work the problem longer to make as sure as they can that the maneuver will be performed properly. The image above is from a few hours after the last pass in December, called Perijove 3. It shows the south pole of Jupiter to the bottom, and from this vantage we're looking \"up\" at the Great Red Spot. The smaller red storm to the lower right is called Oval BA, but it's hardly small: It's about the same diameter as Earth! It formed in 2000 when three smaller storms merged. The image was processed by master planetary photographer Damian Peach, and it's so, well, _odd_. Jupiter orbits the Sun in roughly the same plane as Earth, and its rotational axis is pretty much perpendicular to that plane. That means, from Earth, we tend to be looking down on Jupiter's equator, with the belts and zones stretching across horizontally. From this angle everything is tilty; it's a view we cannot get from Earth. If you want to see Jupiter this way, you have to go there. Which is another reason Juno is so cool. Another Juno image Peach put together from the raw data graced the Astronomy Picture of the Day site recently as well. This last pass of Jupiter by Juno was the first to take gravity data. One of the main purposes of the Juno mission is to map the interior of Jupiter. As it passes very close to the planet, the layers of material beneath the surface of the planet pull on the spacecraft differently, affecting its orbital trajectory minutely. These changes can be used to determine the density of those layers, which in turn reveals the internal structure of Jupiter. Weirdly, it's not clear if Jupiter has a distinct core or not ; different physical models for how it formed yield different results. Juno may be able to help scientists determine which is correct. In the meantime, Juno will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetic field, returning information about that as well. Hopefully, over the next few weeks scientists and engineers will be more confident they can put Juno into the correct science orbit. Until then, it's still doing good work, and we can enjoy the literally unearthly view.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time. The spacecraft was gliding about 63,400 miles above the clouds, offering up a perfect vantage point of the pole. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since July 5, 2016 when it first made its orbital insertion into the Jovian system. It was an astonishing feat: The spacecraft had to endure a 1.75 billion mile journey from Earth and then swerve its way into the orbit with little room for error, all while battling one of the most destructive radiation environments in the solar system. Since then, scientists have received beautiful images of the planet's pearls and north pole. NASA scientists are saying that the story of Jupiter is the \"story of the solar system,\" because it has long been theorized that Jupiter was the first planet to form around the sun. With the help of Juno, they hope to map the planet's magnetic field, learn about its inner core composition, and measure the chemical makeup of the dense clouds, all in an effort to understand how gas giants form.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016.

Juno is expected to remain in orbit for 20 months, adding a wealth of information to our knowledge not only about how Jupiter came to be, but also add more detail to how other planets form in our solar system and around other stars. Though its sensitive electronics are protected in a special enclosure, Juno isn't expected to live much beyond its planned mission lifespan. The volume surrounding the gas giant is one of the most radioactive regions of the solar system, filled with ionizing particles that will eventually erode the spacecraft's systems. Before irreparable damage occurs, to protect Jupiter's moons from biological contamination from a crashing spacecraft, Juno will be commanded to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at the end of its mission, taking data as it burns up, ultimately becoming one with the planet's atmospheric gases.

Launched in 2011, Juno passed by the Earth in October 2013 to pick up some energy and fling itself to Jupiter. Once it arrived, it burned its main engine for over a half hour, slowing enough to place itself into a highly elongated orbit that took it over Jupiter's poles. The orbital burn went perfectly, but a potentially serious problem arose. In October, after two complete orbits, the main engine was scheduled to fire once again. It was supposed to change Juno's orbit from the initial looping trajectory that took it as close as 4,200 kilometers over Jupiter's poles to over eight million kilometers out, to the new \"science orbit\" that was supposed to be only 14 days long. However, just before the burn, telemetry indicated that a pair of valves had failed to work properly. The orbit reduction maneuver was at first postponed until Dec. 11, but then it was decided to postpone it again until at least the next perijove, which is in February 2017. The spacecraft is working, and collecting good data, so engineers decided it would be better to work the problem longer to make as sure as they can that the maneuver will be performed properly. The image above is from a few hours after the last pass in December, called Perijove 3. It shows the south pole of Jupiter to the bottom, and from this vantage we're looking \"up\" at the Great Red Spot. The smaller red storm to the lower right is called Oval BA, but it's hardly small: It's about the same diameter as Earth! It formed in 2000 when three smaller storms merged. The image was processed by master planetary photographer Damian Peach, and it's so, well, _odd_. Jupiter orbits the Sun in roughly the same plane as Earth, and its rotational axis is pretty much perpendicular to that plane. That means, from Earth, we tend to be looking down on Jupiter's equator, with the belts and zones stretching across horizontally. From this angle everything is tilty; it's a view we cannot get from Earth. If you want to see Jupiter this way, you have to go there. Which is another reason Juno is so cool. Another Juno image Peach put together from the raw data graced the Astronomy Picture of the Day site recently as well. This last pass of Jupiter by Juno was the first to take gravity data. One of the main purposes of the Juno mission is to map the interior of Jupiter. As it passes very close to the planet, the layers of material beneath the surface of the planet pull on the spacecraft differently, affecting its orbital trajectory minutely. These changes can be used to determine the density of those layers, which in turn reveals the internal structure of Jupiter. Weirdly, it's not clear if Jupiter has a distinct core or not ; different physical models for how it formed yield different results. Juno may be able to help scientists determine which is correct. In the meantime, Juno will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetic field, returning information about that as well. Hopefully, over the next few weeks scientists and engineers will be more confident they can put Juno into the correct science orbit. Until then, it's still doing good work, and we can enjoy the literally unearthly view.

At closest approach, Juno was 2,670 miles above the cloud tops. All nine science instruments, including the colour camera, were operating during the flyby and the data has been downloading this week. Juno's mission is to make detailed measurements of the amount of water in Jupiter's atmosphere.

During the third flyby in October 2016, the onboard computer rebooted unexpectedly, resulting in the loss of all science data.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time. The spacecraft was gliding about 63,400 miles above the clouds, offering up a perfect vantage point of the pole. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since July 5, 2016 when it first made its orbital insertion into the Jovian system. It was an astonishing feat: The spacecraft had to endure a 1.75 billion mile journey from Earth and then swerve its way into the orbit with little room for error, all while battling one of the most destructive radiation environments in the solar system. Since then, scientists have received beautiful images of the planet's pearls and north pole. NASA scientists are saying that the story of Jupiter is the \"story of the solar system,\" because it has long been theorized that Jupiter was the first planet to form around the sun. With the help of Juno, they hope to map the planet's magnetic field, learn about its inner core composition, and measure the chemical makeup of the dense clouds, all in an effort to understand how gas giants form.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016. Both satellites had to use backup thrusters to finish the job. Nybakken said those engine failures were unrelated to the issue aboard Juno, and engineers with JPL and Lockheed Martin - Juno's prime contractor - cleared the Leros 1b engine on the Jupiter orbiter in October, before encountering the sticky check valves. \"There were a couple of failures last fall that we looked into, and we were able to determine that those failures did not represent any sort of increased risk to Juno,\" Nybakken said. \"And after we completed that investigation, we were, in fact, planning to go ahead with this maneuver.\" One benefit of Juno's predicament is the higher 53-day orbit will keep the spacecraft away from the worst of Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which harbour hazards that mission designers believed would limit the mission's duration to some time in 2018. \"It turns out in the 53-day orbits, we cross the equator, where the radiation belts are, much farther out, so we have much less radiation dose,\" Nybakken said. \"Of course, with the orbits being larger, the dose as a function of time is much slower as well.\" Juno's next close pass by Jupiter is set for March 27, completing its fifth orbit of the planet since last year's arrival. \"Juno is healthy, its science instruments are fully operational, and the data and images we've received are nothing short of amazing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, in a statement. \"The decision to forego the burn is the right thing to do - preserving a valuable asset so that Juno can continue its exciting journey of discovery.\" The Juno mission is funded through July 2018, for a total of 12 science orbits, down from the 32 science orbits originally planned, NASA said in a statement. Juno's science team can then propose to continue the mission for another two years as part of NASA's senior review process, in which a panel of independent researchers recommend to the agency which of its planetary science missions should continue to receive federal funding. \"Juno is providing spectacular results, and we are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work,\" said Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The science will be just as spectacular as with our original plan.\" \"We're very excited about what we've seen so far, and every time we fly by the planet it's like Christmas time,\" Nybakken said. \"The data is stunning.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/02/21/nasa-juno-spacecraft-to-remain-in-current-orbit-around-jupiter/"}, {"title": "Juno Spacecraft Skims Jupiter's Cloud Tops in Its 5th Flyby", "date": "2017-03-27", "content": "NASA's Juno spacecraft whizzed closely by Jupiter today in its fifth flyby of the gas giant.

The first data from the Juno probe was presented at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union. The new findings from Juno are already challenging our understanding of the largest planet in the solar system. Previous observations of Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter was made mostly of a uniform interior with a solid core of metallic hydrogen. New gravitational data from Juno call that into question. It now appears that Jupiter's internal layers are not uniform at all, but instead regularly mix together. Another important discovery is that Jupiter's magnetic field is actually much more powerful than previously believed. Jupiter's magnetic field was already known as the largest structure in the solar system, stretching more than 4 million miles in multiple directions. It was thought to be 10 to 20 times as powerful as Earth's magnetic field. But Juno's measurements seem to indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is even stronger than that. Results from the spacecraft suggest that the field might be almost twice as strong as previously believed. In addition, the field appears to be uneven in places, which means that unlike the Earth, Jupiter's magnetic field is generated closer to the surface rather than deep near the core. All of this new information comes from only Juno's first five orbits of Jupiter. The craft has at least seven more orbits before the budgeted end of mission in July 2018, but depending on how the spacecraft is doing, Juno could operate for longer than that. There's certainly still plenty more to discover about Jupiter.

The solar-powered spacecraft, armored with a titanium vault to shield its sensitive electronics from radiation, passed around 2,200 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops around 0600 GMT Friday. NASA reported the probe completed the flyby as planned, with all of its science instruments and camera operating. Juno has logged 63.5 million miles since arriving in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, ending a nearly five-year trip from Earth. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. Juno has passed inside Jupiter's radiation belts seven times, including the spacecraft's arrival maneuver July 4, when the probe fired its main engine to enter orbit. Its instruments were deactivated during that encounter to focus on the make-or-break engine burn. The spacecraft entered safe mode just before a flyby in October, and it gathered no science data during that approach. The Juno mission is designed to study Jupiter's intense magnetic field and investigate the gas giant's deep interior structure, revealing insights about its atmosphere and probing for a rocky core. The Juno spacecraft is in an oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter that takes it around the planet once ever 53 days. NASA decided in February to forego an engine burn to move Juno into a closer 14-day orbit after engineers detected a problem with check valves inside the craft's propulsion system last year. Juno's mission will last until at least February 2018, enough time to make 11 science orbits around Jupiter, instead of the 32 laps originally planned. But NASA could extend the mission another three years to give Juno more flybys near Jupiter. The best data on Jupiter is captured when Juno is closest to the planet, but the 53-day orbit also gives scientists other opportunities that would not have been available in the mission's original flight plan. Scientists say the higher orbit allows Juno to move through Jupiter's magnetotail, the part of the magnetic field bubble around the planet that is blown back like a comet's tail by the solar wind. Such a perspective will allow Juno's science team to study the complex network of magnetic field lines around Jupiter, and help sort out the drivers behind Jupiter's auroras, separating auroras induced by internal convection and the solar wind.

This takes it below the frozen ammonia cloud top that we usually see in visible light images of the planet, with atmospheric pressures up to 240 times greater than on Earth's surface. Astronomers have already studied the rich and dynamic Jovian weather system since the first space observations of its atmospheric composition and profiles from the Voyager probes. But the previous deepest atmospheric measurements could be considered skin-deep when compared with Juno's latest observations. Only in one specific area of the planet was the atmosphere studied up to a depth of 100km. That was in 1995, when the Galileo probe descended into a so- called \"hot spot\", a dark region between ammonia clouds that glows strongly in infrared light. Galileo's probe measurements found this region surprisingly devoid of any water vapour clouds, as would have been expected below ammonia cloud. Now, for the first time Juno's radiometry allows a global view of deep atmosphere, showing that the banded pattern extends deeply below the visible tops of the clouds. The measurements of ammonia content in these deep layers reveals an unexpected and dynamic mixing similar to the Hadley cells in Earth's atmosphere. This is where masses of hot air rise in equatorial regions and move polewards, before plummeting in the tropics and returning towards the Equator close to Earth's surface. One of the goals of the Juno mission was to measure water content in the Jovian atmosphere, which has implications for understanding Solar System formation. So far Juno has confirmed that the hot spots are indeed very dry regions of descending air with humidity less than 10%. Since the discovery of strong radio emission from Jupiter in the 1950s - implying the existence of a magnetic field around the planet - every new space mission has slowly added to the ever so complex picture of the Jovian magnetosphere. The Juno mission is designed to make an unprecedented leap forward in the understanding magnetic field generation processes and also to make a detailed map of the planet's magnetosphere. One of the most spectacular consequences of interaction between the magnetosphere and atmosphere of a planet is an auroral display, similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth. Jupiter's 'southern lights' as captured by Juno. The JADE, JEDI and Waves instruments placed on Juno are used to measure the energies of particles that plummet into the polar regions and smash into atmospheric gases, mainly hydrogen that emits radiation, which we see as aurora. The ultraviolet and infrared maps of this emission allow us to measure how the top layers of the Jovian atmosphere heat up and cool, as well as to understand the dynamics of the magnetosphere. But why is the magnetosphere worth our attention? Planetary magnetospheres act like protective shields that deflect space radiation harmful to life. Only planets that can produce magnetic fields have magnetospheres and, lucky for us, Earth has one too. But besides Earth, only the giant planets in our Solar System have appreciable magnetospheres. Juno measured magnetic field in regions closer to Jupiter than ever before, and the results were very different than the predictions from the previously used models. The observed magnetic fields are stronger and also more spatially variable than previously assumed. Since it is understood that a magnetic field is formed in the cores of planets via dynamo process, this suggests that magnetic field formation region is actually much larger than expected. This, in turn, in combination with Juno's measurements of gravitational field around the planet, tells us that our previous ideas about the core of the planet may have to be revised. For example, the textbook images of the rather compact core of metallic hydrogen is not consistent with Juno observations. The metallic hydrogen core could be as large as the half of Jupiter's radius. Back on Earth. During Juno's closest approach to Jupiter - while the probe makes critical observations of Jovian weather, magnetism and gravity - some of the largest telescopes on Earth support the mission with imaging and spectroscopy of the giant planet. Although the spatial resolution of such observations is no match for imaging from Juno, ground telescopes have a global view of the planet. During the sixth approach of Juno to the planet on May 19, some of us were using telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. I used a high-resolution infrared spectroscope at the Gemini telescope to map the full extend of auroral hydrogen emission around both planetary poles, while my colleagues were taking infrared images of the same regions at the Subaru telescope. It is exciting to participate in this critical ground base support of the Juno mission, when the international astronomical community joins for a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a very unique view of our giant neighbour. Here I am in front of the terminals to the Gemini Telescope, in Hawaii. Jen Miller It is also amazing to have a support from many amateur astronomy groups that joined in observations of visible light from the planet. The raw images from the Juno's visible light camera are available on the Juno website for public use. People are invited to process such images and submit their work for viewing. Juno's unique orbit allows for making spectacular images of regions not visited in previous missions. The probe also comes much better equipped than some of its predecessors to visit the planet. The first results from the mission are already suggesting future revisions, or at least adjustments to models of Jupiter's atmosphere, interior and magnetism. This unique study of our largest giant planet will hopefully bear implications on the understanding of the formation and composition of similar but much hotter giant planets discovered around other stars.

A series of round, white storms spans across this crescent view of Jupiter. In total, Jupiter currently has eight of these storms, which are known as the \"string of pearls,\" NASA officials said. NASA has been releasing all of the image data captured by Juno's JunoCam instrument to the public, so that citizen scientists can process the photos into stunning new views. This newly processed photo, which NASA released Friday, was made by Roman Tkachenko using a JunoCam photo taken on Dec. 11, 2016, during the spacecraft's most recent close flyby of Jupiter.

Launched in 2011, Juno passed by the Earth in October 2013 to pick up some energy and fling itself to Jupiter. Once it arrived, it burned its main engine for over a half hour, slowing enough to place itself into a highly elongated orbit that took it over Jupiter's poles. The orbital burn went perfectly, but a potentially serious problem arose. In October, after two complete orbits, the main engine was scheduled to fire once again. It was supposed to change Juno's orbit from the initial looping trajectory that took it as close as 4,200 kilometers over Jupiter's poles to over eight million kilometers out, to the new \"science orbit\" that was supposed to be only 14 days long. However, just before the burn, telemetry indicated that a pair of valves had failed to work properly. The orbit reduction maneuver was at first postponed until Dec. 11, but then it was decided to postpone it again until at least the next perijove, which is in February 2017. The spacecraft is working, and collecting good data, so engineers decided it would be better to work the problem longer to make as sure as they can that the maneuver will be performed properly. The image above is from a few hours after the last pass in December, called Perijove 3. It shows the south pole of Jupiter to the bottom, and from this vantage we're looking \"up\" at the Great Red Spot. The smaller red storm to the lower right is called Oval BA, but it's hardly small: It's about the same diameter as Earth! It formed in 2000 when three smaller storms merged. The image was processed by master planetary photographer Damian Peach, and it's so, well, _odd_. Jupiter orbits the Sun in roughly the same plane as Earth, and its rotational axis is pretty much perpendicular to that plane. That means, from Earth, we tend to be looking down on Jupiter's equator, with the belts and zones stretching across horizontally. From this angle everything is tilty; it's a view we cannot get from Earth. If you want to see Jupiter this way, you have to go there. Which is another reason Juno is so cool. Another Juno image Peach put together from the raw data graced the Astronomy Picture of the Day site recently as well. This last pass of Jupiter by Juno was the first to take gravity data. One of the main purposes of the Juno mission is to map the interior of Jupiter. As it passes very close to the planet, the layers of material beneath the surface of the planet pull on the spacecraft differently, affecting its orbital trajectory minutely. These changes can be used to determine the density of those layers, which in turn reveals the internal structure of Jupiter. Weirdly, it's not clear if Jupiter has a distinct core or not ; different physical models for how it formed yield different results. Juno may be able to help scientists determine which is correct. In the meantime, Juno will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetic field, returning information about that as well. Hopefully, over the next few weeks scientists and engineers will be more confident they can put Juno into the correct science orbit. Until then, it's still doing good work, and we can enjoy the literally unearthly view.

At closest approach, Juno was 2,670 miles above the cloud tops. All nine science instruments, including the colour camera, were operating during the flyby and the data has been downloading this week. Juno's mission is to make detailed measurements of the amount of water in Jupiter's atmosphere.

During the third flyby in October 2016, the onboard computer rebooted unexpectedly, resulting in the loss of all science data. The spacecraft also missed out on an engine burn that would have put it into a shorter orbit. This was because of an unrelated problem involving sticky valves in the propulsion system.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time. The spacecraft was gliding about 63,400 miles above the clouds, offering up a perfect vantage point of the pole. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since July 5, 2016 when it first made its orbital insertion into the Jovian system. It was an astonishing feat: The spacecraft had to endure a 1.75 billion mile journey from Earth and then swerve its way into the orbit with little room for error, all while battling one of the most destructive radiation environments in the solar system. Since then, scientists have received beautiful images of the planet's pearls and north pole. NASA scientists are saying that the story of Jupiter is the \"story of the solar system,\" because it has long been theorized that Jupiter was the first planet to form around the sun. With the help of Juno, they hope to map the planet's magnetic field, learn about its inner core composition, and measure the chemical makeup of the dense clouds, all in an effort to understand how gas giants form.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016. Both satellites had to use backup thrusters to finish the job. Nybakken said those engine failures were unrelated to the issue aboard Juno, and engineers with JPL and Lockheed Martin - Juno's prime contractor - cleared the Leros 1b engine on the Jupiter orbiter in October, before encountering the sticky check valves. \"There were a couple of failures last fall that we looked into, and we were able to determine that those failures did not represent any sort of increased risk to Juno,\" Nybakken said. \"And after we completed that investigation, we were, in fact, planning to go ahead with this maneuver.\" One benefit of Juno's predicament is the higher 53-day orbit will keep the spacecraft away from the worst of Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which harbour hazards that mission designers believed would limit the mission's duration to some time in 2018. \"It turns out in the 53-day orbits, we cross the equator, where the radiation belts are, much farther out, so we have much less radiation dose,\" Nybakken said. \"Of course, with the orbits being larger, the dose as a function of time is much slower as well.\" Juno's next close pass by Jupiter is set for March 27, completing its fifth orbit of the planet since last year's arrival. \"Juno is healthy, its science instruments are fully operational, and the data and images we've received are nothing short of amazing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, in a statement. \"The decision to forego the burn is the right thing to do - preserving a valuable asset so that Juno can continue its exciting journey of discovery.\" The Juno mission is funded through July 2018, for a total of 12 science orbits, down from the 32 science orbits originally planned, NASA said in a statement. Juno's science team can then propose to continue the mission for another two years as part of NASA's senior review process, in which a panel of independent researchers recommend to the agency which of its planetary science missions should continue to receive federal funding. \"Juno is providing spectacular results, and we are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work,\" said Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The science will be just as spectacular as with our original plan.\" \"We're very excited about what we've seen so far, and every time we fly by the planet it's like Christmas time,\" Nybakken said. \"The data is stunning.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/02/21/nasa-juno-spacecraft-to-remain-in-current-orbit-around-jupiter/"}, {"title": "Juno Spacecraft Skims Jupiter's Cloud Tops in Its 5th Flyby", "date": "2017-03-27", "content": "NASA's Juno spacecraft whizzed closely by Jupiter today in its fifth flyby of the gas giant.

The first data from the Juno probe was presented at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union. The new findings from Juno are already challenging our understanding of the largest planet in the solar system. Previous observations of Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter was made mostly of a uniform interior with a solid core of metallic hydrogen. New gravitational data from Juno call that into question. It now appears that Jupiter's internal layers are not uniform at all, but instead regularly mix together. Another important discovery is that Jupiter's magnetic field is actually much more powerful than previously believed. Jupiter's magnetic field was already known as the largest structure in the solar system, stretching more than 4 million miles in multiple directions. It was thought to be 10 to 20 times as powerful as Earth's magnetic field. But Juno's measurements seem to indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is even stronger than that. Results from the spacecraft suggest that the field might be almost twice as strong as previously believed. In addition, the field appears to be uneven in places, which means that unlike the Earth, Jupiter's magnetic field is generated closer to the surface rather than deep near the core. All of this new information comes from only Juno's first five orbits of Jupiter. The craft has at least seven more orbits before the budgeted end of mission in July 2018, but depending on how the spacecraft is doing, Juno could operate for longer than that. There's certainly still plenty more to discover about Jupiter.

The orbiter's JunoCam imager was also turned on during Friday's flyby to capture more scans of Jupiter's swirling clouds to be stitched together and edited by the mission's amateur fanbase. The solar-powered spacecraft, armored with a titanium vault to shield its sensitive electronics from radiation, passed around 2,200 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops around 0600 GMT Friday. NASA reported the probe completed the flyby as planned, with all of its science instruments and camera operating. Juno has logged 63.5 million miles since arriving in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, ending a nearly five-year trip from Earth. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. Juno has passed inside Jupiter's radiation belts seven times, including the spacecraft's arrival maneuver July 4, when the probe fired its main engine to enter orbit. Its instruments were deactivated during that encounter to focus on the make-or-break engine burn. The spacecraft entered safe mode just before a flyby in October, and it gathered no science data during that approach. The Juno mission is designed to study Jupiter's intense magnetic field and investigate the gas giant's deep interior structure, revealing insights about its atmosphere and probing for a rocky core. The Juno spacecraft is in an oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter that takes it around the planet once ever 53 days. NASA decided in February to forego an engine burn to move Juno into a closer 14-day orbit after engineers detected a problem with check valves inside the craft's propulsion system last year. Juno's mission will last until at least February 2018, enough time to make 11 science orbits around Jupiter, instead of the 32 laps originally planned. But NASA could extend the mission another three years to give Juno more flybys near Jupiter. The best data on Jupiter is captured when Juno is closest to the planet, but the 53-day orbit also gives scientists other opportunities that would not have been available in the mission's original flight plan. Scientists say the higher orbit allows Juno to move through Jupiter's magnetotail, the part of the magnetic field bubble around the planet that is blown back like a comet's tail by the solar wind.

Juno's advantage relies on an orbit that allows it to come within 3,100 miles of the planet's cloud tops. \"We knew, going in, that Jupiter would throw us some curves,\" said Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio in press release. \"But now that we are here we are finding that Jupiter can throw the heat, as well as knuckleballs and sliders.

Many of the findings were unexpected. Since July 2016, Juno has been revolving around Jupiter - the largest planet in our Solar System - in a highly elongated, 53-day orbit. This allows a clear view of its poles while the spacecraft ducks in and out of the strong radiation regions that surround the planet. The first results of Juno observations were released in two studies published in Science last week. They reveal a very new picture of the Jovian interior, its atmosphere and magnetosphere. Of course it's not only the observations from Juno that are helping us better understand Jupiter. Simultaneous monitoring from ground based telescopes such as the ones on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, where I was recently, are also helping. Here I am on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Marcel de Vriend But first to the latest Juno discoveries. The atmosphere Juno's multiple passes over polar regions of the planet revealed stunning images of swirling cyclones, some almost as large as Earth. There is no banded structure visible in these images, in contrast to Jupiter's equatorial regions. There is no hexagon or a central vortex in the southern polar region like the one that the Cassini probe observed in Saturn's north polar atmosphere. It also appears that a high-altitude thin cloud or a haze, of yet unknown composition, hovers over both poles of Jupiter. Juno's radiometry measurements can probe the atmosphere to the unprecedented depth of 350km. This takes it below the frozen ammonia cloud top that we usually see in visible light images of the planet, with atmospheric pressures up to 240 times greater than on Earth's surface. Astronomers have already studied the rich and dynamic Jovian weather system since the first space observations of its atmospheric composition and profiles from the Voyager probes. But the previous deepest atmospheric measurements could be considered skin-deep when compared with Juno's latest observations. Only in one specific area of the planet was the atmosphere studied up to a depth of 100km. That was in 1995, when the Galileo probe descended into a so- called \"hot spot\", a dark region between ammonia clouds that glows strongly in infrared light. Galileo's probe measurements found this region surprisingly devoid of any water vapour clouds, as would have been expected below ammonia cloud. Now, for the first time Juno's radiometry allows a global view of deep atmosphere, showing that the banded pattern extends deeply below the visible tops of the clouds. The measurements of ammonia content in these deep layers reveals an unexpected and dynamic mixing similar to the Hadley cells in Earth's atmosphere. This is where masses of hot air rise in equatorial regions and move polewards, before plummeting in the tropics and returning towards the Equator close to Earth's surface. One of the goals of the Juno mission was to measure water content in the Jovian atmosphere, which has implications for understanding Solar System formation. So far Juno has confirmed that the hot spots are indeed very dry regions of descending air with humidity less than 10%. Since the discovery of strong radio emission from Jupiter in the 1950s - implying the existence of a magnetic field around the planet - every new space mission has slowly added to the ever so complex picture of the Jovian magnetosphere. The Juno mission is designed to make an unprecedented leap forward in the understanding magnetic field generation processes and also to make a detailed map of the planet's magnetosphere. One of the most spectacular consequences of interaction between the magnetosphere and atmosphere of a planet is an auroral display, similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth. Jupiter's 'southern lights' as captured by Juno. The JADE, JEDI and Waves instruments placed on Juno are used to measure the energies of particles that plummet into the polar regions and smash into atmospheric gases, mainly hydrogen that emits radiation, which we see as aurora. The ultraviolet and infrared maps of this emission allow us to measure how the top layers of the Jovian atmosphere heat up and cool, as well as to understand the dynamics of the magnetosphere. But why is the magnetosphere worth our attention? Planetary magnetospheres act like protective shields that deflect space radiation harmful to life. Only planets that can produce magnetic fields have magnetospheres and, lucky for us, Earth has one too. But besides Earth, only the giant planets in our Solar System have appreciable magnetospheres. Juno measured magnetic field in regions closer to Jupiter than ever before, and the results were very different than the predictions from the previously used models. The observed magnetic fields are stronger and also more spatially variable than previously assumed. Since it is understood that a magnetic field is formed in the cores of planets via dynamo process, this suggests that magnetic field formation region is actually much larger than expected. This, in turn, in combination with Juno's measurements of gravitational field around the planet, tells us that our previous ideas about the core of the planet may have to be revised. For example, the textbook images of the rather compact core of metallic hydrogen is not consistent with Juno observations. The metallic hydrogen core could be as large as the half of Jupiter's radius. Back on Earth. During Juno's closest approach to Jupiter - while the probe makes critical observations of Jovian weather, magnetism and gravity - some of the largest telescopes on Earth support the mission with imaging and spectroscopy of the giant planet. Although the spatial resolution of such observations is no match for imaging from Juno, ground telescopes have a global view of the planet. During the sixth approach of Juno to the planet on May 19, some of us were using telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. I used a high-resolution infrared spectroscope at the Gemini telescope to map the full extend of auroral hydrogen emission around both planetary poles, while my colleagues were taking infrared images of the same regions at the Subaru telescope. It is exciting to participate in this critical ground base support of the Juno mission, when the international astronomical community joins for a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a very unique view of our giant neighbour. Here I am in front of the terminals to the Gemini Telescope, in Hawaii. Jen Miller It is also amazing to have a support from many amateur astronomy groups that joined in observations of visible light from the planet. The raw images from the Juno's visible light camera are available on the Juno website for public use. People are invited to process such images and submit their work for viewing. Juno's unique orbit allows for making spectacular images of regions not visited in previous missions. The probe also comes much better equipped than some of its predecessors to visit the planet. The first results from the mission are already suggesting future revisions, or at least adjustments to models of Jupiter's atmosphere, interior and magnetism. This unique study of our largest giant planet will hopefully bear implications on the understanding of the formation and composition of similar but much hotter giant planets discovered around other stars.

In this image, edited by citizen scientist Roman Tkachenko, the Jovian south pole is made visible with dazzling colors and patterns, showing off the gas giant's banded layers of clouds. The clouds are made up of different elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and methane, which all mix with the hydrogen and helium composition of the planet causing different variations of pressure and turbulence. The atmospheric winds caused by this turbulence can surpass 200 mph. Jupiter has only a slight three-degree axial tilt, so it spins almost right- side up, which means the poles rarely see the sun. However, convection on the planet shifts solar radiation to the poles to keep the temperature balanced across the entirety of the planet. This also means the planet has virtually no change in seasons. In contrast, Earth has a 23-degree tilt, so its north and south poles do get some exposure, giving us our four distinct seasons. In this reprocessed image, we get a birds-eye view of Jupiter's south pole. NASA Juno captured this image on February 2 upon arriving at the south pole for the first time. The spacecraft was gliding about 63,400 miles above the clouds, offering up a perfect vantage point of the pole. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since July 5, 2016 when it first made its orbital insertion into the Jovian system. It was an astonishing feat: The spacecraft had to endure a 1.75 billion mile journey from Earth and then swerve its way into the orbit with little room for error, all while battling one of the most destructive radiation environments in the solar system. Since then, scientists have received beautiful images of the planet's pearls and north pole. NASA scientists are saying that the story of Jupiter is the \"story of the solar system,\" because it has long been theorized that Jupiter was the first planet to form around the sun.

Juno fired its main engine to brake into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, maneuvering into an egg-shaped 53-day orbit that takes the spacecraft several million miles from the giant planet on each circuit. At the low end of the orbit, the spacecraft passes within 3,000 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops, permitting Juno's instruments to peer deep into the atmosphere, measure the planet's extreme magnetic field and radiation belts, observe its auroras, and take the first detailed images of its poles. But engineers called off another engine burn planned for Oct. 19 to put Juno in a tighter 14-day orbit, the science perch envisioned by mission managers since the project's inception. Most of Juno's scientific observations occur when the probe is closer to the planet, and the 14-day orbit was designed to give researchers rapid-fire data returns during close approaches every two weeks. Ground controllers noticed two helium check valves inside the spacecraft's main propulsion system did not behave as expected during pressurization of Juno's propellant tanks about a week before the planned Oct. 19 engine firing. The valves opened in several seconds before previous engine burns, but took several minutes to open in October. Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Spaceflight Now that engineers recommended canceling the maneuver and keeping the craft in its current 53-day orbit after a multi-month investigation. \"The project recommended not doing the burn,\" Nybakken said in a Feb. 17 interview. \"We're in a great science orbit, the spacecraft is healthy, the instruments are healthy. We're getting incredible science, and it's teaching us more about Jupiter, and there are a lot of very interesting surprises about Jupiter, so we recommended not to take any additional risk that might jeopardize that - not to do this burn - and ultimately NASA Headquarters agreed with that recommendation.\" According to Nybakken, experts considered an option in which Juno's Leros 1b main engine, designed and built by Moog-ISP in the United Kingdom, could have fired in a backup \"blow-down\" mode using residual tank pressure, bypassing the suspect check valves. In a normal burn, the check valves would actuate to regulate pressure in the propellant system feeding the thruster. Officials decided the risk of doing a \"blow-down\" burn was too great, Nybakken said. Any problem during such an engine firing could have stranded Juno midway between the 53-day and 14-day orbits in a less optimal perch for science observations. In the 53-day orbit, Juno will avoid flying through Jupiter's shadow, keeping the craft's power-generating solar panels in sunlight. If Juno ended up in an unplanned lower orbit because of a sub-optimal engine burn, the probe would have flown through a series of eclipses in 2019, starving it of sunlight and likely ending the mission. The choice not to execute the orbit-lowering burn preserves the option to use Juno's smaller maneuvering thrusters to steer clear of Jupiter's shadow and keep the mission going beyond 2019. \"It wasn't so much that the risk was unacceptable, it's just that if anything off-nominal were to happen, you bring in these mission-ending eclipses in 2019,\" Nybakken said. \"In our current orbit, the size of the orbit is large enough, and the time of the orbit helps give us the operational latitude to avoid those eclipses.\" Nybakken said the inquiry into Juno's propulsion woes did not determine a root cause for the sticky valves. Officials quickly decided against using the valves for a \"regulated\" burn, and instead studied the backup \"blow-down\" option before eventually concluding Juno's orbit should not be lowered at all. \"At a high level, one of the leading theories is that we can have a very low level of interaction at the vapor level between fuel and oxidizer, and it can create products that can interfere with proper valve operation,\" Nybakken said. \"Beyond that, it is kind of to be determined. We didn't require root cause to realize the valves are not working as intended.\" Engineers ruled out any link between Juno's propulsion problem and engine failures on two geostationary communications satellites last year, Nybakken said. The commercial Intelsat 33e and the U.S. Navy's MUOS 5 communications satellites were to use on-board engines to raise their orbits to geostationary altitude 22,300 miles above Earth's equator after launching in June and August 2016. Both satellites had to use backup thrusters to finish the job. Nybakken said those engine failures were unrelated to the issue aboard Juno, and engineers with JPL and Lockheed Martin - Juno's prime contractor - cleared the Leros 1b engine on the Jupiter orbiter in October, before encountering the sticky check valves. \"There were a couple of failures last fall that we looked into, and we were able to determine that those failures did not represent any sort of increased risk to Juno,\" Nybakken said. \"And after we completed that investigation, we were, in fact, planning to go ahead with this maneuver.\" One benefit of Juno's predicament is the higher 53-day orbit will keep the spacecraft away from the worst of Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which harbour hazards that mission designers believed would limit the mission's duration to some time in 2018. \"It turns out in the 53-day orbits, we cross the equator, where the radiation belts are, much farther out, so we have much less radiation dose,\" Nybakken said. \"Of course, with the orbits being larger, the dose as a function of time is much slower as well.\" Juno's next close pass by Jupiter is set for March 27, completing its fifth orbit of the planet since last year's arrival. \"Juno is healthy, its science instruments are fully operational, and the data and images we've received are nothing short of amazing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's science mission directorate in Washington, in a statement. \"The decision to forego the burn is the right thing to do - preserving a valuable asset so that Juno can continue its exciting journey of discovery.\" The Juno mission is funded through July 2018, for a total of 12 science orbits, down from the 32 science orbits originally planned, NASA said in a statement. Juno's science team can then propose to continue the mission for another two years as part of NASA's senior review process, in which a panel of independent researchers recommend to the agency which of its planetary science missions should continue to receive federal funding. \"Juno is providing spectacular results, and we are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work,\" said Scott Bolton, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The science will be just as spectacular as with our original plan.\" \"We're very excited about what we've seen so far, and every time we fly by the planet it's like Christmas time,\" Nybakken said. \"The data is stunning.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2017/02/21/nasa-juno-spacecraft-to-remain-in-current-orbit-around-jupiter/"}, {"title": "Juno Spacecraft Skims Jupiter's Cloud Tops in Its 5th Flyby", "date": "2017-03-27", "content": "NASA's Juno spacecraft whizzed closely by Jupiter today in its fifth flyby of the gas giant.

The first data from the Juno probe was presented at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union. The new findings from Juno are already challenging our understanding of the largest planet in the solar system. Previous observations of Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter was made mostly of a uniform interior with a solid core of metallic hydrogen. New gravitational data from Juno call that into question. It now appears that Jupiter's internal layers are not uniform at all, but instead regularly mix together. Another important discovery is that Jupiter's magnetic field is actually much more powerful than previously believed. Jupiter's magnetic field was already known as the largest structure in the solar system, stretching more than 4 million miles in multiple directions. It was thought to be 10 to 20 times as powerful as Earth's magnetic field. But Juno's measurements seem to indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is even stronger than that. Results from the spacecraft suggest that the field might be almost twice as strong as previously believed. In addition, the field appears to be uneven in places, which means that unlike the Earth, Jupiter's magnetic field is generated closer to the surface rather than deep near the core. All of this new information comes from only Juno's first five orbits of Jupiter. The craft has at least seven more orbits before the budgeted end of mission in July 2018, but depending on how the spacecraft is doing, Juno could operate for longer than that. There's certainly still plenty more to discover about Jupiter.

The orbiter's JunoCam imager was also turned on during Friday's flyby to capture more scans of Jupiter's swirling clouds to be stitched together and edited by the mission's amateur fanbase. The solar-powered spacecraft, armored with a titanium vault to shield its sensitive electronics from radiation, passed around 2,200 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops around 0600 GMT Friday. NASA reported the probe completed the flyby as planned, with all of its science instruments and camera operating. Juno has logged 63.5 million miles since arriving in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, ending a nearly five-year trip from Earth. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. Juno has passed inside Jupiter's radiation belts seven times, including the spacecraft's arrival maneuver July 4, when the probe fired its main engine to enter orbit. Its instruments were deactivated during that encounter to focus on the make-or-break engine burn. The spacecraft entered safe mode just before a flyby in October, and it gathered no science data during that approach. The Juno mission is designed to study Jupiter's intense magnetic field and investigate the gas giant's deep interior structure, revealing insights about its atmosphere and probing for a rocky core. The Juno spacecraft is in an oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter that takes it around the planet once ever 53 days. NASA decided in February to forego an engine burn to move Juno into a closer 14-day orbit after engineers detected a problem with check valves inside the craft's propulsion system last year. Juno's mission will last until at least February 2018, enough time to make 11 science orbits around Jupiter, instead of the 32 laps originally planned. But NASA could extend the mission another three years to give Juno more flybys near Jupiter. The best data on Jupiter is captured when Juno is closest to the planet, but the 53-day orbit also gives scientists other opportunities that would not have been available in the mission's original flight plan. Scientists say the higher orbit allows Juno to move through Jupiter's magnetotail, the part of the magnetic field bubble around the planet that is blown back like a comet's tail by the solar wind.

This allows a clear view of its poles while the spacecraft ducks in and out of the strong radiation regions that surround the planet.

Simultaneous monitoring from ground based telescopes such as the ones on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, where I was recently, are also helping. Here I am on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Marcel de Vriend But first to the latest Juno discoveries. The atmosphere Juno's multiple passes over polar regions of the planet revealed stunning images of swirling cyclones, some almost as large as Earth. There is no banded structure visible in these images, in contrast to Jupiter's equatorial regions. There is no hexagon or a central vortex in the southern polar region like the one that the Cassini probe observed in Saturn's north polar atmosphere. It also appears that a high-altitude thin cloud or a haze, of yet unknown composition, hovers over both poles of Jupiter. Juno's radiometry measurements can probe the atmosphere to the unprecedented depth of 350km. This takes it below the frozen ammonia cloud top that we usually see in visible light images of the planet, with atmospheric pressures up to 240 times greater than on Earth's surface. Astronomers have already studied the rich and dynamic Jovian weather system since the first space observations of its atmospheric composition and profiles from the Voyager probes. But the previous deepest atmospheric measurements could be considered skin-deep when compared with Juno's latest observations. Only in one specific area of the planet was the atmosphere studied up to a depth of 100km. That was in 1995, when the Galileo probe descended into a so- called \"hot spot\", a dark region between ammonia clouds that glows strongly in infrared light. Galileo's probe measurements found this region surprisingly devoid of any water vapour clouds, as would have been expected below ammonia cloud. Now, for the first time Juno's radiometry allows a global view of deep atmosphere, showing that the banded pattern extends deeply below the visible tops of the clouds. The measurements of ammonia content in these deep layers reveals an unexpected and dynamic mixing similar to the Hadley cells in Earth's atmosphere. This is where masses of hot air rise in equatorial regions and move polewards, before plummeting in the tropics and returning towards the Equator close to Earth's surface. One of the goals of the Juno mission was to measure water content in the Jovian atmosphere, which has implications for understanding Solar System formation. So far Juno has confirmed that the hot spots are indeed very dry regions of descending air with humidity less than 10%. Since the discovery of strong radio emission from Jupiter in the 1950s - implying the existence of a magnetic field around the planet - every new space mission has slowly added to the ever so complex picture of the Jovian magnetosphere. The Juno mission is designed to make an unprecedented leap forward in the understanding magnetic field generation processes and also to make a detailed map of the planet's magnetosphere. One of the most spectacular consequences of interaction between the magnetosphere and atmosphere of a planet is an auroral display, similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth. Jupiter's 'southern lights' as captured by Juno. The JADE, JEDI and Waves instruments placed on Juno are used to measure the energies of particles that plummet into the polar regions and smash into atmospheric gases, mainly hydrogen that emits radiation, which we see as aurora. The ultraviolet and infrared maps of this emission allow us to measure how the top layers of the Jovian atmosphere heat up and cool, as well as to understand the dynamics of the magnetosphere. But why is the magnetosphere worth our attention? Planetary magnetospheres act like protective shields that deflect space radiation harmful to life. Only planets that can produce magnetic fields have magnetospheres and, lucky for us, Earth has one too. But besides Earth, only the giant planets in our Solar System have appreciable magnetospheres. Juno measured magnetic field in regions closer to Jupiter than ever before, and the results were very different than the predictions from the previously used models. The observed magnetic fields are stronger and also more spatially variable than previously assumed. Since it is understood that a magnetic field is formed in the cores of planets via dynamo process, this suggests that magnetic field formation region is actually much larger than expected. This, in turn, in combination with Juno's measurements of gravitational field around the planet, tells us that our previous ideas about the core of the planet may have to be revised. For example, the textbook images of the rather compact core of metallic hydrogen is not consistent with Juno observations. The metallic hydrogen core could be as large as the half of Jupiter's radius. Back on Earth. During Juno's closest approach to Jupiter - while the probe makes critical observations of Jovian weather, magnetism and gravity - some of the largest telescopes on Earth support the mission with imaging and spectroscopy of the giant planet. Although the spatial resolution of such observations is no match for imaging from Juno, ground telescopes have a global view of the planet. During the sixth approach of Juno to the planet on May 19, some of us were using telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. I used a high-resolution infrared spectroscope at the Gemini telescope to map the full extend of auroral hydrogen emission around both planetary poles, while my colleagues were taking infrared images of the same regions at the Subaru telescope.

The raw images from the Juno's visible light camera are available on the Juno website for public use. People are invited to process such images and submit their work for viewing. Juno's unique orbit allows for making spectacular images of regions not visited in previous missions. The probe also comes much better equipped than some of its predecessors to visit the planet. The first results from the mission are already suggesting future revisions, or at least adjustments to models of Jupiter's atmosphere, interior and magnetism. This unique study of our largest giant planet will hopefully bear implications on the understanding of the formation and composition of similar but much hotter giant planets discovered around other stars.

The data collection of the Great Red Spot is part of Juno's sixth science flyby over Jupiter's mysterious cloud tops. Perijove-the point at which an orbit comes closest to Jupiter's centre-will be on 10 July. At the time of perijove, Juno will be about 3,500 kilometres above the planet's cloud tops. Eleven minutes and 33 seconds later, Juno will have covered another 39,771 kilometres and will be directly above the coiling crimson cloud tops of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spacecraft will pass about 9,000 kilometres above the Giant Red Spot clouds. All eight of the spacecraft's instruments as well as its imager, JunoCam, will be on during the flyby. On 4 July, Juno will have logged exactly one year in Jupiter orbit. At the time, the spacecraft will have chalked up about 114.5 million kilometres in orbit around the giant planet. \"The success of science collection at Jupiter is a testament to the dedication, creativity and technical abilities of the Nasa-Juno team,\" said Rick Nybakken, project manager for Juno from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US. \"Each new orbit brings us closer to the heart of Jupiter's radiation belt, but so far the spacecraft has weathered the storm of electrons surrounding Jupiter better than we could have ever imagined,\" said Nybakken. Juno was launched in 2011 from the US. During its mission of exploration, Juno soars low over the planet's cloud tops-as close as about 3,400 kilometres. During these flybys, Juno is probing beneath the obscuring cloud cover of Jupiter and studying its auroras to learn more about the planet's origins, structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere.

The data may reveal new details about how this massive storm, with winds whipping as fast as 425 miles per hour, and Jupiter's atmosphere in general, work. Instruments on the probe might help to explain where the storm gets its red coloration, and could even peer below the surface of the storm for the first time ever. \"It sees through the cloud tops, and we can investigate how deep the storm's roots are,\" says Bolton. \"Do we see a signature at all underneath the cloud tops, or is it just a shallow feature? That helps us understand maybe how it's made, and why it's lasted this long.\" Although many scientists think the storm's roots must go very deep into Jupiter's atmosphere, Bolton says Juno's observations could potentially throw out that hypothesis. \"Until now, we've never had any kind of instrument that could see below the top layer, the veneer, of Jupiter.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/nasa-juno-great-red-spot-jupiter/"}, {"title": "Juno Spacecraft Completes Flyby of Jupiter's Great Red Spot", "date": "2017-07-12", "content": "Success!

The first data from the Juno probe was presented at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union. The new findings from Juno are already challenging our understanding of the largest planet in the solar system. Previous observations of Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter was made mostly of a uniform interior with a solid core of metallic hydrogen. New gravitational data from Juno call that into question. It now appears that Jupiter's internal layers are not uniform at all, but instead regularly mix together. Another important discovery is that Jupiter's magnetic field is actually much more powerful than previously believed. Jupiter's magnetic field was already known as the largest structure in the solar system, stretching more than 4 million miles in multiple directions. It was thought to be 10 to 20 times as powerful as Earth's magnetic field. But Juno's measurements seem to indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is even stronger than that. Results from the spacecraft suggest that the field might be almost twice as strong as previously believed. In addition, the field appears to be uneven in places, which means that unlike the Earth, Jupiter's magnetic field is generated closer to the surface rather than deep near the core. All of this new information comes from only Juno's first five orbits of Jupiter. The craft has at least seven more orbits before the budgeted end of mission in July 2018, but depending on how the spacecraft is doing, Juno could operate for longer than that. There's certainly still plenty more to discover about Jupiter.

The orbiter's JunoCam imager was also turned on during Friday's flyby to capture more scans of Jupiter's swirling clouds to be stitched together and edited by the mission's amateur fanbase. The solar-powered spacecraft, armored with a titanium vault to shield its sensitive electronics from radiation, passed around 2,200 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops around 0600 GMT Friday. NASA reported the probe completed the flyby as planned, with all of its science instruments and camera operating. Juno has logged 63.5 million miles since arriving in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, ending a nearly five-year trip from Earth. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. Juno has passed inside Jupiter's radiation belts seven times, including the spacecraft's arrival maneuver July 4, when the probe fired its main engine to enter orbit. Its instruments were deactivated during that encounter to focus on the make-or-break engine burn. The spacecraft entered safe mode just before a flyby in October, and it gathered no science data during that approach. The Juno mission is designed to study Jupiter's intense magnetic field and investigate the gas giant's deep interior structure, revealing insights about its atmosphere and probing for a rocky core. The Juno spacecraft is in an oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter that takes it around the planet once ever 53 days. NASA decided in February to forego an engine burn to move Juno into a closer 14-day orbit after engineers detected a problem with check valves inside the craft's propulsion system last year. Juno's mission will last until at least February 2018, enough time to make 11 science orbits around Jupiter, instead of the 32 laps originally planned. But NASA could extend the mission another three years to give Juno more flybys near Jupiter. The best data on Jupiter is captured when Juno is closest to the planet, but the 53-day orbit also gives scientists other opportunities that would not have been available in the mission's original flight plan. Scientists say the higher orbit allows Juno to move through Jupiter's magnetotail, the part of the magnetic field bubble around the planet that is blown back like a comet's tail by the solar wind. Such a perspective will allow Juno's science team to study the complex network of magnetic field lines around Jupiter, and help sort out the drivers behind Jupiter's auroras, separating auroras induced by internal convection and the solar wind.

The first data from the Juno probe was presented at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union. The new findings from Juno are already challenging our understanding of the largest planet in the solar system. Previous observations of Jupiter from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter was made mostly of a uniform interior with a solid core of metallic hydrogen. New gravitational data from Juno call that into question. It now appears that Jupiter's internal layers are not uniform at all, but instead regularly mix together. Another important discovery is that Jupiter's magnetic field is actually much more powerful than previously believed. Jupiter's magnetic field was already known as the largest structure in the solar system, stretching more than 4 million miles in multiple directions. It was thought to be 10 to 20 times as powerful as Earth's magnetic field. But Juno's measurements seem to indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is even stronger than that. Results from the spacecraft suggest that the field might be almost twice as strong as previously believed. In addition, the field appears to be uneven in places, which means that unlike the Earth, Jupiter's magnetic field is generated closer to the surface rather than deep near the core. All of this new information comes from only Juno's first five orbits of Jupiter. The craft has at least seven more orbits before the budgeted end of mission in July 2018, but depending on how the spacecraft is doing, Juno could operate for longer than that. There's certainly still plenty more to discover about Jupiter.

The orbiter's JunoCam imager was also turned on during Friday's flyby to capture more scans of Jupiter's swirling clouds to be stitched together and edited by the mission's amateur fanbase. The solar-powered spacecraft, armored with a titanium vault to shield its sensitive electronics from radiation, passed around 2,200 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops around 0600 GMT Friday. NASA reported the probe completed the flyby as planned, with all of its science instruments and camera operating. Juno has logged 63.5 million miles since arriving in orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, ending a nearly five-year trip from Earth. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. Juno has passed inside Jupiter's radiation belts seven times, including the spacecraft's arrival maneuver July 4, when the probe fired its main engine to enter orbit. Its instruments were deactivated during that encounter to focus on the make-or-break engine burn. The spacecraft entered safe mode just before a flyby in October, and it gathered no science data during that approach. The Juno mission is designed to study Jupiter's intense magnetic field and investigate the gas giant's deep interior structure, revealing insights about its atmosphere and probing for a rocky core. The Juno spacecraft is in an oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter that takes it around the planet once ever 53 days. NASA decided in February to forego an engine burn to move Juno into a closer 14-day orbit after engineers detected a problem with check valves inside the craft's propulsion system last year. Juno's mission will last until at least February 2018, enough time to make 11 science orbits around Jupiter, instead of the 32 laps originally planned. But NASA could extend the mission another three years to give Juno more flybys near Jupiter. The best data on Jupiter is captured when Juno is closest to the planet, but the 53-day orbit also gives scientists other opportunities that would not have been available in the mission's original flight plan. Scientists say the higher orbit allows Juno to move through Jupiter's magnetotail, the part of the magnetic field bubble around the planet that is blown back like a comet's tail by the solar wind. Such a perspective will allow Juno's science team to study the complex network of magnetic field lines around Jupiter, and help sort out the drivers behind Jupiter's auroras, separating auroras induced by internal convection and the solar wind. Juno's next close encounter with Jupiter is scheduled for July 11, when the spacecraft will fly over Jupiter's Great Red Spot.

Many of the findings were unexpected. Since July 2016, Juno has been revolving around Jupiter - the largest planet in our Solar System - in a highly elongated, 53-day orbit. This allows a clear view of its poles while the spacecraft ducks in and out of the strong radiation regions that surround the planet. The first results of Juno observations were released in two studies published in Science last week. They reveal a very new picture of the Jovian interior, its atmosphere and magnetosphere. Of course it's not only the observations from Juno that are helping us better understand Jupiter. Simultaneous monitoring from ground based telescopes such as the ones on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, where I was recently, are also helping. Here I am on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Marcel de Vriend But first to the latest Juno discoveries. The atmosphere Juno's multiple passes over polar regions of the planet revealed stunning images of swirling cyclones, some almost as large as Earth. There is no banded structure visible in these images, in contrast to Jupiter's equatorial regions. There is no hexagon or a central vortex in the southern polar region like the one that the Cassini probe observed in Saturn's north polar atmosphere. It also appears that a high-altitude thin cloud or a haze, of yet unknown composition, hovers over both poles of Jupiter. Juno's radiometry measurements can probe the atmosphere to the unprecedented depth of 350km. This takes it below the frozen ammonia cloud top that we usually see in visible light images of the planet, with atmospheric pressures up to 240 times greater than on Earth's surface. Astronomers have already studied the rich and dynamic Jovian weather system since the first space observations of its atmospheric composition and profiles from the Voyager probes. But the previous deepest atmospheric measurements could be considered skin-deep when compared with Juno's latest observations. Only in one specific area of the planet was the atmosphere studied up to a depth of 100km. That was in 1995, when the Galileo probe descended into a so- called \"hot spot\", a dark region between ammonia clouds that glows strongly in infrared light. Galileo's probe measurements found this region surprisingly devoid of any water vapour clouds, as would have been expected below ammonia cloud. Now, for the first time Juno's radiometry allows a global view of deep atmosphere, showing that the banded pattern extends deeply below the visible tops of the clouds. The measurements of ammonia content in these deep layers reveals an unexpected and dynamic mixing similar to the Hadley cells in Earth's atmosphere. This is where masses of hot air rise in equatorial regions and move polewards, before plummeting in the tropics and returning towards the Equator close to Earth's surface. One of the goals of the Juno mission was to measure water content in the Jovian atmosphere, which has implications for understanding Solar System formation. So far Juno has confirmed that the hot spots are indeed very dry regions of descending air with humidity less than 10%. Since the discovery of strong radio emission from Jupiter in the 1950s - implying the existence of a magnetic field around the planet - every new space mission has slowly added to the ever so complex picture of the Jovian magnetosphere. The Juno mission is designed to make an unprecedented leap forward in the understanding magnetic field generation processes and also to make a detailed map of the planet's magnetosphere. One of the most spectacular consequences of interaction between the magnetosphere and atmosphere of a planet is an auroral display, similar to the northern and southern lights on Earth. Jupiter's 'southern lights' as captured by Juno. The JADE, JEDI and Waves instruments placed on Juno are used to measure the energies of particles that plummet into the polar regions and smash into atmospheric gases, mainly hydrogen that emits radiation, which we see as aurora. The ultraviolet and infrared maps of this emission allow us to measure how the top layers of the Jovian atmosphere heat up and cool, as well as to understand the dynamics of the magnetosphere. But why is the magnetosphere worth our attention? Planetary magnetospheres act like protective shields that deflect space radiation harmful to life. Only planets that can produce magnetic fields have magnetospheres and, lucky for us, Earth has one too. But besides Earth, only the giant planets in our Solar System have appreciable magnetospheres. Juno measured magnetic field in regions closer to Jupiter than ever before, and the results were very different than the predictions from the previously used models. The observed magnetic fields are stronger and also more spatially variable than previously assumed. Since it is understood that a magnetic field is formed in the cores of planets via dynamo process, this suggests that magnetic field formation region is actually much larger than expected. This, in turn, in combination with Juno's measurements of gravitational field around the planet, tells us that our previous ideas about the core of the planet may have to be revised. For example, the textbook images of the rather compact core of metallic hydrogen is not consistent with Juno observations. The metallic hydrogen core could be as large as the half of Jupiter's radius. Back on Earth. During Juno's closest approach to Jupiter - while the probe makes critical observations of Jovian weather, magnetism and gravity - some of the largest telescopes on Earth support the mission with imaging and spectroscopy of the giant planet. Although the spatial resolution of such observations is no match for imaging from Juno, ground telescopes have a global view of the planet. During the sixth approach of Juno to the planet on May 19, some of us were using telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. I used a high-resolution infrared spectroscope at the Gemini telescope to map the full extend of auroral hydrogen emission around both planetary poles, while my colleagues were taking infrared images of the same regions at the Subaru telescope. It is exciting to participate in this critical ground base support of the Juno mission, when the international astronomical community joins for a once in a lifetime opportunity to get a very unique view of our giant neighbour.

Across the top left corner four bright, oval storms known as the \" String of Pearls \" dance. Among the cream-colored storms in the belt region a bright orange- colored storm sticks out. NASA's Juno spacecraft launched on August 5, 2011 for a multi-year journey. As part of the New Frontiers Program, Juno's main goal is to gather information, helping scientists understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter. In the process the craft used the JunoCam to capture and send information back to Earth. Juno arrived at Jupiter n July of 2016, will spend 20 months orbiting the planet 37 times and ending its mission gallantly by deorbiting into Jupiter in February of 2018. JunoCam's raw images are available online for viewing and processing.

This monumental storm has raged on the solar system's biggest planet for centuries,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"Now, Juno and her cloud-penetrating science instruments will dive in to see how deep the roots of this storm go, and help us understand how this giant storm works and what makes it so special,\" said Bolton. The data collection of the Great Red Spot is part of Juno's sixth science flyby over Jupiter's mysterious cloud tops. Perijove-the point at which an orbit comes closest to Jupiter's centre-will be on 10 July. At the time of perijove, Juno will be about 3,500 kilometres above the planet's cloud tops. Eleven minutes and 33 seconds later, Juno will have covered another 39,771 kilometres and will be directly above the coiling crimson cloud tops of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spacecraft will pass about 9,000 kilometres above the Giant Red Spot clouds. All eight of the spacecraft's instruments as well as its imager, JunoCam, will be on during the flyby. On 4 July, Juno will have logged exactly one year in Jupiter orbit. At the time, the spacecraft will have chalked up about 114.5 million kilometres in orbit around the giant planet. \"The success of science collection at Jupiter is a testament to the dedication, creativity and technical abilities of the Nasa-Juno team,\" said Rick Nybakken, project manager for Juno from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US. \"Each new orbit brings us closer to the heart of Jupiter's radiation belt, but so far the spacecraft has weathered the storm of electrons surrounding Jupiter better than we could have ever imagined,\" said Nybakken. Juno was launched in 2011 from the US. During its mission of exploration, Juno soars low over the planet's cloud tops-as close as about 3,400 kilometres. During these flybys, Juno is probing beneath the obscuring cloud cover of Jupiter and studying its auroras to learn more about the planet's origins, structure, atmosphere and magnetosphere. Early science results from Nasa's Juno mission portray the largest planet in our solar system as a turbulent world, with an intriguingly complex interior structure, energetic polar aurora, and huge polar cyclones.

Lensing like this allows cosmologists and astronomers to understand how massive the object is based on how much light it's bending. Those smudges and streaks are galaxies, and their curves are caused by the actual bending of the environment around the cluster. It's warping space-time itself! Finally we'll wrap up with a quadriptych homage to asteroids. This series of four photos was taken by the Very Large Telescope of four seemingly average asteroids. The asteroid belt and the rocks within it live between Mars and Jupiter, but contrary to popular belief these rocky bodies are very spread out, with an average distance of 2 million miles separating them.

The $1 billion mission was scheduled to end with a crash into Jupiter's clouds after July 2018. However, NASA sources have confirmed that the mission will be extended through July 2021. For the past two years, NASA's Juno probe has studied planet Jupiter like no spacecraft before it. The $1 billion mission has peeled back the giant planet's thick cloud layers, searched for an elusive core, and returned dazzling images of colossal storms and chaotic cloud bands. But all good things must come to an end, and Juno is no exception. NASA planned to destroy the tennis-court-size robot by plunging it into Jupiter's clouds sometime after July 2018. The rationale is similar to the Cassini probe's recent demise: Jupiter's icy moon Europa may be habitable to alien life, so carefully and deliberately ending the mission would prevent Juno from accidentally crashing into that moon. This would keep Europa's ocean - which may have twice as much water as exists on Earth - from getting contaminated by any earthly microbes stuck to Juno. However, the probe's fiery end is now pushed back by at least three years to July 2021, according to NASA sources. Scientific work on the mission will continue through September 2022. The extension is critical to one of Juno's primary objectives. The probe has been mapping Jupiter as it orbits the gas giant with infrequent close passes called perijoves. Juno builds this map slice-by-slice using a suite of different instruments, including ones that record data about Jupiter's gravitational field. But due to lingering trouble with Juno's propulsion system, by next month the team will have completed only 14 of the 32 perijoves that it needs to finish mapping Jupiter. Why Juno needs an extension to finish mapping Jupiter. Spending too much time in Jupiter's powerful radiation field can damage sensitive electronics. As a result, Juno orbits the planet on a highly elliptical path that keeps the probe mostly out of harm's way, yet regularly zooms it over the cloud tops for detailed observations. When Juno arrived in July 2016, mission managers had the spacecraft orbit Jupiter once every 53.5 days. In October 2016, they planned to fire up the probe's engines and speed Juno's orbits to once every 14 days - until the team discovered some sticky valves in the engine's plumbing. NASA ultimately decided to play it safe and not risk using the engines, delaying Juno's mapping pace nearly four-fold. \"During a thorough review, we looked at multiple scenarios that would place Juno in a shorter-period orbit, but there was concern that another main engine burn could result in a less-than-desirable orbit,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a 2017 press release. \"The bottom line is a burn represented a risk to completion of Juno's science objectives.\" The Juno mission leaders received a memo authorizing the extension in mid-May, but NASA has not yet publicly announced its decision. One representative told Business Insider that the agency hasn't \"put anything out yet about that\" when asked about the extension. \"NASA is close to being able to announce a decision on the possibility of continuing the Juno mission at Jupiter,\" another representative said in an emailed statement. Extending Juno's flight will help the probe finish mapping Jupiter - a project that primarily focuses on the planet's gravitational field. That data may reveal what is going on deep inside the giant yet mysterious world. \"It is very exciting for us to be able to complete the mission pretty much as it was originally proposed, except with longer orbits,\" Frederic Allegrini, a staff scientist at Southwest Research Institute who works on the Juno mission, told Business Insider.

That means Juno will be orbiting the gas giant until July 2021 and will spend the months after that analyzing data. Juno originally had a short lifespan, since it was supposed to orbit Jupiter every 14 days.

The $1 billion mission was scheduled to end with a crash into Jupiter's clouds after July 2018. However, NASA sources have confirmed that the mission will be extended through July 2021. For the past two years, NASA's Juno probe has studied planet Jupiter like no spacecraft before it. The $1 billion mission has peeled back the giant planet's thick cloud layers, searched for an elusive core, and returned dazzling images of colossal storms and chaotic cloud bands. But all good things must come to an end, and Juno is no exception. NASA planned to destroy the tennis-court-size robot by plunging it into Jupiter's clouds sometime after July 2018. The rationale is similar to the Cassini probe's recent demise: Jupiter's icy moon Europa may be habitable to alien life, so carefully and deliberately ending the mission would prevent Juno from accidentally crashing into that moon. This would keep Europa's ocean - which may have twice as much water as exists on Earth - from getting contaminated by any earthly microbes stuck to Juno. However, the probe's fiery end is now pushed back by at least three years to July 2021, according to NASA sources. Scientific work on the mission will continue through September 2022. The extension is critical to one of Juno's primary objectives. The probe has been mapping Jupiter as it orbits the gas giant with infrequent close passes called perijoves. Juno builds this map slice-by-slice using a suite of different instruments, including ones that record data about Jupiter's gravitational field. But due to lingering trouble with Juno's propulsion system, by next month the team will have completed only 14 of the 32 perijoves that it needs to finish mapping Jupiter. Why Juno needs an extension to finish mapping Jupiter. Spending too much time in Jupiter's powerful radiation field can damage sensitive electronics. As a result, Juno orbits the planet on a highly elliptical path that keeps the probe mostly out of harm's way, yet regularly zooms it over the cloud tops for detailed observations. When Juno arrived in July 2016, mission managers had the spacecraft orbit Jupiter once every 53.5 days. In October 2016, they planned to fire up the probe's engines and speed Juno's orbits to once every 14 days - until the team discovered some sticky valves in the engine's plumbing. NASA ultimately decided to play it safe and not risk using the engines, delaying Juno's mapping pace nearly four-fold. \"During a thorough review, we looked at multiple scenarios that would place Juno in a shorter-period orbit, but there was concern that another main engine burn could result in a less-than-desirable orbit,\" Rick Nybakken, Juno's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a 2017 press release. \"The bottom line is a burn represented a risk to completion of Juno's science objectives.\" The Juno mission leaders received a memo authorizing the extension in mid-May, but NASA has not yet publicly announced its decision. One representative told Business Insider that the agency hasn't \"put anything out yet about that\" when asked about the extension. \"NASA is close to being able to announce a decision on the possibility of continuing the Juno mission at Jupiter,\" another representative said in an emailed statement. Extending Juno's flight will help the probe finish mapping Jupiter - a project that primarily focuses on the planet's gravitational field. That data may reveal what is going on deep inside the giant yet mysterious world. \"It is very exciting for us to be able to complete the mission pretty much as it was originally proposed, except with longer orbits,\" Frederic Allegrini, a staff scientist at Southwest Research Institute who works on the Juno mission, told Business Insider. If Juno stays operational and productive over the next few years, NASA might again decide to keep flying the probe around Jupiter beyond July 2021.

The probe, which left our planet in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016, was supposed to wrap things up in February this year. Now, NASA has agreed to fund the project until fiscal year 2022 and to extend its science operations for 41 more months. That means Juno will be orbiting the gas giant until July 2021 and will spend the months after that analyzing data. Juno originally had a short lifespan, since it was supposed to orbit Jupiter every 14 days. Unfortunately, something went wrong with the valves in its fuel system, so it got stuck doing 53-day orbits instead of 14-day ones like its ground team planned. Longer orbits mean it needs more time to collect the amount of data NASA wanted to get -- this extension will give the agency the chance to learn everything it can about the biggest planet in our solar system. In the past two years that it's been orbiting Jupiter, Juno already beamed back a lot of crazy interesting information about the planet. We learned that its poles are packed with storms the size of Earth, for instance, and that the belts we see in many Jupiter photos vary in depth and nature. The spacecraft also took some of the closest images of the planet we've ever seen, including snapshots of the Great Red Spot that show the storm's finer details.

The $1.1 billion Juno mission has been extended through at least July 2021, NASA officials announced yesterday. The agency will fund Juno into 2022, to cover the cost of data analysis and close-out activities. \"With these funds, not only can the Juno team continue to answer long-standing questions about Jupiter that first fueled this exciting mission, but they'll also investigate new scientific puzzles motivated by their discoveries thus far,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. \"With every additional orbit, both scientists and citizen scientists will help unveil new surprises about this distant world.\" Juno launched in August 2011 and arrived in orbit around the solar system's largest planet on July 4, 2016. The spacecraft is studying Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields as well as its thick atmosphere, collecting data that should reveal key insights about how the gas giant formed and evolved. Juno makes most of its observations during its closest approaches to Jupiter, which occur once every 53 days. Juno's final science orbit was supposed to be much less elliptical, with close flybys taking place every 14 days, but an issue with a thruster valve nixed that plan. The mission extension is an acknowledgement of this new reality - that Juno will need more time to do its work in this longer orbit. \"This is great news for planetary exploration as well as for the Juno team,\" Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton, from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in the same statement. \"These updated plans for Juno will allow it to complete its primary science goals,\" he added. \"As a bonus, the larger orbits allow us to further explore the far reaches of the Jovian magnetosphere - the region of space dominated by Jupiter's magnetic field - including the far magnetotail, the southern magnetosphere, and the magnetospheric boundary region called the magnetopause. We have also found Jupiter's radiation environment in this orbit to be less extreme than expected, which has been beneficial to not only our spacecraft, but our instruments and the continued quality of science data collected.\" Juno and its science instruments remain in good health, NASA officials said. The extension comes after an April report by an independent review panel that found the mission remains on track to accomplish its main science goals. When Juno's work is done, the probe will be de-orbited intentionally into Jupiter's thick atmosphere, to ensure that the spacecraft doesn't contaminate the potentially life-supporting Jovian moon Europa with microbes from Earth. NASA's Cassini Saturn orbiter ended its mission with the same kind of death dive last September.

NASA this week said its Juno spacecraft has uncovered evidence suggesting Jupiter has an internal magnetic field that changes over time, much like Earth's. The phenomenon, known as secular variation, is most likely caused by the planet's deep atmospheric winds, the agency said. Juno launched from Cape Canaveral in August 2011 as part of the New Frontiers program and entered a polar orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. The craft was sent to study Jupiter's magnetic field, gravity field, composition and polar magnetosphere. NASA used data collected during Juno's first eight passes of Jupiter to create a three-dimensional map of the planet's magnetic field. This map was then compared to data collected from past missions, some dating back more than four decades. What they noticed were small but distinct changes to Jupiter's magnetic field. \"Having a baseline of close-up observations over four decades long provided us with just enough data to confirm that Jupiter's magnetic field does indeed change over time,\" said Kimee Moore, a Juno scientist from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scientists think atmospheric winds are responsible for changes in the planet's magnetic fields. The winds extend from the surface to over 1,860 miles deep where the planet's interior starts to change from gas to highly conductive liquid metal. It is believed that these winds shear the magnetic fields, stretching and carrying them around the planet. The discovery will help scientists better understand the many mysteries of Jupiter and could even help unlock some of the remaining secrets of Earth's magnetic field.

Juno launched from Cape Canaveral in August 2011 as part of the New Frontiers program and entered a polar orbit around Jupiter in July 2016. The craft was sent to study Jupiter's magnetic field, gravity field, composition and polar magnetosphere. NASA used data collected during Juno's first eight passes of Jupiter to create a three-dimensional map of the planet's magnetic field. This map was then compared to data collected from past missions, some dating back more than four decades. What they noticed were small but distinct changes to Jupiter's magnetic field. \"Having a baseline of close-up observations over four decades long provided us with just enough data to confirm that Jupiter's magnetic field does indeed change over time,\" said Kimee Moore, a Juno scientist from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scientists think atmospheric winds are responsible for changes in the planet's magnetic fields. The winds extend from the surface to over 1,860 miles deep where the planet's interior starts to change from gas to highly conductive liquid metal. It is believed that these winds shear the magnetic fields, stretching and carrying them around the planet. The discovery will help scientists better understand the many mysteries of Jupiter and could even help unlock some of the remaining secrets of Earth's magnetic field.

Its little solar-powered probe has just sent back a trove of incredible images from its latest 'dip' towards Jupiter, including this incredible image of swirling clouds that surround a circular feature within a jet stream region called 'Jet N6.' This color-enhanced image was created by 'citizen scientist' Kevin M. Gill image using data from the spacecraft's JunoCam imager. It was taken on Feb. 12, 2019, as the spacecraft performed its 18th close flyby of the gas giant planet. NASA says that Juno was about 8,000 miles from the planet's cloud tops when it snapped the photo. NASA is making the raw images from JunoCam available online to anyone who wants to look at them, or like Gill, process them. A high-resolution version of Gill's image is also available to download. The latest collection of raw images is from what NASA calls Juno's 'Perijove 18'. A perijove is essentially a close flyby of Jupiter. Juno is in a big polar orbit of the giant planet, and every 53 days it passes just 3,000 miles shy of Jupiter's cloud tops. That's when it's taking all of its photos, so expect a 'data dump' every couple of months. Juno's mission was replanned last June after concerns over valves on its fule system. Either way, Juno will crash into Jupiter in July 2021. What science is Juno doing at Jupiter? Juno has nine instruments to help it gather data on the existence of a solid planetary core under Jupiter's mysterious cloud tops, the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and map Jupiter's intense magnetic field. It's also been observing the planet's auroras. Are there any other missions planned for Jupiter? Yes. The European Space Agency is planning its JUICE mission, which is scheduled for launch in June 2022.

NASA's Juno spacecraft began orbiting Jupiter in July 2016. In addition to capturing stunning imagery of the gas giant, Juno has also uncovered surprising insight that only creates more questions. Based on its latest observations, Juno's data about Jupiter's gravity suggests that the planet doesn't have a small, dense core as expected. Instead, there's a diluted core, the researchers said. At first, they couldn't understand why. \"Instead of a small compact core as we previously assumed, Jupiter's core is 'fuzzy,' \" said Ravit Helled, study co-author, Juno mission team member and professor at the University of Z\u00fcrich. \"This means that the core is likely not made of only rocks and ices but is also mixed with hydrogen and helium, and there is a gradual transition as opposed to a sharp boundary between the core and the envelope.\" But what could disrupt the core? It would require something that could stir up the core. A giant impact seemed likely. The international team of researchers used simulations of model collisions between the still-forming Jupiter with baby planets. Their results showed that a head-on collision between Jupiter and a young planet 10 times the mass of Earth would have enough impact to shatter the core. This would dilute it by allowing heavy metals to mix inside it. \"Because it's dense, and it comes in with a lot of energy, the impactor would be like a bullet that goes through the atmosphere and hits the core head-on,\" said Andrea Isella, study co-author and Rice University astronomer. \"Before impact, you have a very dense core, surrounded by atmosphere. The head-on impact spreads things out, diluting the core.\" The study results were published this week in the journal Nature. The researchers also wanted to know if the diluted core persisted over billions of years, or whether it evolved that way over time. \"We are talking about very different timescales,\" said Simon M\u00fcller, study co- author and University of Z\u00fcrich doctoral student who ran the simulations of Jupiter's evolution. \"Giant impacts occurred early in the history of the solar system and lasted for a short time, while the evolution is a long process up to today, 4.5 billions of years after Jupiter's formation.\" Their calculations showed that the diluted core persisted, which has implications for more than just Jupiter. \"That makes the case for the giant impact much stronger,\" Helled said. \"It seems that such violent impacts were very common in the young solar system and interestingly, they played an important role in shaping the planetary characteristics - not only for Jupiter, as we suggest in this paper, but also for other planets, to explain the Earth's moon, the high metal-to-rock fraction in Mercury, and Uranus' tilt.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/world/jupiter-planet-impact-scn-trnd/index.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Juno spacecraft has spotted Jupiter's magnetic field shifting", "date": "2019-05-21", "content": "The Juno spacecraft has now discovered that Earth isn't alone in experiencing this.

While everyone would usually ooh and ahh about the planet's alien beauty, something in the most recent images caught everyone's eye. There is an ominous black dot on Jupiter's surface. Before you start pointing fingers and sputtering about monoliths and Europa, though, the answer is actually rather lame. While one theory doing the rounds suggests that the dot is a black hole, that's simply not possible, primarily because black holes smaller than Jupiter aren't known to exist. More importantly, black holes are massive, high-energy objects that have powerful consequences on objects in their neighbourhood. Any object close enough to a black hole falls into it and gets ripped apart by the immense gravity of the black hole. The black dot is, in fact, the shadow of Io, its moon, falling on Jupiter. The images were taken by the Juno's onboard camera, JunoCam, from about 8,000 km above Jupiter's surface, during Juno's 22nd perijove, the point in Juno's orbit at which it is closest to Jupiter's core. Io, one of Jupiter's moon and one of the most **volcanically active bodies** in the solar system, and its surface is covered in sulfur. The volcanoes are caused by Jupiter and its strong gravitational pull on Io. Gravity causes friction and heat on the moon and causes the rocks to melt. Io is a little bigger than Earth's moon but Jupiter is 11 times the size of the Earth, making the shadow seem relatively small. A solar eclipse takes place when the moon comes in front of the Sun, blocking out its light. The moon then casts a shadow on the planet, in this case, Jupiter. Jupiter has 79 moons, of which 53 have been named. Out of these, scientists on Earth are only interested in its four moons - the so- called Galilean satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Juno's main goal is to understand Jupiter, its origin and evolution and how giant planets help in the formation of the solar system. The spacecraft was launched in 2011 and took five years to reach its destination in 2016. It has an elliptical orbit that lasts 53 days which puts it in close contact with the planet. Juno swoops in close to Jupiter to observe and then backs off to a safe distance of eight million kilometres. Its instruments are placed inside titanium coverings to protect them from radiation. The mission is said to end by July 2021 and the satellite will be destroyed in Jupiter's atmosphere to avoid contaminating the moons.

NASA's Juno spacecraft began orbiting Jupiter in July 2016. In addition to capturing stunning imagery of the gas giant, Juno has also uncovered surprising insight that only creates more questions. Based on its latest observations, Juno's data about Jupiter's gravity suggests that the planet doesn't have a small, dense core as expected. Instead, there's a diluted core, the researchers said. At first, they couldn't understand why. \"Instead of a small compact core as we previously assumed, Jupiter's core is 'fuzzy,' \" said Ravit Helled, study co-author, Juno mission team member and professor at the University of Z\u00fcrich. \"This means that the core is likely not made of only rocks and ices but is also mixed with hydrogen and helium, and there is a gradual transition as opposed to a sharp boundary between the core and the envelope.\" But what could disrupt the core? It would require something that could stir up the core. A giant impact seemed likely. The international team of researchers used simulations of model collisions between the still-forming Jupiter with baby planets. Their results showed that a head-on collision between Jupiter and a young planet 10 times the mass of Earth would have enough impact to shatter the core. This would dilute it by allowing heavy metals to mix inside it. \"Because it's dense, and it comes in with a lot of energy, the impactor would be like a bullet that goes through the atmosphere and hits the core head-on,\" said Andrea Isella, study co-author and Rice University astronomer. \"Before impact, you have a very dense core, surrounded by atmosphere. The head-on impact spreads things out, diluting the core.\" The study results were published this week in the journal Nature. The researchers also wanted to know if the diluted core persisted over billions of years, or whether it evolved that way over time. \"We are talking about very different timescales,\" said Simon M\u00fcller, study co- author and University of Z\u00fcrich doctoral student who ran the simulations of Jupiter's evolution. \"Giant impacts occurred early in the history of the solar system and lasted for a short time, while the evolution is a long process up to today, 4.5 billions of years after Jupiter's formation.\" Their calculations showed that the diluted core persisted, which has implications for more than just Jupiter. \"That makes the case for the giant impact much stronger,\" Helled said. \"It seems that such violent impacts were very common in the young solar system and interestingly, they played an important role in shaping the planetary characteristics - not only for Jupiter, as we suggest in this paper, but also for other planets, to explain the Earth's moon, the high metal-to-rock fraction in Mercury, and Uranus' tilt.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/world/jupiter-planet-impact-scn-trnd/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Juno spacecraft captures ominous images of black spot on Jupiter's surface", "date": "2019-09-24", "content": " NASA's Juno spacecraft has captured new images of the biggest planet in the solar system, Jupiter in pictures, is stunning as always.

Before you start pointing fingers and sputtering about monoliths and Europa, though, the answer is actually rather lame. While one theory doing the rounds suggests that the dot is a black hole, that's simply not possible, primarily because black holes smaller than Jupiter aren't known to exist. More importantly, black holes are massive, high-energy objects that have powerful consequences on objects in their neighbourhood. Any object close enough to a black hole falls into it and gets ripped apart by the immense gravity of the black hole. The black dot is, in fact, the shadow of Io, its moon, falling on Jupiter.

Juno's cameras spied giant cyclones gathered at Jupiter's poles soon after its arrival in July 2016 -- nine to the north, and six to the south. The central cyclone at the heart of the gathering was as big as the United States. Five giant cyclones seemed to hold court at the south pole, keeping in tight, stable formation around a sixth central cyclone and not allowing other nearby cyclones to join their pentagon-like formation. \"It almost appeared like the polar cyclones were part of a private club that seemed to resist new members,\" said Scott Bolton in a statement, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. But on November 3, Juno flew a daring 3,500 kilometres above Jupiter's clouds and conducted its 22nd flyby since its arrival. This latest flyby revealed that a new, small cyclone had been allowed to join the exclusive group. \"Data from Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper JIRAM instrument indicates we went from a pentagon of cyclones surrounding one at the center to a hexagonal arrangement,\" said Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome. \"This new addition is smaller in stature than its six more established cyclonic brothers: It's about the size of Texas.\" Only time will tell if the small cyclone will grow to reach the size of its neighbors. It already has a similar sustained velocity of 225 miles per hour. Cameras on Juno were able to take a deeper look at the atmospheric process happening on Jupiter and peek inside the weather layer 30 to 45 miles beneath the cloud tops. Combined, this data not only offers insight about Jupiter but also about other gas and ice giants in our solar system, as well as how the atmospheres of exoplanets may behave and even similar storms on Earth. \"These cyclones are new weather phenomena that have not been seen or predicted before,\" said Cheng Li, a Juno scientist from the University of California, Berkeley. \"Nature is revealing new physics regarding fluid motions and how giant planet atmospheres work. We are beginning to grasp it through observations and computer simulations. Future Juno flybys will help us further refine our understanding by revealing how the cyclones evolve over time.\" But detecting the cyclone was only possible because engineers helped the solar-powered spacecraft navigate an eclipse that could have ended the mission by freezing it out. \"Ever since the day we entered orbit around Jupiter, we made sure it remained bathed in sunlight 24/7,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Our navigators and engineers told us a day of reckoning was coming, when we would go into Jupiter's shadow for about 12 hours. We knew that for such an extended period without power, our spacecraft would suffer a similar fate as the Opportunity rover, when the skies of Mars filled with dust and blocked the Sun's rays from reaching its solar panels.\" Inside Jupiter's shadow, Juno would face temperatures far colder than it was tested to withstand, which strains its batteries past the point of recovery. The mission team strategized a way for Juno to \"jump the shadow,\" according to NASA, to just miss the eclipse. A system burn helped it jump ahead and avoid the eclipse. \"The combination of creativity and analytical thinking has once again paid off big time for NASA,\" said Bolton. \"It was nothing less than a navigation stroke of genius.

The discovery of the massive Jovian tempest occurred on November 3rd, 2019, during the most recent data-gathering flyby of Jupiter by NASA's Juno spacecraft. It was the 22nd flyby during which the solar- powered spacecraft collected science data on the gas giant, soaring only 2,175 miles above its cloud tops. The flyby also marked a victory for the mission team, whose innovative measures kept the solar-powered spacecraft clear of what could have been a mission-ending eclipse. \"The combination of creativity and analytical thinking has once again paid off big time for NASA,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"We realized that the orbit was going to carry Juno into Jupiter's shadow, which could have grave consequences because we're solar powered.\" \"No sunlight means no power, so there was real risk we might freeze to death. While the team was trying to figure out how to conserve energy and keep our core heated, the engineers came up with a completely new way out of the problem: Jump Jupiter's shadow,\" Bolton stated. \"It was nothing less than a navigation stroke of genius. Lo and behold, first thing out of the gate on the other side, we make another fundamental discovery.\" When Juno first arrived at Jupiter in July 2016, its infrared and visible- light cameras discovered giant cyclones encircling the planet's poles - nine in the north and six in the south. Were they, like their Earthly siblings, a transient phenomenon, taking only weeks to develop and then ebb? Or could these cyclones, each nearly as wide as the continental U.S., be more permanent fixtures? With each flyby, the data reinforced the idea that five windstorms were swirling in a pentagonal pattern around a central storm at the south pole and that the system seemed stable. None of the six storms showed signs of yielding to allow other cyclones to join in. \"It almost appeared like the polar cyclones were part of a private club that seemed to resist new members,\" said Bolton. Then, during Juno's 22nd science pass, a new, smaller cyclone churned to life and joined the fray. \"Data from Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper JIRAM instrument indicates we went from a pentagon of cyclones surrounding one at the center to a hexagonal arrangement,\" said Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome. \"This new addition is smaller in stature than its six more established cyclonic brothers: It's about the size of Texas. Maybe JIRAM data from future flybys will show the cyclone growing to the same size as its neighbors,\" Mura stated. The spacecraft's JunoCam also obtained visible-light imagery of the new cyclone. The two datasets shed light on atmospheric processes of not just Jupiter but also fellow gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune as well as those of giant exoplanets now being discovered; they even shed light on atmospheric processes of Earth's cyclones. \"These cyclones are new weather phenomena that have not been seen or predicted before,\" said Cheng Li, a Juno scientist from the University of California, Berkeley. \"Nature is revealing new physics regarding fluid motions and how giant planet atmospheres work. We are beginning to grasp it through observations and computer simulations. Future Juno flybys will help us further refine our understanding by revealing how the cyclones evolve over time.\" Of course, the new cyclone would never have been discovered if Juno had frozen to death during the eclipse when Jupiter got between the spacecraft and the Sun's heat and light rays. Juno has been navigating in deep space since 2011. It entered an initial 53-day orbit around Jupiter on July 4th, 2016. Originally, the mission planned to reduce the size of its orbit a few months later to shorten the period between science flybys of the gas giant to every 14 days. But the project team recommended to NASA to forgo the main engine burn due to concerns about the spacecraft's fuel delivery system. Juno's 53-day orbit provides all the science as originally planned; it just takes longer to do so. Juno's longer life at Jupiter is what led to the need to avoid Jupiter's shadow. \"Ever since the day we entered orbit around Jupiter, we made sure it remained bathed in sunlight 24/7,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Our navigators and engineers told us a day of reckoning was coming, when we would go into Jupiter's shadow for about 12 hours. We knew that for such an extended period without power, our spacecraft would suffer a similar fate as the Opportunity rover, when the skies of Mars filled with dust and blocked the Sun's rays from reaching its solar panels.\" Without the Sun's rays providing power, Juno would be chilled below tested levels, eventually draining its battery cells beyond recovery. So the navigation team set devised a plan to \"jump the shadow,\" maneuvering the spacecraft just enough so its trajectory would miss the eclipse. \"In deep space, you are either in sunlight or your out of sunlight; there really is no in-between,\" said Levin. The navigators calculated that if Juno performed a rocket burn weeks in advance of November 3rd, while the spacecraft was as far in its orbit from Jupiter as it gets, they could modify its trajectory enough to give the eclipse the slip. The maneuver would utilize the spacecraft's reaction control system, which wasn't initially intended to be used for a maneuver of this size and duration. On September 30th, at 6:46pm CDT, the reaction control system burn began. It ended 10 \u00bd hours later. The propulsive maneuver - five times longer than any previous use of that system - changed Juno's orbital velocity by 126 mph and consumed about 160 pounds of fuel. Thirty-four days later, the spacecraft's solar arrays continued to convert sunlight into electrons unabated as Juno prepared to scream once again over Jupiter's cloud tops. \"Thanks to our navigators and engineers, we still have a mission,\" said Bolton. \"What they did is more than just make our cyclone discovery possible; they made possible the new insights and revelations about Jupiter that lie ahead of us.\" NASA's JPL manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.

While everyone would usually ooh and ahh about the planet's alien beauty, something in the most recent images caught everyone's eye. There is an ominous black dot on Jupiter's surface. Before you start pointing fingers and sputtering about monoliths and Europa, though, the answer is actually rather lame. While one theory doing the rounds suggests that the dot is a black hole, that's simply not possible, primarily because black holes smaller than Jupiter aren't known to exist. More importantly, black holes are massive, high-energy objects that have powerful consequences on objects in their neighbourhood. Any object close enough to a black hole falls into it and gets ripped apart by the immense gravity of the black hole. The black dot is, in fact, the shadow of Io, its moon, falling on Jupiter. The images were taken by the Juno's onboard camera, JunoCam, from about 8,000 km above Jupiter's surface, during Juno's 22nd perijove, the point in Juno's orbit at which it is closest to Jupiter's core. Io, one of Jupiter's moon and one of the most **volcanically active bodies** in the solar system, and its surface is covered in sulfur. The volcanoes are caused by Jupiter and its strong gravitational pull on Io. Gravity causes friction and heat on the moon and causes the rocks to melt. Io is a little bigger than Earth's moon but Jupiter is 11 times the size of the Earth, making the shadow seem relatively small. A solar eclipse takes place when the moon comes in front of the Sun, blocking out its light. The moon then casts a shadow on the planet, in this case, Jupiter. Jupiter has 79 moons, of which 53 have been named. Out of these, scientists on Earth are only interested in its four moons - the so- called Galilean satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Juno's main goal is to understand Jupiter, its origin and evolution and how giant planets help in the formation of the solar system. The spacecraft was launched in 2011 and took five years to reach its destination in 2016. It has an elliptical orbit that lasts 53 days which puts it in close contact with the planet. Juno swoops in close to Jupiter to observe and then backs off to a safe distance of eight million kilometres. Its instruments are placed inside titanium coverings to protect them from radiation. The mission is said to end by July 2021 and the satellite will be destroyed in Jupiter's atmosphere to avoid contaminating the moons.

One of the novel features of Juno is that, unlike previous missions to the outer solar system, the spacecraft is solar-powered, generating electricity thanks to large, advanced photovoltaic panels. It's a testament to how far solar technology has come, but it also means that Juno is dependent on the Sun to keep on functioning. Originally, this wasn't a problem for NASA because of the planned highly elliptical orbit that would always keep it out of Jupiter's shadow. Unfortunately, when Juno went into its initial 53-day orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016, there was a malfunction with the main engine and mission control decided not to risk the additional main burns that would place the craft into the planned 14-day final orbit.

But now, new data from NASA's Juno mission suggests that the gas giant might be wetter than previously thought. According to NASA, about 0.25% of Jupiter's atmosphere consists of water, which is three times more than the Sun. But, these figures are based on the amount of hydrogen and oxygen recorded by Juno. In contrast, the Galileo spacecraft recorded and transmitted the spectrographic measurements of water vapour in the Jovian atmosphere in 1995. The data from Galileo found that the water in Jupiter's atmosphere was about ten times less than expected. But, the new Juno discovery made scientists curious about the Galileo data. It was then found using an infrared map captured during the same time as Galileo data that the particular region of the atmosphere was drier and warmer than its surrounding. This suggests that the moisture in Jupiter's atmosphere is not uniformly mixed but rather varies heavily depending on various conditions. Even data from Galileo showed that moisture content increased as it delved deeper into Jupiter's atmosphere. The new discovery has just added to the elusive mystery of water on the gas giant.

Juno's cameras spied giant cyclones gathered at Jupiter's poles soon after its arrival in July 2016 -- nine to the north, and six to the south. The central cyclone at the heart of the gathering was as big as the United States. Five giant cyclones seemed to hold court at the south pole, keeping in tight, stable formation around a sixth central cyclone and not allowing other nearby cyclones to join their pentagon-like formation. \"It almost appeared like the polar cyclones were part of a private club that seemed to resist new members,\" said Scott Bolton in a statement, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. But on November 3, Juno flew a daring 3,500 kilometres above Jupiter's clouds and conducted its 22nd flyby since its arrival. This latest flyby revealed that a new, small cyclone had been allowed to join the exclusive group. \"Data from Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper JIRAM instrument indicates we went from a pentagon of cyclones surrounding one at the center to a hexagonal arrangement,\" said Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome. \"This new addition is smaller in stature than its six more established cyclonic brothers: It's about the size of Texas.\" Only time will tell if the small cyclone will grow to reach the size of its neighbors. It already has a similar sustained velocity of 225 miles per hour. Cameras on Juno were able to take a deeper look at the atmospheric process happening on Jupiter and peek inside the weather layer 30 to 45 miles beneath the cloud tops. Combined, this data not only offers insight about Jupiter but also about other gas and ice giants in our solar system, as well as how the atmospheres of exoplanets may behave and even similar storms on Earth. \"These cyclones are new weather phenomena that have not been seen or predicted before,\" said Cheng Li, a Juno scientist from the University of California, Berkeley. \"Nature is revealing new physics regarding fluid motions and how giant planet atmospheres work. We are beginning to grasp it through observations and computer simulations. Future Juno flybys will help us further refine our understanding by revealing how the cyclones evolve over time.\" But detecting the cyclone was only possible because engineers helped the solar-powered spacecraft navigate an eclipse that could have ended the mission by freezing it out. \"Ever since the day we entered orbit around Jupiter, we made sure it remained bathed in sunlight 24/7,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Our navigators and engineers told us a day of reckoning was coming, when we would go into Jupiter's shadow for about 12 hours. We knew that for such an extended period without power, our spacecraft would suffer a similar fate as the Opportunity rover, when the skies of Mars filled with dust and blocked the Sun's rays from reaching its solar panels.\" Inside Jupiter's shadow, Juno would face temperatures far colder than it was tested to withstand, which strains its batteries past the point of recovery. The mission team strategized a way for Juno to \"jump the shadow,\" according to NASA, to just miss the eclipse. A system burn helped it jump ahead and avoid the eclipse. \"The combination of creativity and analytical thinking has once again paid off big time for NASA,\" said Bolton. \"It was nothing less than a navigation stroke of genius. Lo and behold, first thing out of the gate on the other side, we make another fundamental discovery.\" Happily, Juno can continue to orbit and study Jupiter until the mission's end in July 2021.

The discovery of the massive Jovian tempest occurred on November 3rd, 2019, during the most recent data-gathering flyby of Jupiter by NASA's Juno spacecraft. It was the 22nd flyby during which the solar- powered spacecraft collected science data on the gas giant, soaring only 2,175 miles above its cloud tops. The flyby also marked a victory for the mission team, whose innovative measures kept the solar-powered spacecraft clear of what could have been a mission-ending eclipse. \"The combination of creativity and analytical thinking has once again paid off big time for NASA,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"We realized that the orbit was going to carry Juno into Jupiter's shadow, which could have grave consequences because we're solar powered.\" \"No sunlight means no power, so there was real risk we might freeze to death. While the team was trying to figure out how to conserve energy and keep our core heated, the engineers came up with a completely new way out of the problem: Jump Jupiter's shadow,\" Bolton stated. \"It was nothing less than a navigation stroke of genius. Lo and behold, first thing out of the gate on the other side, we make another fundamental discovery.\" When Juno first arrived at Jupiter in July 2016, its infrared and visible- light cameras discovered giant cyclones encircling the planet's poles - nine in the north and six in the south. Were they, like their Earthly siblings, a transient phenomenon, taking only weeks to develop and then ebb? Or could these cyclones, each nearly as wide as the continental U.S., be more permanent fixtures? With each flyby, the data reinforced the idea that five windstorms were swirling in a pentagonal pattern around a central storm at the south pole and that the system seemed stable. None of the six storms showed signs of yielding to allow other cyclones to join in. \"It almost appeared like the polar cyclones were part of a private club that seemed to resist new members,\" said Bolton. Then, during Juno's 22nd science pass, a new, smaller cyclone churned to life and joined the fray. \"Data from Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper JIRAM instrument indicates we went from a pentagon of cyclones surrounding one at the center to a hexagonal arrangement,\" said Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome. \"This new addition is smaller in stature than its six more established cyclonic brothers: It's about the size of Texas. Maybe JIRAM data from future flybys will show the cyclone growing to the same size as its neighbors,\" Mura stated. The spacecraft's JunoCam also obtained visible-light imagery of the new cyclone. The two datasets shed light on atmospheric processes of not just Jupiter but also fellow gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune as well as those of giant exoplanets now being discovered; they even shed light on atmospheric processes of Earth's cyclones. \"These cyclones are new weather phenomena that have not been seen or predicted before,\" said Cheng Li, a Juno scientist from the University of California, Berkeley. \"Nature is revealing new physics regarding fluid motions and how giant planet atmospheres work. We are beginning to grasp it through observations and computer simulations. Future Juno flybys will help us further refine our understanding by revealing how the cyclones evolve over time.\" Of course, the new cyclone would never have been discovered if Juno had frozen to death during the eclipse when Jupiter got between the spacecraft and the Sun's heat and light rays. Juno has been navigating in deep space since 2011. It entered an initial 53-day orbit around Jupiter on July 4th, 2016. Originally, the mission planned to reduce the size of its orbit a few months later to shorten the period between science flybys of the gas giant to every 14 days. But the project team recommended to NASA to forgo the main engine burn due to concerns about the spacecraft's fuel delivery system. Juno's 53-day orbit provides all the science as originally planned; it just takes longer to do so. Juno's longer life at Jupiter is what led to the need to avoid Jupiter's shadow. \"Ever since the day we entered orbit around Jupiter, we made sure it remained bathed in sunlight 24/7,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Our navigators and engineers told us a day of reckoning was coming, when we would go into Jupiter's shadow for about 12 hours. We knew that for such an extended period without power, our spacecraft would suffer a similar fate as the Opportunity rover, when the skies of Mars filled with dust and blocked the Sun's rays from reaching its solar panels.\" Without the Sun's rays providing power, Juno would be chilled below tested levels, eventually draining its battery cells beyond recovery. So the navigation team set devised a plan to \"jump the shadow,\" maneuvering the spacecraft just enough so its trajectory would miss the eclipse. \"In deep space, you are either in sunlight or your out of sunlight; there really is no in-between,\" said Levin. The navigators calculated that if Juno performed a rocket burn weeks in advance of November 3rd, while the spacecraft was as far in its orbit from Jupiter as it gets, they could modify its trajectory enough to give the eclipse the slip. The maneuver would utilize the spacecraft's reaction control system, which wasn't initially intended to be used for a maneuver of this size and duration. On September 30th, at 6:46pm CDT, the reaction control system burn began. It ended 10 \u00bd hours later. The propulsive maneuver - five times longer than any previous use of that system - changed Juno's orbital velocity by 126 mph and consumed about 160 pounds of fuel. Thirty-four days later, the spacecraft's solar arrays continued to convert sunlight into electrons unabated as Juno prepared to scream once again over Jupiter's cloud tops. \"Thanks to our navigators and engineers, we still have a mission,\" said Bolton. \"What they did is more than just make our cyclone discovery possible; they made possible the new insights and revelations about Jupiter that lie ahead of us.\" NASA's JPL manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.

But now, new data from NASA's Juno mission suggests that the gas giant might be wetter than previously thought. According to NASA, about 0.25% of Jupiter's atmosphere consists of water, which is three times more than the Sun. But, these figures are based on the amount of hydrogen and oxygen recorded by Juno. In contrast, the Galileo spacecraft recorded and transmitted the spectrographic measurements of water vapour in the Jovian atmosphere in 1995. The data from Galileo found that the water in Jupiter's atmosphere was about ten times less than expected. But, the new Juno discovery made scientists curious about the Galileo data. It was then found using an infrared map captured during the same time as Galileo data that the particular region of the atmosphere was drier and warmer than its surrounding. This suggests that the moisture in Jupiter's atmosphere is not uniformly mixed but rather varies heavily depending on various conditions. Even data from Galileo showed that moisture content increased as it delved deeper into Jupiter's atmosphere. The new discovery has just added to the elusive mystery of water on the gas giant. Juno's principal investigator Scott Bolton from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio explained, \"Juno's surprise discovery that the atmosphere was not well mixed even well below the cloud tops is a puzzle that we are still trying to figure out. No one would have guessed that water might be so variable across the planet.\" The team is looking forward to the new data from Juno's next flyby when its orbit transitions northward towards the polar storms of Jupiter.

Some of its clouds rise up above the surrounding cloud tops. The two bright spots in the right center of this image are much higher than the surrounding clouds. Jupiter's atmosphere is a swirling, colourful, chaotic mix-up of currents and eddies. Thanks to NASA's Juno spacecraft, we know that Jupiter's swirling bands of clouds can extend deep into the planet. They go as deep as 3,000 km Jupiter's atmosphere is the deepest of any planet in the Solar System. Jupiter has no solid surface, but the atmosphere is generally considered to end at the point where the pressure reaches 100 kPa. Though what scientist call the cloud layer may only be about 50 km deep, Jupiter's atmospheric bands can extend down to a much greater depth. If this sounds a little confusing, it's because Jupiter's atmosphere and internal structure are very complex. Exactly how deep Jupiter's storm bands went has been a mystery for decades. Juno was able to measure them with its Gravity Science instrument. The deeper the cloud streams are, the more mass they contain, which the Gravity Science instrument was able to measure. This new image of bright spots rising up above the rest of Jupiter's clouds comes from citizen scientist Gerald Eichst\u00e4dt.

Lo and behold, first thing out of the gate on the other side, we make another fundamental discovery.\" When Juno first arrived at Jupiter in July 2016, its infrared and visible- light cameras discovered giant cyclones encircling the planet's poles - nine in the north and six in the south. Were they, like their Earthly siblings, a transient phenomenon, taking only weeks to develop and then ebb? Or could these cyclones, each nearly as wide as the continental U.S., be more permanent fixtures? With each flyby, the data reinforced the idea that five windstorms were swirling in a pentagonal pattern around a central storm at the south pole and that the system seemed stable. None of the six storms showed signs of yielding to allow other cyclones to join in. \"It almost appeared like the polar cyclones were part of a private club that seemed to resist new members,\" said Bolton. Then, during Juno's 22nd science pass, a new, smaller cyclone churned to life and joined the fray. \"Data from Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper JIRAM instrument indicates we went from a pentagon of cyclones surrounding one at the center to a hexagonal arrangement,\" said Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome. \"This new addition is smaller in stature than its six more established cyclonic brothers: It's about the size of Texas. Maybe JIRAM data from future flybys will show the cyclone growing to the same size as its neighbors,\" Mura stated. The spacecraft's JunoCam also obtained visible-light imagery of the new cyclone. The two datasets shed light on atmospheric processes of not just Jupiter but also fellow gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune as well as those of giant exoplanets now being discovered; they even shed light on atmospheric processes of Earth's cyclones. \"These cyclones are new weather phenomena that have not been seen or predicted before,\" said Cheng Li, a Juno scientist from the University of California, Berkeley. \"Nature is revealing new physics regarding fluid motions and how giant planet atmospheres work. We are beginning to grasp it through observations and computer simulations. Future Juno flybys will help us further refine our understanding by revealing how the cyclones evolve over time.\" Of course, the new cyclone would never have been discovered if Juno had frozen to death during the eclipse when Jupiter got between the spacecraft and the Sun's heat and light rays. Juno has been navigating in deep space since 2011. It entered an initial 53-day orbit around Jupiter on July 4th, 2016. Originally, the mission planned to reduce the size of its orbit a few months later to shorten the period between science flybys of the gas giant to every 14 days. But the project team recommended to NASA to forgo the main engine burn due to concerns about the spacecraft's fuel delivery system. Juno's 53-day orbit provides all the science as originally planned; it just takes longer to do so. Juno's longer life at Jupiter is what led to the need to avoid Jupiter's shadow. \"Ever since the day we entered orbit around Jupiter, we made sure it remained bathed in sunlight 24/7,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Our navigators and engineers told us a day of reckoning was coming, when we would go into Jupiter's shadow for about 12 hours. We knew that for such an extended period without power, our spacecraft would suffer a similar fate as the Opportunity rover, when the skies of Mars filled with dust and blocked the Sun's rays from reaching its solar panels.\" Without the Sun's rays providing power, Juno would be chilled below tested levels, eventually draining its battery cells beyond recovery. So the navigation team set devised a plan to \"jump the shadow,\" maneuvering the spacecraft just enough so its trajectory would miss the eclipse. \"In deep space, you are either in sunlight or your out of sunlight; there really is no in-between,\" said Levin. The navigators calculated that if Juno performed a rocket burn weeks in advance of November 3rd, while the spacecraft was as far in its orbit from Jupiter as it gets, they could modify its trajectory enough to give the eclipse the slip. The maneuver would utilize the spacecraft's reaction control system, which wasn't initially intended to be used for a maneuver of this size and duration. On September 30th, at 6:46pm CDT, the reaction control system burn began. It ended 10 \u00bd hours later. The propulsive maneuver - five times longer than any previous use of that system - changed Juno's orbital velocity by 126 mph and consumed about 160 pounds of fuel. Thirty-four days later, the spacecraft's solar arrays continued to convert sunlight into electrons unabated as Juno prepared to scream once again over Jupiter's cloud tops. \"Thanks to our navigators and engineers, we still have a mission,\" said Bolton. \"What they did is more than just make our cyclone discovery possible; they made possible the new insights and revelations about Jupiter that lie ahead of us.\" NASA's JPL manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.

More than 400 years later, astronomers will use NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe these famous subjects, pushing the observatory's instruments to their fullest capabilities and laying the groundwork for far- reaching scientific discovery. A diverse team of more than 40 researchers, led by astronomers Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley and Thierry Fouchet of the Observatoire de Paris, have designed an ambitious observing program that will conduct some of Webb's first scientific observations in the solar system-- studying Jupiter, its ring system, and two of its moons: Ganymede and Io. \"It will be a really challenging experiment,\" said de Pater. \"Jupiter is so bright, and Webb's instruments are so sensitive, that observing both the bright planet and its fainter rings and moons will be an excellent test of how to get the most out of Webb's innovative technology.\" In addition to calibrating Webb's instruments for Jupiter's brightness, astronomers must also take into account the planet's rotation, because Jupiter completes one day in only 10 hours. Several images must be stitched together in a mosaic to fully capture a certain area--the famous storm known as the Great Red Spot, for example--a task made more difficult when the object itself is moving. While many telescopes have studied Jupiter and its storms, Webb's large mirror and powerful instruments will provide new insights. \"We know that the immediate atmosphere above the Great Red Spot is colder than other areas of Jupiter, but at higher altitudes, in the mesosphere, the atmosphere appears to be warmer. We will use Webb to investigate this phenomenon,\" de Pater said. Webb will also examine the atmosphere of the polar region, where NASA's Juno spacecraft discovered clusters of cyclones. Webb's spectroscopic data will provide much more detail than has been possible in past observations, measuring winds, cloud particles, gas composition, and temperature. Future solar system observations of the giant planets with Webb will benefit from the lessons learned in these early observations of the Jovian system. The team is tasked with developing methods for working with Webb observations of solar system planets, which can be used later by other scientists. All four of the gas giant planets of the solar system have rings, with Saturn's being the most prominent. Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts: a flat main ring; a halo inside the main ring, shaped like a double- convex lens; and the gossamer ring, exterior to the main ring. Jupiter's ring system is exceptionally faint because the particles that make up the rings are so small and sparse that they do not reflect much light. Next to the brightness of the planet they practically disappear, presenting a challenge for astronomers. \"We are really pushing the capabilities of some of Webb's instruments to the limit to get a unique new set of observations,\" said co-investigator Michael Wong of the University of California, Berkeley. The team will test observing strategies to deal with Jupiter's scattered light, and build models for use by other astronomers, including those studying exoplanets orbiting bright stars. The team will look to make new discoveries in the rings as well. De Pater noted that there may be undiscovered \"ephemeral moonlets\" in the dynamic ring system, and potential ripples in the ring from comet impacts, like those observed and traced back to the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994. Several features of icy Ganymede make it fascinating for astronomers. Aside from being the largest moon in the solar system, and larger even than the planet Mercury, it is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field. The team will investigate the very outer parts of Ganymede's atmosphere, its exosphere, to better understand the moon's interaction with particles in Jupiter's magnetic field. There is also evidence that Ganymede may have a liquid saltwater ocean beneath its thick surface ice, which Webb will investigate with detailed spectroscopic study of surface salts and other compounds. The team's experience studying Ganymede's surface may be useful in the future study of other icy solar system moons suspected of having subsurface oceans, including Saturn's moon Enceladus and fellow Jovian satellite Europa. In dramatic contrast to Ganymede is the other moon the team will study, Io, the most volcanically active world in the solar system. The dynamic surface is covered with hundreds of huge volcanoes that would dwarf those on Earth, as well as lakes of molten lava and smooth floodplains of solidified lava. Astronomers plan to use Webb to learn more about the effects of Io's volcanos on its atmosphere. \"There is still much we don't know about Io's atmospheric temperature structure, because we haven't had the data to distinguish the temperature at different altitudes,\" said de Pater. \"On Earth we take for granted that as you hike up a mountain, the air gets cooler--would it be the same on Io? Right now we don't know, but Webb may help us to find out.\" Another mystery Webb will investigate on Io is the existence of \"stealth volcanoes,\" which emit plumes of gas without the light-reflecting dust that can be detected by spacecraft like NASA's Voyager and Galileo missions, and so have thus far gone undetected. Webb's high spatial resolution will be able to isolate individual volcanoes that previously would have appeared as one large hotspot, allowing astronomers to gather detailed data on Io's geology. Webb will also provide unprecedented data on the temperature of Io's hotspots, and determine if they are closer to volcanism on Earth today, or if they have a much higher temperature, similar to the environment on Earth in the early years after its formation. Previous observations by the Galileo mission and ground observatories have hinted at these high temperatures; Webb will follow up on that research and provide new evidence that may settle the question. Webb's detailed observations will not supplant those of other observatories, but rather coordinate with them, Wong explained. \"Webb's spectroscopic observations will cover just a small area of the planet, so global views from ground-based observatories can show how the detailed Webb data fit in with what's happening on a larger scale, similar to how Hubble and the Gemini Observatory provide context for Juno's narrow, close-up observations.\" In turn, Webb's study of Jupiter's storms and atmosphere will complement Juno data, including radio signals from lightning, which Webb does not detect. \"No one observatory or spacecraft can do it all,\" Wong said, \"so we are very excited about combining data from multiple observatories to tell us much more than we could learn from only a single source.\" This research is being conducted as part of a Webb Early Release Science program. This program provides time to selected projects early in the observatory's mission, allowing researchers to quickly learn how best to use Webb's capabilities, while also yielding robust science.

Here's a breathtaking image of Jupiter's turbulent northern regions during the spacecraft's super-close encounter with the hulking planet on Feb. 17, 2020. Those long, thin bands that streak through the middle of the image from top to bottom are layers of haze particles that hang just above the underlying cloud formations. Juno has captured these luminous marks ever since its initial close-up pass by Jupiter back in 2016. Scientists are uncertain about precisely what these hazy highways are comprised of or exactly how they are generated. Twin jet streams in the gas giant's atmosphere bookend the borders of this region where the stripes of haze normally appear, offering researchers perhaps a clue that those jet streams could contribute to the creation of Jupiter's lofty hazes. So if you're looking for something to do during the COVID-19 lockdown, this might occupy your mind! This particularly striking JunoCam image was processed by citizen scientist Gerald Eichst\u00e4dt as the Juno probe executed its 25th intimate rendezvous of Jupiter when the spacecraft was 15,610 miles from it cloud tops at a latitude of approximately 71 degrees North.

More than 400 years later, astronomers will use NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe these famous subjects, pushing the observatory's instruments to their fullest capabilities and laying the groundwork for far- reaching scientific discovery. A diverse team of more than 40 researchers, led by astronomers Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley and Thierry Fouchet of the Observatoire de Paris, have designed an ambitious observing program that will conduct some of Webb's first scientific observations in the solar system-- studying Jupiter, its ring system, and two of its moons: Ganymede and Io. \"It will be a really challenging experiment,\" said de Pater. \"Jupiter is so bright, and Webb's instruments are so sensitive, that observing both the bright planet and its fainter rings and moons will be an excellent test of how to get the most out of Webb's innovative technology.\" In addition to calibrating Webb's instruments for Jupiter's brightness, astronomers must also take into account the planet's rotation, because Jupiter completes one day in only 10 hours. Several images must be stitched together in a mosaic to fully capture a certain area--the famous storm known as the Great Red Spot, for example--a task made more difficult when the object itself is moving. While many telescopes have studied Jupiter and its storms, Webb's large mirror and powerful instruments will provide new insights. \"We know that the immediate atmosphere above the Great Red Spot is colder than other areas of Jupiter, but at higher altitudes, in the mesosphere, the atmosphere appears to be warmer. We will use Webb to investigate this phenomenon,\" de Pater said. Webb will also examine the atmosphere of the polar region, where NASA's Juno spacecraft discovered clusters of cyclones. Webb's spectroscopic data will provide much more detail than has been possible in past observations, measuring winds, cloud particles, gas composition, and temperature. Future solar system observations of the giant planets with Webb will benefit from the lessons learned in these early observations of the Jovian system. The team is tasked with developing methods for working with Webb observations of solar system planets, which can be used later by other scientists. All four of the gas giant planets of the solar system have rings, with Saturn's being the most prominent. Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts: a flat main ring; a halo inside the main ring, shaped like a double- convex lens; and the gossamer ring, exterior to the main ring. Jupiter's ring system is exceptionally faint because the particles that make up the rings are so small and sparse that they do not reflect much light. Next to the brightness of the planet they practically disappear, presenting a challenge for astronomers. \"We are really pushing the capabilities of some of Webb's instruments to the limit to get a unique new set of observations,\" said co-investigator Michael Wong of the University of California, Berkeley. The team will test observing strategies to deal with Jupiter's scattered light, and build models for use by other astronomers, including those studying exoplanets orbiting bright stars. The team will look to make new discoveries in the rings as well. De Pater noted that there may be undiscovered \"ephemeral moonlets\" in the dynamic ring system, and potential ripples in the ring from comet impacts, like those observed and traced back to the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994. Several features of icy Ganymede make it fascinating for astronomers. Aside from being the largest moon in the solar system, and larger even than the planet Mercury, it is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field. The team will investigate the very outer parts of Ganymede's atmosphere, its exosphere, to better understand the moon's interaction with particles in Jupiter's magnetic field. There is also evidence that Ganymede may have a liquid saltwater ocean beneath its thick surface ice, which Webb will investigate with detailed spectroscopic study of surface salts and other compounds. The team's experience studying Ganymede's surface may be useful in the future study of other icy solar system moons suspected of having subsurface oceans, including Saturn's moon Enceladus and fellow Jovian satellite Europa. In dramatic contrast to Ganymede is the other moon the team will study, Io, the most volcanically active world in the solar system. The dynamic surface is covered with hundreds of huge volcanoes that would dwarf those on Earth, as well as lakes of molten lava and smooth floodplains of solidified lava. Astronomers plan to use Webb to learn more about the effects of Io's volcanos on its atmosphere. \"There is still much we don't know about Io's atmospheric temperature structure, because we haven't had the data to distinguish the temperature at different altitudes,\" said de Pater. \"On Earth we take for granted that as you hike up a mountain, the air gets cooler--would it be the same on Io? Right now we don't know, but Webb may help us to find out.\" Another mystery Webb will investigate on Io is the existence of \"stealth volcanoes,\" which emit plumes of gas without the light-reflecting dust that can be detected by spacecraft like NASA's Voyager and Galileo missions, and so have thus far gone undetected. Webb's high spatial resolution will be able to isolate individual volcanoes that previously would have appeared as one large hotspot, allowing astronomers to gather detailed data on Io's geology. Webb will also provide unprecedented data on the temperature of Io's hotspots, and determine if they are closer to volcanism on Earth today, or if they have a much higher temperature, similar to the environment on Earth in the early years after its formation. Previous observations by the Galileo mission and ground observatories have hinted at these high temperatures; Webb will follow up on that research and provide new evidence that may settle the question. Webb's detailed observations will not supplant those of other observatories, but rather coordinate with them, Wong explained. \"Webb's spectroscopic observations will cover just a small area of the planet, so global views from ground-based observatories can show how the detailed Webb data fit in with what's happening on a larger scale, similar to how Hubble and the Gemini Observatory provide context for Juno's narrow, close-up observations.\" In turn, Webb's study of Jupiter's storms and atmosphere will complement Juno data, including radio signals from lightning, which Webb does not detect. \"No one observatory or spacecraft can do it all,\" Wong said, \"so we are very excited about combining data from multiple observatories to tell us much more than we could learn from only a single source.\" This research is being conducted as part of a Webb Early Release Science program. This program provides time to selected projects early in the observatory's mission, allowing researchers to quickly learn how best to use Webb's capabilities, while also yielding robust science. The James Webb Space Telescope will be the world's premier space science observatory when it launches in 2021. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.

Buckle up and enjoy the trip, accompanied by ambient tunes by Vangelis! Nearing the spacecraft's closest proximity to Jupiter, the monster world's intense gravitational tug actually gave Juno a boost and sped up the spacecraft up to a blistering 130,000 mph relative to the planet, according to a NASA statement.

Unlike anything you've seen before, NASA has released an extreme false color rendering of an image of the Jupiter cyclones from its Juno mission. In the image, these cyclones can be seen as swirls of striking colors on the planet, making a beautiful masterpiece that depicts the wonders of outer space in a scientific appearance.

This data was recorded by the JunoCam instrument aboard the spacecraft during one of its four close passes by Jupiter. This one took place between February 17, 2020, and July 25, 2020. The image is not the way the cyclones on Jupiter look in real life. Instead, the exaggerated colours are in part, a result of combining many individual images to create this view, says NASA in a recent release.

During the course of a 30-second spin, UVS observes a swath of the planet. The UVS instrument has occasionally observed short-lived, localized ultraviolet emissions outside of the auroral zone, including a singular event on April 10, 2020. \"This observation is from a tiny snapshot in time - Juno is a spinning spacecraft, and our instrument observed that point on the planet for just 17 milliseconds, and we don't know what happened to the bright flash outside of that time frame,\" Giles said, \"But we do know that we didn't see it on an earlier spin or a later spin, so it must have been pretty short-lived.\" Previously, UVS had observed a set of eleven bright transient flashes that lasted 1 to 2 milliseconds. They were identified as Transient Luminous Events, an upper atmospheric phenomenon triggered by lightning. The team initially thought this bright flash might be a TLE, however, it was different in two key ways. While it was also short-lived, it lasted at least 17 milliseconds, much longer than a TLE. It also had very different spectral characteristics. Spectra of TLEs and auroras feature emissions of molecular hydrogen, the main component of Jupiter's atmosphere. This bolide event had a smooth \"blackbody'' curve, which is what is expected from a meteor. \"The flash duration and spectral shape match up well with what we expect from an impact,\" Giles said. \"This bright flash stood out in the data, as it had very different spectral characteristics than the UV emissions from the Jupiter's auroras. From the UV spectrum, we can see that the emission came from blackbody with a temperature of 9600 Kelvin, located at an altitude of 140 miles above the planet's cloud tops. By looking at the brightness of the bright flash, we estimate that it was caused by an impactor with a mass of 550-3,300 pounds.\" Comet Shoemaker-Levy was the largest observed Jupiter impactor. The comet broke apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, which was closely observed by astronomers worldwide and the Galileo spacecraft. An SwRI- led team detected impact-related X-ray emissions from Jupiter's northern hemisphere, and prominent scars from the impacts persisted for many months. \"Impacts from asteroids and comets can have a significant impact on the planet's stratospheric chemistry - 15 years after the impact, comet Shoemaker Levy 9 was still responsible for 95% of the stratospheric water on Jupiter,\" Giles said. \"Continuing to observe impacts and estimating the overall impact rates is therefore an important element of understanding the planet's composition.\" The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Dr. Scott J.

New results from the Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument on NASA's Juno mission reveal for the first time the birth of auroral dawn storms - the early morning brightening unique to Jupiter's spectacular aurorae. These immense, transient displays of light occur at both Jovian poles and had previously been observed only by ground-based and Earth-orbiting observatories, notably NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Results of this study were published March 16 in the journal AGU Advances. First discovered by Hubble's Faint Object Camera in 1994, dawn storms consist of short-lived but intense brightening and broadening of Jupiter's main auroral oval - an oblong curtain of light that surrounds both poles - near where the atmosphere emerges from darkness in the early morning region. Before Juno, observations of Jovian ultraviolet aurora had offered only side views, hiding everything happening on the nightside of the planet. \"Observing Jupiter's aurora from Earth does not allow you to see beyond the limb, into the nightside of Jupiter's poles. Explorations by other spacecraft - Voyager, Galileo, Cassini - happened from relatively large distances and did not fly over the poles, so they could not see the complete picture,\" said Bertrand Bonfond, a researcher from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium and lead author of the study. \"That's why the Juno data is a real game changer, allowing us a better understanding what is happening on the nightside, where the dawn storms are born.\" Researchers found dawn storms are born on the nightside of the gas giant. As the planet rotates, the soon-to-be dawn storm rotates with it into the dayside, where these complex and intensely bright auroral features grow even more luminous, emitting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of gigawatts of ultraviolet light into space. The jump in brightness implies that dawn storms are dumping at least 10 times more energy into Jupiter's upper atmosphere than typical aurora. \"When we looked at the whole dawn storm sequence, we couldn't help but notice that they are very similar to a type of terrestrial auroras called substorms,\" said Zhonghua Yao, co-author of the study at the University of Li\u00e8ge.\" Substorms result from brief disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere - the region of space controlled by the planet's magnetic field - that release energy high into the planet's ionosphere. The similarity between terrestrial and Jovian substorms is surprising because the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Earth are radically different. On Earth, the magnetosphere is essentially controlled by the interaction of the solar wind - the stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun - with Earth's magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetosphere is mostly populated by particles escaping from the volcanic moon Io, which then get ionized and trapped around the gas giant via its magnetic field. These new findings will allow scientists to further study the differences and similarities driving the formation of aurora, providing a better understanding how these most beautiful of planetary phenomena occur on worlds both within our solar system and beyond. \"The power that Jupiter possesses is amazing. The energy in these dawn aurorae is yet another example of how powerful this giant planet really is,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The dawn storm revelations are another surprise from the Juno mission, which is constantly rewriting the book on how giant planet's work.

New results from the Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument on NASA's Juno mission reveal for the first time the birth of auroral dawn storms - the early morning brightening unique to Jupiter's spectacular aurorae. These immense, transient displays of light occur at both Jovian poles and had previously been observed only by ground-based and Earth-orbiting observatories, notably NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Results of this study were published March 16 in the journal AGU Advances. First discovered by Hubble's Faint Object Camera in 1994, dawn storms consist of short-lived but intense brightening and broadening of Jupiter's main auroral oval - an oblong curtain of light that surrounds both poles - near where the atmosphere emerges from darkness in the early morning region. Before Juno, observations of Jovian ultraviolet aurora had offered only side views, hiding everything happening on the nightside of the planet. \"Observing Jupiter's aurora from Earth does not allow you to see beyond the limb, into the nightside of Jupiter's poles. Explorations by other spacecraft - Voyager, Galileo, Cassini - happened from relatively large distances and did not fly over the poles, so they could not see the complete picture,\" said Bertrand Bonfond, a researcher from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium and lead author of the study. \"That's why the Juno data is a real game changer, allowing us a better understanding what is happening on the nightside, where the dawn storms are born.\" Researchers found dawn storms are born on the nightside of the gas giant. As the planet rotates, the soon-to-be dawn storm rotates with it into the dayside, where these complex and intensely bright auroral features grow even more luminous, emitting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of gigawatts of ultraviolet light into space. The jump in brightness implies that dawn storms are dumping at least 10 times more energy into Jupiter's upper atmosphere than typical aurora. \"When we looked at the whole dawn storm sequence, we couldn't help but notice that they are very similar to a type of terrestrial auroras called substorms,\" said Zhonghua Yao, co-author of the study at the University of Li\u00e8ge.\" Substorms result from brief disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere - the region of space controlled by the planet's magnetic field - that release energy high into the planet's ionosphere. The similarity between terrestrial and Jovian substorms is surprising because the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Earth are radically different. On Earth, the magnetosphere is essentially controlled by the interaction of the solar wind - the stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun - with Earth's magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetosphere is mostly populated by particles escaping from the volcanic moon Io, which then get ionized and trapped around the gas giant via its magnetic field. These new findings will allow scientists to further study the differences and similarities driving the formation of aurora, providing a better understanding how these most beautiful of planetary phenomena occur on worlds both within our solar system and beyond. \"The power that Jupiter possesses is amazing.

Ganymede is not only the gas giant's biggest moon, it's also the most massive in the entire solar system, with a diameter greater than the planet Mercury. Galilean satellites represent the four largest moons of Jupiter - Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto. These remarkable shots were obtained via the probe's JunoCam and were snapped during its closest pass on Monday, Jun. 7. The JunoCam imaging system had a narrow window of only 25 minutes to take these photos, long enough to capture five exposures before closing in on Jupiter for the 33rd time. \"Things usually happen pretty quick in the world of flybys ... every second counts,\" noted Juno Mission Manager Matt Johnson of JPL in an official statement. This past Monday, Juno streaked past Ganymede at 12 miles per second before zipping over Jupiter's thick cloud tops at 36 miles per second on Tuesday. Juno's scientific team will now scrutinize the images and compare them to those pics from earlier missions, watching for alterations in surface features since Ganymede was last photographed by Galileo two decades ago. Juno already had a quick peek at Ganymede back on Dec. 26, 2019, when it delivered the first-ever photographs of its north pole, but this week's flyby is the closest encounter of the huge moon. \"As Juno passes behind Ganymede, radio signals will pass through Ganymede's ionosphere, causing small changes in the frequency that should be picked up by two antennas at the Deep Space Network's Canberra complex in Australia,\" said Dustin Buccino, a signal analysis engineer for the Juno mission at JPL. \"If we can measure this change, we might be able to understand the connection between Ganymede's ionosphere, its intrinsic magnetic field, and Jupiter's magnetosphere.\" Juno has recently finished its main five-year mission surveying Jupiter, a situation that now sees the craft repositioned in a new, shorter orbit of the red-eyed planet. This trajectory will ensure that Juno gets close to two other moons of Jupiter during its final 42 orbits through 2025. Currently the furthest solar-powered probe from Earth, Juno will eventually get to within 200 miles of Europa on Sep. 29, 2022 before a double flyby of Io, when the spacecraft will soar within 900 miles of the surface on Dec. 30, 2023 and on Feb. 3, 2024. \"Juno carries a suite of sensitive instruments capable of seeing Ganymede in ways never before possible,\" explained Bolton. \"By flying so close, we will bring the exploration of Ganymede into the 21st century, both complementing future missions with our unique sensors and helping prepare for the next generation of missions to the Jovian system-NASA's Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/first-wave-of-ganymede-images-arrive-from-nasas-juno-spacecraft"}, {"title": "NASA's Juno orbiter captured striking close-ups of Jupiter's biggest moon", "date": "2021-06-14", "content": "In ancient mythology, the Roman god Jupiter uses a veil of clouds to conceal his mischief from his wife Juno. NASA's Juno spacecraft has spent three years looking beneath the clouds of our similarly secretive and distant planetary neighbor, Jupiter. But recently, Juno got up close and personal with a different celestial body. Juno's original mission was to learn about Jupiter's formation, magnetic field, and composition under its surface clouds. But in its extended mission, it's going far beyond that. On Monday, June 7, the spacecraft shot past Jupiter's Ganymede-the largest moon in the solar system-snapping a few quick but iconic images and taking readings of the moon's magnetic field from just over 600 miles away. The team of scientists running Juno is just starting to analyze the data, says Scott Bolton, the head of the mission and a space scientist at the Southwestern Research Institute. But they've already posted two close-up pictures which show the icy moon's cratered and craggy surface in detail. The flyby was the closest look we've had at Ganymede since the Galileo mission 20 years prior. One image was taken by JunoCam, the craft's signature camera, but the other was taken by a navigational camera which, through clever use, was also able to measure radiation levels near the Jupiter moon. As the camera took pictures, charged particles would hit its sensor, leaving little dots, squiggles, or streaks in the image that scientists could use to approximate radiation levels. The use of a navigational camera for this measurement \"is one of the aspects that does surprise me,\" says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan who has studied Jupiter's moons and planetary magnetic fields but was not involved in the Juno mission. As the saying goes, one instrument's noise is another's instrument's signal, he says. It's part of the Juno team's philosophy to squeeze every possible bit of science from the craft, Bolton says. \"We look at every engineering sensor and think, 'What can we do with it scientifically?' It's giving us some kind of data.\" For example, when a camera unintentionally caught the impacts of dust particles on Juno's solar panels, that \"serendipitous\" data helped scientists gain new insights about zodiacal light and the inner solar system's dust cloud. The Juno team also used a method called radio occultation. But fear not-it has nothing to do with satanic rituals. Instead, it measures the moon's ionosphere, a section of its thin atmosphere where radiation knocks the electrons off gas molecules. To do this, Juno sends a signal to Earth while positioned behind the moon's atmosphere, so that it passes through Ganymede's ionosphere and on to a receiver on Earth in Canberra, Australia. The charged particles in the ionosphere nudge the frequencies of the signal such that the team can, through a kind of reverse engineering, learn about the magnetic field causing the interference. The technique is common, Jia says, \"but it highly depends on the geometry of the flyby.\" To work, the objects need to line up perfectly, with a straight path between the craft, the magnetosphere, and Earth. The magnetic environment around Ganymede is particularly interesting, Jia says, because it's a small magnetosphere within a large one-that of Ganymede bubbled inside that of Jupiter. That makes it a natural laboratory to study plasma physics, he says. Other mysteries abound when it comes to Ganymede. For one thing, images show lines that scratch across the ice on its surface-and we aren't sure what caused them. Tectonic faults could have caused these features, Bolton says, or some other process. For all we know, they could still be forming, he adds. Bolton is most excited about the microwave measurements Juno captured during the flyby, which will make a map of Ganymede's surface using six different wavelengths. \"That'll be really the first detailed map of the ice,\" Bolton says. The microwave readings could tell us about \"the composition of the ice, the temperature of the ice, possibly the thickness of the ice,\" Bolton says. The team will compare readings across the light and dark regions of the moon's surface, and across craters and those mysterious tectonic lines. Soon, the team will share more images from the flyby, Bolton says, and the curious among us can download and toy with JunoCam's raw images themselves. He's excited to see what the community does with them. Juno's flyby also serves as a run-up for two other missions that will explore the Jovian moons. NASA's Clipper mission will target Europa, and the European Space Agency's JUICE will study Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Juno's data will help both teams plan their missions, and because the sensors carried by each mission differ, Bolton says, \"We complement them as well.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/science/nasa-captures-ganymede-flyby/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Juno spacecraft shows off a gorgeously glam side of Jupiter", "date": "2021-02-10", "content": "We're all pumped for the NASA Perseverance rover's arrival at Mars next week, but let's not forget some of the other incredible missions at work in the solar system.

The UVS instrument has occasionally observed short-lived, localized ultraviolet emissions outside of the auroral zone, including a singular event on April 10, 2020. \"This observation is from a tiny snapshot in time - Juno is a spinning spacecraft, and our instrument observed that point on the planet for just 17 milliseconds, and we don't know what happened to the bright flash outside of that time frame,\" Giles said, \"But we do know that we didn't see it on an earlier spin or a later spin, so it must have been pretty short-lived.\" Previously, UVS had observed a set of eleven bright transient flashes that lasted 1 to 2 milliseconds. They were identified as Transient Luminous Events, an upper atmospheric phenomenon triggered by lightning. The team initially thought this bright flash might be a TLE, however, it was different in two key ways. While it was also short-lived, it lasted at least 17 milliseconds, much longer than a TLE. It also had very different spectral characteristics. Spectra of TLEs and auroras feature emissions of molecular hydrogen, the main component of Jupiter's atmosphere. This bolide event had a smooth \"blackbody'' curve, which is what is expected from a meteor. \"The flash duration and spectral shape match up well with what we expect from an impact,\" Giles said. \"This bright flash stood out in the data, as it had very different spectral characteristics than the UV emissions from the Jupiter's auroras. From the UV spectrum, we can see that the emission came from blackbody with a temperature of 9600 Kelvin, located at an altitude of 140 miles above the planet's cloud tops. By looking at the brightness of the bright flash, we estimate that it was caused by an impactor with a mass of 550-3,300 pounds.\" Comet Shoemaker-Levy was the largest observed Jupiter impactor. The comet broke apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, which was closely observed by astronomers worldwide and the Galileo spacecraft. An SwRI- led team detected impact-related X-ray emissions from Jupiter's northern hemisphere, and prominent scars from the impacts persisted for many months. \"Impacts from asteroids and comets can have a significant impact on the planet's stratospheric chemistry - 15 years after the impact, comet Shoemaker Levy 9 was still responsible for 95% of the stratospheric water on Jupiter,\" Giles said. \"Continuing to observe impacts and estimating the overall impact rates is therefore an important element of understanding the planet's composition.\" The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Dr. Scott J. Bolton, of Southwest Research Institute.

New results from the Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument on NASA's Juno mission reveal for the first time the birth of auroral dawn storms - the early morning brightening unique to Jupiter's spectacular aurorae. These immense, transient displays of light occur at both Jovian poles and had previously been observed only by ground-based and Earth-orbiting observatories, notably NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Results of this study were published March 16 in the journal AGU Advances. First discovered by Hubble's Faint Object Camera in 1994, dawn storms consist of short-lived but intense brightening and broadening of Jupiter's main auroral oval - an oblong curtain of light that surrounds both poles - near where the atmosphere emerges from darkness in the early morning region. Before Juno, observations of Jovian ultraviolet aurora had offered only side views, hiding everything happening on the nightside of the planet. \"Observing Jupiter's aurora from Earth does not allow you to see beyond the limb, into the nightside of Jupiter's poles. Explorations by other spacecraft - Voyager, Galileo, Cassini - happened from relatively large distances and did not fly over the poles, so they could not see the complete picture,\" said Bertrand Bonfond, a researcher from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium and lead author of the study. \"That's why the Juno data is a real game changer, allowing us a better understanding what is happening on the nightside, where the dawn storms are born.\" Researchers found dawn storms are born on the nightside of the gas giant. As the planet rotates, the soon-to-be dawn storm rotates with it into the dayside, where these complex and intensely bright auroral features grow even more luminous, emitting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of gigawatts of ultraviolet light into space. The jump in brightness implies that dawn storms are dumping at least 10 times more energy into Jupiter's upper atmosphere than typical aurora. \"When we looked at the whole dawn storm sequence, we couldn't help but notice that they are very similar to a type of terrestrial auroras called substorms,\" said Zhonghua Yao, co-author of the study at the University of Li\u00e8ge.\" Substorms result from brief disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere - the region of space controlled by the planet's magnetic field - that release energy high into the planet's ionosphere. The similarity between terrestrial and Jovian substorms is surprising because the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Earth are radically different. On Earth, the magnetosphere is essentially controlled by the interaction of the solar wind - the stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun - with Earth's magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetosphere is mostly populated by particles escaping from the volcanic moon Io, which then get ionized and trapped around the gas giant via its magnetic field. These new findings will allow scientists to further study the differences and similarities driving the formation of aurora, providing a better understanding how these most beautiful of planetary phenomena occur on worlds both within our solar system and beyond. \"The power that Jupiter possesses is amazing. The energy in these dawn aurorae is yet another example of how powerful this giant planet really is,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"The dawn storm revelations are another surprise from the Juno mission, which is constantly rewriting the book on how giant planet's work.

Ganymede is not only the gas giant's biggest moon, it's also the most massive in the entire solar system, with a diameter greater than the planet Mercury. Galilean satellites represent the four largest moons of Jupiter - Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto. These remarkable shots were obtained via the probe's JunoCam and were snapped during its closest pass on Monday, Jun. 7. The JunoCam imaging system had a narrow window of only 25 minutes to take these photos, long enough to capture five exposures before closing in on Jupiter for the 33rd time. \"Things usually happen pretty quick in the world of flybys ... every second counts,\" noted Juno Mission Manager Matt Johnson of JPL in an official statement. This past Monday, Juno streaked past Ganymede at 12 miles per second before zipping over Jupiter's thick cloud tops at 36 miles per second on Tuesday. Juno's scientific team will now scrutinize the images and compare them to those pics from earlier missions, watching for alterations in surface features since Ganymede was last photographed by Galileo two decades ago. Juno already had a quick peek at Ganymede back on Dec. 26, 2019, when it delivered the first-ever photographs of its north pole, but this week's flyby is the closest encounter of the huge moon. \"As Juno passes behind Ganymede, radio signals will pass through Ganymede's ionosphere, causing small changes in the frequency that should be picked up by two antennas at the Deep Space Network's Canberra complex in Australia,\" said Dustin Buccino, a signal analysis engineer for the Juno mission at JPL. \"If we can measure this change, we might be able to understand the connection between Ganymede's ionosphere, its intrinsic magnetic field, and Jupiter's magnetosphere.\" Juno has recently finished its main five-year mission surveying Jupiter, a situation that now sees the craft repositioned in a new, shorter orbit of the red-eyed planet.

NASA's Juno spacecraft has spent three years looking beneath the clouds of our similarly secretive and distant planetary neighbor, Jupiter. But recently, Juno got up close and personal with a different celestial body. Juno's original mission was to learn about Jupiter's formation, magnetic field, and composition under its surface clouds. But in its extended mission, it's going far beyond that. On Monday, June 7, the spacecraft shot past Jupiter's Ganymede-the largest moon in the solar system-snapping a few quick but iconic images and taking readings of the moon's magnetic field from just over 600 miles away. The team of scientists running Juno is just starting to analyze the data, says Scott Bolton, the head of the mission and a space scientist at the Southwestern Research Institute. But they've already posted two close-up pictures which show the icy moon's cratered and craggy surface in detail. The flyby was the closest look we've had at Ganymede since the Galileo mission 20 years prior. One image was taken by JunoCam, the craft's signature camera, but the other was taken by a navigational camera which, through clever use, was also able to measure radiation levels near the Jupiter moon. As the camera took pictures, charged particles would hit its sensor, leaving little dots, squiggles, or streaks in the image that scientists could use to approximate radiation levels. The use of a navigational camera for this measurement \"is one of the aspects that does surprise me,\" says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan who has studied Jupiter's moons and planetary magnetic fields but was not involved in the Juno mission. As the saying goes, one instrument's noise is another's instrument's signal, he says. It's part of the Juno team's philosophy to squeeze every possible bit of science from the craft, Bolton says. \"We look at every engineering sensor and think, 'What can we do with it scientifically?' It's giving us some kind of data.\" For example, when a camera unintentionally caught the impacts of dust particles on Juno's solar panels, that \"serendipitous\" data helped scientists gain new insights about zodiacal light and the inner solar system's dust cloud. The Juno team also used a method called radio occultation. But fear not-it has nothing to do with satanic rituals. Instead, it measures the moon's ionosphere, a section of its thin atmosphere where radiation knocks the electrons off gas molecules. To do this, Juno sends a signal to Earth while positioned behind the moon's atmosphere, so that it passes through Ganymede's ionosphere and on to a receiver on Earth in Canberra, Australia. The charged particles in the ionosphere nudge the frequencies of the signal such that the team can, through a kind of reverse engineering, learn about the magnetic field causing the interference. The technique is common, Jia says, \"but it highly depends on the geometry of the flyby.\" To work, the objects need to line up perfectly, with a straight path between the craft, the magnetosphere, and Earth. The magnetic environment around Ganymede is particularly interesting, Jia says, because it's a small magnetosphere within a large one-that of Ganymede bubbled inside that of Jupiter. That makes it a natural laboratory to study plasma physics, he says. Other mysteries abound when it comes to Ganymede. For one thing, images show lines that scratch across the ice on its surface-and we aren't sure what caused them. Tectonic faults could have caused these features, Bolton says, or some other process. For all we know, they could still be forming, he adds. Bolton is most excited about the microwave measurements Juno captured during the flyby, which will make a map of Ganymede's surface using six different wavelengths. \"That'll be really the first detailed map of the ice,\" Bolton says. The microwave readings could tell us about \"the composition of the ice, the temperature of the ice, possibly the thickness of the ice,\" Bolton says. The team will compare readings across the light and dark regions of the moon's surface, and across craters and those mysterious tectonic lines. Soon, the team will share more images from the flyby, Bolton says, and the curious among us can download and toy with JunoCam's raw images themselves. He's excited to see what the community does with them. Juno's flyby also serves as a run-up for two other missions that will explore the Jovian moons. NASA's Clipper mission will target Europa, and the European Space Agency's JUICE will study Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Juno's data will help both teams plan their missions, and because the sensors carried by each mission differ, Bolton says, \"We complement them as well.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/science/nasa-captures-ganymede-flyby/"}, {"title": "NASA's Juno spacecraft flies past solar system's biggest moon, Jupiter.

Scientists are using infrared to better explore Jupiter's moon Ganymede, the largest moon in our solar system. As we mark 10 years since NASA's Juno mission launched from Earth, the craft has delivered stunning images from its orbit around Jupiter, including new infrared views of Ganymede captured during its latest flyby of the Jovian moon on July 20. Using Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper instrument, which detects in infrared light that is not visible to the human eye, the Juno science team has created a new infrared map of Ganymede, which they hope will help them to better understand the Jupiter moon's ice crust and the ocean lurking beneath, according to NASA. \"Ganymede is larger than the planet Mercury, but just about everything we explore on this mission to Jupiter is on a monumental scale,\" Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton, a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a NASA statement. \"The infrared and other data collected by Juno during the flyby contain fundamental clues for understanding the evolution of Jupiter's 79 moons from the time of their formation to today.\" During Juno's most recent encounter with Ganymede, which followed a much closer flyby on June 7, the spacecraft swung within 31,136 miles of Ganymede's surface. With this close pass, Juno's JIRAM instrument was able to see Ganymede's north polar region for the first time. The instrument also collected data about the different compositions of material at both low and high altitudes on the alien moon, according to the statement. The data that Juno collected during this flyby adds to its previous close encounters as well as observations by previous probes like NASA's Voyager mission as well as the agency's crafts Galileo, New Horizons and Cassini. By observing the moon in infrared, the team was able to learn more about what really makes up Ganymede to better understand not just this moon but worlds like it as well. \"We found Ganymede's high latitudes dominated by water ice, with fine grain size, which is the result of the intense bombardment of charged particles,\" Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator from the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome, said in the same statement. \"Conversely, low latitudes are shielded by the moon's magnetic field and contain more of its original chemical composition, most notably of non-water- ice constituents such as salts and organics,\" Mura added. \"It is extremely important to characterize the unique properties of these icy regions to better understand the space-weathering processes that the surface undergoes.\" As Juno continues to explore the entire Jovian system - NASA has extended Juno's _mission_ through September 2025 so that the probe can explore Jupiter's moons and rings - other upcoming space missions could catch their own views of the large moon.

NASA's Juno spacecraft has spent three years looking beneath the clouds of our similarly secretive and distant planetary neighbor, Jupiter. But recently, Juno got up close and personal with a different celestial body. Juno's original mission was to learn about Jupiter's formation, magnetic field, and composition under its surface clouds. But in its extended mission, it's going far beyond that. On Monday, June 7, the spacecraft shot past Jupiter's Ganymede-the largest moon in the solar system-snapping a few quick but iconic images and taking readings of the moon's magnetic field from just over 600 miles away. The team of scientists running Juno is just starting to analyze the data, says Scott Bolton, the head of the mission and a space scientist at the Southwestern Research Institute. But they've already posted two close-up pictures which show the icy moon's cratered and craggy surface in detail. The flyby was the closest look we've had at Ganymede since the Galileo mission 20 years prior. One image was taken by JunoCam, the craft's signature camera, but the other was taken by a navigational camera which, through clever use, was also able to measure radiation levels near the Jupiter moon. As the camera took pictures, charged particles would hit its sensor, leaving little dots, squiggles, or streaks in the image that scientists could use to approximate radiation levels. The use of a navigational camera for this measurement \"is one of the aspects that does surprise me,\" says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan who has studied Jupiter's moons and planetary magnetic fields but was not involved in the Juno mission. As the saying goes, one instrument's noise is another's instrument's signal, he says. It's part of the Juno team's philosophy to squeeze every possible bit of science from the craft, Bolton says. \"We look at every engineering sensor and think, 'What can we do with it scientifically?' It's giving us some kind of data.\" For example, when a camera unintentionally caught the impacts of dust particles on Juno's solar panels, that \"serendipitous\" data helped scientists gain new insights about zodiacal light and the inner solar system's dust cloud. The Juno team also used a method called radio occultation. But fear not-it has nothing to do with satanic rituals. Instead, it measures the moon's ionosphere, a section of its thin atmosphere where radiation knocks the electrons off gas molecules. To do this, Juno sends a signal to Earth while positioned behind the moon's atmosphere, so that it passes through Ganymede's ionosphere and on to a receiver on Earth in Canberra, Australia. The charged particles in the ionosphere nudge the frequencies of the signal such that the team can, through a kind of reverse engineering, learn about the magnetic field causing the interference. The technique is common, Jia says, \"but it highly depends on the geometry of the flyby.\" To work, the objects need to line up perfectly, with a straight path between the craft, the magnetosphere, and Earth. The magnetic environment around Ganymede is particularly interesting, Jia says, because it's a small magnetosphere within a large one-that of Ganymede bubbled inside that of Jupiter. That makes it a natural laboratory to study plasma physics, he says. Other mysteries abound when it comes to Ganymede. For one thing, images show lines that scratch across the ice on its surface-and we aren't sure what caused them. Tectonic faults could have caused these features, Bolton says, or some other process. For all we know, they could still be forming, he adds. Bolton is most excited about the microwave measurements Juno captured during the flyby, which will make a map of Ganymede's surface using six different wavelengths. \"That'll be really the first detailed map of the ice,\" Bolton says. The microwave readings could tell us about \"the composition of the ice, the temperature of the ice, possibly the thickness of the ice,\" Bolton says. The team will compare readings across the light and dark regions of the moon's surface, and across craters and those mysterious tectonic lines. Soon, the team will share more images from the flyby, Bolton says, and the curious among us can download and toy with JunoCam's raw images themselves. He's excited to see what the community does with them. Juno's flyby also serves as a run-up for two other missions that will explore the Jovian moons. NASA's Clipper mission will target Europa, and the European Space Agency's JUICE will study Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Juno's data will help both teams plan their missions, and because the sensors carried by each mission differ, Bolton says, \"We complement them as well.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/science/nasa-captures-ganymede-flyby/"}, {"title": "NASA's Juno spacecraft flies past solar system's biggest moon, Jupiter.

This is what it found out", "date": "2021-10-29", "content": "Scientists revealed the latest discoveries on Jupiter, including surprising findings about the planet's Great Red Spot and the cyclonic storms swirling at the poles, in a NASA press conference on Thursday. The Great Red Spot was thought to be a storm shaped as a flat \"pancake,\" according to Scott Bolton, principal investigator of NASA's Juno mission and director of the space science and engineering division at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"We knew it lasted a long time, but we didn't know how deep or how it really worked,\" Bolton said in the press conference. In February and July 2019, NASA's Juno spacecraft flew directly over the Great Red Spot, which is about 10,000 miles wide, to figure out how deep the vortex extends beneath the visible cloud tops. Two papers published Thursday in the journal Science have detailed what Juno discovered. Scientists had believed the depth of the storm and the planet's weather layer would be constrained to depths where sunlight can penetrate or water and ammonia are expected to condense - the planet's cloud level. However, the storm wasn't a shallow meteorological feature, the researchers found. A microwave radiometer on Juno gave scientists a three-dimensional look at the planet. They discovered that the Great Red Spot is between 124 miles and 311 miles deep, extending much deeper into the gas giant than expected. \"The Great Red Spot is as deep within Jupiter as the International Space Station is high above our heads,\" said Marzia Parisi, research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Great Red Spot is deeply rooted, but the team found it's still shallower than the zonal jets that power the storm, which extend to depths approaching 1,864 miles. While the storm rages on, the size of the spot is shrinking. In 1979, it was twice Earth's diameter. Since then, the spot has shrunk by at least a third. Five years ago, scientists used data gathered by Juno to capture photos and learn more about Jupiter's poles. Juno found the gas giant has five cyclonic storms at the south pole in the shape of a pentagon and eight cyclonic storms at the north pole forming an octagon. When Juno observed the cyclones five years later using the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, it found the storms stayed in the same location. The polar cyclones showed patterns of trying to move toward the poles, but the cyclones on top of each pole pushed back. This explains why the storms have remained in the same place. ## Vertical patterns of wind circulation Jupiter's clouds are embedded in the east and west jet streams, which extends 200 miles deep, said Keren Duer, a doctoral student at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. When the research team followed the movement of ammonia, it revealed that it traveled in an up-and-down and north-south movement surrounding the jet streams, she said. Those circulation cells in both of Jupiter's hemispheres share similar characteristics to Earth's Ferrel cells, which are the wind circulation patterns in the mid-latitudes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Those cells have a large influence on our planet's climate, Duer said. Jupiter contains eight Ferrel cells in each hemisphere compared to Earth, which has only one per hemisphere, she said. Earth's cells extend 6 miles from the surface compared to Jupiter's cells, which start at the cloud level and extend at least 200 miles, she added. \"This means that the cells on Jupiter are at least 30 times deeper than the equivalent cells on Earth,\" Duer said. Since 2016, the Juno spacecraft - as wide as a basketball court - has circled Jupiter, scanning the atmosphere and mapping its magnetic and gravitational fields. In January, NASA announced it would be extending Juno's mission through September 2025. Astronomers have been monitoring the Great Red Spot since 1830.

By that point, Jupiter's powerful gravity has accelerated the spacecraft to almost 130,000 mph relative to the planet. The next flyby of Jupiter, the 35th of the mission, is scheduled for July 21, NASA said. Jupiter has a total of 79 moons. Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, is the largest and most massive of the solar system's moons. Jupiter is roughly 390 million miles away from Earth.

Scientists are using infrared to better explore Jupiter's moon Ganymede, the largest moon in our solar system. As we mark 10 years since NASA's Juno mission launched from Earth, the craft has delivered stunning images from its orbit around Jupiter, including new infrared views of Ganymede captured during its latest flyby of the Jovian moon on July 20. Using Juno's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper instrument, which detects in infrared light that is not visible to the human eye, the Juno science team has created a new infrared map of Ganymede, which they hope will help them to better understand the Jupiter moon's ice crust and the ocean lurking beneath, according to NASA. \"Ganymede is larger than the planet Mercury, but just about everything we explore on this mission to Jupiter is on a monumental scale,\" Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton, a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a NASA statement. \"The infrared and other data collected by Juno during the flyby contain fundamental clues for understanding the evolution of Jupiter's 79 moons from the time of their formation to today.\" During Juno's most recent encounter with Ganymede, which followed a much closer flyby on June 7, the spacecraft swung within 31,136 miles of Ganymede's surface. With this close pass, Juno's JIRAM instrument was able to see Ganymede's north polar region for the first time. The instrument also collected data about the different compositions of material at both low and high altitudes on the alien moon, according to the statement. The data that Juno collected during this flyby adds to its previous close encounters as well as observations by previous probes like NASA's Voyager mission as well as the agency's crafts Galileo, New Horizons and Cassini. By observing the moon in infrared, the team was able to learn more about what really makes up Ganymede to better understand not just this moon but worlds like it as well. \"We found Ganymede's high latitudes dominated by water ice, with fine grain size, which is the result of the intense bombardment of charged particles,\" Alessandro Mura, a Juno co-investigator from the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome, said in the same statement. \"Conversely, low latitudes are shielded by the moon's magnetic field and contain more of its original chemical composition, most notably of non-water- ice constituents such as salts and organics,\" Mura added. \"It is extremely important to characterize the unique properties of these icy regions to better understand the space-weathering processes that the surface undergoes.\" As Juno continues to explore the entire Jovian system - NASA has extended Juno's _mission_ through September 2025 so that the probe can explore Jupiter's moons and rings - other upcoming space missions could catch their own views of the large moon. For example, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission scheduled to launch next year will study all of Jupiter's four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons.

This is what it found out", "date": "2021-10-29", "content": "Scientists revealed the latest discoveries on Jupiter, including surprising findings about the planet's Great Red Spot and the cyclonic storms swirling at the poles, in a NASA press conference on Thursday. The Great Red Spot was thought to be a storm shaped as a flat \"pancake,\" according to Scott Bolton, principal investigator of NASA's Juno mission and director of the space science and engineering division at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"We knew it lasted a long time, but we didn't know how deep or how it really worked,\" Bolton said in the press conference. In February and July 2019, NASA's Juno spacecraft flew directly over the Great Red Spot, which is about 10,000 miles wide, to figure out how deep the vortex extends beneath the visible cloud tops. Two papers published Thursday in the journal Science have detailed what Juno discovered. Scientists had believed the depth of the storm and the planet's weather layer would be constrained to depths where sunlight can penetrate or water and ammonia are expected to condense - the planet's cloud level. However, the storm wasn't a shallow meteorological feature, the researchers found. A microwave radiometer on Juno gave scientists a three-dimensional look at the planet. They discovered that the Great Red Spot is between 124 miles and 311 miles deep, extending much deeper into the gas giant than expected. \"The Great Red Spot is as deep within Jupiter as the International Space Station is high above our heads,\" said Marzia Parisi, research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Great Red Spot is deeply rooted, but the team found it's still shallower than the zonal jets that power the storm, which extend to depths approaching 1,864 miles. While the storm rages on, the size of the spot is shrinking. In 1979, it was twice Earth's diameter. Since then, the spot has shrunk by at least a third. Five years ago, scientists used data gathered by Juno to capture photos and learn more about Jupiter's poles. Juno found the gas giant has five cyclonic storms at the south pole in the shape of a pentagon and eight cyclonic storms at the north pole forming an octagon. When Juno observed the cyclones five years later using the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, it found the storms stayed in the same location. The polar cyclones showed patterns of trying to move toward the poles, but the cyclones on top of each pole pushed back. This explains why the storms have remained in the same place. ## Vertical patterns of wind circulation Jupiter's clouds are embedded in the east and west jet streams, which extends 200 miles deep, said Keren Duer, a doctoral student at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. When the research team followed the movement of ammonia, it revealed that it traveled in an up-and-down and north-south movement surrounding the jet streams, she said. Those circulation cells in both of Jupiter's hemispheres share similar characteristics to Earth's Ferrel cells, which are the wind circulation patterns in the mid-latitudes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Those cells have a large influence on our planet's climate, Duer said. Jupiter contains eight Ferrel cells in each hemisphere compared to Earth, which has only one per hemisphere, she said. Earth's cells extend 6 miles from the surface compared to Jupiter's cells, which start at the cloud level and extend at least 200 miles, she added. \"This means that the cells on Jupiter are at least 30 times deeper than the equivalent cells on Earth,\" Duer said. Since 2016, the Juno spacecraft - as wide as a basketball court - has circled Jupiter, scanning the atmosphere and mapping its magnetic and gravitational fields. In January, NASA announced it would be extending Juno's mission through September 2025. Astronomers have been monitoring the Great Red Spot since 1830.

At the time of Juno's closest approach to Ganymede - during the mission's 34th trip around Jupiter - the spacecraft was within 645 miles of the moon's surface and traveling at a relative velocity of 41,600 mph.

Juno data indicates that a change in the gas giant's magnetic field has occurred during the spacecraft's five years in orbit, and that the Great Blue Spot is drifting eastward at a speed of about 2 inches per second relative to the rest of Jupiter's interior, lapping the planet in about 350 years.

Juno swung within 645 miles of the moon's surface - the closest any spacecraft has come to it in two decades. As it flew by, Juno raked the moon for data with its cameras and host of scientific instruments. One instrument in particular, called \"Waves,\" has delivered something beyond the dazzling imagery we've come to expect from solar system exploration: a 50-second sweep of _magnetic_ measurements, later converted to audio frequencies. The dynamic whistles and whirs of the soundtrack offer a rare opportunity to imagine ourselves exploring deep space in person, via the telepresence of a robot. We've heard direct recordings of sound from different places in the solar system before, like the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan as the Huygens probe descended, or the winds of Mars heard by the Perseverance rover. But in this case, Juno's \"ear,\" the Waves instrument, measures the properties of magnetic fields the spacecraft passes through, giving us the chance to hear something normally inaccessible to human senses. Close-up image of Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft during its June 7, 2021, flyby. Juno's primary mission is to explore the planet Jupiter, but NASA often takes advantage of serendipitous encounters to explore more. On June 8, 2021, the close flyby of Ganymede created an opportunity for some side work beyond the mission routine. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one to possess a significant global enveloping magnetic field - a magnetic field that extends from the moon into space. This is a feature that even the planets Venus and Mars do not possess. If Ganymede orbited the sun instead of Jupiter, it would be considered a planet, larger even than Mercury. Ganymede's mystery runs below its icy, cratered, cracked surface. Hidden beneath that frosty shell may be an ocean, one that contains more water than all of Earth's. This alone ranks Ganymede as prime real estate for the search for extraterrestrial life, like other tantalizing moons where we have detected the presence of liquid water - Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus. Juno's batch of flyby data most likely won't discover extraterrestrials, but magnetic and other data collected by instruments like Waves may provide insights into the ocean lurking beneath Ganymede's crust, such as its depth, volume, salinity and other properties. NASA launched Juno a decade ago on a mission to explore Jupiter, to give us our first-ever look at the gas giant's mysterious polar regions, and to probe its interior by measuring its magnetic and gravitational fields. Since arriving in 2016, Juno has circled the giant planet on an elongated orbit that sends it buzzing close to Jupiter's polar regions every 53 days, cruising to within 2,100 miles of its cloud tops, arguably one of the most stunning vista points in the solar system. From this vantage, Juno has captured thousands of captivating images of Jupiter's colorful cloud belts, swirling storm systems and auroras. And we have glimpsed processes and structures of the planet's interior that may help scientists understand how Jupiter originally formed and evolved. For example, some of Juno's major discoveries include: insights into a mysterious magnetic anomaly near Jupiter's equator, called the Great Blue Spot ; similarities in patterns between Jupiter's swirling cyclones and vortices in Earth's oceans; and detailed imagery of the thin ring of dust encircling Jupiter and its relationship to the two tiny moons Metis and Adrastea. NASA has extended Juno's mission through September 2025, so more discoveries about the king of planets and its entourage of amazing moons are sure to come. Whether the solar-powered spacecraft will survive Jupiter's deadly radiation belts until then remains to be seen, but for now we can continue to enjoy the grand vista.

This is what it found out", "date": "2021-10-29", "content": "Scientists revealed the latest discoveries on Jupiter, including surprising findings about the planet's Great Red Spot and the cyclonic storms swirling at the poles, in a NASA press conference on Thursday. The Great Red Spot was thought to be a storm shaped as a flat \"pancake,\" according to Scott Bolton, principal investigator of NASA's Juno mission and director of the space science and engineering division at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"We knew it lasted a long time, but we didn't know how deep or how it really worked,\" Bolton said in the press conference. In February and July 2019, NASA's Juno spacecraft flew directly over the Great Red Spot, which is about 10,000 miles wide, to figure out how deep the vortex extends beneath the visible cloud tops. Two papers published Thursday in the journal Science have detailed what Juno discovered. Scientists had believed the depth of the storm and the planet's weather layer would be constrained to depths where sunlight can penetrate or water and ammonia are expected to condense - the planet's cloud level. However, the storm wasn't a shallow meteorological feature, the researchers found. A microwave radiometer on Juno gave scientists a three-dimensional look at the planet. They discovered that the Great Red Spot is between 124 miles and 311 miles deep, extending much deeper into the gas giant than expected. \"The Great Red Spot is as deep within Jupiter as the International Space Station is high above our heads,\" said Marzia Parisi, research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Great Red Spot is deeply rooted, but the team found it's still shallower than the zonal jets that power the storm, which extend to depths approaching 1,864 miles. While the storm rages on, the size of the spot is shrinking. In 1979, it was twice Earth's diameter. Since then, the spot has shrunk by at least a third. Five years ago, scientists used data gathered by Juno to capture photos and learn more about Jupiter's poles. Juno found the gas giant has five cyclonic storms at the south pole in the shape of a pentagon and eight cyclonic storms at the north pole forming an octagon. When Juno observed the cyclones five years later using the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, it found the storms stayed in the same location. The polar cyclones showed patterns of trying to move toward the poles, but the cyclones on top of each pole pushed back. This explains why the storms have remained in the same place. ## Vertical patterns of wind circulation Jupiter's clouds are embedded in the east and west jet streams, which extends 200 miles deep, said Keren Duer, a doctoral student at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. When the research team followed the movement of ammonia, it revealed that it traveled in an up-and-down and north-south movement surrounding the jet streams, she said. Those circulation cells in both of Jupiter's hemispheres share similar characteristics to Earth's Ferrel cells, which are the wind circulation patterns in the mid-latitudes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Those cells have a large influence on our planet's climate, Duer said. Jupiter contains eight Ferrel cells in each hemisphere compared to Earth, which has only one per hemisphere, she said. Earth's cells extend 6 miles from the surface compared to Jupiter's cells, which start at the cloud level and extend at least 200 miles, she added. \"This means that the cells on Jupiter are at least 30 times deeper than the equivalent cells on Earth,\" Duer said. Since 2016, the Juno spacecraft - as wide as a basketball court - has circled Jupiter, scanning the atmosphere and mapping its magnetic and gravitational fields. In January, NASA announced it would be extending Juno's mission through September 2025. Astronomers have been monitoring the Great Red Spot since 1830.

At the time of Juno's closest approach to Ganymede - during the mission's 34th trip around Jupiter - the spacecraft was within 645 miles of the moon's surface and traveling at a relative velocity of 41,600 mph. Jack Connerney from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the lead investigator with Juno's magnetometer and is the mission's deputy principal investigator. His team has produced the most detailed map ever obtained of Jupiter's magnetic field. Compiled from data collected from 32 orbits during Juno's prime mission, the map provides new insights into the gas giant's mysterious Great Blue Spot, a magnetic anomaly at the planet's equator. Juno data indicates that a change in the gas giant's magnetic field has occurred during the spacecraft's five years in orbit, and that the Great Blue Spot is drifting eastward at a speed of about 2 inches per second relative to the rest of Jupiter's interior, lapping the planet in about 350 years. In contrast, the Great Red Spot - the long-lived atmospheric anticyclone just south of Jupiter's equator - is drifting westward at a relatively rapid clip, circling the planet in about four-and-a-half years. In addition, the new map shows that Jupiter's zonal winds are pulling the Great Blue Spot apart. This means that the zonal winds measured on the surface of the planet reach deep into the planet's interior. The new magnetic field map also allows Juno scientists to make comparisons with Earth's magnetic field. The data suggests to the team that dynamo action - the mechanism by which a celestial body generates a magnetic field - in Jupiter's interior occurs in metallic hydrogen, beneath a layer expressing \"helium rain.\" Data Juno collects during its extended mission may further unravel the mysteries of the dynamo effect not only at Jupiter but those of other planets, including Earth.

Juno swung within 645 miles of the moon's surface - the closest any spacecraft has come to it in two decades. As it flew by, Juno raked the moon for data with its cameras and host of scientific instruments. One instrument in particular, called \"Waves,\" has delivered something beyond the dazzling imagery we've come to expect from solar system exploration: a 50-second sweep of _magnetic_ measurements, later converted to audio frequencies. The dynamic whistles and whirs of the soundtrack offer a rare opportunity to imagine ourselves exploring deep space in person, via the telepresence of a robot. We've heard direct recordings of sound from different places in the solar system before, like the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan as the Huygens probe descended, or the winds of Mars heard by the Perseverance rover. But in this case, Juno's \"ear,\" the Waves instrument, measures the properties of magnetic fields the spacecraft passes through, giving us the chance to hear something normally inaccessible to human senses. Close-up image of Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft during its June 7, 2021, flyby. Juno's primary mission is to explore the planet Jupiter, but NASA often takes advantage of serendipitous encounters to explore more. On June 8, 2021, the close flyby of Ganymede created an opportunity for some side work beyond the mission routine. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one to possess a significant global enveloping magnetic field - a magnetic field that extends from the moon into space. This is a feature that even the planets Venus and Mars do not possess. If Ganymede orbited the sun instead of Jupiter, it would be considered a planet, larger even than Mercury. Ganymede's mystery runs below its icy, cratered, cracked surface. Hidden beneath that frosty shell may be an ocean, one that contains more water than all of Earth's. This alone ranks Ganymede as prime real estate for the search for extraterrestrial life, like other tantalizing moons where we have detected the presence of liquid water - Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus. Juno's batch of flyby data most likely won't discover extraterrestrials, but magnetic and other data collected by instruments like Waves may provide insights into the ocean lurking beneath Ganymede's crust, such as its depth, volume, salinity and other properties. NASA launched Juno a decade ago on a mission to explore Jupiter, to give us our first-ever look at the gas giant's mysterious polar regions, and to probe its interior by measuring its magnetic and gravitational fields. Since arriving in 2016, Juno has circled the giant planet on an elongated orbit that sends it buzzing close to Jupiter's polar regions every 53 days, cruising to within 2,100 miles of its cloud tops, arguably one of the most stunning vista points in the solar system. From this vantage, Juno has captured thousands of captivating images of Jupiter's colorful cloud belts, swirling storm systems and auroras. And we have glimpsed processes and structures of the planet's interior that may help scientists understand how Jupiter originally formed and evolved. For example, some of Juno's major discoveries include: insights into a mysterious magnetic anomaly near Jupiter's equator, called the Great Blue Spot ; similarities in patterns between Jupiter's swirling cyclones and vortices in Earth's oceans; and detailed imagery of the thin ring of dust encircling Jupiter and its relationship to the two tiny moons Metis and Adrastea. NASA has extended Juno's mission through September 2025, so more discoveries about the king of planets and its entourage of amazing moons are sure to come. Whether the solar-powered spacecraft will survive Jupiter's deadly radiation belts until then remains to be seen, but for now we can continue to enjoy the grand vista.

His team has produced the most detailed map ever obtained of Jupiter's magnetic field. Compiled from data collected from 32 orbits during Juno's prime mission, the map provides new insights into the gas giant's mysterious Great Blue Spot, a magnetic anomaly at the planet's equator. Juno data indicates that a change in the gas giant's magnetic field has occurred during the spacecraft's five years in orbit, and that the Great Blue Spot is drifting eastward at a speed of about 2 inches per second relative to the rest of Jupiter's interior, lapping the planet in about 350 years. In contrast, the Great Red Spot - the long-lived atmospheric anticyclone just south of Jupiter's equator - is drifting westward at a relatively rapid clip, circling the planet in about four-and-a-half years. In addition, the new map shows that Jupiter's zonal winds are pulling the Great Blue Spot apart. This means that the zonal winds measured on the surface of the planet reach deep into the planet's interior. The new magnetic field map also allows Juno scientists to make comparisons with Earth's magnetic field. The data suggests to the team that dynamo action - the mechanism by which a celestial body generates a magnetic field - in Jupiter's interior occurs in metallic hydrogen, beneath a layer expressing \"helium rain.\" Data Juno collects during its extended mission may further unravel the mysteries of the dynamo effect not only at Jupiter but those of other planets, including Earth.

Juno swung within 645 miles of the moon's surface - the closest any spacecraft has come to it in two decades. As it flew by, Juno raked the moon for data with its cameras and host of scientific instruments. One instrument in particular, called \"Waves,\" has delivered something beyond the dazzling imagery we've come to expect from solar system exploration: a 50-second sweep of _magnetic_ measurements, later converted to audio frequencies. The dynamic whistles and whirs of the soundtrack offer a rare opportunity to imagine ourselves exploring deep space in person, via the telepresence of a robot. We've heard direct recordings of sound from different places in the solar system before, like the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan as the Huygens probe descended, or the winds of Mars heard by the Perseverance rover. But in this case, Juno's \"ear,\" the Waves instrument, measures the properties of magnetic fields the spacecraft passes through, giving us the chance to hear something normally inaccessible to human senses. Close-up image of Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft during its June 7, 2021, flyby. Juno's primary mission is to explore the planet Jupiter, but NASA often takes advantage of serendipitous encounters to explore more. On June 8, 2021, the close flyby of Ganymede created an opportunity for some side work beyond the mission routine. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one to possess a significant global enveloping magnetic field - a magnetic field that extends from the moon into space. This is a feature that even the planets Venus and Mars do not possess. If Ganymede orbited the sun instead of Jupiter, it would be considered a planet, larger even than Mercury. Ganymede's mystery runs below its icy, cratered, cracked surface. Hidden beneath that frosty shell may be an ocean, one that contains more water than all of Earth's. This alone ranks Ganymede as prime real estate for the search for extraterrestrial life, like other tantalizing moons where we have detected the presence of liquid water - Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus. Juno's batch of flyby data most likely won't discover extraterrestrials, but magnetic and other data collected by instruments like Waves may provide insights into the ocean lurking beneath Ganymede's crust, such as its depth, volume, salinity and other properties. NASA launched Juno a decade ago on a mission to explore Jupiter, to give us our first-ever look at the gas giant's mysterious polar regions, and to probe its interior by measuring its magnetic and gravitational fields. Since arriving in 2016, Juno has circled the giant planet on an elongated orbit that sends it buzzing close to Jupiter's polar regions every 53 days, cruising to within 2,100 miles of its cloud tops, arguably one of the most stunning vista points in the solar system. From this vantage, Juno has captured thousands of captivating images of Jupiter's colorful cloud belts, swirling storm systems and auroras. And we have glimpsed processes and structures of the planet's interior that may help scientists understand how Jupiter originally formed and evolved. For example, some of Juno's major discoveries include: insights into a mysterious magnetic anomaly near Jupiter's equator, called the Great Blue Spot ; similarities in patterns between Jupiter's swirling cyclones and vortices in Earth's oceans; and detailed imagery of the thin ring of dust encircling Jupiter and its relationship to the two tiny moons Metis and Adrastea. NASA has extended Juno's mission through September 2025, so more discoveries about the king of planets and its entourage of amazing moons are sure to come. Whether the solar-powered spacecraft will survive Jupiter's deadly radiation belts until then remains to be seen, but for now we can continue to enjoy the grand vista.

Just like when Earth's Moon crosses between our planet and the Sun creating an eclipse for lucky Earthlings, when Jupiter's moons cross between the gas giant and the Sun, they create shadows too. NASA's Juno spacecraft captured this view of Jupiter during the mission's 40th close pass by the giant planet on 25 Feb. 2022. This image was taken by the camera on board the spacecraft, JunoCam, and processed by citizen scientist Thomas Thomopoulos. As you may know, JunoCam is a public outreach project, with people around the world actively participating in science investigation. Citizen scientists have processed the stunning images taken by JunoCam, as well as developing time-lapse movies, measuring wind flow, tracking circulation patterns in the circumpolar cyclones, and looking for lightning flashes. Another citizen scientist/image processer, Brian Swift created the graphic below using JunoCam data, illustrating the approximate geometry of the visible area, projected onto a globe of Jupiter. At the time this image was taken, the Juno spacecraft was about 44,000 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops, at a latitude of about 55 degrees south, and 15 times closer than Ganymede, which orbits about 666,000 miles away from Jupiter. If you were lucky enough - or unlucky, perhaps due to the conditions on Jupiter - to be an observer at Jupiter's cloud tops within the oval shadow, you would experience a total eclipse of the Sun. NASA says that total eclipses are more common on Jupiter than on Earth for several reasons. Jupiter has four large moons that often pass between Jupiter and the Sun: in seven days, Ganymede transits once; Europa, twice; and Io, four times. And since Jupiter's moons orbit in a plane close to Jupiter's orbital plane, the moon shadows are often cast upon the planet.

Juno swung within 645 miles of the moon's surface - the closest any spacecraft has come to it in two decades. As it flew by, Juno raked the moon for data with its cameras and host of scientific instruments. One instrument in particular, called \"Waves,\" has delivered something beyond the dazzling imagery we've come to expect from solar system exploration: a 50-second sweep of _magnetic_ measurements, later converted to audio frequencies. The dynamic whistles and whirs of the soundtrack offer a rare opportunity to imagine ourselves exploring deep space in person, via the telepresence of a robot. We've heard direct recordings of sound from different places in the solar system before, like the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan as the Huygens probe descended, or the winds of Mars heard by the Perseverance rover. But in this case, Juno's \"ear,\" the Waves instrument, measures the properties of magnetic fields the spacecraft passes through, giving us the chance to hear something normally inaccessible to human senses. Close-up image of Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft during its June 7, 2021, flyby. Juno's primary mission is to explore the planet Jupiter, but NASA often takes advantage of serendipitous encounters to explore more. On June 8, 2021, the close flyby of Ganymede created an opportunity for some side work beyond the mission routine. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one to possess a significant global enveloping magnetic field - a magnetic field that extends from the moon into space. This is a feature that even the planets Venus and Mars do not possess. If Ganymede orbited the sun instead of Jupiter, it would be considered a planet, larger even than Mercury. Ganymede's mystery runs below its icy, cratered, cracked surface. Hidden beneath that frosty shell may be an ocean, one that contains more water than all of Earth's. This alone ranks Ganymede as prime real estate for the search for extraterrestrial life, like other tantalizing moons where we have detected the presence of liquid water - Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus. Juno's batch of flyby data most likely won't discover extraterrestrials, but magnetic and other data collected by instruments like Waves may provide insights into the ocean lurking beneath Ganymede's crust, such as its depth, volume, salinity and other properties. NASA launched Juno a decade ago on a mission to explore Jupiter, to give us our first-ever look at the gas giant's mysterious polar regions, and to probe its interior by measuring its magnetic and gravitational fields. Since arriving in 2016, Juno has circled the giant planet on an elongated orbit that sends it buzzing close to Jupiter's polar regions every 53 days, cruising to within 2,100 miles of its cloud tops, arguably one of the most stunning vista points in the solar system. From this vantage, Juno has captured thousands of captivating images of Jupiter's colorful cloud belts, swirling storm systems and auroras. And we have glimpsed processes and structures of the planet's interior that may help scientists understand how Jupiter originally formed and evolved. For example, some of Juno's major discoveries include: insights into a mysterious magnetic anomaly near Jupiter's equator, called the Great Blue Spot ; similarities in patterns between Jupiter's swirling cyclones and vortices in Earth's oceans; and detailed imagery of the thin ring of dust encircling Jupiter and its relationship to the two tiny moons Metis and Adrastea. NASA has extended Juno's mission through September 2025, so more discoveries about the king of planets and its entourage of amazing moons are sure to come. Whether the solar-powered spacecraft will survive Jupiter's deadly radiation belts until then remains to be seen, but for now we can continue to enjoy the grand vista.

The picture was taken when NASA's Juno spacecraft approached the giant planet during a regular close pass. The crescent shape of Jupiter can never be captured from telescopes on Earth's surface. The blog post explained why this was so. It stated that this image of Jupiter in a crescent phase, unlike the Moon or Venus, was difficult to observe from Earth, even with the aid of a telescope. The post went on to add that Jupiter's orbit was outside the Earth's, hence an observer on Earth can only view the side of Jupiter that is illuminated by the Sun. So, the planet appears to be full at all times. This backlit view of the crescent Jupiter from Juno was taken by using raw data from the JunoCam instrument. **Juno's Spacecraft** NASA's Juno's principal goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter.

If you were lucky enough - or unlucky, perhaps due to the conditions on Jupiter - to be an observer at Jupiter's cloud tops within the oval shadow, you would experience a total eclipse of the Sun. NASA says that total eclipses are more common on Jupiter than on Earth for several reasons. Jupiter has four large moons that often pass between Jupiter and the Sun: in seven days, Ganymede transits once; Europa, twice; and Io, four times.

In the days since it's sent back its raw image data across 461 million miles/742 million kilometers through NASA's Deep Space Network. That data includes precious new images of Jupiter's moon Io-the most volcanic body in the entire solar system-seen from just 53,000 miles/86,000 kilometers. For now that's closer than the spacecraft has been. It follows another close encounter with Io in April 2022 when Juno got to within 66,000 miles/106,000 kilometers. The images come from the _JunoCam_ camera on board NASA's Juno spacecraft, which launched in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016. Since then the bus-sized spacecraft has orbited the giant planet 43 times, producing some jaw-dropping images each time. The spacecraft is in a highly elliptical orbit around Jupiter, coming as close as a few thousand kilometers above the cloud tops during its closest approach. From the gravitational data it's collected a new study just published saw researchers map out the giant planet's core. It revealed a high amount of heavy material, which was unexpected. It hints that Jupiter may have devoured planetesimals-the building blocks of the solar system-to aid its growth. More than 60,000 images from this data set are also being used by the Jovian Vortex Hunter project, a new citizen science project on the Zooniverse platform led by researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with support from NASA. It allows volunteers to play an important role in helping scientists learn more about the atmosphere on Jupiter. Citizen scientists can help astrophysicists categorize tens of thousands of stunning images taken from the _Juno_ spacecraft with just a web browser. Citizen scientists are being asked to identify atmospheric vortices-clouds that have a round or elliptical shape, like hurricanes. Jupiter's atmosphere comprises hydrogen and helium yet contains a wide variety of clouds of different shapes and sizes. \"There are so many images, that it would take several years for our small team to examine all of them,\" said Ramanakumar Sankar, postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy, who is leading the project. \"We need help from the public to identify which images have vortices, where they are, and how they appear,\" said Sankar. \"With the catalog of features in place, we can study the physics behind how these features form, and how they are related to the structure of the atmosphere, particularly below the clouds, where we cannot directly observe them.\" The information from the citizen scientists will not only be used to study Jupiter. It will also help to write a computer algorithm that could speed future identification of Jupiter's atmospheric features by combining computer help with human expertise. Juno will complete another _perijove_ of Jupiter in August. In December 2023 and January 2024, Juno will get to within just 932 miles/1,500 kilometers of Io.

During the probe's 43rd close flyby of the enormous planet, its JunoCam instrument caught sight of watercolor vortices near the north pole. These hypnotic views are deceptively stunning -- they are of hurricane wind patterns that can reach over 30 miles in height and spread across hundreds of miles of gaseous plains. Though the picture we see of the frightening spectacle is decked out in lovely ceruleans, iridescent opals and strong teals, it's important to realize that it's digitally processed to hold such vivid blue-ish hues. After collecting raw JunoCam data -- specifically an image taken by the space explorer at about 15,600 miles above Jupiter's cloud tops -- citizen scientist Brian Swift enhanced these Jovian storms for analytic purposes. For instance, an achingly beautiful view of Jupiter and its moon, Ganymede, released earlier this year isn't colorized in blue tones at all -- and a composite image from last year might lead you to believe the Jovian lifestyle is shrouded in hellish flames. In reality, if we could hypothetically pop up next to Jupiter right now, we'd see those spirals projecting a variety of other colors - which fascinatingly depend on the chemistry and _direction_ of each one. Counterclockwise and clockwise cyclones in Jupiter's northern hemisphere, as an example, offer their own separate palates. Counterclockwise and clockwise ones in the southern hemisphere also have their own. For context, Jupiter's \" Great Red Spot \" is a southern hemisphere, counterclockwise storm. But apart from color schemes, scientists are also generally interested in understanding Jupiter's stormy weather because such knowledge could help decode information about Jovian clouds and fluid dynamics in the atmosphere. This endeavor is so important, in fact, that NASA has been trying to outsource the job of categorizing storm images and other atmospheric phenomena of Jupiter. You can even take part in what's called the \" Jovian Vortex Hunter \" project online. All you need is access to a cellphone or laptop - so far, per the agency, 2,404 volunteers have contributed to study 376,725 images for the mission. Zooming out, Jupiter is home to a great many mysteries, which is why the European Space Agency is poised to send its own probe toward the peach-striped ball of gas to join Juno's cosmic expedition.

That data includes precious new images of Jupiter's moon Io-the most volcanic body in the entire solar system-seen from just 53,000 miles/86,000 kilometers. For now that's closer than the spacecraft has been. It follows another close encounter with Io in April 2022 when Juno got to within 66,000 miles/106,000 kilometers. The images come from the _JunoCam_ camera on board NASA's Juno spacecraft, which launched in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016. Since then the bus-sized spacecraft has orbited the giant planet 43 times, producing some jaw-dropping images each time. The spacecraft is in a highly elliptical orbit around Jupiter, coming as close as a few thousand kilometers above the cloud tops during its closest approach. From the gravitational data it's collected a new study just published saw researchers map out the giant planet's core. It revealed a high amount of heavy material, which was unexpected. It hints that Jupiter may have devoured planetesimals-the building blocks of the solar system-to aid its growth.

It will also help to write a computer algorithm that could speed future identification of Jupiter's atmospheric features by combining computer help with human expertise.

We finally have an answer thanks to NASA's Juno spacecraft which is hovering over the gas giant since 2016. The agency has shared an incredible animation that was created by citizen scientist Andrea Luck using the spacecraft's JunoCam instrument. The visual is from April 9, 2022, when Juno completed its 41st close flyby of Jupiter capturing what it would look like to ride along with the probe. Check out the animation below. According to NASA, the spacecraft was just over 3,300 kilometres above Jupiter's colourful clouds when it made its closest approach on April 9. Moreover, the probe was cruising at a speed of about 2,10,000 kilometres relative to the planet which has a diameter of about 1,40,000 kilometres, the largest in our solar system. \"By comparison, at closest approach, Juno was more than 10 times closer to Jupiter than satellites in geosynchronous orbit are to Earth, travelling at a speed about five times faster than the Apollo missions did when they left Earth for the Moon\", NASA said in a statement. Launched ten years ago, the Juno spacecraft has been NASA's eyes and ears around Jupiter and its Moons and has beamed back several other stunning visuals during its mission. Tap here to see more of Juno's photography. NASA launched the mission from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on August 5, 2011, with an aim to enter Jupiter's orbit and use Juno's suite of scientific instruments and cameras to observe the planet's atmosphere, gravity and magnetic fields. Interestingly, Juno carries two categories of items of historical and educational significance along with nine scientific instruments. The first is a plaque provided by the Italian Space Agency that depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting which was penned in January 1610. The reason why Galileo has been given such importance is that it was this Italian astronomer who discovered Jupiter's four biggest moons, which are now known as Galilean satellites.
