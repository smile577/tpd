The future USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) will be the lead ship of the Navy's newest destroyer class, designed for littoral operations and land attack. The ship began its translation from Bath Iron Works' land-level construction facility to a floating dry dock on Friday. Once loaded into the dry dock, the dock was flooded and the ship was removed from its specially designed cradle. By late Monday, the dock had been flooded and the ship was floated off and tied to a pier on the Kennebec River. \"This is the largest ship Bath Iron Works has ever constructed and the Navy's largest destroyer. The launch was unprecedented in both its size and complexity,\" said Capt. Jim Downey, the Zumwalt-class program manager for the Navy's Program Executive Office, Ships. \"Due to meticulous planning and execution, the operation went very smoothly. I'm extremely pleased with the results and applaud the combined efforts of the Navy-industry team.\" Construction began on DDG 1000 in February 2009, and the Navy and its industry partners have worked to mature the ship's design and ready their industrial facilities to build this advanced surface combatant. Zumwalt is currently more than 87 percent complete, and the shipbuilder will continue remaining construction work on the hull prior to planned delivery late next year. Because of the complexity of the first-of-class ship, the Navy will perform a two-phase delivery process. Bath Iron Works will deliver the ship itself to the Navy in late 2014. Upon delivery, the Navy will then conduct combat systems activation, tests and trials, to include multiple underway periods. The ship is expected to reach its initial operating capability in 2016. The ship, the first of three Zumwalt-class destroyers, will provide independent forward presence and deterrence, support special operations forces and operate as part of joint and combined expeditionary forces. The Navy has incorporated many new technologies into the ship's unique tumblehome hull, including an all-electric integrated power system and an Advanced Gun System, designed to fire rocket-powered, precision projectiles 63-nautical miles. The shape of the superstructure and the arrangement of its antennas significantly reduce the ship's radar cross section, making the ship less visible to enemy radar at sea. The design also allows for optimal manning with a standard crew size of 130 and an aviation detachment of 28 sailors thereby decreasing lifecycle operations and support costs. The lead ship and class are named in honor of former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Elmo R. \"Bud\" Zumwalt Jr., who served as chief of naval operations from 1970-1974. As one of the Defense Department's largest acquisition organizations, PEO Ships, an affiliated PEO of the Naval Sea Systems Command, is responsible for executing the development and procurement of all major surface combatants, amphibious ships, special mission and support ships and special warfare craft.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131103221523/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/NewsView.aspx?nw=NewsWires&id=320"}, {"title": "Navy new destroyer: USS Zumwalt is bigger, badder than any other destroyer", "date": "2013-10-30", "content": "The Navy's biggest-ever destroyer, the USS Zumwalt, sailed from a Maine port on Monday. The stealth warship is the first of the DDG-1000 class of destroyers, a controversial line of three ships to be deployed to the Pacific during the next three years as sentries to China's burgeoning naval might. The USS Zumwalt is big: It is 610 feet long, has an 11,000-square foot flight deck, and displaces 14,564 tons of water. That's about 100 feet longer than other destroyers, as well a water displacement about 50 percent larger than the next biggest destroyer on the water, the Military Times reported. Despite its colossal size, Zumwalt is also stealthy, with concealed antennas and an angular frame that makes it much less detectable to radar than are current warships. It also packs a punch. Its \"Advanced Gun System\" fires warheads at a range of about 63 miles with impeccable precision, three times farther than current destroyers can fire, CNN reported. Its massive electrical capabilities are also expected to support future laser weapons. But, as precedent suggests with ships of unprecedented size, there's a problem: Engineers aren't quite sure if Zumwalt ships are capable of weathering giant waves, according to Defense News. A single sizable swell that hits the ship's back end might take the ship down, engineers have said. That's because these ships sport a new, downward-sloping hull that primes the ship to move stealthily, but not necessarily stably; traditional ships have upward-flaring hulls. The ships are controversial for more than just their Achilles hull: They are expensive - the most expensive Navy ships ever built, to be exact. Zumwalts began as a dream of the 1990s, imagined as part of the 1991 21st Century Destroyer program, the news website Medium reported. What if a ship could avoid radar detection? What if it could ply the waters unnoticed, a Loch Ness monster of the open seas? What if the US could sport bigger and badder ships than ever before thought possible? The Department of Defense announced in the 1990s that it would build 32 of the novel class of ships, originally called DD 21 and later DD(X). But the cost of building the ships began to float higher and higher, and, as it did, the Pentagon scaled back the number of behemoth ships it planned to put on the water. In 2003, the Pentagon said it would buy 16 ships. Then, it said seven ships. Then, in 2008, it said three ships. In 2009, the number of ships was almost reduced to no ships at all, when costs ballooned to over $5 billion per ship, a violation of the Nunn-McCurdy amendment, which says that defense projects whose cost per unit grows more than 15% above what was originally estimated must be tabled. That year, to keep the program going, Department of Defense officials dialed back the cost of the first Zumwalt destroyer to $3.3 billion, with subsequent ships costing about $2.5 billion. The most recent new destroyer, the US Arleigh Burke class of ships, cost about $1.8 billion each. The Navy is expected to return to building the cheaper class of ships after production wraps up on the three Zumwalts. All three Zumwalt ships, called Zumwalt, Michael Monsoor, and Lyndon B. Johnson, are due to be based out of San Diego and to be charged with policing the Pacific. Their super structures are constructed at Huntington Ingalls Industries, in Gulfport, Miss., and assembled at Maine's Bath Iron Works, which is part of General Dynamics Marine Systems. The first ship will be delivered to the Navy in 2015, the Washington Times reported.

Named after the late Admiral Elmo \"Bud\" Zumwalt, however good or bad (or mediocre) the new warship actually ends up being, it's certainly an interesting one. Its two most immediately interesting features are its radar stealth geometry and its electric-driven propulsion system which is reportedly powerful enough to power the future BAE electromagnetic railgun and possibly also a shipborne laser weapon system like the Raytheon LaWS (Laser Weapon System). The more traditional weapons will be an automated dual 155mm gun system firing GPS-guided shells with onboard trajectory control, Raytheon Tomahawk Cruise Missile system, Raytheon Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) system (wow, Raytheon must be doing pretty well) to handle (i.e., intercept) incoming missile threats, SM-2 anti-aircraft missile battery, and last, but certainly not least, a Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) (VLA) missile sytem, which can send MK 46 Mod 5A (SW) or MK 54 Mod Lightweight Torpedoes after enemy subs. The Zumwalt will target airborne threats using planar-array radar. Underwater threats will be targeted using advanced sonar. The radar-targeted gun system will allow the ship to engage and destroy enemy targets up to 72 miles out. The 155mm cannon are just point, click and shoot, no manual loading required. Easy-peasy. With all that weaponization, the Raytheon Zumwalt-Class Destroyer should be a hyper-lethal naval blaster of heretofore impossible proportions. However, while it can operate in just 30 feet of water, it's still a surface ship, even though it looks like, and probably should be, a submersible ship. So, no matter how much low-observable above-the-water geometry it employs, it's still going to have a lot of exposed surface above the water in daylight and at night. The enemy will thermal/IR (infrared) and night vision imagers. Imagine for a moment if it were that stealthy AND submersible. Then imagine all it has to do is just raise the rail gun and laser out of the water to fire them and engage the enemy, then go right back under the surface. Is it possible that the Zumwalt-Class Destroyer indeed is submersible and can dive like a dolphin, and that this capability is simply classified? Sure, but DefenseReview (DR) is forced for the moment to take the Navy at its word that it's a purely surface ship-and surface ships can be located and sunk much more easily, stealthy or not. If it does get hit by the enemy, DR hope's the ship's advertised level of automation and centralization, which allows the ship to run with half the current crew number, doesn't doom it to automatically sinking. What happens if you need to seal a bunch of holes and repair critical systems real quick? Will there be enough guys on the ship to effectively fight fires? Maybe the answer's \"yes\", and maybe \"it's no\". We just don't know, but we do know the Zumwalt will be about 100 feet longer than current destroyers. 100 feet longer, half the crew. The reader can understand our concern. Defense Review would prefer to see a greater number of smaller, yet hyper-lethal submersible ships, including mini aircraft carriers that can surface, launch some F-35B STOVL (Short Take-Off and Landing) Lightening II fighter aircraft and other STOVL and VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft, and then submerge again in minutes. And, it would be nice if all the submersible ships could launch some of their weapons-missiles and, obviously, torpedoes-while still submerged. All of these ships would of course be ruggedly and redundantly networked, and capable of establishing and maintaining regional micro-networks, in case the central comms (communications network) goes down. This would spread the risk and make it much more difficult for the enemy to deal a crippling blow to our navy. Even if that were to happen though, and we needed a whole fleet of new warships of all kinds, it's probably a pretty safe bet that Raytheon will get the contract. Kidding sort of.

The future USS Zumwalt features an angled hull that looks like a hybrid of something out of Soviet Russia and a James Bond movie. Staff from Bath Iron Works, the Maine shipyard that built the destroyer, and Navy crew members will be on board during the trials for testing and to help prepare the ship for delivery. Once this round of trials is complete, the Navy will begin its own testing, determining the ship's capabilities in different sea conditions, including extremely rough waters. \"We go to find the most miserable places in the ocean and drive at various sea stages,\" Rear Adm. Peter Fanta, director of surface warfare, told The Associated Press. However fancy it may look, the USS Zumwalt's development has been anything but smooth. The 600-foot ship will cost at least $4.4 billion, according to AP -- more than twice the cost of the Navy's current Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers. When the ship was originally proposed in the early 1990s, the Navy ordered 32 of the destroyers. As costs soared, commanders hacked the order down to three. At one point, they tried to kill the program entirely. Now, the Navy is starting development of an entirely new destroyer -- slated for completion in the 2030s -- and is building updated Arleigh Burke destroyers in the meantime. The Zumwalt's design is a far cry from destroyers past. Its sloped \"tumblehome\" hull supposedly makes it harder for radar to detect, it needs a smaller crew for operation, the deck can accommodate more aircraft, and it features two massive guns with incredible attack power and accuracy. Some current and former Navy officials have called into question the seaworthiness of the ship, claiming the new hull shape leaves it vulnerable to rolling over in certain conditions. Defense experts have said it's vulnerable to submarine attacks and will be of little use for current naval needs.", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uss-zumwalt-trial_n_56f19e6ce4b03a640a6c0508"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Largest destroyer built for Navy heads out to sea", "date": "2015-12-08", "content": "The largest destroyer ever built for the U.S. Navy headed out to sea for the first time Monday, departing from shipbuilder Bath Iron Works and carefully navigating the winding Kennebec River before reaching the open ocean where the ship will undergo sea trials.

More than 200 shipbuilders, sailors and residents gathered to watch as the futuristic 600-foot, 15,000-ton USS Zumwalt glided past Fort Popham, accompanied by tugboats. Kelley Campana, a Bath Iron Works employee, said she had goose bumps and tears in her eyes. \"This is pretty exciting. It's a great day to be a shipbuilder and to be an American,\" she said. \"It's the first in its class. There's never been anything like it. It looks like the future.\" Larry Harris, a retired Raytheon employee who worked on the ship, watched it depart from Bath. \"It's as cool as can be. It's nice to see it underway,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it will perform as advertised.\" Bath Iron Works will be testing the ship's performance and making tweaks this winter. The goal is to deliver it to the Navy sometime next year. \"We are absolutely fired up to see Zumwalt get underway. For the crew and all those involved in designing, building, and readying this fantastic ship, this is a huge milestone,\" the ship's skipper, Navy Capt. James Kirk, said before the ship departed. The ship has electric propulsion, new radar and sonar, powerful missiles and guns, and a stealthy design to reduce its radar signature. Advanced automation will allow the warship to operate with a much smaller crew size than current destroyers. All of that innovation has led to construction delays and a growing price tag. The Zumwalt, the first of three ships in the class, will cost at least $4.4 billion. The ship looks like nothing ever built at Bath Iron Works. The inverse bow juts forward to slice through the waves. Sharp angles deflect enemy radar signals. Radar and antennas are hidden in a composite deckhouse. The builder sea trials will answer any questions of seaworthiness for a ship that utilizes a type of hull associated with pre-dreadnought battleships from a century ago. Critics say the \"tumblehome\" hull's sloping shape makes it less stable than conventional hulls, but it contributes to the ship's stealth and the Navy is confident in the design. Eric Wertheim, author and editor of the U.S. Naval Institute's \"Guide to Combat Fleets of the World,\" said there's no question the integration of so many new systems from the electric drive to the tumblehome hull carries some level of risk. Operational concerns, growing costs and fleet makeup led the Navy to truncate the 32-ship program to three ships, he said.

The guided missile destroyer will undergo repairs at a former U.S. naval station until its fit to complete its journey to Naval Station San Diego, Calif., U.S. 3rd Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Ryan Perry told USNI News. The ship was in the midst of a southbound transit through the canal when it suffered the casualty, Under orders from U.S. 3rd Fleet commander Vice Adm. Nora Tyson, Zumwalt is now stopped for repairs at the former U.S. Naval Station Rodman, he said. \"The timeline for repairs is being determined now, in direct coordination with Naval Sea Systems and Naval Surface Forces,\" he said. \"The schedule for the ship will remain flexible to enable testing and evaluation in order to ensure the ship's safe transit to her new homeport in San Diego.\" A defense official told USNI News on Tuesday the repairs could take up to ten days. The ship lost propulsion in its port shaft during the transit and the crew saw water intrusion in two of the four bearings that connect to Zumwalt's port and starboard Advanced Induction Motors (AIMs) to the drive shafts, a defense official told USNI News on Tuesday. The AIMs are the massive electrical motors that are driven by the ship's gas turbines and in turn electrically power the ship's systems and drive the shafts.

And where we had kind of gotten away from a lot of the schoolhouse, hands-on type training and moved to the computer-based training that you love or hate, depending on where you sit, we realized that that wasn't the best way to probably train some of our sailors ... especially when it comes to the maintenance, the troubleshooting, the repair aspect we ask our sailors to do, particularly the engineering trades.\" Galinis later told USNI News, on new ships, \"one of the things that we've really kind of come to understand is that, especially for sailors that are maintainers that troubleshoot and repair those systems, you really need a little bit more advanced training than just a computer-based training course or reading a tech manual of some sort. That's where that hands-on training really comes into play. So shore-based training, and we've really leveraged that.\" Galinis noted that the Surface Training Systems Program Office (PMS 339) manages trainers for new ship classes, including the LCS and Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000). For future classes of ships, he said, that organization would be involved early on and \"I think that [type of trainer] will be a key component of any training strategy going forward for a new class of ship.\" The admiral added that other decisions, such as using existing hull forms for new purposes - like using the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock (LPD-17) as the basis of the LX(R) dock landing ship replacement, now called LPD Flight II - would also contribute to improved training because mature training pipelines could be leveraged instead of having to start from scratch. \"Where we had put new training courses and new training opportunities for sailors on the LPD-class ship, those are easily transferable to the Flight II,\" Galinis said.

According to U.S. Naval Institute News, the House of Representatives' 2021 defense budget will carry a provision ordering the Navy to begin integration of Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPS) onto the Zumwalt class destroyers by 2021. CPS is a hypersonic weapon system that travels at speeds in excess of Mach 5-nobody really knows how fast-to destroy time-sensitive targets on the ground. CPS was originally designed to deploy aboard U.S. Navy submarines. The U.S. Navy originally intended the stealthy Zumwalts as land attack destroyers, meant to creep up to an adversary's coastline and then bombard targets ashore with the ship's new 155-millimeter Advanced Gun Systems. The Navy cut the number of destroyers from 32 to just three, causing the price of the AGS' precision-guided shell to balloon from a pricey $50,000 each to an unaffordable $566,000. As a result the U.S. Navy is repurposing the three remaining Zumwalts into ship killers, and plans to add new anti-ship missiles to the destroyers' vertical launch silos.

Black destroyers on April 24. DDG-1000 is the lead ship of three multi-mission surface combatant destroyers. The delivery marks a milestone in the dual delivery approach to the Zumwalt -class vessels. It previously reached the first delivery stage, Hull Mechanical & Electrical, from shipbuilder General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works in May 2016. The USS Zumwalt at the start of its journey from Bath, Maine to its homeport of San Diego. Since HM&E was completed, Raytheon Technologies [RTX] is the prime contractor for the Zumwalt Combat System and has been leading activation and integration for Zumwalt-class ships in San Diego and Bath. After the delivery, the ship will next transition from Combat Systems Activation to the next phase of developmental and integrated at-sea testing. With the delivery, DDG-1000 now officially joins the U.S. Pacific Fleet battle force, but will remain assigned to Surface Development Squadron One, the Navy said. The Zumwalt is slated to operate as a \"key enabler in the acceleration of new warfighting capabilities and rapid development and validation of operational tactics, techniques, and procedures\" beyond continuing at-sea testing of its combat system, the Navy said in a statement. Capt. Andrew Carlson, the commanding officer of USS Zumwalt, noted DDG-1000 sailed over 9,000 miles and 100 days at sea in 2019. \"Every day the ship is at sea, the officers and crew learn more about her capability, and can immediately inform the continued development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to not only integrate Zumwalt into the fleet, but to advance the Navy's understanding of operations with a stealth destroyer,\" he said in a statement. After 2019 activities, \"we are absolutely looking forward to more aggressive at-sea testing and validation of the combat systems leading to achievement of initial operational capability,\" Carlson added. The Zumwalt's sister ship, the USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) is homeported in San Diego as well and is undergoing combat system activation. The final ship in the class, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002) is currently under construction at Bath Iron Works. Separately, the Navy also accepted delivery of DDG-119 from shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries [HII], the 68th Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. Delivery marks the official transfer of the ship from the builder to the Navy. The ship was built at HII's Ingalls Shipbuilding shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss. The Delbert D. Black previously completed acceptance trials in March when it underwent demonstrations for the Navy's Board of inspection and Survey while at sea in the Gulf of Mexico (Defense Daily, March 17). The ship was built with the Aegis Baseline 9 combat system that includes upgraded integrated air and missile defense capabilities to better detect and react to air and missile defense threats via increased computing power and radar upgrades. \"Ingalls has delivered another highly capable platform that will sail from our shores and help protect the nation for decades to come,\" Capt. Seth Miller, DDG-51 class program manager, Program Executive Office (PEO) Ships, said in a statement. HII's Pascagoula shipyard is currently in production on the future destroyers Frank E. Peterson Jr. (DDG-121), Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123), and the Flight III ships Jack H. Lucas (DDG-125) and Ted Stevens (DDG-128).

She said the ship did not carry a helicopter detachment during the deployment but did carry two rigid-hull inflatable boats for mine countermeasures exercises. Thompson said the Zumwalt exercised all of its mission areas typical for a DDG. He also said the ship took advantage of the deployment for testing and assessment of signature management, about which he was not at liberty to detail because of classification. \"We expect to capitalize on those lessons learned as we continue to employ the ship forward and integrate that platform into fleet operations and exercises,\" Thompson said. Thompson said that in his assessment, Zumwalt achieved Initial Operational Capability \"today.\" The commodore said the Zumwalt had no direct interaction with Chinese navy ships during the deployment.

The Zumwalt, which departed Naval Station San Diego on Aug. 1, operated in the U.S. 3rd Fleet and U.S. 7th Fleet areas of responsibility. The deployment involved a wide variety of training, testing and evaluation of operational concepts, fleet integration, crew size and ship systems, said Capt. Shea Thompson, commodore of Surface Development Squadron One, and Capt. Amy McInnis, commanding officer of USS Zumwalt, in a Nov. 16 media roundtable. The deployment, which concentrated on fleet integration, was termed \"very successful\" by Thompson who called it an important milestone for the DDG 1000 class and for the Navy\" and that it marked \"significant strides in learning how to employ, integrate and sustain Zumwalt as she operated forward\" and a \"significant step forward for the future of this class.\"  During the deployment, the Zumwalt operated and trained in joint simulated fires training with a Japanese destroyer and a U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber; mine countermeasures proof of concept work with a forward-deployed explosive ordnance detachment; operations with fleet maritime operations centers, and the staff of the 7th Fleet's Task Force 71; and operations with U.S. Army aviation.
