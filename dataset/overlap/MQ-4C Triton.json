The MFAS is a 360-degree field-of-regard active electronically scanned array radar designed for maritime surveillance. The X-Band two-dimensional sensor features a combination of electronic scanning and a mechanical rotation, allowing the radar to spotlight a geographic area of interest for longer periods to increase detection capabilities of smaller targets, particularly in sea clutter. \"BAMS will provide the Navy with a very capable persistent maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance system to provide a capability to detect, track, classify, and identify maritime and littoral targets,\" said Capt. Bob Dishman, the Navy's BAMS UAS program manager. \"With our successful Critical Design Review behind us and sensor testing underway, our customer-industry team is rapidly pulling the components together that will result in first MQ-4C flight next year,\" said Steve Enewold, Northrop Grumman vice president for the BAMS program. The MFAS tests are being conducted in a laboratory environment at Northrop Grumman and are expected to continue over the next several months in parallel with ongoing radar software mode development and hardware synchronization and integration activities. The first MFAS sensor is scheduled for delivery to Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector facility in SanDiego, Calif., in June with a second sensor slated for delivery in September. Risk reduction flight tests of the MFAS are planned for later this year onboard the company's Gulfstream II test-bed aircraft. \"This is a very significant first step toward providing the U.S. Navy warfighter with a new and powerful ISR capability,\" said Paul \"Buz\" Kalafos, vice president of Surveillance Systems at Northrop Grumman's Electronic Systems sector. The Northrop Grumman MQ-4C BAMS UAS is a versatile maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft system that will perform maritime missions independently or in direct collaboration with fleet assets. BAMS UAS will play a key role in providing fleet commanders with a persistent, reliable picture of maritime surface contacts, covering vast areas of open ocean and littoral regions in a highly efficient manner.

The new unmanned aircraft, based on Northrop's Global Hawk, will soon help patrol the oceans along with Navy aircraft such as the P-3 by providing overhead surveillance. \"It's been made more robust,\" Walt Kreitler, Northrop's director of business development for BAMS, says of the new Triton aircraft. The MQ-4C maintains many basic elements of the Global Hawk design, along with airframe improvements including anti-icing capabilities, improved anti-lightning protection, and a new wing design. The Triton is designed to be vertically agile-meaning, for example, that it could descend quickly through clouds to take a picture of a ship. It's bigger than the Global Hawk, with a wingspan of 130 feet. The Triton will be based at five locations around the world and will have a range of 8000 nautical miles. Beyond the changes to the airframe, the MQ-4C also carries different equipment to optimize it for maritime surveillance. The Triton will be equipped with a Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) designed specifically for spotting objects in the ocean. This \"field of regard\" radar will provide 360-degree coverage of the area below, allowing it to spot ships and other objects of interest. The Triton will also fly a \"due regard\" radar that will help provide sense-and-avoid capabilities, a critical component for allowing unmanned aircraft to fly in the national airspace alongside manned aircraft. Once the aircraft are delivered to the Navy it will begin flight testing, first at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and then at Patuxent River in Maryland. Currently the Triton's 360-degree radar is being flown on a Gulf Stream aircraft, which Kreitler says has been a big success. The next step will be integrating it on the unmanned airframe. The Navy is scheduled to begin operating the Triton in 2015, with full capability fielded about five years after that. Although Triton is based upon the RQ-4 Global Hawk, Northrop and the Navy have plenty of reason to emphasize the differences between the two. The Air Force's Global Hawk platform has suffered a couple of hits to its reputation over the past year. First, the Global Hawk Block 30 aircraft, which was supposed to replace the manned U-2 spy aircraft, is on the chopping block because of escalating costs. The Pentagon wants to cancel the program and currently plans to keep the U-2s flying instead. Then there was the ill-timed crash earlier this week, when a Navy Global Hawk that was flying over Maryland went down. The cause of the crash still isn't known, but Northrop is making a special effort to emphasize that the doomed aircraft, though part of the BAMS program, was not a MQ-4C Triton but rather a Global Hawk airframe that the Navy had adapted. With every Pentagon weapon under scrutiny, one of the keys to keeping the Triton on track will be ensuring that it doesn't suffer from the cost growth that plagued the Global Hawk. Kreitler remains confident that the Triton, which should save money on crew costs and transit time, will remain cost-effective. \"Pound for pound, dollar for dollar for fuel, hour for hour of crew time, you get much more surveillance product [compared to manned aircraft],\" he says.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a7712/meet-triton-the-navys-new-spy-drone-9718704/"}, {"title": "Northrop Grumman Unveils US Navy's MQ-4C BAMS Triton unmanned aircraft", "date": "2012-06-16", "content": "If Broad Area Maritime Surveillance, or war gadgets are your bag, then things just got real.

Orion and P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance/anti-submarine aircraft. Guam's Andersen Air Force Base (AFB) currently operates three Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in a limited surveillance role. The RQ-4 was designed primarily to perform land surveillance duties, not long-duration ocean surveillance sweeps. In an interview with ABC News, intelligence analyst Matthew Aid said that the RQ-4 \"was designed for pinpoint imagery or eavesdropping on land targets, by over flight, or by flying obliquely up to 450 kilometers off an enemy's coastline\" while the MQ-4C \"was designed for broad area maritime surveillance - following ships from high altitude.\" Joe Gradisher, Public Affairs Officer for the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), recently told Stars & Stripes newspaper that the Navy's Tritons would join the Global Hawks at Guam. Mr. Gradisher told Stars & Stripes that current plans \"for BAMS include the use of Guam, but other bases may be considered in the future, subject to combatant commander desires and future diplomatic arrangements.\" The Japan Times newspaper and ABC News also reported the decision to base the Tritons at Guam. As part of the United States' \"pivot\" to the Asia-Pacific region, the US Navy is working towards reinforcing its maritime surveillance capability in the Pacific Ocean arena. Existing plans call for the new Boeing P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol/Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft to be deployed as a replacement for the Navy's venerable Lockheed Martin P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft. The P-8A Poseidon is designed to operate with the Navy's new MQ-4C Triton in an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role that includes the interdiction of maritime shipping and performance of electronic intelligence (ELINT) functions. The P-3 has been in service with the navies of many nations since 1962 and is nearing retirement. The P-8s are expected to begin replacing some of the aging P-3s assigned to stateside squadrons next year. Existing plans call for the acquisition of 68 Tritons and 117 Poseidons to replace the P-3C Orions still operational. By pairing the MQ-4C Triton BAMS drone with the P-8A Poseidon in the Pacific, the US Navy will be able to maintain a continuous long-range surveillance over a wide expanse of the Asia-Pacific region to an extent the P-3C Orions cannot match. As tensions between Japan, China, and other Asian-Pacific nations have continued to escalate and are beginning to pose a threat to regional peace, an enhanced surveillance force is a capability US Pacific commanders are anxious to get into operation. There is also a very real possibility that Japan will be deploying its drones to Andersen AFB in the near future as well. Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that the United States and Japan were discussing a proposal to jointly-base US and Japanese UAVs in Guam. The Japan Times newspaper also released a story, citing an anonymous source, stating that the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) was in negotiations with US representatives to arrange a joint-use arrangement that would allow the JSDF to operate drones from Guam. The joint-use proposal, as reported by the Japan Times, would provide for the JSDF to share USAF/USN hangars, flight support, and maintenance facilities. A previous Japanese proposal to buy Global Hawks was dropped because of cost considerations, but JSDF officials insist it is their desire to buy surveillance drones sometime between Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2020. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) currently operates 80 P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, five EP-3C ELINT Orions, and four OP-3C reconnaissance models from various air stations throughout the Japanese Archipelago. These aircraft were built under license by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. United States Navy officials and JMSDF officers are well aware that Japan's fleet of Orions is not capable of providing the long-duration continuous surveillance of Pacific sea lanes needed to keep an eye on China's rapidly-growing, technologically-advanced naval presence. A joint-basing arrangement would be advantageous to both nations with respect to cost-savings, workload reductions, information sharing, and joint-force readiness. US military officials at Guam declined comment on the MQ-4C basing reports. Navy Lieutenant William Knight said that he could neither confirm nor deny the reports, but indicated that pertinent information could be forthcoming at a later date.", "url": "https://defense-update.com/20120917_uas-on-maritime-surveillance-pacific.html#.ZGIjx3ZBxPY"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Northrop Grumman Unveils U.S. Navy's First MQ-4C BAMS Unmanned Aircraft", "date": "2012-06-14", "content": "Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) unveiled the first U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Unmanned Aircraft System (BAMS UAS) in a ceremony today at Northrop Grumman's Palmdale, Calif., manufacturing facility. \"Northrop Grumman is proud to provide our U.S. Navy customer with the MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft, a key element of the BAMS UAS program, representing the future of naval aviation and a strategic element of the U.S. Navy,\" said Duke Dufresne, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems sector vice president and general manager for unmanned systems. \"The BAMS UAS program will revolutionize persistent maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

Though at first glance it looks a lot like the Air Force's high-flying spy drone, the Navy's new surveillance aircraft doesn't want to be confused with the Global Hawk. Northrop Grumman today unveiled its MQ-4C Triton, an unmanned aircraft the company has built for the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) program. The new unmanned aircraft, based on Northrop's Global Hawk, will soon help patrol the oceans along with Navy aircraft such as the P-3 by providing overhead surveillance. \"It's been made more robust,\" Walt Kreitler, Northrop's director of business development for BAMS, says of the new Triton aircraft. The MQ-4C maintains many basic elements of the Global Hawk design, along with airframe improvements including anti-icing capabilities, improved anti-lightning protection, and a new wing design. The Triton is designed to be vertically agile-meaning, for example, that it could descend quickly through clouds to take a picture of a ship. It's bigger than the Global Hawk, with a wingspan of 130 feet. The Triton will be based at five locations around the world and will have a range of 8000 nautical miles. Beyond the changes to the airframe, the MQ-4C also carries different equipment to optimize it for maritime surveillance. The Triton will be equipped with a Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) designed specifically for spotting objects in the ocean. This \"field of regard\" radar will provide 360-degree coverage of the area below, allowing it to spot ships and other objects of interest. The Triton will also fly a \"due regard\" radar that will help provide sense-and-avoid capabilities, a critical component for allowing unmanned aircraft to fly in the national airspace alongside manned aircraft. Once the aircraft are delivered to the Navy it will begin flight testing, first at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and then at Patuxent River in Maryland. Currently the Triton's 360-degree radar is being flown on a Gulf Stream aircraft, which Kreitler says has been a big success. The next step will be integrating it on the unmanned airframe. The Navy is scheduled to begin operating the Triton in 2015, with full capability fielded about five years after that. Although Triton is based upon the RQ-4 Global Hawk, Northrop and the Navy have plenty of reason to emphasize the differences between the two. The Air Force's Global Hawk platform has suffered a couple of hits to its reputation over the past year. First, the Global Hawk Block 30 aircraft, which was supposed to replace the manned U-2 spy aircraft, is on the chopping block because of escalating costs. The Pentagon wants to cancel the program and currently plans to keep the U-2s flying instead. Then there was the ill-timed crash earlier this week, when a Navy Global Hawk that was flying over Maryland went down. The cause of the crash still isn't known, but Northrop is making a special effort to emphasize that the doomed aircraft, though part of the BAMS program, was not a MQ-4C Triton but rather a Global Hawk airframe that the Navy had adapted. With every Pentagon weapon under scrutiny, one of the keys to keeping the Triton on track will be ensuring that it doesn't suffer from the cost growth that plagued the Global Hawk. Kreitler remains confident that the Triton, which should save money on crew costs and transit time, will remain cost-effective. \"Pound for pound, dollar for dollar for fuel, hour for hour of crew time, you get much more surveillance product [compared to manned aircraft],\" he says.", "url": "https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a7712/meet-triton-the-navys-new-spy-drone-9718704/"}, {"title": "Northrop Grumman Unveils US Navy's MQ-4C BAMS Triton unmanned aircraft", "date": "2012-06-16", "content": "If Broad Area Maritime Surveillance, or war gadgets are your bag, then things just got real.

Orion and P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance/anti-submarine aircraft. Guam's Andersen Air Force Base (AFB) currently operates three Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in a limited surveillance role. The RQ-4 was designed primarily to perform land surveillance duties, not long-duration ocean surveillance sweeps. In an interview with ABC News, intelligence analyst Matthew Aid said that the RQ-4 \"was designed for pinpoint imagery or eavesdropping on land targets, by over flight, or by flying obliquely up to 450 kilometers off an enemy's coastline\" while the MQ-4C \"was designed for broad area maritime surveillance - following ships from high altitude.\" Joe Gradisher, Public Affairs Officer for the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), recently told Stars & Stripes newspaper that the Navy's Tritons would join the Global Hawks at Guam. Mr. Gradisher told Stars & Stripes that current plans \"for BAMS include the use of Guam, but other bases may be considered in the future, subject to combatant commander desires and future diplomatic arrangements.\" The Japan Times newspaper and ABC News also reported the decision to base the Tritons at Guam. As part of the United States' \"pivot\" to the Asia-Pacific region, the US Navy is working towards reinforcing its maritime surveillance capability in the Pacific Ocean arena. Existing plans call for the new Boeing P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol/Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft to be deployed as a replacement for the Navy's venerable Lockheed Martin P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft. The P-8A Poseidon is designed to operate with the Navy's new MQ-4C Triton in an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role that includes the interdiction of maritime shipping and performance of electronic intelligence (ELINT) functions. The P-3 has been in service with the navies of many nations since 1962 and is nearing retirement. The P-8s are expected to begin replacing some of the aging P-3s assigned to stateside squadrons next year. Existing plans call for the acquisition of 68 Tritons and 117 Poseidons to replace the P-3C Orions still operational. By pairing the MQ-4C Triton BAMS drone with the P-8A Poseidon in the Pacific, the US Navy will be able to maintain a continuous long-range surveillance over a wide expanse of the Asia-Pacific region to an extent the P-3C Orions cannot match. As tensions between Japan, China, and other Asian-Pacific nations have continued to escalate and are beginning to pose a threat to regional peace, an enhanced surveillance force is a capability US Pacific commanders are anxious to get into operation. There is also a very real possibility that Japan will be deploying its drones to Andersen AFB in the near future as well. Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that the United States and Japan were discussing a proposal to jointly-base US and Japanese UAVs in Guam. The Japan Times newspaper also released a story, citing an anonymous source, stating that the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) was in negotiations with US representatives to arrange a joint-use arrangement that would allow the JSDF to operate drones from Guam. The joint-use proposal, as reported by the Japan Times, would provide for the JSDF to share USAF/USN hangars, flight support, and maintenance facilities. A previous Japanese proposal to buy Global Hawks was dropped because of cost considerations, but JSDF officials insist it is their desire to buy surveillance drones sometime between Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2020. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) currently operates 80 P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, five EP-3C ELINT Orions, and four OP-3C reconnaissance models from various air stations throughout the Japanese Archipelago. These aircraft were built under license by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. United States Navy officials and JMSDF officers are well aware that Japan's fleet of Orions is not capable of providing the long-duration continuous surveillance of Pacific sea lanes needed to keep an eye on China's rapidly-growing, technologically-advanced naval presence. A joint-basing arrangement would be advantageous to both nations with respect to cost-savings, workload reductions, information sharing, and joint-force readiness.

Northrop Grumman's vice president and programme manager for Triton Steve Enewold said: \"Through numerous engine runs and checks with communications systems between the aircraft and ground controllers, we can ensure that everything is working properly before entering taxi testing as the next step in our efforts.\" The company was awarded systems development and demonstration contract in 2008 to build and test two aircraft in preparation for operational deployment with the US Navy by late 2015. Officially named Triton, the MQ-4C BAMS UAS will provide constant surveillance for the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) to carry out littoral missions. Developed as a naval version of the US Air Force's RQ-4 Global Hawk aircraft, the MQ-4C BAMS UAS has been designed to conduct maritime surveillance, gather enemy battle information, battle damage assessment and port surveillance missions.

The MQ-4C Triton took off today for the first time from a Palmdale, California airfield, a major step in the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. Northrop Grumman, which manufactured the 130.9-foot-wingspan drone, said the maiden voyage lasted an hour and a half. The Navy even announced it via Twitter. \"First flight represents a critical step in maturing Triton's systems before operationally supporting the Navy's maritime surveillance mission around the world,\" Capt. James Hoke, Triton's program manager, said in a statement. If the Triton looks familiar, it should. It's a souped-up version of the Air Force's old reliable spy drone, Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk. The Navy's made some modifications to the airframe and the sensors it carries to ensure it can spy on vast swaths of ocean, from great height. (It's unarmed, if you were wondering.) The idea is for the Triton to achieve altitudes of nearly 53,000 feet - that's 10 miles up - where it will scan 2,000 nautical miles at a single robotic blink. (Notice that wingspan is bigger than a 737's.) Its sensors, Northrop boasts, will \"detect and automatically classify\" ships, giving captains a much broader view of what's on the water than radar, sonar and manned aircraft provide. Not only that, Triton is a flying communications relay station, bouncing \"airborne communications and information sharing capabilities\" between ships. And it can fly about 11,500 miles without refueling. The Navy wants 68 of these aircraft. But the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Program hasn't all been shining successes. Almost a year ago, a Global Hawk that the Air Force loaned the Navy to experiment with at Pax River Air Station went down in Maryland. Northrop says it'll put the Triton through additional flight tests before sending it to Pax River later this year. While most of the military has said it's got enough drones, thanks, the Navy is moving forward with at least two advanced drone programs.

The Navy's goal is to have 20 of the huge drones available at any given time to use for five continuous \"orbits\" of maritime surveillance. It takes four planes to make up one orbit. Rising reliability rates mean the Navy may not need as many of the high-altitude aircraft as first thought, said Captain Jim Hoke, who runs the Triton program for the Navy. Northrop had no immediate comment on the matter. Hoke said he was mindful of tough budget pressures facing the Navy and also had a team looking for other ways to reduce the cost of building and operating the Triton unmanned system. The overall development program is slated to cost about $3 billion, Hoke said. The plane's design was based on the unmanned Global Hawk plane that Northrop builds for the Air Force, but the two planes have only about 20-30 percent in common, Hoke said. The Navy aims to start early operational use of two Triton aircraft by the end of 2017, with the formal \"initial operational capability\" to follow about six months later when two additional aircraft are delivered. The date slipped due to budget cuts that slowed Northrop's production, Hoke said. Each aircraft now costs about $100 million, but Hoke said the Navy hoped to drive the cost down by finding more efficient ways to build the planes in coming years. Hoke said all new weapons programs were vulnerable during lean budget times, but demand for maritime surveillance remained strong. He said the BAMS-D demonstration aircraft that preceded Triton has been used in the Middle East for six years. The Navy expects to award Northrop a small contract to buy certain components for the first low-production aircraft once the fiscal 2015 budget is approved, Hoke said. He said the number of aircraft in that first batch of orders would be determined as part of the fiscal 2016 budget deliberations.

Each aircraft now costs about $100 million, but Hoke said the Navy hoped to drive the cost down by finding more efficient ways to build the planes in coming years. Hoke said all new weapons programs were vulnerable during lean budget times, but demand for maritime surveillance remained strong. He said the BAMS-D demonstration aircraft that preceded Triton has been used in the Middle East for six years. The Navy expects to award Northrop a small contract to buy certain components for the first low-production aircraft once the fiscal 2015 budget is approved, Hoke said. He said the number of aircraft in that first batch of orders would be determined as part of the fiscal 2016 budget deliberations. The first of three Triton planes arrived at the base in southern Maryland on Thursday after completing its longest flight ever, a 3,000-mile, 11-hour journey from California. Hoke said two more aircraft would arrive at the base in coming weeks. The planes are due to conduct about 2,000 hours of flight testing before it enters service in 2017. The second plane will have its first flight in California this week, Hoke said. Hoke said he hoped to resume work on an Exelis Inc system that will allow the airplane to \"sense and avoid\" other aircraft before the end of the year, when he is due to retire. The Navy halted work on the system last year after running into technical issues, and has been working closely with prime contractor Northrop to find a way to fix the problem. Northrop's deputy Triton program manager Tim Kesecker said the company had pulled in experts from other divisions, and he was upbeat that agreement would be reached soon.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151014173354/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/northrop-grumman-navy-triton-idUSL2N0RO2G920140923"}, {"title": "Navy Shifts MQ-4C Tritons to East Coast, Adds Functionality", "date": "2014-09-24", "content": "The U.S. Navy is shifting its developmental fleet of unmanned MQ-4C Tritons across the country to introduce mission systems and continue flight-testing the new maritime surveillance aircraft. The first of three Triton system development test articles (SDTA) arrived recently at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md.; the other two will follow by the end of October. SDTA 1 landed at NAS Patuxent River at 7:53 a.m. on September 18 after a nearly 11-hour, 3,290-nm ferry flight from manufacturer Northrop Grumman's Palmdale, Calif., facility. The aircraft arrived on the East Coast without mission system and airborne collision avoidance capabilities, which will come with new software iterations. The Navy is still working the technical challenge of adding a full \u201csense and avoid\u201d capability the aircraft will need to fly in unrestricted airspace. The Triton launched from restricted airspace above Edwards Air Force Base in California and landed in restricted airspace at Patuxent River. It flew an instrument route the Federal Aviation Administration approved along the southern U.S. border, the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida. Navy operators flew the aircraft at altitudes exceeding 50,000 feet along the Atlantic coast and the Chesapeake Bay to avoid conflicts with civilian air traffic. Its maximum altitude during the ferry flight was 58,000 feet. An integrated functional capability (IFC) 2.2 software build will incorporate the Northrop Grumman multifunction active sensor radar, Raytheon MTS-B multispectral targeting system, electronic support measures and automatic identification system, said Capt. James Hoke, the Navy's Triton program manager. Satellite-based position reporting and collision avoidance capabilities will follow when an IFC 3 software build in 2016 adds automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and traffic alert and collision avoidance system (Tcas) capabilities. These will be available when the Triton reaches initial operational capability in 2017, providing a measure of sense-and-avoid protection.

The operational assessment involved analysing sensor and aircraft performance over about 60 flight hours, Northrop says. The tests evaluated the MQ-4C's key sensors - an active electronically scanned array radar, an electro-optic/infrared camera and a hydrocarbon detector - over different altitudes and ranges, analysing the \"system's ability [to] classify targets and [disseminate] critical data\", Northrop says. The navy is still analysing the results and a favourable review could clear the way for awarding the first low-rate initial production contract to Northrop in the second quarter. The navy decided to launch low-rate initial production a year ahead of the next major operational test event. The initial operational test and evaluate phase is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2017, forming a 'graduation exercise' for the unmanned adjunct of the Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. In the navy's original concept, the MQ-4C will provide broad area surveillance over five orbits encircling the globe. As the unmanned aircraft identifies targets, it will be able to cue the manned P-8A to go in for a closer look or deploy weapons. That strategy led to the navy's decision to buy 70 MQ-4Cs, including two aircraft reserved for flight test. Four aircraft are needed to support a continuous surveillance orbit at each of the five sites, leading to a fleet requirement of 20 aircraft. Another 48 aircraft were added to the procurement to replace attrition losses. The attrition number was driven by a navy estimate predicting four aircraft losses per 100,000 flight hours. That estimate has drawn scrutiny from the Department of Defense's inspector general. In an audit released in September, the inspector general urged the navy to review the attrition requirement after the results of the operational assessment and the initial operational test and evaluation periods are available.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160218100920/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/mq-4c-clears-step-before-production-decision-422013/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "MQ-4C Triton Approved To Enter Low-Rate Initial Production After Successful Review", "date": "2016-09-26", "content": "The Navy's MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system received Milestone C low-rate initial production approval after a successful Milestone Decision Authority review, contractor Northrop Grumman announced today.

The squadron's members are formed into crews, just as any other Navy patrol squadron, but the P-8A pilots, naval flight officers and aviation warfare operators don't fly, instead controlling the aircraft from a mission control system. The squadron's mission and aircraft are designed to complement the Navy's P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft, which are currently being phased into the fleet, replacing the P-3 Orion. With a 130-foot wingspan, the Triton aircraft is expected to have a maximum flight endurance of up to 28-hours, giving it the ability to cover up to 1 million square miles of ocean in a single patrol mission. Though like its Global Hawk sister, the aircraft is usually flown from a ground control station, the hope is that it could also be controlled eventually from a P-8, but that capability has yet to be officially developed. VUP-19's operators will be in on the ground floor of that effort, helping the Navy develop the operational techniques and procedures for operating the two together, Navy sources tell Navy Times. That effort will use the lessons gained from another twin-aircraft effort, the teaming of the MH-60 helicopter and the MQ-8 Fire Scout while taking the capability into long-range,fixed-wing maritime patrols. VUP-19 was named after Patrol Squadron 19, which was in service from 1946 until 1991. It takes on the squadron's name and nickname of \"Big Red.\" Its unit patch is also a nod to the former P-3 Orion squadron, but has been updated to reflect the unit's new mission.

Triton will reach an initial operational capability in 2021, and the Navy will add two additional aircraft to the Guam orbit. Under the current concept of operations for the platform, four airframes will make up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. \"One on the way out, one on station, one on the way back and one in maintenance,\" Mackin said. The first capability will combine a series of electro-optical sensors and radar to track maritime targets from as high as 60,000 feet over the ocean and compare tracks to automated identification systems on ships. A Triton will relay the information back to one of two main operating bases in the U.S. - Naval Station Mayport, Fla., and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.

One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" The Navy took delivery of the first operational Triton earlier this year, and that vehicle is currently being tested at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, Calif., ahead of the deployment to Guam, Mackin said.

The program plans to complete testing an integrated functional capability (IFC) 3 configuration Triton by August, fulfilling the requirements of its Milestone B approval in 2008-the start of engineering and manufacturing development. Manufacturer Northrop Grumman has built three system development and demonstration models of the RQ-4B Global Hawk derivative, two of which the Navy owns, as well as a fatigue test article. Last September, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $255 million contract to produce three low-rate initial production Lot 1 Tritons. The manufacturer is currently building early operational capability aircraft B-5 and B-6 at its Palmdale, California facility. These will be sent to the Navy's Point Mugu test range later this year, with final delivery starting in mid-2018. Triton IFC 3 is the version that will enter service with the Navy next year; it comes equipped with the Northrop Grumman AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) maritime radar, Raytheon MTS-B electro-optical/infrared sensor turret, automatic identification system receiver and electronic support measures. \"IFC 3 equals baseline Triton,\" said Sean Burke, program manager for persistent maritime unmanned aircraft systems with the Naval Air Systems Command (Navair). \"The primary focus now for the program is completing the system development and demonstration contract and handing the system over to the fleet,\" he told reporters April 4 at the Navy League Sea-Air-Space conference. Once IFC 3 testing is completed, the program will deliver the aircraft to the Navy's VX-1 air test and evaluation squadron in September, Burke explained. The test squadron will conduct a two-month operational evaluation involving air crew and maintainers from Unmanned Patrol Squadron (VUP) 19 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, the Navy's first Triton squadron. VUP-19 will conduct its own safe-for-flight certification process before beginning operations with the aircraft next year. Recently, the program completed the preliminary design review phase of Triton IFC 4, a \"multi-int\" upgrade that includes SIGINT functionality. Congress specified in the 2011 national defense authorization act that the Navy produce a comparable system to replace the EP-3, a SIGINT-capable, multi-intelligence platform based on the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. Working with Navair's PMA-290 maritime surveillance program office, the Triton program is incorporating a SIGINT sensor payload with components from Boeing Argon ST and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Plans call for delivering the IFC 4 version in 2021 to coincide with the Navy's retirement of the EP-3. \"The Triton has always had a requirement to provide a SIGINT capability; that traces back to our original requirements document. But it was not a defined capability,\" Burke said. \"The Navy has tried several times to replace the EP-3 over the years. Ultimately, in the 2012 time frame, it started to jell that the Triton could provide that capability.\" The baseline Triton was supposed to have a sense-and-avoid radar subsystem that would help prevent midair collisions with other aircraft. But the program encountered technical problems that led the Navy to order work stopped on the radar development in 2013. The effort has since resumed with Northrop Grumman as lead system developer, but the plan for introducing an SAA radar has moved to a planned IFC 5 upgrade in 2024. \"The technology continues to evolve,\" Burke said. \"There're two elements to it-one is the ability to execute IFC 4's development and deliver it [to the Navy]. We can only pack so much content, if you will, into IFC 4. The sense-and-avoid radar brings in a fairly high degree of test requirements to prove the capability that will then allow for safety and use certifications. When we looked at trying to pack all that into the IFC 4 timeline, it was too much complexity, too much content. \"At the same time, funding is always a concern area,\" he added. \"We want to make sure we deliver the multi-int capability on time connected with the EP-3 retirement.

The Australian Government announced today its plans to invest $1.4 billion and acquire the first six drones under the Project AIR 7000 Phase 1B. The Triton, based on the Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft is procured and will be operated through a cooperative program with the United States Navy that operates the same assets. As part of its investment, Australia will also allocate $200 million to the cooperative program with the U.S. Navy, for the development, production, and sustainment of the MQ-4C Triton. Australia also invests $364 million developing new facilities at the drone's home base at RAAF Edinburgh, and forward operating base, RAAF Tindal, as well the necessary ground control systems, support and training required to implement the project. The Triton will complement the surveillance role of the Boeing P-8A Poseidon manned maritime surveillance aircraft, that replace the P-3C Orion in this role. Performing sustained long ranges patrols over vast oceans, these assets will also be able to undertake Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance tasks. \"Together these aircraft will significantly enhance our anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, as well as our search and rescue capability,\" a joint statement by Prime Minister Turnbull, Defence Minister Senator Marise Payne and Defence Industry Christopher Pyne reads. Australia has already taken delivery of seven Poseidon aircraft under Project AIR 7000 Phase 2B and achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) earlier this year.

Dan Mackin said in a briefing at the Navy League's Sea Air Space 2018 exposition. Triton will reach an initial operational capability in 2021, and the Navy will add two additional aircraft to the Guam orbit. Under the current concept of operations for the platform, four airframes will make up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. \"One on the way out, one on station, one on the way back and one in maintenance,\" Mackin said. The first capability will combine a series of electro-optical sensors and radar to track maritime targets from as high as 60,000 feet over the ocean and compare tracks to automated identification systems on ships. A Triton will relay the information back to one of two main operating bases in the U.S. - Naval Station Mayport, Fla., and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Wash. - or to nearby P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine warfare aircraft. \"One of the main reasons that the Navy decided to fund Triton was to have that teaming arrangement, to be able to communicate back and forth between P-8s and the Triton aircraft. One of the primary missions of P-8 is to do the anti-submarine warfare and ISR, not necessarily things you want to do at the same time,\" Mackin said. \"You want to give the P-8 the ability to perform the anti-submarine warfare mission while trying to high-altitude ISR mission. One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" The Navy took delivery of the first operational Triton earlier this year, and that vehicle is currently being tested at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, Calif., ahead of the deployment to Guam, Mackin said. Part of the IOC process will include adding a top secret \"multi-intelligence\" function to Triton that will eventually replace the Navy's Lockheed Martin EP-3E Aries II manned signals intelligence platforms. Congress mandated the Navy retire the EP-3E Aries II only after it had found a way to field a similar capability. Eventually, the Triton program will consist of five four-aircraft orbits around the world. The operators will reside in the two main bases at Mayport and Whidbey Island. \"The system is made up of an aircraft and a main operating base where the warfighter starts taking that data over wideband SATCOM link you start assimilating that data, put that data together to understand the [maritime picture],\" Mackin said.

It has postponed adding a \"sense-and-avoid\" radar to the unmanned aircraft until an incremental upgrade planned in 2024. The program plans to complete testing an integrated functional capability (IFC) 3 configuration Triton by August, fulfilling the requirements of its Milestone B approval in 2008-the start of engineering and manufacturing development. Manufacturer Northrop Grumman has built three system development and demonstration models of the RQ-4B Global Hawk derivative, two of which the Navy owns, as well as a fatigue test article. Last September, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $255 million contract to produce three low-rate initial production Lot 1 Tritons. The manufacturer is currently building early operational capability aircraft B-5 and B-6 at its Palmdale, California facility. These will be sent to the Navy's Point Mugu test range later this year, with final delivery starting in mid-2018. Triton IFC 3 is the version that will enter service with the Navy next year; it comes equipped with the Northrop Grumman AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) maritime radar, Raytheon MTS-B electro-optical/infrared sensor turret, automatic identification system receiver and electronic support measures. \"IFC 3 equals baseline Triton,\" said Sean Burke, program manager for persistent maritime unmanned aircraft systems with the Naval Air Systems Command (Navair). \"The primary focus now for the program is completing the system development and demonstration contract and handing the system over to the fleet,\" he told reporters April 4 at the Navy League Sea-Air-Space conference. Once IFC 3 testing is completed, the program will deliver the aircraft to the Navy's VX-1 air test and evaluation squadron in September, Burke explained. The test squadron will conduct a two-month operational evaluation involving air crew and maintainers from Unmanned Patrol Squadron (VUP) 19 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, the Navy's first Triton squadron. VUP-19 will conduct its own safe-for-flight certification process before beginning operations with the aircraft next year. Recently, the program completed the preliminary design review phase of Triton IFC 4, a \"multi-int\" upgrade that includes SIGINT functionality. Congress specified in the 2011 national defense authorization act that the Navy produce a comparable system to replace the EP-3, a SIGINT-capable, multi-intelligence platform based on the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. Working with Navair's PMA-290 maritime surveillance program office, the Triton program is incorporating a SIGINT sensor payload with components from Boeing Argon ST and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Plans call for delivering the IFC 4 version in 2021 to coincide with the Navy's retirement of the EP-3. \"The Triton has always had a requirement to provide a SIGINT capability; that traces back to our original requirements document.

What will the drones add to the US military's arsenal in the Pacific? Prior to taking over the US Indo-Pacific Command on 30 May, four-star Admiral Philip Davidson appeared before a Senate committee. Referring to China's ongoing development of forward operating bases on manmade islands in the South China Sea, he made the following statement. \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the US.\" The military is not adverse to using hyperbole and scare tactics to squeeze a few extra dollars out of Congress, of course, but in this case there are real signs that power in the region is shifting to Beijing. Geopolitical analysts have long feared that the battle between the US and China for strategic military and economic supremacy in the South China Sea, as well as multiple disputes over territory and sovereignty - China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan all lay claim to the Spratly islands, for example - will escalate beyond political posturing and into direct military action. Recently, the situation has become ominous. In March, China sent a 40-ship flotilla, including its only native-built aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, to the South China Sea. The following month, reports came out that Beijing had installed electronic jamming equipment on two of its outposts in the Spratly islands. Despite President Xi Jinping's assurances in 2015 that he would never seek to militarise the islands, China now operates three 10,000ft runways there, in addition to aircraft hangars, bunkers, military housing and deep-water piers for ships. Military flashpoint: the strategic importance of the South China Sea: Located at the crux of where the Pacific and Indian Oceans meet, the South China Sea is one of the most hotly-contested geopolitical regions on Earth. A critical thoroughfare for the global economy, nearly a third of all maritime trade - worth a staggering $5.3tn last year - passes through it. Beijing has drawn a so-called 'nine-dash line' over the South China Sea, a territorial claim stretching 200 miles south and east from the province of Hainan, backed by island-building and naval patrols. The line would theoretically give China control over a zone that caters for almost 40% of the global trade in liquefied natural gas, one that is home to an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In October 2015, the US challenged Chinese hegemony by sailing a destroyer within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands, the first in a series of actions planned to assert freedom of navigation. The following July, in a case brought by the Philippines, an arbitral tribunal ruled China has no legal basis to claim \"historic rights\" within its nine-dash line, a decision rejected by Taiwan and Beijing. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference on 2 June, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis spoke out against China's strategy of \"intimidation and coercion\" in the region, including the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and, more recently, the landing of nuclear-capable bombers at Woody Island. \"What China is winning is de facto control of nearly the entire South China Sea, including all activities and resources in it, despite the other surrounding Southeast Asian states' respective legal rights and entitlements under international law,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, told Nikkei Asian Review. High and mighty: the MQ-4C Triton drone: In response, the US has decided to step up its \u00efntelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the region, beginning with the deployment of two $180m MQ-4C Triton drones. Built by Northrop Grumman and based on the RQ-4 Global Hawk platform used by the US Air Force, the high altitude, long-range MQ-4C Triton platform has a wingspan of 131ft, weighs 14,628kg, and is installed with 360\u00b0 electro-optical sensors capable of tracking maritime targets from 60,000ft. The MQ-4C Triton incorporates a reinforced airframe and wing, de-icing and lighting protection systems and sophisticated sensor suites, allowing the platform to track ships over vast distances. \"During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification,\" stated Mike Mackey, Northrop Grumman's Triton UAS programme director. \"The wing's strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.\" The Triton can fly more than 24 hours at a time and has an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles. The data collected by the two drones will be fed back to ground stations at Naval Station Mayport in Florida, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, or to P-8A Poseidon submarine hunters. \"One of the main reasons the Navy decided to fund Triton was to have that teaming arrangement, to be able to communicate back and forth between P-8s and the Triton aircraft,\" explained Mackey. \"You want to give the P-8 the ability to perform the anti-submarine warfare mission while tying to [the] high-altitude ISR mission. \"One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" Drone wars: are UAVs the answer in the Pacific? The first Triton squadron, Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19, will arrive at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam this summer. Once the drone reaches initial operational capability in 2021, the Navy plans to deploy a further two aircraft in Guam, with the four Titans making up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. The use of drones in theatre or for ISR has its fair share of critics, however. Military Watch magazine points out that US drones active in Syria and Crimea have recently proven vulnerable to jamming from Russian electronic warfare units and that it remains to be seen whether drones will be able to survive near Chinese military facilities and stay reliable in the event of open conflict. Such a scenario still seems unlikely. So far the US has restricted its response to Chinese operations in the South China Sea to 'freedom of navigation operations', the most recent on 27 May. This was followed by US military aircraft flying over the Paracel Islands in early June, a move that prompted a countercharge of \"militarisation'\" against the US by China's Foreign Ministry. At the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June, Mattis issued the following warning to Beijing. \"There are consequences that will continue to come home to roost, so to speak, with China, if they do not find the way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations.\"", "url": "https://www.army-technology.com/analysis/mq4c-triton-drones/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Navy: First Operational MQ-4C Tritons Will Deploy to Guam By Year's End", "date": "2018-04-10", "content": "The Navy's first two operational MQ-4C Triton high- altitude surveillance aircraft will start missions over the Pacific by the end of the year from a forward base in Guam, Naval Air Systems Command officials told reporters on Monday. The pair of 131-ft wingspan UAVs built by Northrop Grumman for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions will deploy with an early set of capabilities designed for maritime ISR and will grow to include a signals intelligence function in 2021, Triton program manager Capt. Dan Mackin said in a briefing at the Navy League's Sea Air Space 2018 exposition. Triton will reach an initial operational capability in 2021, and the Navy will add two additional aircraft to the Guam orbit. Under the current concept of operations for the platform, four airframes will make up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. \"One on the way out, one on station, one on the way back and one in maintenance,\" Mackin said. The first capability will combine a series of electro-optical sensors and radar to track maritime targets from as high as 60,000 feet over the ocean and compare tracks to automated identification systems on ships. A Triton will relay the information back to one of two main operating bases in the U.S. - Naval Station Mayport, Fla., and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Wash. - or to nearby P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine warfare aircraft. \"One of the main reasons that the Navy decided to fund Triton was to have that teaming arrangement, to be able to communicate back and forth between P-8s and the Triton aircraft. One of the primary missions of P-8 is to do the anti-submarine warfare and ISR, not necessarily things you want to do at the same time,\" Mackin said. \"You want to give the P-8 the ability to perform the anti-submarine warfare mission while trying to high-altitude ISR mission. One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" The Navy took delivery of the first operational Triton earlier this year, and that vehicle is currently being tested at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, Calif., ahead of the deployment to Guam, Mackin said. Part of the IOC process will include adding a top secret \"multi-intelligence\" function to Triton that will eventually replace the Navy's Lockheed Martin EP-3E Aries II manned signals intelligence platforms. Congress mandated the Navy retire the EP-3E Aries II only after it had found a way to field a similar capability. Eventually, the Triton program will consist of five four-aircraft orbits around the world. The operators will reside in the two main bases at Mayport and Whidbey Island. \"The system is made up of an aircraft and a main operating base where the warfighter starts taking that data over wideband SATCOM link you start assimilating that data, put that data together to understand the [maritime picture],\" Mackin said. The Navy will have five operating bases where the aircraft will be maintained, launched and recovered. The forward bases will be at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy; an unspecified location in the Middle East; Naval Air Station Guam; Mayport; and Point Mugu.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2018/04/10/navy-first-operational-mq-4c-tritons-will-deploy-guam-years-end"}, {"title": "U.S. Navy, Northrop Grumman Near Delivery of Baseline Triton", "date": "2018-04-11", "content": "The U.S. Navy's MQ-4C Triton program expects to deliver the first baseline configuration aircraft to the service later this year, with an upgraded version capable of collecting signals intelligence (SIGINT) due to follow in 2021 to succeed the Lockheed EP-3E Aries. It has postponed adding a \"sense-and-avoid\" radar to the unmanned aircraft until an incremental upgrade planned in 2024. The program plans to complete testing an integrated functional capability (IFC) 3 configuration Triton by August, fulfilling the requirements of its Milestone B approval in 2008-the start of engineering and manufacturing development. Manufacturer Northrop Grumman has built three system development and demonstration models of the RQ-4B Global Hawk derivative, two of which the Navy owns, as well as a fatigue test article. Last September, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $255 million contract to produce three low-rate initial production Lot 1 Tritons. The manufacturer is currently building early operational capability aircraft B-5 and B-6 at its Palmdale, California facility. These will be sent to the Navy's Point Mugu test range later this year, with final delivery starting in mid-2018. Triton IFC 3 is the version that will enter service with the Navy next year; it comes equipped with the Northrop Grumman AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function Active Sensor (MFAS) maritime radar, Raytheon MTS-B electro-optical/infrared sensor turret, automatic identification system receiver and electronic support measures. \"IFC 3 equals baseline Triton,\" said Sean Burke, program manager for persistent maritime unmanned aircraft systems with the Naval Air Systems Command (Navair). \"The primary focus now for the program is completing the system development and demonstration contract and handing the system over to the fleet,\" he told reporters April 4 at the Navy League Sea-Air-Space conference. Once IFC 3 testing is completed, the program will deliver the aircraft to the Navy's VX-1 air test and evaluation squadron in September, Burke explained. The test squadron will conduct a two-month operational evaluation involving air crew and maintainers from Unmanned Patrol Squadron (VUP) 19 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, the Navy's first Triton squadron. VUP-19 will conduct its own safe-for-flight certification process before beginning operations with the aircraft next year. Recently, the program completed the preliminary design review phase of Triton IFC 4, a \"multi-int\" upgrade that includes SIGINT functionality. Congress specified in the 2011 national defense authorization act that the Navy produce a comparable system to replace the EP-3, a SIGINT-capable, multi-intelligence platform based on the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. Working with Navair's PMA-290 maritime surveillance program office, the Triton program is incorporating a SIGINT sensor payload with components from Boeing Argon ST and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Plans call for delivering the IFC 4 version in 2021 to coincide with the Navy's retirement of the EP-3. \"The Triton has always had a requirement to provide a SIGINT capability; that traces back to our original requirements document. But it was not a defined capability,\" Burke said. \"The Navy has tried several times to replace the EP-3 over the years. Ultimately, in the 2012 time frame, it started to jell that the Triton could provide that capability.\" The baseline Triton was supposed to have a sense-and-avoid radar subsystem that would help prevent midair collisions with other aircraft. But the program encountered technical problems that led the Navy to order work stopped on the radar development in 2013. The effort has since resumed with Northrop Grumman as lead system developer, but the plan for introducing an SAA radar has moved to a planned IFC 5 upgrade in 2024. \"The technology continues to evolve,\" Burke said. \"There're two elements to it-one is the ability to execute IFC 4's development and deliver it [to the Navy]. We can only pack so much content, if you will, into IFC 4. The sense-and-avoid radar brings in a fairly high degree of test requirements to prove the capability that will then allow for safety and use certifications. When we looked at trying to pack all that into the IFC 4 timeline, it was too much complexity, too much content. \"At the same time, funding is always a concern area,\" he added. \"We want to make sure we deliver the multi-int capability on time connected with the EP-3 retirement. If we try to put the sense-and-avoid radar in there as well, that pushes out that timeline and that's not acceptable.\"", "url": "https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-04-11/us-navy-northrop-grumman-near-delivery-baseline-triton"}, {"title": "Navy marks Triton arrival at Point Mugu", "date": "2018-06-03", "content": "Two of the Navy's large unmanned surveillance and patrol aircraft are now housed at a repurposed hangar at Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu in Southern California.

The Triton, based on the Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft is procured and will be operated through a cooperative program with the United States Navy that operates the same assets. As part of its investment, Australia will also allocate $200 million to the cooperative program with the U.S. Navy, for the development, production, and sustainment of the MQ-4C Triton. Australia also invests $364 million developing new facilities at the drone's home base at RAAF Edinburgh, and forward operating base, RAAF Tindal, as well the necessary ground control systems, support and training required to implement the project. The Triton will complement the surveillance role of the Boeing P-8A Poseidon manned maritime surveillance aircraft, that replace the P-3C Orion in this role. Performing sustained long ranges patrols over vast oceans, these assets will also be able to undertake Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance tasks. \"Together these aircraft will significantly enhance our anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, as well as our search and rescue capability,\" a joint statement by Prime Minister Turnbull, Defence Minister Senator Marise Payne and Defence Industry Christopher Pyne reads. Australia has already taken delivery of seven Poseidon aircraft under Project AIR 7000 Phase 2B and achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) earlier this year. The full fleet of 12 Poseidon aircraft is expected to be delivered and in operation by 2022. The first of the Triton aircraft is expected to be introduced into service in mid-2023 with all six aircraft planned to be delivered and in operation by late 2025, based at RAAF Base, Edinburgh in South Australia. From these bases, a single Triton mission can cover well up into the South China Sea or most of Australia's Antarctic coastal area of interest in a single mission.

The U.S. Navy's MQ-4C \"Triton\" Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) is an ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance) platform that will complement the P-8A Poseidon within the Navy's Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force family of systems: for instance, testing has already proved the MQ-4C's ability to pass FMV (Full Motion Video) to a Poseidon MPA (Maritime Patrol Aircraft).

What will the drones add to the US military's arsenal in the Pacific? Prior to taking over the US Indo-Pacific Command on 30 May, four-star Admiral Philip Davidson appeared before a Senate committee. Referring to China's ongoing development of forward operating bases on manmade islands in the South China Sea, he made the following statement. \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the US.\" The military is not adverse to using hyperbole and scare tactics to squeeze a few extra dollars out of Congress, of course, but in this case there are real signs that power in the region is shifting to Beijing. Geopolitical analysts have long feared that the battle between the US and China for strategic military and economic supremacy in the South China Sea, as well as multiple disputes over territory and sovereignty - China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan all lay claim to the Spratly islands, for example - will escalate beyond political posturing and into direct military action. Recently, the situation has become ominous. In March, China sent a 40-ship flotilla, including its only native-built aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, to the South China Sea. The following month, reports came out that Beijing had installed electronic jamming equipment on two of its outposts in the Spratly islands. Despite President Xi Jinping's assurances in 2015 that he would never seek to militarise the islands, China now operates three 10,000ft runways there, in addition to aircraft hangars, bunkers, military housing and deep-water piers for ships. Military flashpoint: the strategic importance of the South China Sea: Located at the crux of where the Pacific and Indian Oceans meet, the South China Sea is one of the most hotly-contested geopolitical regions on Earth. A critical thoroughfare for the global economy, nearly a third of all maritime trade - worth a staggering $5.3tn last year - passes through it. Beijing has drawn a so-called 'nine-dash line' over the South China Sea, a territorial claim stretching 200 miles south and east from the province of Hainan, backed by island-building and naval patrols. The line would theoretically give China control over a zone that caters for almost 40% of the global trade in liquefied natural gas, one that is home to an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In October 2015, the US challenged Chinese hegemony by sailing a destroyer within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands, the first in a series of actions planned to assert freedom of navigation. The following July, in a case brought by the Philippines, an arbitral tribunal ruled China has no legal basis to claim \"historic rights\" within its nine-dash line, a decision rejected by Taiwan and Beijing. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference on 2 June, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis spoke out against China's strategy of \"intimidation and coercion\" in the region, including the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and, more recently, the landing of nuclear-capable bombers at Woody Island. \"What China is winning is de facto control of nearly the entire South China Sea, including all activities and resources in it, despite the other surrounding Southeast Asian states' respective legal rights and entitlements under international law,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, told Nikkei Asian Review. High and mighty: the MQ-4C Triton drone: In response, the US has decided to step up its \u00efntelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the region, beginning with the deployment of two $180m MQ-4C Triton drones. Built by Northrop Grumman and based on the RQ-4 Global Hawk platform used by the US Air Force, the high altitude, long-range MQ-4C Triton platform has a wingspan of 131ft, weighs 14,628kg, and is installed with 360\u00b0 electro-optical sensors capable of tracking maritime targets from 60,000ft. The MQ-4C Triton incorporates a reinforced airframe and wing, de-icing and lighting protection systems and sophisticated sensor suites, allowing the platform to track ships over vast distances. \"During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification,\" stated Mike Mackey, Northrop Grumman's Triton UAS programme director. \"The wing's strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.\" The Triton can fly more than 24 hours at a time and has an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles. The data collected by the two drones will be fed back to ground stations at Naval Station Mayport in Florida, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, or to P-8A Poseidon submarine hunters. \"One of the main reasons the Navy decided to fund Triton was to have that teaming arrangement, to be able to communicate back and forth between P-8s and the Triton aircraft,\" explained Mackey. \"You want to give the P-8 the ability to perform the anti-submarine warfare mission while tying to [the] high-altitude ISR mission. \"One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" Drone wars: are UAVs the answer in the Pacific? The first Triton squadron, Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19, will arrive at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam this summer. Once the drone reaches initial operational capability in 2021, the Navy plans to deploy a further two aircraft in Guam, with the four Titans making up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. The use of drones in theatre or for ISR has its fair share of critics, however. Military Watch magazine points out that US drones active in Syria and Crimea have recently proven vulnerable to jamming from Russian electronic warfare units and that it remains to be seen whether drones will be able to survive near Chinese military facilities and stay reliable in the event of open conflict. Such a scenario still seems unlikely. So far the US has restricted its response to Chinese operations in the South China Sea to 'freedom of navigation operations', the most recent on 27 May. This was followed by US military aircraft flying over the Paracel Islands in early June, a move that prompted a countercharge of \"militarisation'\" against the US by China's Foreign Ministry. At the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June, Mattis issued the following warning to Beijing. \"There are consequences that will continue to come home to roost, so to speak, with China, if they do not find the way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations.\"", "url": "https://www.army-technology.com/analysis/mq4c-triton-drones/"}, {"title": "MQ-4C Triton Crashes In California", "date": "2018-09-13", "content": "One of two MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft systems crashed yesterday on a Naval Base Ventura County, Calif., base runway following an inflight mechanical issue and landing gear failure.

Both Triton and Poseidon are expected to assist Australia in improving its anti-submarine warfare, maritime strike, and search and rescue capabilities as part of the initiative. The $1.4bn investment will see the Government of Australia enter a $200m cooperative programme with the US Navy for the development, manufacture and sustainment of the MQ-4C RPAs. The project will support the country's commitment to developing advanced capabilities and conducting joint military operations. In addition, the government will invest $364m on new facilities at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh and RAAF Base Tindal, in addition to delivering necessary ground control systems and providing the required support and training services. The project is expected to generate approximately 70 jobs across South Australia and the Northern Territory. The first MQ-4C Triton UAS will be operated by RAAF and is currently scheduled to be launched in mid-2023. All six of the aircraft will be based at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. They are planned to be operational by late-2025. The Triton RPA is based on the legacy Global Hawk UAS. It is integrated with a reinforced airframe for increased internal payload, as well as highly durable wings for improved hail, bird strike and gust load protection. The Triton UAS units are also equipped with de-icing and lightning protection systems.", "url": "https://www.naval-technology.com/news/australia-to-buy-six-mq-4c-triton-uas-from-us-navy-for-1-4bn/"}, {"title": "VUP-19 DET PM MQ-4C \"Triton\" Drone Performs First Flight From NBVC Point Mugu", "date": "2018-06-28", "content": "U.S. Navy's MQ-4C \"Triton\" belonging to the Unmanned Patrol Squadron One Nine (VUP-19) DET Point Mugu conducted first flight from Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Point Mugu. On Jun. 27, VUP-19 DET Point Mugu launched its first MQ-4C \"Triton\" UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) from Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Point Mugu. Based on the photographs released by the U.S. Navy, the drone that carried out the first sortie is MQ-4C #168461, one of the two Tritons assigned to the unit (the other being the example #168460 that, at the end of May, sported high-rez tail markings). The U.S. Navy's MQ-4C \"Triton\" Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) is an ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance) platform that will complement the P-8A Poseidon within the Navy's Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force family of systems: for instance, testing has already proved the MQ-4C's ability to pass FMV (Full Motion Video) to a Poseidon MPA (Maritime Patrol Aircraft). An advanced version than the first generation Global Hawk Block 10, the drone it is believed to be a sort of Block 20 and Block 30 Global Hawk hybrid, carrying Navy payload including an AN/ZPY-3 multi-function active-sensor (MFAS) radar system, that gives the Triton the ability to cover more than 2.7 million square miles in a single mission that can last as long as 24 hours at a time, at altitudes higher than 10 miles, with an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles.

What will the drones add to the US military's arsenal in the Pacific? Prior to taking over the US Indo-Pacific Command on 30 May, four-star Admiral Philip Davidson appeared before a Senate committee. Referring to China's ongoing development of forward operating bases on manmade islands in the South China Sea, he made the following statement. \"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the US.\" The military is not adverse to using hyperbole and scare tactics to squeeze a few extra dollars out of Congress, of course, but in this case there are real signs that power in the region is shifting to Beijing. Geopolitical analysts have long feared that the battle between the US and China for strategic military and economic supremacy in the South China Sea, as well as multiple disputes over territory and sovereignty - China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan all lay claim to the Spratly islands, for example - will escalate beyond political posturing and into direct military action. Recently, the situation has become ominous. In March, China sent a 40-ship flotilla, including its only native-built aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, to the South China Sea. The following month, reports came out that Beijing had installed electronic jamming equipment on two of its outposts in the Spratly islands. Despite President Xi Jinping's assurances in 2015 that he would never seek to militarise the islands, China now operates three 10,000ft runways there, in addition to aircraft hangars, bunkers, military housing and deep-water piers for ships. Military flashpoint: the strategic importance of the South China Sea: Located at the crux of where the Pacific and Indian Oceans meet, the South China Sea is one of the most hotly-contested geopolitical regions on Earth. A critical thoroughfare for the global economy, nearly a third of all maritime trade - worth a staggering $5.3tn last year - passes through it. Beijing has drawn a so-called 'nine-dash line' over the South China Sea, a territorial claim stretching 200 miles south and east from the province of Hainan, backed by island-building and naval patrols. The line would theoretically give China control over a zone that caters for almost 40% of the global trade in liquefied natural gas, one that is home to an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In October 2015, the US challenged Chinese hegemony by sailing a destroyer within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands, the first in a series of actions planned to assert freedom of navigation. The following July, in a case brought by the Philippines, an arbitral tribunal ruled China has no legal basis to claim \"historic rights\" within its nine-dash line, a decision rejected by Taiwan and Beijing. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference on 2 June, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis spoke out against China's strategy of \"intimidation and coercion\" in the region, including the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and, more recently, the landing of nuclear-capable bombers at Woody Island. \"What China is winning is de facto control of nearly the entire South China Sea, including all activities and resources in it, despite the other surrounding Southeast Asian states' respective legal rights and entitlements under international law,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, told Nikkei Asian Review. High and mighty: the MQ-4C Triton drone: In response, the US has decided to step up its \u00efntelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in the region, beginning with the deployment of two $180m MQ-4C Triton drones. Built by Northrop Grumman and based on the RQ-4 Global Hawk platform used by the US Air Force, the high altitude, long-range MQ-4C Triton platform has a wingspan of 131ft, weighs 14,628kg, and is installed with 360\u00b0 electro-optical sensors capable of tracking maritime targets from 60,000ft. The MQ-4C Triton incorporates a reinforced airframe and wing, de-icing and lighting protection systems and sophisticated sensor suites, allowing the platform to track ships over vast distances. \"During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification,\" stated Mike Mackey, Northrop Grumman's Triton UAS programme director. \"The wing's strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.\" The Triton can fly more than 24 hours at a time and has an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles. The data collected by the two drones will be fed back to ground stations at Naval Station Mayport in Florida, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, or to P-8A Poseidon submarine hunters. \"One of the main reasons the Navy decided to fund Triton was to have that teaming arrangement, to be able to communicate back and forth between P-8s and the Triton aircraft,\" explained Mackey. \"You want to give the P-8 the ability to perform the anti-submarine warfare mission while tying to [the] high-altitude ISR mission. \"One of the things we'll do is pass information back and forth between the two aircraft and the situational awareness of the fleet will be enhanced. Both aircraft have the ability to do chat, so both crews will be able to communicate back and forth.\" Drone wars: are UAVs the answer in the Pacific? The first Triton squadron, Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19, will arrive at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam this summer. Once the drone reaches initial operational capability in 2021, the Navy plans to deploy a further two aircraft in Guam, with the four Titans making up one 24-hour, seven-day orbit. The use of drones in theatre or for ISR has its fair share of critics, however. Military Watch magazine points out that US drones active in Syria and Crimea have recently proven vulnerable to jamming from Russian electronic warfare units and that it remains to be seen whether drones will be able to survive near Chinese military facilities and stay reliable in the event of open conflict. Such a scenario still seems unlikely. So far the US has restricted its response to Chinese operations in the South China Sea to 'freedom of navigation operations', the most recent on 27 May. This was followed by US military aircraft flying over the Paracel Islands in early June, a move that prompted a countercharge of \"militarisation'\" against the US by China's Foreign Ministry. At the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June, Mattis issued the following warning to Beijing. \"There are consequences that will continue to come home to roost, so to speak, with China, if they do not find the way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations.\"", "url": "https://www.army-technology.com/analysis/mq4c-triton-drones/"}, {"title": "MQ-4C Triton Crashes In California", "date": "2018-09-13", "content": "One of two MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft systems crashed yesterday on a Naval Base Ventura County, Calif., base runway following an inflight mechanical issue and landing gear failure.

The Navy is acquiring three MQ-4Cs annually from builder Northrop Grumman [NOC] and requested funding for three aircraft in FY 2019. Internationally, Germany won approval for a possible $2.5 billion deal to buy four of the aircraft in April (Defense Daily, April 5).

A Triton conducting operational testing out of Naval Base Ventura County in California on Wednesday \"had an issue during flight and the decision was made to bring it back to base. While heading in for landing, the engine was shut down but the landing gear did not extend. The aircraft landed on its belly on the runway. No one was hurt and there was no collateral damage,\" Cmdr. Dave Hecht, a spokesman for Naval Air Force Atlantic, told USNI News today. The incident is still under investigation, with the Navy still looking into the cause of the malfunctions and the cost estimate of the damage to the aircraft. Hecht did say that the cost was expected to be more than $2 million, marking this incident as a Class A aviation mishap. While the investigation goes on, VUP-19 - which has a dual-site command structure at both Naval Base Ventura County and Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla. - will cease flying for an indefinitely amount of time. VUP-19 stood up at NAS Jacksonville in October 2016 and was the first squadron in the Navy to consist solely of unmanned aircraft. The squadron falls under Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 11 and is collocated in Jacksonville with the wing's P-8A Poseidons, a manned airplane that also conducts maritime surveillance. The Tritons and Poseidons were identified as a natural pairing for manned/unmanned teaming and have already proven their ability to pass information from the unmanned plane to the operators aboard the manned P-8s. The Navy has said it would deploy its first operational Tritons to Guam by the end of this year, and the unmanned aircraft in California were conducting tests ahead of that deployment to Guam.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2018/09/14/navy-pauses-operations-mq-4c-triton-squadron-crash-landing-week"}, {"title": "U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton Drone Performs Gear Up Landing At Point Mugu", "date": "2018-09-14", "content": "The crash landing has caused some 2M USD damage to the UAVs (unmanned Aerial Vehicles).

The incident, which goes beyond recent attacks in the Middle East that the U.S. has blamed on Iran, is sure to trigger serious discussions within the Trump administration about how to respond to a direct attack on a U.S. military asset. A U.S. official said that the U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton was shot down by an Iranian surface to air missile while the reconnaissance drone was flying in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday. Earlier, Iranian state media had quoted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as saying it had downed a Global Hawk drone when it entered Iranian airspace near the Kouhmobarak district north of the Strait of Hormuz. The MQ-4C Triton is an unarmed surveillance aircraft powered by a jet engine, which is capable of operating at altitudes as high as 60,000 feet. The Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system (UAS) provides real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions. Based on the proven Global Hawk UAS, Triton's autonomous operations are supported by land-based command and control mission planners and sensor operators. The Triton is equipped with a unique and robust mission sensor suite that provides 360-degree coverage on all sensors, providing unprecedented maritime domain awareness for the U.S. Navy. Triton also incorporates a reinforced airframe, for increased internal payload, and wing for hail, bird strike, and gust load protection, along with de-icing and lightning protection systems. These features allow the aircraft to descend and ascend through harsh maritime weather environments to gain a closer view of ships and other targets at sea when needed.

The IRGC had declared in a statement earlier that the drone was from the RQ-4 Global Hawk variety. Triton is a slightly modified version of the Global Hawk and is made mostly from its components. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced later in the day that Iran had located parts of the drone in its territorial waters. Khordad 3 is a domestic Iranian design which was first unveiled in 2014. Equipped with a powerful phased array radar, the system can engage up to four targets at the same time and fire a total of eight missiles at them. The system has an operational range of between 50 and 75 kilometers and can intercept airborne targets as high as 25 to 30 kilometers. Iran has recently made major breakthroughs in its defense sector and attained self-sufficiency in producing military equipment and hardware despite facing sanctions and Western economic pressure.

While heading in for a landing, though, the engine was shut down but the landing gear did not extend, resulting in a belly landing. There were no injuries or collateral damage reported, but the damage to the Triton was estimated at more than $2 million, the threshold for a Class A flight mishap, according to the Navy.

Matt Rutherford, the commander of CTF-72, said in the statement. \"Coupling the capabilities of the MQ-4C with the proven performance of P-8, P-3 and EP-3 will enable improved maritime domain awareness in support of regional and national security objectives.\" The Navy had planned to deploy two Tritons to Guam by the end of 2018, Naval Air Systems Command announced in April 2018 at the Navy League's Sea Air Space 2018 exposition. However, in September 2018 a 131-foot wingspan Triton crashed in California while conducting operational testing out of Naval Base Ventura County. The Navy halted Triton operations while it investigated the crash. The investigation found that the Triton had an issue during flight operations and was told by operators to come back to the base. While heading in for a landing, though, the engine was shut down but the landing gear did not extend, resulting in a belly landing. There were no injuries or collateral damage reported, but the damage to the Triton was estimated at more than $2 million, the threshold for a Class A flight mishap, according to the Navy. The Navy and the aircraft manufacturer Northrop Grumman spent years testing and evaluating the Tritons before flying them to Guam. \"This significant milestone marks the culmination of years of hard work by the joint team to prepare Triton for overseas operations,\" Capt. Dan Mackin, the manager of NAVAIR's Persistent Maritime UAS program office, said in a statement. \"The fielding of the Navy's premier unmanned aircraft system and its additive, persistent, multi-sensor data collection and real-time dissemination capability will revolutionize the way maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is performed.\"", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2020/01/27/navys-first-mq-4c-triton-unmanned-aircraft-deploy-to-guam"}, {"title": "U.S. Navy's first MQ-4C Triton UAS Begins Initial Pacific deployment", "date": "2020-01-27", "content": "The U.S. Navy's first MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have arrived in Guam for their initial deployment in the Pacific theater.

Triton's ability to fly at high altitude and remain airborne in excess of 24 hours allows commanders to surveil a larger maritime area than ever before. Designed to operate in a manned-unmanned teaming concept, Triton provides an unblinking eye over massive swaths of ocean and littoral areas, enabling manned aircraft such as the U.S. Navy's P-8 Poseidon to focus on anti-surface and anti-sub-surface warfare.

The Naval Air Systems Command awarded Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. of San Diego a $15.1 million contract modification to a previously awarded, fixed-price incentive contract to provide \"additional labor and material to incorporate production engineering change proposals that modify MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system production assets to an Integrated Functional Capability 4.0 [IFC-4] multiple intelligence configuration for the Navy and the government of Australia,\" according to a June 14 Defense Department contract announcement. Another contract issued June 16 awarded the company $20.5 million to incorporate IFC-4 for MQ-4Cs construction numbers B13 through B15. The MQ-4C's IFC-4 is designed to bring an enhanced multi-mission sensor capability as part of the Navy's Maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting transition plan. The Triton in the IFC-4 configuration is designed to complement the Navy's P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and eventually will enable the Navy to retire its EP-3E Orion electronic reconnaissance aircraft. The initial operational capability for the Triton will be declared in 2023 when IFC-4-configured Tritons are deployed in enough quantity to field one complete orbit. The first production MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicle to be upgraded to the multi-intelligence configuration was delivered to the U.S. Navy at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, on Feb. 1. The Triton, designated B8 by the manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, went through a 30-month modification period to the new configuration. The two MQ-4Cs that were deployed to Guam for the U.S. 7th Fleet's Task Force 72 by Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 (VUP-19) as part of the early operational capability deployment were in the baseline IFC-3 configuration.
