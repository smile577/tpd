Why yes you did. Boeing announced this week that their first 787-9 could possibly have its maiden flight at Paine Field early next week. Yes AvGeeks, this is going to be a good week for all of us! While we know that the 787-9 could experience its first flight starting on Tuesday, that's all that is known right now. The flight could be pushed back later in the week due to a number of different factors. This might surprise some of you, but the weather in Seattle in mid-September can be a bit unpredictable and not always conducive to an aircraft's first flight. As of now, there is rain forecast for Tuesday, but I am more concerned about low visibility. As they have with other first flights, Boeing warns, \"as flight testing is dynamic by its very nature, the schedule for first flight is always subject to change due to weather conditions and other factors.\" For those of us who have spent quite a bit of time at Paine Field watching the new aircraft, we call this \"Boeing time.\" Obviously there are no passengers waiting for the plane and Boeing needs to make sure that everything is working properly, so often first flights will not always go as scheduled. If you are not going to be in the Seattle area during the first flight, have no worries. Boeing tells us that they will have a live webcast of the takeoff and landing. No matter what happens with the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner first flight, you better be sure we will be covering it.", "url": "https://www.airlinereporter.com/2013/09/first-flight-for-the-first-boeing-787-9-dreamliner-could-be-tuesday/"}, {"title": "Stretched 787-9 Dreamliner makes first flight as Boeing seeks to move forward", "date": "2013-09-17", "content": "Boeing has successfully test-flown the stretched version of its 787 Dreamliner as the planemaker tries to move forward from battery fires that culminated in worldwide grounding. The 787-9 jet landed at 4.18pm at Boeing Field in Seattle. It has room for 290 passengers, 40 more than the original 787-8 jetliner, and about 300 more nautical miles of range. Boeing hopes it will be more profitable to sell, and for its customers to operate, than the current production model. In its maiden voyage the 787-9 was scheduled to run detailed tests of its flight controls, part of a nine-month programme. The aircraft used for the tests would eventually be delivered to Air New Zealand in mid-2014, Boeing said. The jet flew at a speed of up to 366 knots and altitude of 20,000ft, according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com. The trip took it over Puget Sound and then the eastern part of Washington state. Boeing has unfilled orders for 936 Dreamliners, worth about US$217bn at list prices, or nearly eight years' worth of production at its target construction rate of 10 per month, which it aims to hit by the end of 2013. About 41% of the orders, or 388 planes, are for the 787-9. Boeing began selling an even longer version of the jet, the 787-10, in June, and has orders for 50 of them. The rest are for the 787-8. The 787 series has been dogged by problems - overheating and fires related to its next-generation lithium ion battery system caused several emergencies and led to grounding of the jets worldwide. After they were allowed back into the air, another of the planes was at the centre of drama when a fire broke out near its emergency beacon system, prompting American authorities to issue an airworthiness directive requiring checks on the electrical wiring. A day before the stretched Dreamliner flight, Bombardier successfully flew its CSeries jetliner, kicking off a renewed effort to sell the all-new narrow-body plane amid questions about its development cost. The plane brings the Canadian-based company into direct competition for the firist time with the smallest airliners of Boeing and Airbus. The CS100 test aircraft gently touched down in clear, chilly weather beside the Bombardier plant in Mirabel, Quebec, at 12.23pm on Monday. \"It flew very well,\" said Bombardier chief test pilot Chuck Ellis. \"It's a very, very nice airplane.\" At a press conference Bombardier said an alert had gone off for one of the subsystems during the flight, without providing details. The \"advisory message\" did not affect the plane and would not have required the pilot to land even if the plane had commercial passengers aboard, Ellis said. Montreal-based Bombardier, which also makes trains, is staking a claim in a niche: the single-aisle, 100- to 149-seat class that is midway between the size of so-called \"regional\" planes and the larger commercial jetliners of Boeing and Airbus. Bombardier says it can corner half of that market over the next 20 years. Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's number three planemaker, leads in sales of smaller, regional jets. CSeries sales are at 177 firm orders, far short of Bombardier's goal of 300 by the time the plane enters service in 2014. Critics say the Canadian design for the medium-haul jet made of lightweight composite materials ignores a trend towards larger aircraft seating 150 people or more as air traffic expands and carriers offer more seats. Bombardier says its plane will have a 15% cash operating cost advantage, 20% fuel consumption advantage and will be the world's quietest commercial aircraft. The new jet faces an ambitious 12-month deadline to enter commercial service, and tough sales competition from Boeing's Dreamliner as well as Airbus's A319neo and A320neo models, according to analysts. The first flight was delayed three times over the last nine months and the plane still faces considerable work in testing, certification and setting up production.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/18/stretched-787-9-dreamliner-first-flight"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Boeing 787-9 comes to Lubbock a second time", "date": "2014-04-27", "content": "A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner made its second appearance at the Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport on Sunday to continue testing.

The carrier will be first customer in the world to fly the \"dash-9\" model of the Dreamliner, a \"stretch\" version of the aircraft. The 787-9 will become the biggest model of the Dreamliner to go into commercial service for an airline when it begins flying for Air New Zealand this October on flights between Auckland, New Zealand, and the city of Perth on Australia's West Coast. The 787-9 version is 20 feet longer and can carry roughly 40 more passengers as compared to the current 787-8 model of the Dreamliner, according to Boeing. Air New Zealand has order 10 Dreamliners, and test flights of the carrier's first 787-9 began last week near Boeing's Dreamliner production line in Seattle. The aircraft has been painted in Air New Zealand's distinctive black livery, one that Luxon says he's particularly fond of. He says the special livery gives the carrier an opportunity to drum up attention for the South Pacific nation of about 4.5 million. \"We honestly feel we have a role to promote New Zealand and be great ambassadors for our country,\" Luxon says. \"Frankly not that many airlines in countries of 4 million people. So we take great pride with the way that aircraft looks because when it shows up in foreign ports, it's a great representation of New Zealand,\" Luxon adds. \"Our people ... are pretty pumped up and excited about the growth.\" The comments by Air New Zealand's top executive came Sunday ahead of the official start the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association trade group in Doha. Air New Zealand used the aviation summit as a backdrop to announce an order for 14 narrow-body Airbus jets. The deal is valued at $1.6 billion at list prices, though airlines receive significant discounts in such orders. In its order, Air New Zealand will take three A321neos, 10 A320 neos and a single current-generation A321.

The 787-9 is the newest and biggest version of Boeing's Dreamliner, a \"stretch\" variant of its original 787-8 model. United is the first airline in North American to fly both the original 787-8 and the newer 787-9 models of the Dreamliner. As for the 787-9, the LAX-Melbourne route marks United's first international deployment of the aircraft. Prior to the beginning of that route Sunday, United flew the 787-9 on domestic routes - mainly between its hubs - as it readied the aircraft for long-haul international service. United's 787-9s have 252 seats, including 48 lie-flat business-class seats, 88 Economy Plus seats and 116 in standard coach. At a distance of 7,920 miles, the Los Angeles-Melbourne route is the world's longest with regular Dreamliner service. In a statement, United says \"the 787-9's extended range - 8,550 miles compared with the 787-8's 8,200 - enables United to launch the Los Angeles-to-Melbourne service, which will be the longest Dreamliner route in the world to date.\" United does currently use the 787-8 on some of its flights between L.A. and Melbourne. However, though the 787-8 has the range to do so, United says it would frequently have to account for weight restrictions - flying with fewer passengers or cargo than it has capacity for - to make the journey on the westbound leg. That, United says, would have made it unlikely to add the route without a plan to shift all Melbourne-Los Angeles flights to the 787-9. More broadly, LAX-Melbourne is the 15th-longest regularly scheduled route departing from an airport in the U.S. or Canada. United now goes head-to- head with Qantas on the route. Another competitor, Virgin Australia, ended its nonstop service on the route Saturday, the day before United's route began. United's LAX-Melbourne route comes as the carrier launches three other Pacific routes. Also on Sunday, United began nonstop service between San Francisco and Tokyo's close-to-downtown Haneda Airport. That route compliments United's existing service between San Francisco and Tokyo Narita, the city's primary international airport. United also is adding two new routes from its Guam hub. Nonstop service to Seoul begins Monday while nonstop flights to Shanghai launch on Tuesday. \"These four new routes further strengthen United's presence in the Pacific, already the most extensive among U.S. airlines,\" Brian Znotins, United's VP of network, says in a statement. \"New nonstop service to Melbourne and Haneda from our powerhouse West Coast hubs, and the additional new flights from our Guam hub to both Seoul and Shanghai, offer our customers convenience and schedule options that no other airline can offer.\" ", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/10/27/united-now-flying-the-worlds-longest-dreamliner-route/18025651/"}, {"title": "Virgin Atlantic launches first Dreamliner route", "date": "2014-10-29", "content": "Virgin Atlantic launched its first Dreamliner route on Tuesday, flying its new 787-9 from London Heathrow to Boston and back. The carrier's Dreamliner made its debut on Virgin Atlantic Flight 11, which departed London Heathrow at 5:42 p.m. and landed at Boston Logan International at 8:48 p.m., all times local. The Dreamliner then returned to London on Virgin Atlantic Flight 12, which took off from Boston at 11:30 p.m. and touched down in London at 9:50 a.m. Wednesday morning, all times local. The flights marked Virgin Atlantic's first-ever Dreamliner flights with paying passengers. After debuting its first 787-9 on its Boston-London route, Virgin Atlantic also plans to put Dreamliners on routes to Washington Dulles, New York JFK and Newark Liberty in the coming months. All told, Virgin Atlantic has 21 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in order. Boeing's new-age long-haul jet will make up about half of Virgin Atlantic's fleet once the airline receives all the 787-9s it has on order. \"It is safe to call it a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic,\" Craig Kreeger, the carrier's CEO, told Today in the Sky on Friday onboard the aircraft in Atlanta. Virgin Atlantic has not yet announced plans to use the Dreamliner for its Atlanta service - the carrier began its first Atlanta flights on Sunday using Airbus A330s. But the airline flew its first Boeing 787 to the city on a special flight last week to show off the aircraft in the hometown of its new partner Delta, which purchased a 49% stake in the carrier in a deal that closed last year. As for Virgin Atlantic, Kreeger says the Dreamliner will be a key element for the carrier to return to profitability. Virgin Atlantic has lost money in four of the past five years, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Yet Kreeger said he expects that to change this year. \"There is a sort of a line-in-the-sand moment that this aircraft represents for us,\" Kreeger said, referring to the 787-9. \"It represents, in my mind, the transition from our recovery mode to the future. And this airplane is going to be such a big part of that transition over the next several years.\" Virgin Atlantic intends to use its fuel-efficient Dreamliners to replace its aging and fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340s, as well as some of its Boeing 747s, which also have four engines. \"As we go from having zero 787s to 21 ... the result of that is we go from having an average-aged fleet of fuel-inefficient airplanes to a really young fleet of great fuel-efficient and environmentally airplanes,\" Kreeger says. \"I think is very consistent, from a customer service standpoint of what we want to offer. And, from a cost standpoint, about what can make us successful.\" British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic three decades ago and remains the company's majority owner praised his airline's newest aircraft. \"They just got every single little detail right,\" Branson told Today in the Sky on Friday from inside the Dreamliner at the same event in Atlanta. It smells good, looks good.

The 787-9 is the newest and biggest version of Boeing's Dreamliner, a \"stretch\" variant of its original 787-8 model. United is the first airline in North American to fly both the original 787-8 and the newer 787-9 models of the Dreamliner. As for the 787-9, the LAX-Melbourne route marks United's first international deployment of the aircraft. Prior to the beginning of that route Sunday, United flew the 787-9 on domestic routes - mainly between its hubs - as it readied the aircraft for long-haul international service. United's 787-9s have 252 seats, including 48 lie-flat business-class seats, 88 Economy Plus seats and 116 in standard coach. At a distance of 7,920 miles, the Los Angeles-Melbourne route is the world's longest with regular Dreamliner service. In a statement, United says \"the 787-9's extended range - 8,550 miles compared with the 787-8's 8,200 - enables United to launch the Los Angeles-to-Melbourne service, which will be the longest Dreamliner route in the world to date.\" United does currently use the 787-8 on some of its flights between L.A. and Melbourne. However, though the 787-8 has the range to do so, United says it would frequently have to account for weight restrictions - flying with fewer passengers or cargo than it has capacity for - to make the journey on the westbound leg. That, United says, would have made it unlikely to add the route without a plan to shift all Melbourne-Los Angeles flights to the 787-9. More broadly, LAX-Melbourne is the 15th-longest regularly scheduled route departing from an airport in the U.S. or Canada. United now goes head-to- head with Qantas on the route. Another competitor, Virgin Australia, ended its nonstop service on the route Saturday, the day before United's route began. United's LAX-Melbourne route comes as the carrier launches three other Pacific routes. Also on Sunday, United began nonstop service between San Francisco and Tokyo's close-to-downtown Haneda Airport. That route compliments United's existing service between San Francisco and Tokyo Narita, the city's primary international airport. United also is adding two new routes from its Guam hub. Nonstop service to Seoul begins Monday while nonstop flights to Shanghai launch on Tuesday. \"These four new routes further strengthen United's presence in the Pacific, already the most extensive among U.S. airlines,\" Brian Znotins, United's VP of network, says in a statement. \"New nonstop service to Melbourne and Haneda from our powerhouse West Coast hubs, and the additional new flights from our Guam hub to both Seoul and Shanghai, offer our customers convenience and schedule options that no other airline can offer.\" ", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/10/27/united-now-flying-the-worlds-longest-dreamliner-route/18025651/"}, {"title": "Virgin Atlantic launches first Dreamliner route", "date": "2014-10-29", "content": "Virgin Atlantic launched its first Dreamliner route on Tuesday, flying its new 787-9 from London Heathrow to Boston and back. The carrier's Dreamliner made its debut on Virgin Atlantic Flight 11, which departed London Heathrow at 5:42 p.m. and landed at Boston Logan International at 8:48 p.m., all times local. The Dreamliner then returned to London on Virgin Atlantic Flight 12, which took off from Boston at 11:30 p.m. and touched down in London at 9:50 a.m. Wednesday morning, all times local. The flights marked Virgin Atlantic's first-ever Dreamliner flights with paying passengers. After debuting its first 787-9 on its Boston-London route, Virgin Atlantic also plans to put Dreamliners on routes to Washington Dulles, New York JFK and Newark Liberty in the coming months. All told, Virgin Atlantic has 21 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in order. Boeing's new-age long-haul jet will make up about half of Virgin Atlantic's fleet once the airline receives all the 787-9s it has on order. \"It is safe to call it a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic,\" Craig Kreeger, the carrier's CEO, told Today in the Sky on Friday onboard the aircraft in Atlanta. Virgin Atlantic has not yet announced plans to use the Dreamliner for its Atlanta service - the carrier began its first Atlanta flights on Sunday using Airbus A330s. But the airline flew its first Boeing 787 to the city on a special flight last week to show off the aircraft in the hometown of its new partner Delta, which purchased a 49% stake in the carrier in a deal that closed last year. As for Virgin Atlantic, Kreeger says the Dreamliner will be a key element for the carrier to return to profitability. Virgin Atlantic has lost money in four of the past five years, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Yet Kreeger said he expects that to change this year. \"There is a sort of a line-in-the-sand moment that this aircraft represents for us,\" Kreeger said, referring to the 787-9. \"It represents, in my mind, the transition from our recovery mode to the future. And this airplane is going to be such a big part of that transition over the next several years.\" Virgin Atlantic intends to use its fuel-efficient Dreamliners to replace its aging and fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340s, as well as some of its Boeing 747s, which also have four engines. \"As we go from having zero 787s to 21 ... the result of that is we go from having an average-aged fleet of fuel-inefficient airplanes to a really young fleet of great fuel-efficient and environmentally airplanes,\" Kreeger says. \"I think is very consistent, from a customer service standpoint of what we want to offer. And, from a cost standpoint, about what can make us successful.\" British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic three decades ago and remains the company's majority owner praised his airline's newest aircraft. \"They just got every single little detail right,\" Branson told Today in the Sky on Friday from inside the Dreamliner at the same event in Atlanta. It smells good, looks good.

With much pomp & circumstance, they took ownership of their \"All Blacks\" livery aircraft and flew it away back to New Zealand. Then, just before the end of July, the second 787-9 was delivered to All Nippon Airways (ANA) (JA830A), and it quietly slipped away into the night off to Japan. At the time, it was unknown who might commence 787-9 flights first. Air New Zealand, being the first to take delivery, did not plan to start their 787 on a new route until October when they would begin service from Auckland to Perth. The Kiwis had decided to operate flights back and forth between New Zealand & Australia to get their crew used to the aircraft (as this is their first 787) and although they were operating flights with crew onboard, there were a few with just friends and family. Despite that, it was ANA who would challenge the spot as first to operate the newest 787 model. ANA was the first airline to take delivery of the 787-8, and they originally put it to work on domestic flights within Japan. The airline is also now the largest operator of the 787, with a total of 30 in service; 29 of those are the smaller 787-8, which is split between a long-haul configuration and a higher density domestic configuration. The newest arrival to the fleet is set up in a domestic configuration as well, with a whopping 395 seats onboard. Meant to replace high-capacity 767s in Japan, the new aircraft will run back and forth between the Tokyo Haneda hub and other major Japanese cities like Osaka and Fukuoka. But could ANA get a 787-9 into service before Air New Zealand? You bet! Before they even took delivery, it was announced that the first real flight of the 787-9 in Japan with passengers would be a special charity flight on the 4th of August. The flight, scheduled to be a round trip to and from Tokyo Haneda, flew by Mt. Fuji and was full of school children from Japan and the United States. Just three days later, on August 7th in Japan, the aircraft started flying with-in the ANA network, replacing older aircraft. The first commercial flight of the 787-9 was NH241, departing Tokyo Haneda at 7:25 am local time, heading south towards Fukuoka. Replacing a 777-200 on this route, it turned around as NH248 and headed back to Tokyo to prep for its next flight. The plane would then fly NH25 & NH30 to and from Osaka's Itami Airport, and then the fifth and sixth flights of the day were a trip to Matsuyama. A total of six revenue flights were accomplished for the 787 in the first day. When this schedule was announced, Air New Zealand seemed to be scrambling to get their 787-9 into revenue service, but its first flight won't be until August 9th. It will commence on an Auckland to Sydney run, replacing a 767. Although the 787 was designed for very long and thin routes, the Japanese market is a very different beast compared to other places. Later deliveries of the 787-9 to ANA will come in an international configuration with 215 seats in a much more comfortable configuration. As NH241 took off into the sky, heralding a new beginning for Japanese aviation, we can only look forward to seeing more and more carriers take delivery of this new aircraft.", "url": "https://www.airlinereporter.com/2014/08/all-nippon-airways-begins-revenue-flights-with-the-boeing-787-9/"}, {"title": "United takes delivery of its first 787-9 Dreamliner", "date": "2014-09-04", "content": "United Airlines has taken delivery of its first 787-9 Dreamliner and will become the first airline in North America operating both the 787-8 and the 787-9 aircraft when the plane goes into service later this month.

United's 787-9s have 252 seats, including 48 lie-flat business-class seats, 88 Economy Plus seats and 116 in standard coach. At a distance of 7,920 miles, the Los Angeles-Melbourne route is the world's longest with regular Dreamliner service. In a statement, United says \"the 787-9's extended range - 8,550 miles compared with the 787-8's 8,200 - enables United to launch the Los Angeles-to-Melbourne service, which will be the longest Dreamliner route in the world to date.\" United does currently use the 787-8 on some of its flights between L.A. and Melbourne. However, though the 787-8 has the range to do so, United says it would frequently have to account for weight restrictions - flying with fewer passengers or cargo than it has capacity for - to make the journey on the westbound leg. That, United says, would have made it unlikely to add the route without a plan to shift all Melbourne-Los Angeles flights to the 787-9. More broadly, LAX-Melbourne is the 15th-longest regularly scheduled route departing from an airport in the U.S. or Canada. United now goes head-to- head with Qantas on the route. Another competitor, Virgin Australia, ended its nonstop service on the route Saturday, the day before United's route began. United's LAX-Melbourne route comes as the carrier launches three other Pacific routes. Also on Sunday, United began nonstop service between San Francisco and Tokyo's close-to-downtown Haneda Airport. That route compliments United's existing service between San Francisco and Tokyo Narita, the city's primary international airport. United also is adding two new routes from its Guam hub. Nonstop service to Seoul begins Monday while nonstop flights to Shanghai launch on Tuesday. \"These four new routes further strengthen United's presence in the Pacific, already the most extensive among U.S. airlines,\" Brian Znotins, United's VP of network, says in a statement. \"New nonstop service to Melbourne and Haneda from our powerhouse West Coast hubs, and the additional new flights from our Guam hub to both Seoul and Shanghai, offer our customers convenience and schedule options that no other airline can offer.\" ", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/10/27/united-now-flying-the-worlds-longest-dreamliner-route/18025651/"}, {"title": "Virgin Atlantic launches first Dreamliner route", "date": "2014-10-29", "content": "Virgin Atlantic launched its first Dreamliner route on Tuesday, flying its new 787-9 from London Heathrow to Boston and back. The carrier's Dreamliner made its debut on Virgin Atlantic Flight 11, which departed London Heathrow at 5:42 p.m. and landed at Boston Logan International at 8:48 p.m., all times local. The Dreamliner then returned to London on Virgin Atlantic Flight 12, which took off from Boston at 11:30 p.m. and touched down in London at 9:50 a.m. Wednesday morning, all times local. The flights marked Virgin Atlantic's first-ever Dreamliner flights with paying passengers. After debuting its first 787-9 on its Boston-London route, Virgin Atlantic also plans to put Dreamliners on routes to Washington Dulles, New York JFK and Newark Liberty in the coming months. All told, Virgin Atlantic has 21 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in order. Boeing's new-age long-haul jet will make up about half of Virgin Atlantic's fleet once the airline receives all the 787-9s it has on order. \"It is safe to call it a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic,\" Craig Kreeger, the carrier's CEO, told Today in the Sky on Friday onboard the aircraft in Atlanta. Virgin Atlantic has not yet announced plans to use the Dreamliner for its Atlanta service - the carrier began its first Atlanta flights on Sunday using Airbus A330s. But the airline flew its first Boeing 787 to the city on a special flight last week to show off the aircraft in the hometown of its new partner Delta, which purchased a 49% stake in the carrier in a deal that closed last year. As for Virgin Atlantic, Kreeger says the Dreamliner will be a key element for the carrier to return to profitability. Virgin Atlantic has lost money in four of the past five years, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Yet Kreeger said he expects that to change this year. \"There is a sort of a line-in-the-sand moment that this aircraft represents for us,\" Kreeger said, referring to the 787-9. \"It represents, in my mind, the transition from our recovery mode to the future. And this airplane is going to be such a big part of that transition over the next several years.\" Virgin Atlantic intends to use its fuel-efficient Dreamliners to replace its aging and fuel-guzzling four-engine Airbus A340s, as well as some of its Boeing 747s, which also have four engines. \"As we go from having zero 787s to 21 ... the result of that is we go from having an average-aged fleet of fuel-inefficient airplanes to a really young fleet of great fuel-efficient and environmentally airplanes,\" Kreeger says. \"I think is very consistent, from a customer service standpoint of what we want to offer. And, from a cost standpoint, about what can make us successful.\" British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic three decades ago and remains the company's majority owner praised his airline's newest aircraft. \"They just got every single little detail right,\" Branson told Today in the Sky on Friday from inside the Dreamliner at the same event in Atlanta.

In other words, consider this piece an easy-to-read primer breakdown for laypersons to understand how a commercial aircraft takes off like a rocket! In anticipation of the 2015 Paris Air Show, this brief primer is \"jet propulsion and rocket science for laypersons!\" Boeing says the above company video \"spotlights technical maneuvers that showcase some of the airplane's many capabilities.\" In all fairness to the Boeing-Airbus global commercial aircraft manufacturing competition, Friday's near vertical takeoff performance of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is not the first one by a large commercial airliner of this jumbo size class. The video below is an equally remarkable \"S-vertical\" takeoff performance of an Airbus A380 at the 2013 Paris Air Show. Two French Navy pilots teamed up with Airbus to display a stunning near vertical takeoff and near vertical flight maneuver at the 2013 Paris Air Show on empty fuel tanks and extremely light weight, mainly because the Airbus A380 had previously performed a short maneuver presentation nearby at the Le Bourget Exhibition Centre outside of Paris. CNN prompted Boeing to \"share specifics about the takeoff and banking angles during the flight.\" A company spokeswoman told CNN \"we unfortunately aren't sharing specifics about the profile such as bank angles at this time.\" \"Some of what you're seeing on takeoff is a trick of perspective,\" said Boeing 767 pilot Patrick Smith, who blogs on aviation at AskthePilot.com. \"It looks like the takeoff is at a near vertical 90 degree angle - trust me it's not.\" \"A 20 degree pitch-up on takeoff is pretty strong,\" said Smith, describing what passengers inside the cabin may feel during takeoff. What a competitively strategic \"marketing bonanza move\" for the American airplane manufacturer to enhance the Boeing 787 Dreamliner brand after its dubious market launch a few years back. That news is ancient history now after Friday's remarkable takeoff of the Boeing 787-9, spiraling up as a viral technological phenomenon across social media. As of May 2015, 509 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft have been ordered by 30 airlines around the world. Smith further comments on the video: \"If they're pushing the envelope and having fun, they might be going a bit past what the command bars are showing, but just temporarily - again, it's the Paris Air Show!\" Friday's trial run of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, undergoing a near \"S-vertical takeoff\" to be performed at the 2015 Paris Air Show, further highlights the company's technologically innovative capabilities in aviation safety and critical flight performance. Remarkably displayed are critical flight maneuvers at subsonic flight envelop extremes akin to a \"military fighter.\" Most of all, what is displayed is a more extraordinary extreme takeoff requirement of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner performing nearly as a \"vertical rocket\" propulsive system. It is this latter extraordinary extreme, where it appears the jet is heading straight up, like a rocket, that we wish to discuss in the next section, the simple scientific and technological anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner near vertical takeoff for the benefit of laypersons looking at the stunning pictures. Anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 \"S-Vertical\" Takeoff. \"Presumably the plane was very light because it wasn't carrying any passengers, probably had a very light fuel load, no freight, so it would have been able to perform a steeper than normal ascent - but not to the extent the video seems to show,\" Boeing 767 pilot Patrick Smith said. \"But for demonstration purposes, under lightweight conditions, it's perfectly natural for this airplane to do that. It's nothing dangerous.\" A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner without its payload and fuel weighs about 117,617 kilograms equal to about 29 elephants. The maximum payload takeoff weight is designed for 227,930 kilograms. The airliner's wing span is 197 feet, the aircraft's length is 186 feet, and the air vehicle's height is 56 feet. The commercial airliner is designed to fly subsonically at Mach 0.85, that is, about 650 miles per hour. Forward thrust of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner at horizontally level flight is \"rearward ejection of air flow\" through a high-intake engine mounted on the wings with the condition that the air flow in the engine exhaust jet originates from the airliner's forward flight design speed. Essentially, the two air-breathing turbofan propulsion systems of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, operating at level flight, are fundamentally converging- diverging flow stream nozzles with a sonic plenum of combustible heat input in the middle, wherein fuel-air mixture propellant is burned. The exhaust jet is a characteristic velocity dependent on how well the flow stream through the engine device is designed. As the Vietnam Airlines crew kept close tabs on the climb rate, airliner vehicle speed, and \"glass cockpit\" command bars, the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff momentarily shifts the Boeing 787-9 in an aggressive flight takeoff performance mode akin to a rocket propulsive system. Fluidic momentum suggests the near vertical thrust needed to achieve the rapid climb equals a large air intake mass flow through the engines multiplied by an even larger engines' exhaust jet velocity, due to the high vehicle speed of the Boeing 787-9 vertically upward, as seen on the company video. Hence, the near vertical thrust readings on the \"glass cockpit\" command bar of the Boeing 787-9 airliner is essentially a non-dimensional ratio of two characteristic velocities - one, which is an exhaust jet dependent on how well the engine flow stream is designed, over another, which is a characteristic velocity about 40 percent higher than the speed of sound inside the combustion chambers of the engines. This near vertical thrust is one measure of performance of the Boeing 787-9 near \"S-vertical\" takeoff, as seen on the company video. Another consideration is how effectively or usefully do the engines burn fuel. This requires next-generation engines, having a sufficiently large overall pressure ratio, so as to have sonic flow at the throat of the engine flow stream design. It is useful here to consider three additional figures of merit - fuel burn, specific impulse, and engine thermal efficiency - in terms of various Boeing 787-9 vehicle parameters from the perspectives of the Boeing aircraft design and the General Electric GEnx-1B and/or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine designs adopted. Both of these adopted engines \"represent nearly a two-generation jump in propulsion technology used on the Boeing 767,\" whereby the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than any other airplane of its size, according to Boeing. Back in 2002, Boeing foresaw increased market demand for its Boeing 767 class twin-aisle airplane flying over significantly larger range. The company believed the airline industry was evolving from a \"hub-and-spoke\" to a \"point- to-point\" lower-fuel cost operational model. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an outgrowth of the challenge to meet this airline industry demand for making significant advances in overall airplane design requiring greater advances in propulsion system innovation. Boeing Commercial Airplane alongside General Electric and Rolls-Royce aircraft engine manufacturers approached this challenge by \"improving fuel burn of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner engines in three traditional performance areas,\" according to the aircraft manufacturer: Higher propulsive efficiency through increased bypass ratio. Higher engine thermal efficiency through increased overall pressure ratio and improved component efficiencies, exclusively involves the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. Improved thrust-to-weight ratio through the application of advanced materials, brings together the Boeing structural engineer and Boeing aeronautical engineer with the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. According to Boeing, the following facts are the conditions for the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's near vertical takeoff using either General Electric GEnx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines: Bypass ratio = 10; Fan diameter = 111-112 inches; Overall pressure ratio = 50; Thrust = 53,000-74,000 pound-feet; Specific fuel consumption = 15% lower than the Boeing 767 class engines. To achieve the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff mode, the propulsion engines must generate momentarily an enormous amount of near vertical thrust. The amount of fuel needed to produce such thrust must momentarily balance the weight of the Boeing 787-9 airliner. Hence, General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineers must consider a figure of merit, called specific fuel consumption, to characterize the engine's fuel efficiency. Specific fuel consumption measures \"how much fuel the engine burns each hour,\" normalized by mass or weight, or in this case, \"per pound of thrust.\" In other words, specific fuel consumption is the mass of fuel burned by the Boeing 787-9 engines in one hour divided by the thrust that the engine produces. Putting it another way, by definition, specific fuel consumption is a ratio of the engine fuel mass flow rate to the amount of thrust produced during fuel burn. When we normalize this ratio by the engine air mass flow rate, we obtain another form of specific fuel consumption in terms of a ratio defining the fuel-to-air mix to the specific thrust. The units of specific fuel consumption are mass per unit time divided by thrust force. Research experts and officials at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, working from the standpoint of producing clean efficient turbofan engines, consider figure of merit tradeoffs between specific fuel consumption versus nitrogen oxide emissions. The key source of NOx emissions is the combustion of fuels inside the burner chamber of the aircraft engine device. This brings into consideration the multidisciplinary science of aero-environmental propulsion engineering. However, we can also define another figure of merit, called the specific impulse, as directly related to the overall efficiency of the engines of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in performing the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff. The specific impulse in performing this takeoff is a ratio of the near vertical thrust divided by the temporal rate of change of the Boeing 787-9 weight. Naturally, of course, we do also have equilibrated lift-to-drag force ratios of the wings, tail section, and fuselage. However, such resultant equilibrated lift-to-drag forces are momentarily vectorially-directed at sharply inclined angles relative to the Boeing 787-9 airliner's center of mass, as the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff flight maneuver of the airliner is being performed. The overall efficiency may be approximated as a product of the propulsive efficiency and the thermal efficiency.", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anatomy-boeing-787-dreamliner-vertical-takeoff-oliver"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Boeing delivers first South Carolina-built 787-9 Dreamliner", "date": "2015-03-17", "content": "Boeing has delivered the first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner assembled at its South Carolina production line in North Charleston, the company revealed Tuesday. \"In 2012, we delivered our first South Carolina-built 787-8, and less than three years later, we're celebrating another significant milestone - our first 787-9 delivery,\" Beverly Wyse, VP and general manager -- Boeing South Carolina, says in a statement. \"This is an incredible achievement for Boeing, and I'm proud to be a member of the Boeing South Carolina team.\" The aircraft also represented another milestone for Boeing, becoming the 250th Dreamliner overall that the company has delivered since the aircraft's debut.

According to Boeing, the following facts are the conditions for the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's near vertical takeoff using either General Electric GEnx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines: Bypass ratio = 10; Fan diameter = 111-112 inches; Overall pressure ratio = 50; Thrust = 53,000-74,000 pound-feet; Specific fuel consumption = 15% lower than the Boeing 767 class engines. To achieve the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff mode, the propulsion engines must generate momentarily an enormous amount of near vertical thrust. The amount of fuel needed to produce such thrust must momentarily balance the weight of the Boeing 787-9 airliner. Hence, General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineers must consider a figure of merit, called specific fuel consumption, to characterize the engine's fuel efficiency. Specific fuel consumption measures \"how much fuel the engine burns each hour,\" normalized by mass or weight, or in this case, \"per pound of thrust.\" In other words, specific fuel consumption is the mass of fuel burned by the Boeing 787-9 engines in one hour divided by the thrust that the engine produces. Putting it another way, by definition, specific fuel consumption is a ratio of the engine fuel mass flow rate to the amount of thrust produced during fuel burn. When we normalize this ratio by the engine air mass flow rate, we obtain another form of specific fuel consumption in terms of a ratio defining the fuel-to-air mix to the specific thrust. The units of specific fuel consumption are mass per unit time divided by thrust force. Research experts and officials at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, working from the standpoint of producing clean efficient turbofan engines, consider figure of merit tradeoffs between specific fuel consumption versus nitrogen oxide emissions. The key source of NOx emissions is the combustion of fuels inside the burner chamber of the aircraft engine device. This brings into consideration the multidisciplinary science of aero-environmental propulsion engineering. However, we can also define another figure of merit, called the specific impulse, as directly related to the overall efficiency of the engines of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in performing the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff. The specific impulse in performing this takeoff is a ratio of the near vertical thrust divided by the temporal rate of change of the Boeing 787-9 weight. Naturally, of course, we do also have equilibrated lift-to-drag force ratios of the wings, tail section, and fuselage. However, such resultant equilibrated lift-to-drag forces are momentarily vectorially-directed at sharply inclined angles relative to the Boeing 787-9 airliner's center of mass, as the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff flight maneuver of the airliner is being performed. The overall efficiency may be approximated as a product of the propulsive efficiency and the thermal efficiency.", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anatomy-boeing-787-dreamliner-vertical-takeoff-oliver"}, {"title": "KLM gives sneak-peek of its Boeing 787 'Dreamliner'", "date": "2015-07-24", "content": "Dutch carrier KLM isn't scheduled to get its first Boeing 787 \"Dreamliner\" until this fall, but the carrier teased the arrival of its new jet on Friday by releasing several images of the aircraft decked out in its signature color scheme.

The most stunning stunt is a near-vertical takeoff featuring the jet cruising along the runway and then climbing into the sky at a startling angle.

A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner performed a near \"S-vertical\" takeoff, on Friday, June 12, 2015, as Boeing and Vietnam Airlines crew teamed up to put the airliner through its paces over Moses Lake, Washington. This test run was completed in preparation for its performance at the 51st International Paris Air Show, held June 15-21, 2015 at Le Bourget Exhibition Centre a few kilometers from Paris. Spectacular pictures and Boeing video released Friday exhibit the groundbreaking Boeing 787-9 airliner's state-of-the-art digital \"glass cockpit\" aviation, navigation, and communication systems, alongside its \"rocket science\" maneuvers. It appears the jet is heading straight up, like a rocket, so we aim to discuss in this article, the scientific and technological anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, as it performs a near vertical takeoff for the benefit of laypersons watching this stunning video below. In other words, consider this piece an easy-to-read primer breakdown for laypersons to understand how a commercial aircraft takes off like a rocket! In anticipation of the 2015 Paris Air Show, this brief primer is \"jet propulsion and rocket science for laypersons!\" Boeing says the above company video \"spotlights technical maneuvers that showcase some of the airplane's many capabilities.\" In all fairness to the Boeing-Airbus global commercial aircraft manufacturing competition, Friday's near vertical takeoff performance of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is not the first one by a large commercial airliner of this jumbo size class. The video below is an equally remarkable \"S-vertical\" takeoff performance of an Airbus A380 at the 2013 Paris Air Show. Two French Navy pilots teamed up with Airbus to display a stunning near vertical takeoff and near vertical flight maneuver at the 2013 Paris Air Show on empty fuel tanks and extremely light weight, mainly because the Airbus A380 had previously performed a short maneuver presentation nearby at the Le Bourget Exhibition Centre outside of Paris. CNN prompted Boeing to \"share specifics about the takeoff and banking angles during the flight.\" A company spokeswoman told CNN \"we unfortunately aren't sharing specifics about the profile such as bank angles at this time.\" \"Some of what you're seeing on takeoff is a trick of perspective,\" said Boeing 767 pilot Patrick Smith, who blogs on aviation at AskthePilot.com. \"It looks like the takeoff is at a near vertical 90 degree angle - trust me it's not.\" \"A 20 degree pitch-up on takeoff is pretty strong,\" said Smith, describing what passengers inside the cabin may feel during takeoff. What a competitively strategic \"marketing bonanza move\" for the American airplane manufacturer to enhance the Boeing 787 Dreamliner brand after its dubious market launch a few years back. That news is ancient history now after Friday's remarkable takeoff of the Boeing 787-9, spiraling up as a viral technological phenomenon across social media. As of May 2015, 509 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft have been ordered by 30 airlines around the world. Smith further comments on the video: \"If they're pushing the envelope and having fun, they might be going a bit past what the command bars are showing, but just temporarily - again, it's the Paris Air Show!\" Friday's trial run of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, undergoing a near \"S-vertical takeoff\" to be performed at the 2015 Paris Air Show, further highlights the company's technologically innovative capabilities in aviation safety and critical flight performance. Remarkably displayed are critical flight maneuvers at subsonic flight envelop extremes akin to a \"military fighter.\" Most of all, what is displayed is a more extraordinary extreme takeoff requirement of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner performing nearly as a \"vertical rocket\" propulsive system. It is this latter extraordinary extreme, where it appears the jet is heading straight up, like a rocket, that we wish to discuss in the next section, the simple scientific and technological anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner near vertical takeoff for the benefit of laypersons looking at the stunning pictures. Anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 \"S-Vertical\" Takeoff. \"Presumably the plane was very light because it wasn't carrying any passengers, probably had a very light fuel load, no freight, so it would have been able to perform a steeper than normal ascent - but not to the extent the video seems to show,\" Boeing 767 pilot Patrick Smith said. \"But for demonstration purposes, under lightweight conditions, it's perfectly natural for this airplane to do that. It's nothing dangerous.\" A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner without its payload and fuel weighs about 117,617 kilograms equal to about 29 elephants. The maximum payload takeoff weight is designed for 227,930 kilograms. The airliner's wing span is 197 feet, the aircraft's length is 186 feet, and the air vehicle's height is 56 feet. The commercial airliner is designed to fly subsonically at Mach 0.85, that is, about 650 miles per hour. Forward thrust of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner at horizontally level flight is \"rearward ejection of air flow\" through a high-intake engine mounted on the wings with the condition that the air flow in the engine exhaust jet originates from the airliner's forward flight design speed. Essentially, the two air-breathing turbofan propulsion systems of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, operating at level flight, are fundamentally converging- diverging flow stream nozzles with a sonic plenum of combustible heat input in the middle, wherein fuel-air mixture propellant is burned. The exhaust jet is a characteristic velocity dependent on how well the flow stream through the engine device is designed. As the Vietnam Airlines crew kept close tabs on the climb rate, airliner vehicle speed, and \"glass cockpit\" command bars, the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff momentarily shifts the Boeing 787-9 in an aggressive flight takeoff performance mode akin to a rocket propulsive system. Fluidic momentum suggests the near vertical thrust needed to achieve the rapid climb equals a large air intake mass flow through the engines multiplied by an even larger engines' exhaust jet velocity, due to the high vehicle speed of the Boeing 787-9 vertically upward, as seen on the company video. Hence, the near vertical thrust readings on the \"glass cockpit\" command bar of the Boeing 787-9 airliner is essentially a non-dimensional ratio of two characteristic velocities - one, which is an exhaust jet dependent on how well the engine flow stream is designed, over another, which is a characteristic velocity about 40 percent higher than the speed of sound inside the combustion chambers of the engines. This near vertical thrust is one measure of performance of the Boeing 787-9 near \"S-vertical\" takeoff, as seen on the company video. Another consideration is how effectively or usefully do the engines burn fuel. This requires next-generation engines, having a sufficiently large overall pressure ratio, so as to have sonic flow at the throat of the engine flow stream design. It is useful here to consider three additional figures of merit - fuel burn, specific impulse, and engine thermal efficiency - in terms of various Boeing 787-9 vehicle parameters from the perspectives of the Boeing aircraft design and the General Electric GEnx-1B and/or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine designs adopted. Both of these adopted engines \"represent nearly a two-generation jump in propulsion technology used on the Boeing 767,\" whereby the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than any other airplane of its size, according to Boeing. Back in 2002, Boeing foresaw increased market demand for its Boeing 767 class twin-aisle airplane flying over significantly larger range. The company believed the airline industry was evolving from a \"hub-and-spoke\" to a \"point- to-point\" lower-fuel cost operational model. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an outgrowth of the challenge to meet this airline industry demand for making significant advances in overall airplane design requiring greater advances in propulsion system innovation. Boeing Commercial Airplane alongside General Electric and Rolls-Royce aircraft engine manufacturers approached this challenge by \"improving fuel burn of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner engines in three traditional performance areas,\" according to the aircraft manufacturer: Higher propulsive efficiency through increased bypass ratio. Higher engine thermal efficiency through increased overall pressure ratio and improved component efficiencies, exclusively involves the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. Improved thrust-to-weight ratio through the application of advanced materials, brings together the Boeing structural engineer and Boeing aeronautical engineer with the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. According to Boeing, the following facts are the conditions for the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's near vertical takeoff using either General Electric GEnx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines: Bypass ratio = 10; Fan diameter = 111-112 inches; Overall pressure ratio = 50; Thrust = 53,000-74,000 pound-feet; Specific fuel consumption = 15% lower than the Boeing 767 class engines. To achieve the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff mode, the propulsion engines must generate momentarily an enormous amount of near vertical thrust. The amount of fuel needed to produce such thrust must momentarily balance the weight of the Boeing 787-9 airliner. Hence, General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineers must consider a figure of merit, called specific fuel consumption, to characterize the engine's fuel efficiency. Specific fuel consumption measures \"how much fuel the engine burns each hour,\" normalized by mass or weight, or in this case, \"per pound of thrust.\" In other words, specific fuel consumption is the mass of fuel burned by the Boeing 787-9 engines in one hour divided by the thrust that the engine produces. Putting it another way, by definition, specific fuel consumption is a ratio of the engine fuel mass flow rate to the amount of thrust produced during fuel burn.

That will come courtesy of British Airways, which announced Wednesday that it will begin flying between the Mineta San Jose International Airport and London Heathrow starting May 4, 2016. British Airways will fly one daily round-trip flight on the route using its new Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which BA notes will include a \"newly designed\" first-class cabin. Tickets for the flights will go on sale on Thursday. \"We are thrilled to be bringing our most technically advanced aircraft to the tech center of the world,\" Simon Brooks, senior vice president for British Airways North America, says in a statement. \"We want to give the business community in and around Silicon Valley more options to access the UK and Europe, quickly and easily. With connections beyond London to over 130 destinations around the world, we're delighted that we can bring the world just a bit closer.\" The new route, of course, is a coup for San Jose. Though it's one of three major airports serving the Bay Area, San Francisco International is the primary international gateway for the region. San Jose and Oakland each have a few overseas routes, but the bulk of the Bay Area's overseas flights operate out of SFO. \"San Jose and Silicon Valley tech companies have committed to Mineta San Jose International as being their airport of choice, and have expressed strong support for a direct flight to London for several years,\" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo adds in the statement. \"The British Airways announcement to launch service between San Jose and London Heathrow will be well received by both business and leisure travelers in our region.\" \"London is the No. 1 requested international destination from Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport, and we're so pleased to share the news today that we have delivered this service to Silicon Valley businesses and residents,\" SJC Director of Aviation Kim Becker adds. \"We warmly welcome British Airways and the innovative Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner to San Jose.\". The new route also continues the Dreamliners' strong track record of opening up new international routes from small and medium-sized markets. Since the launch of the 787 program in 2004, Boeing pledged that the lightweight Dreamliner's modest size - for a widebody - and fuel efficiency would open up potentially hundreds of new long-haul international routes that would previously have been money losers. British Airways already successfully used the Dreamliner to open up one medium-sized U.S. market, launching nonstop service between London and Austin in March 2014. \"London Heathrow to Austin is exactly that kind of route,\" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of marketing, told Today in the Sky right before that route launched. \"It's really about changing the landscape of aviation. It's putting the right tools in our customers' hands to help do that. And I think the Dreamliner is proving that.\" The service turned out to do well for the both British Airways and Austin. The carrier confirmed in May that it will boost capacity on the route Oct. 25, switching the 787 to a bigger Boeing 777-200. British Airways' Dreamliners seat 214 passengers while the carrier's 777-200s seat up to 280. The carrier says it's doing so to meet demand. British Airways' Austin route might be the most striking U.S. example of the 787's impact on medium-sized markets; but it's not the only one. United Airlines began flying to Tokyo from its hub in Denver in April 2012. That gave the busy Colorado airport its first-ever regularly scheduled airline service to Asia. Other smaller, non-hub U.S. cities also have landed new overseas flights on the Dreamliner. They include: Oakland to Oslo on Norwegian Air Shuttle and Orlando's small Sanford International Airport to London Gatwick on British carrier Thomson Airways. Among U.S. carriers, United has used its Dreamliners to fly to secondary markets in other countries, notably with its nonstop route connecting San Francisco and Chengdu, China. In fact, San Jose already has seen its standing grow thanks to Dreamliner- operated overseas routes. One came in early 2013, when Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways added nonstop service to Tokyo Narita. And the airport added another high-profile Dreamliner route to Asia this past June, when China's Hainan Airlines began flying to Beijing .", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/08/26/san-jose-lands-1st-ever-nonstop-route--london--new-british-airways-route/32404563/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "New Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner Makes Dizzying Takeoff in Test Flight", "date": "2015-06-11", "content": "Boeing pilots took the company's new 787 Dreamliner on a vertigo-inducing test flight, complete with a dizzying climb off the runway, a new video shows.

Remarkably displayed are critical flight maneuvers at subsonic flight envelop extremes akin to a \"military fighter.\" Most of all, what is displayed is a more extraordinary extreme takeoff requirement of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner performing nearly as a \"vertical rocket\" propulsive system. It is this latter extraordinary extreme, where it appears the jet is heading straight up, like a rocket, that we wish to discuss in the next section, the simple scientific and technological anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner near vertical takeoff for the benefit of laypersons looking at the stunning pictures. Anatomy of a Boeing 787-9 \"S-Vertical\" Takeoff. \"Presumably the plane was very light because it wasn't carrying any passengers, probably had a very light fuel load, no freight, so it would have been able to perform a steeper than normal ascent - but not to the extent the video seems to show,\" Boeing 767 pilot Patrick Smith said. \"But for demonstration purposes, under lightweight conditions, it's perfectly natural for this airplane to do that. It's nothing dangerous.\" A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner without its payload and fuel weighs about 117,617 kilograms equal to about 29 elephants. The maximum payload takeoff weight is designed for 227,930 kilograms. The airliner's wing span is 197 feet, the aircraft's length is 186 feet, and the air vehicle's height is 56 feet. The commercial airliner is designed to fly subsonically at Mach 0.85, that is, about 650 miles per hour. Forward thrust of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner at horizontally level flight is \"rearward ejection of air flow\" through a high-intake engine mounted on the wings with the condition that the air flow in the engine exhaust jet originates from the airliner's forward flight design speed. Essentially, the two air-breathing turbofan propulsion systems of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, operating at level flight, are fundamentally converging- diverging flow stream nozzles with a sonic plenum of combustible heat input in the middle, wherein fuel-air mixture propellant is burned. The exhaust jet is a characteristic velocity dependent on how well the flow stream through the engine device is designed. As the Vietnam Airlines crew kept close tabs on the climb rate, airliner vehicle speed, and \"glass cockpit\" command bars, the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff momentarily shifts the Boeing 787-9 in an aggressive flight takeoff performance mode akin to a rocket propulsive system. Fluidic momentum suggests the near vertical thrust needed to achieve the rapid climb equals a large air intake mass flow through the engines multiplied by an even larger engines' exhaust jet velocity, due to the high vehicle speed of the Boeing 787-9 vertically upward, as seen on the company video. Hence, the near vertical thrust readings on the \"glass cockpit\" command bar of the Boeing 787-9 airliner is essentially a non-dimensional ratio of two characteristic velocities - one, which is an exhaust jet dependent on how well the engine flow stream is designed, over another, which is a characteristic velocity about 40 percent higher than the speed of sound inside the combustion chambers of the engines. This near vertical thrust is one measure of performance of the Boeing 787-9 near \"S-vertical\" takeoff, as seen on the company video. Another consideration is how effectively or usefully do the engines burn fuel. This requires next-generation engines, having a sufficiently large overall pressure ratio, so as to have sonic flow at the throat of the engine flow stream design. It is useful here to consider three additional figures of merit - fuel burn, specific impulse, and engine thermal efficiency - in terms of various Boeing 787-9 vehicle parameters from the perspectives of the Boeing aircraft design and the General Electric GEnx-1B and/or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine designs adopted. Both of these adopted engines \"represent nearly a two-generation jump in propulsion technology used on the Boeing 767,\" whereby the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than any other airplane of its size, according to Boeing. Back in 2002, Boeing foresaw increased market demand for its Boeing 767 class twin-aisle airplane flying over significantly larger range. The company believed the airline industry was evolving from a \"hub-and-spoke\" to a \"point- to-point\" lower-fuel cost operational model. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an outgrowth of the challenge to meet this airline industry demand for making significant advances in overall airplane design requiring greater advances in propulsion system innovation. Boeing Commercial Airplane alongside General Electric and Rolls-Royce aircraft engine manufacturers approached this challenge by \"improving fuel burn of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner engines in three traditional performance areas,\" according to the aircraft manufacturer: Higher propulsive efficiency through increased bypass ratio. Higher engine thermal efficiency through increased overall pressure ratio and improved component efficiencies, exclusively involves the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. Improved thrust-to-weight ratio through the application of advanced materials, brings together the Boeing structural engineer and Boeing aeronautical engineer with the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. According to Boeing, the following facts are the conditions for the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's near vertical takeoff using either General Electric GEnx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines: Bypass ratio = 10; Fan diameter = 111-112 inches; Overall pressure ratio = 50; Thrust = 53,000-74,000 pound-feet; Specific fuel consumption = 15% lower than the Boeing 767 class engines. To achieve the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff mode, the propulsion engines must generate momentarily an enormous amount of near vertical thrust. The amount of fuel needed to produce such thrust must momentarily balance the weight of the Boeing 787-9 airliner. Hence, General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineers must consider a figure of merit, called specific fuel consumption, to characterize the engine's fuel efficiency. Specific fuel consumption measures \"how much fuel the engine burns each hour,\" normalized by mass or weight, or in this case, \"per pound of thrust.\" In other words, specific fuel consumption is the mass of fuel burned by the Boeing 787-9 engines in one hour divided by the thrust that the engine produces. Putting it another way, by definition, specific fuel consumption is a ratio of the engine fuel mass flow rate to the amount of thrust produced during fuel burn. When we normalize this ratio by the engine air mass flow rate, we obtain another form of specific fuel consumption in terms of a ratio defining the fuel-to-air mix to the specific thrust. The units of specific fuel consumption are mass per unit time divided by thrust force. Research experts and officials at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, working from the standpoint of producing clean efficient turbofan engines, consider figure of merit tradeoffs between specific fuel consumption versus nitrogen oxide emissions. The key source of NOx emissions is the combustion of fuels inside the burner chamber of the aircraft engine device. This brings into consideration the multidisciplinary science of aero-environmental propulsion engineering. However, we can also define another figure of merit, called the specific impulse, as directly related to the overall efficiency of the engines of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in performing the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff. The specific impulse in performing this takeoff is a ratio of the near vertical thrust divided by the temporal rate of change of the Boeing 787-9 weight. Naturally, of course, we do also have equilibrated lift-to-drag force ratios of the wings, tail section, and fuselage. However, such resultant equilibrated lift-to-drag forces are momentarily vectorially-directed at sharply inclined angles relative to the Boeing 787-9 airliner's center of mass, as the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff flight maneuver of the airliner is being performed. The overall efficiency may be approximated as a product of the propulsive efficiency and the thermal efficiency.", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anatomy-boeing-787-dreamliner-vertical-takeoff-oliver"}, {"title": "KLM gives sneak-peek of its Boeing 787 'Dreamliner'", "date": "2015-07-24", "content": "Dutch carrier KLM isn't scheduled to get its first Boeing 787 \"Dreamliner\" until this fall, but the carrier teased the arrival of its new jet on Friday by releasing several images of the aircraft decked out in its signature color scheme.

That will come courtesy of British Airways, which announced Wednesday that it will begin flying between the Mineta San Jose International Airport and London Heathrow starting May 4, 2016. British Airways will fly one daily round-trip flight on the route using its new Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which BA notes will include a \"newly designed\" first-class cabin. Tickets for the flights will go on sale on Thursday. \"We are thrilled to be bringing our most technically advanced aircraft to the tech center of the world,\" Simon Brooks, senior vice president for British Airways North America, says in a statement. \"We want to give the business community in and around Silicon Valley more options to access the UK and Europe, quickly and easily. With connections beyond London to over 130 destinations around the world, we're delighted that we can bring the world just a bit closer.\" The new route, of course, is a coup for San Jose. Though it's one of three major airports serving the Bay Area, San Francisco International is the primary international gateway for the region. San Jose and Oakland each have a few overseas routes, but the bulk of the Bay Area's overseas flights operate out of SFO. \"San Jose and Silicon Valley tech companies have committed to Mineta San Jose International as being their airport of choice, and have expressed strong support for a direct flight to London for several years,\" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo adds in the statement. \"The British Airways announcement to launch service between San Jose and London Heathrow will be well received by both business and leisure travelers in our region.\" \"London is the No. 1 requested international destination from Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport, and we're so pleased to share the news today that we have delivered this service to Silicon Valley businesses and residents,\" SJC Director of Aviation Kim Becker adds. \"We warmly welcome British Airways and the innovative Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner to San Jose.\". The new route also continues the Dreamliners' strong track record of opening up new international routes from small and medium-sized markets. Since the launch of the 787 program in 2004, Boeing pledged that the lightweight Dreamliner's modest size - for a widebody - and fuel efficiency would open up potentially hundreds of new long-haul international routes that would previously have been money losers. British Airways already successfully used the Dreamliner to open up one medium-sized U.S. market, launching nonstop service between London and Austin in March 2014. \"London Heathrow to Austin is exactly that kind of route,\" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of marketing, told Today in the Sky right before that route launched. \"It's really about changing the landscape of aviation. It's putting the right tools in our customers' hands to help do that. And I think the Dreamliner is proving that.\" The service turned out to do well for the both British Airways and Austin. The carrier confirmed in May that it will boost capacity on the route Oct. 25, switching the 787 to a bigger Boeing 777-200. British Airways' Dreamliners seat 214 passengers while the carrier's 777-200s seat up to 280. The carrier says it's doing so to meet demand. British Airways' Austin route might be the most striking U.S. example of the 787's impact on medium-sized markets; but it's not the only one. United Airlines began flying to Tokyo from its hub in Denver in April 2012. That gave the busy Colorado airport its first-ever regularly scheduled airline service to Asia. Other smaller, non-hub U.S. cities also have landed new overseas flights on the Dreamliner. They include: Oakland to Oslo on Norwegian Air Shuttle and Orlando's small Sanford International Airport to London Gatwick on British carrier Thomson Airways. Among U.S. carriers, United has used its Dreamliners to fly to secondary markets in other countries, notably with its nonstop route connecting San Francisco and Chengdu, China. In fact, San Jose already has seen its standing grow thanks to Dreamliner- operated overseas routes. One came in early 2013, when Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways added nonstop service to Tokyo Narita. And the airport added another high-profile Dreamliner route to Asia this past June, when China's Hainan Airlines began flying to Beijing .", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/08/26/san-jose-lands-1st-ever-nonstop-route--london--new-british-airways-route/32404563/"}, {"title": "The Plane Awakens: ANA Star Wars 787-9", "date": "2015-09-12", "content": "It's finally here!

This near vertical thrust is one measure of performance of the Boeing 787-9 near \"S-vertical\" takeoff, as seen on the company video. Another consideration is how effectively or usefully do the engines burn fuel. This requires next-generation engines, having a sufficiently large overall pressure ratio, so as to have sonic flow at the throat of the engine flow stream design. It is useful here to consider three additional figures of merit - fuel burn, specific impulse, and engine thermal efficiency - in terms of various Boeing 787-9 vehicle parameters from the perspectives of the Boeing aircraft design and the General Electric GEnx-1B and/or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine designs adopted. Both of these adopted engines \"represent nearly a two-generation jump in propulsion technology used on the Boeing 767,\" whereby the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than any other airplane of its size, according to Boeing. Back in 2002, Boeing foresaw increased market demand for its Boeing 767 class twin-aisle airplane flying over significantly larger range. The company believed the airline industry was evolving from a \"hub-and-spoke\" to a \"point- to-point\" lower-fuel cost operational model. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an outgrowth of the challenge to meet this airline industry demand for making significant advances in overall airplane design requiring greater advances in propulsion system innovation. Boeing Commercial Airplane alongside General Electric and Rolls-Royce aircraft engine manufacturers approached this challenge by \"improving fuel burn of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner engines in three traditional performance areas,\" according to the aircraft manufacturer: Higher propulsive efficiency through increased bypass ratio. Higher engine thermal efficiency through increased overall pressure ratio and improved component efficiencies, exclusively involves the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. Improved thrust-to-weight ratio through the application of advanced materials, brings together the Boeing structural engineer and Boeing aeronautical engineer with the General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineer. According to Boeing, the following facts are the conditions for the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's near vertical takeoff using either General Electric GEnx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines: Bypass ratio = 10; Fan diameter = 111-112 inches; Overall pressure ratio = 50; Thrust = 53,000-74,000 pound-feet; Specific fuel consumption = 15% lower than the Boeing 767 class engines. To achieve the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff mode, the propulsion engines must generate momentarily an enormous amount of near vertical thrust. The amount of fuel needed to produce such thrust must momentarily balance the weight of the Boeing 787-9 airliner. Hence, General Electric and Rolls-Royce propulsion engineers must consider a figure of merit, called specific fuel consumption, to characterize the engine's fuel efficiency. Specific fuel consumption measures \"how much fuel the engine burns each hour,\" normalized by mass or weight, or in this case, \"per pound of thrust.\" In other words, specific fuel consumption is the mass of fuel burned by the Boeing 787-9 engines in one hour divided by the thrust that the engine produces. Putting it another way, by definition, specific fuel consumption is a ratio of the engine fuel mass flow rate to the amount of thrust produced during fuel burn. When we normalize this ratio by the engine air mass flow rate, we obtain another form of specific fuel consumption in terms of a ratio defining the fuel-to-air mix to the specific thrust. The units of specific fuel consumption are mass per unit time divided by thrust force. Research experts and officials at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, working from the standpoint of producing clean efficient turbofan engines, consider figure of merit tradeoffs between specific fuel consumption versus nitrogen oxide emissions. The key source of NOx emissions is the combustion of fuels inside the burner chamber of the aircraft engine device. This brings into consideration the multidisciplinary science of aero-environmental propulsion engineering. However, we can also define another figure of merit, called the specific impulse, as directly related to the overall efficiency of the engines of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in performing the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff. The specific impulse in performing this takeoff is a ratio of the near vertical thrust divided by the temporal rate of change of the Boeing 787-9 weight. Naturally, of course, we do also have equilibrated lift-to-drag force ratios of the wings, tail section, and fuselage. However, such resultant equilibrated lift-to-drag forces are momentarily vectorially-directed at sharply inclined angles relative to the Boeing 787-9 airliner's center of mass, as the near \"S-vertical\" takeoff flight maneuver of the airliner is being performed. The overall efficiency may be approximated as a product of the propulsive efficiency and the thermal efficiency.", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/anatomy-boeing-787-dreamliner-vertical-takeoff-oliver"}, {"title": "KLM gives sneak-peek of its Boeing 787 'Dreamliner'", "date": "2015-07-24", "content": "Dutch carrier KLM isn't scheduled to get its first Boeing 787 \"Dreamliner\" until this fall, but the carrier teased the arrival of its new jet on Friday by releasing several images of the aircraft decked out in its signature color scheme.

British Airways will fly one daily round-trip flight on the route using its new Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which BA notes will include a \"newly designed\" first-class cabin. Tickets for the flights will go on sale on Thursday. \"We are thrilled to be bringing our most technically advanced aircraft to the tech center of the world,\" Simon Brooks, senior vice president for British Airways North America, says in a statement. \"We want to give the business community in and around Silicon Valley more options to access the UK and Europe, quickly and easily. With connections beyond London to over 130 destinations around the world, we're delighted that we can bring the world just a bit closer.\" The new route, of course, is a coup for San Jose. Though it's one of three major airports serving the Bay Area, San Francisco International is the primary international gateway for the region. San Jose and Oakland each have a few overseas routes, but the bulk of the Bay Area's overseas flights operate out of SFO. \"San Jose and Silicon Valley tech companies have committed to Mineta San Jose International as being their airport of choice, and have expressed strong support for a direct flight to London for several years,\" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo adds in the statement. \"The British Airways announcement to launch service between San Jose and London Heathrow will be well received by both business and leisure travelers in our region.\" \"London is the No. 1 requested international destination from Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport, and we're so pleased to share the news today that we have delivered this service to Silicon Valley businesses and residents,\" SJC Director of Aviation Kim Becker adds. \"We warmly welcome British Airways and the innovative Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner to San Jose.\". The new route also continues the Dreamliners' strong track record of opening up new international routes from small and medium-sized markets. Since the launch of the 787 program in 2004, Boeing pledged that the lightweight Dreamliner's modest size - for a widebody - and fuel efficiency would open up potentially hundreds of new long-haul international routes that would previously have been money losers. British Airways already successfully used the Dreamliner to open up one medium-sized U.S. market, launching nonstop service between London and Austin in March 2014. \"London Heathrow to Austin is exactly that kind of route,\" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of marketing, told Today in the Sky right before that route launched. \"It's really about changing the landscape of aviation. It's putting the right tools in our customers' hands to help do that. And I think the Dreamliner is proving that.\" The service turned out to do well for the both British Airways and Austin. The carrier confirmed in May that it will boost capacity on the route Oct. 25, switching the 787 to a bigger Boeing 777-200. British Airways' Dreamliners seat 214 passengers while the carrier's 777-200s seat up to 280. The carrier says it's doing so to meet demand. British Airways' Austin route might be the most striking U.S. example of the 787's impact on medium-sized markets; but it's not the only one.

Hedging about Dreamliner delivery dates aside, AA will offer a full four-and- a-half classes of service on board its 777-300ER. Its 777-200ER, 787-8, A330 and A350 aircraft will either arrive with the product from the factory or be retrofitted within a relatively slow three years into a 3.5 class layout, without first class. The airline's Boeing 767-300ER fleet, which is on the way out, will not be refitted. American joins a growing number of airlines realising that their ultra-narrow economy seats in 3-4-3 Boeing 777 configurations or 3-3-3 layouts on the 787 create too much of what Airbus calls the \"comfort canyon\" between a very tight economy experience and an increasingly spacious business class. The airline is to be praised for being a first mover among its US competitors - frankly, the US #PaxEx innovator recently has been Delta, not merger-focussed American. The seat, though, is very average. American certainly hasn't used the time it gained from being a very late mover in this space to create an innovative hard product product in the premium economy space. This seat couldn't be more average if it tried: 38\" inches of pitch, at the bottom of the premium economy charts and four inches below partner JAL's existing seat. The same 2-3-2 premium economy layout that every Dreamliner premium economy section has. Legrests for the first row only, with other seats just seeing a fold-down bar from the seat in front. While the promise of noise-reducing headsets, an as-yet unspecified amenity kit, priority boarding and an onboard food upgrade are slight pluses, there's nothing innovative about this product. But more than that, the cabin in the mockups just feels ... staid. Grey. Boring. Like a domestic first class cabin on a regional jet from the previous decade. American has missed a trick in introducing a modern looking cabin to take advantage of the Dreamliner lighting's ability to flood the cabin with a great-looking, bang-on-brand atmosphere - or it has done so with the obviously expensively produced faux-VR video CGI it has created to introduce the product. The overall question is: \"it took American that long to come up with just this?\" Runway Girl Network approached American Airlines about the reasons for its selection of B/E Aerospace as a manufacturer, but the airline has not yet responded. Key parts of the seat strongly resemble a premium economy product B/E Aerospace was demonstrating on its stand at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg earlier this year - which came in a finish significantly more pleasing to the eye than the boring grey AA has chosen. This is the first time this seat has been chosen for a premium economy cabin, and could well signal an addition to the much-criticised catalogue for the 787. RGN approached Boeing with questions about the catalogue but the airframer has not yet responded. A B/E product in premium economy would seem to suggest that American, which dropped Zodiac Aerospace from its 787-9 fleet after delivery problems with AA's custom 787-8 business class product, will select B/E for its business class cabin for future deliveries. American will very much be hoping that B/E is able to certify and produce this premium economy seat on time, even with the long three-year retrofit period. The seatmaker recently caused significant delays to the rollout of Virgin Australia's new business class seats on two fleet types as the result of what were frankly easily foreseeable head impact certification problems - could the three years be the result of needing to certify and produce this new premium economy product? American Airlines did not respond to RGN's questions about how it has satisfied itself that B/E Aerospace can deliver the seat to schedule.

British Airways will fly one daily round-trip flight on the route using its new Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which BA notes will include a \"newly designed\" first-class cabin. Tickets for the flights will go on sale on Thursday. \"We are thrilled to be bringing our most technically advanced aircraft to the tech center of the world,\" Simon Brooks, senior vice president for British Airways North America, says in a statement. \"We want to give the business community in and around Silicon Valley more options to access the UK and Europe, quickly and easily. With connections beyond London to over 130 destinations around the world, we're delighted that we can bring the world just a bit closer.\" The new route, of course, is a coup for San Jose. Though it's one of three major airports serving the Bay Area, San Francisco International is the primary international gateway for the region. San Jose and Oakland each have a few overseas routes, but the bulk of the Bay Area's overseas flights operate out of SFO. \"San Jose and Silicon Valley tech companies have committed to Mineta San Jose International as being their airport of choice, and have expressed strong support for a direct flight to London for several years,\" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo adds in the statement. \"The British Airways announcement to launch service between San Jose and London Heathrow will be well received by both business and leisure travelers in our region.\" \"London is the No. 1 requested international destination from Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport, and we're so pleased to share the news today that we have delivered this service to Silicon Valley businesses and residents,\" SJC Director of Aviation Kim Becker adds. \"We warmly welcome British Airways and the innovative Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner to San Jose.\". The new route also continues the Dreamliners' strong track record of opening up new international routes from small and medium-sized markets. Since the launch of the 787 program in 2004, Boeing pledged that the lightweight Dreamliner's modest size - for a widebody - and fuel efficiency would open up potentially hundreds of new long-haul international routes that would previously have been money losers. British Airways already successfully used the Dreamliner to open up one medium-sized U.S. market, launching nonstop service between London and Austin in March 2014. \"London Heathrow to Austin is exactly that kind of route,\" Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of marketing, told Today in the Sky right before that route launched. \"It's really about changing the landscape of aviation. It's putting the right tools in our customers' hands to help do that. And I think the Dreamliner is proving that.\" The service turned out to do well for the both British Airways and Austin. The carrier confirmed in May that it will boost capacity on the route Oct. 25, switching the 787 to a bigger Boeing 777-200. British Airways' Dreamliners seat 214 passengers while the carrier's 777-200s seat up to 280. The carrier says it's doing so to meet demand. British Airways' Austin route might be the most striking U.S. example of the 787's impact on medium-sized markets; but it's not the only one. United Airlines began flying to Tokyo from its hub in Denver in April 2012. That gave the busy Colorado airport its first-ever regularly scheduled airline service to Asia. Other smaller, non-hub U.S. cities also have landed new overseas flights on the Dreamliner. They include: Oakland to Oslo on Norwegian Air Shuttle and Orlando's small Sanford International Airport to London Gatwick on British carrier Thomson Airways. Among U.S. carriers, United has used its Dreamliners to fly to secondary markets in other countries, notably with its nonstop route connecting San Francisco and Chengdu, China. In fact, San Jose already has seen its standing grow thanks to Dreamliner- operated overseas routes. One came in early 2013, when Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways added nonstop service to Tokyo Narita. And the airport added another high-profile Dreamliner route to Asia this past June, when China's Hainan Airlines began flying to Beijing .", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/08/26/san-jose-lands-1st-ever-nonstop-route--london--new-british-airways-route/32404563/"}, {"title": "The Plane Awakens: ANA Star Wars 787-9", "date": "2015-09-12", "content": "It's finally here!

Hedging about Dreamliner delivery dates aside, AA will offer a full four-and- a-half classes of service on board its 777-300ER. Its 777-200ER, 787-8, A330 and A350 aircraft will either arrive with the product from the factory or be retrofitted within a relatively slow three years into a 3.5 class layout, without first class. The airline's Boeing 767-300ER fleet, which is on the way out, will not be refitted. American joins a growing number of airlines realising that their ultra-narrow economy seats in 3-4-3 Boeing 777 configurations or 3-3-3 layouts on the 787 create too much of what Airbus calls the \"comfort canyon\" between a very tight economy experience and an increasingly spacious business class. The airline is to be praised for being a first mover among its US competitors - frankly, the US #PaxEx innovator recently has been Delta, not merger-focussed American. The seat, though, is very average. American certainly hasn't used the time it gained from being a very late mover in this space to create an innovative hard product product in the premium economy space. This seat couldn't be more average if it tried: 38\" inches of pitch, at the bottom of the premium economy charts and four inches below partner JAL's existing seat. The same 2-3-2 premium economy layout that every Dreamliner premium economy section has. Legrests for the first row only, with other seats just seeing a fold-down bar from the seat in front. While the promise of noise-reducing headsets, an as-yet unspecified amenity kit, priority boarding and an onboard food upgrade are slight pluses, there's nothing innovative about this product. But more than that, the cabin in the mockups just feels ... staid. Grey. Boring. Like a domestic first class cabin on a regional jet from the previous decade. American has missed a trick in introducing a modern looking cabin to take advantage of the Dreamliner lighting's ability to flood the cabin with a great-looking, bang-on-brand atmosphere - or it has done so with the obviously expensively produced faux-VR video CGI it has created to introduce the product. The overall question is: \"it took American that long to come up with just this?\" Runway Girl Network approached American Airlines about the reasons for its selection of B/E Aerospace as a manufacturer, but the airline has not yet responded. Key parts of the seat strongly resemble a premium economy product B/E Aerospace was demonstrating on its stand at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg earlier this year - which came in a finish significantly more pleasing to the eye than the boring grey AA has chosen. This is the first time this seat has been chosen for a premium economy cabin, and could well signal an addition to the much-criticised catalogue for the 787. RGN approached Boeing with questions about the catalogue but the airframer has not yet responded. A B/E product in premium economy would seem to suggest that American, which dropped Zodiac Aerospace from its 787-9 fleet after delivery problems with AA's custom 787-8 business class product, will select B/E for its business class cabin for future deliveries. American will very much be hoping that B/E is able to certify and produce this premium economy seat on time, even with the long three-year retrofit period. The seatmaker recently caused significant delays to the rollout of Virgin Australia's new business class seats on two fleet types as the result of what were frankly easily foreseeable head impact certification problems - could the three years be the result of needing to certify and produce this new premium economy product?

The airline is to be praised for being a first mover among its US competitors - frankly, the US #PaxEx innovator recently has been Delta, not merger-focussed American. The seat, though, is very average. American certainly hasn't used the time it gained from being a very late mover in this space to create an innovative hard product product in the premium economy space. This seat couldn't be more average if it tried: 38\" inches of pitch, at the bottom of the premium economy charts and four inches below partner JAL's existing seat. The same 2-3-2 premium economy layout that every Dreamliner premium economy section has. Legrests for the first row only, with other seats just seeing a fold-down bar from the seat in front. While the promise of noise-reducing headsets, an as-yet unspecified amenity kit, priority boarding and an onboard food upgrade are slight pluses, there's nothing innovative about this product. But more than that, the cabin in the mockups just feels ... staid. Grey. Boring. Like a domestic first class cabin on a regional jet from the previous decade. American has missed a trick in introducing a modern looking cabin to take advantage of the Dreamliner lighting's ability to flood the cabin with a great-looking, bang-on-brand atmosphere - or it has done so with the obviously expensively produced faux-VR video CGI it has created to introduce the product. The overall question is: \"it took American that long to come up with just this?\" Runway Girl Network approached American Airlines about the reasons for its selection of B/E Aerospace as a manufacturer, but the airline has not yet responded. Key parts of the seat strongly resemble a premium economy product B/E Aerospace was demonstrating on its stand at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg earlier this year - which came in a finish significantly more pleasing to the eye than the boring grey AA has chosen. This is the first time this seat has been chosen for a premium economy cabin, and could well signal an addition to the much-criticised catalogue for the 787. RGN approached Boeing with questions about the catalogue but the airframer has not yet responded. A B/E product in premium economy would seem to suggest that American, which dropped Zodiac Aerospace from its 787-9 fleet after delivery problems with AA's custom 787-8 business class product, will select B/E for its business class cabin for future deliveries. American will very much be hoping that B/E is able to certify and produce this premium economy seat on time, even with the long three-year retrofit period. The seatmaker recently caused significant delays to the rollout of Virgin Australia's new business class seats on two fleet types as the result of what were frankly easily foreseeable head impact certification problems - could the three years be the result of needing to certify and produce this new premium economy product? American Airlines did not respond to RGN's questions about how it has satisfied itself that B/E Aerospace can deliver the seat to schedule.

Of course, I doubt that anyone happens to have a personal Boeing 787 parked in their driveway, but by all means only professional test pilots should have this kind of fun. As a teaser for the Farnborough International Airshow next week, Boeing took another 787-9 into the air with a thrilling near-vertical takeoff that you'd never experience as a passenger. It's just as jaw-dropping as the video we saw last year featuring a Vietnam Airlines 787-9, but this time the airliner is emblazoned with the livery of Japan's ANA. The video, which Boeing published Thursday on the company's YouTube page, begins with overhead shots of the Dreamliner taxiing onto the runway at Moses Lake, Washington. Located in a flat semi-arid portion of Washington State east of the Cascade Range, Moses Lake is home to a Boeing test facility. It then takes off at a sharp angle that would make even the most courageous flyer sick while we watch it all happen from above and inside the cockpit and the cabin. After that, chase planes give us a view of the aircraft soaring above the airport before it returns for a landing. But don't take my word for how stupendous the video is, enjoy for yourself all the way through. Boeing made the 787-9 the centerpiece of its presence at the 2014 Farnborough show, which is held every two years at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire, UK. The successor to the 787-8, the 787-9 is 20 feet longer than the original Dreamliner and fits about 280 passengers.

The Dutch carrier made its inaugural Dreamliner flight to the USA on Wednesday, with service between San Francisco International Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. The inaugural 787 departure for Amsterdam left after a short gate-side celebration marked with cupcakes, balloons, commemorative T-shirts and a ribbon-cutting with KLM executives. \"We are excited to inaugurate KLM's first North American Dreamliner in San Francisco to support growing West Coast demand,\" Eric Caron, Air France-KLM general manager for the U.S., told passengers waiting to board the Amsterdam flight. Through the summer season, passengers flying on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines between San Francisco and Amsterdam will fly on either KLM's 747-400 or on its Boeing 787-9 \"Dreamlimer.\" KLM's twice-weekly 787-9 Dreamliner flights -- on Wednesdays and Sundays through October -- will be in addition to daily Boeing 747-400 service between the cities. At the end of the summer season, KLM's service between SFO and AMS will switch exclusively to the Dreamliner. \"On this Dreamliner there is a reduction in noise and a different cabin pressure so you will feel less tired when you arrive in Amsterdam,\" said Caron, \"You'll have Wi-Fi on board, the latest generation of our seats and more than 200 movies on your screen. It is part of our investment in providing the best quality, the best comfort and the best crew.\" KLM is currently the only carrier offering direct flights between San Francisco and Amsterdam. Passengers on the inaugural flight were given commemorative T-shirts at check- in. That's how the one family heading home to Delft after a California vacation, learned they were flying on the Dreamliner and not on a 747. And they were thrilled. \"If we'd known it was possible to fly on a Dreamliner we would have chosen it, so this is a nice surprise,\" said Judith Rietveld, whose son, Max Van Doorn, was proudly wearing his new Dreamliner T-shirt, The family has been following news about the Dreamliner on TV. \"We are aware that the plane has added comfort, less noise, saves fuel and is better for the environment,\" said Rietveld, \"Everyone has to do their part and this is a great way to do it.\" KLM's 787-9 Dreamliner features the airline's full-flat World Business Class seats, each with a 16-inch TV screen and direct-aisle access.

The 8,446-mile flight - the first- ever regularly scheduled service to connect those cities nonstop - is the third-longest flight by distance of any carrier in the world, according to airline data provider OAG. United Flight 1 - the westbound flight from San Francisco to Singapore - has a scheduled flying time of 16 hours, 20 minutes. The return - United Flight 2 - is scheduled for 15 hours, 30 minutes. \"This is a special time for all of us at United,\" Jim Compton - United's chief revenue officer - said during a gateside ceremony for the inaugural S.F.-Singapore flight. \"By using this flight, our customers are going to save up to four hours compared to connecting options on other airlines.\" Additionally, Compton said the new San Francisco route adds a one-stop option to Singapore from 26 U.S. cities that previously required two or more stops to get to that city. The Singapore service comes amid a sizable international expansion for United at its San Francisco hub. United also has recently launched new routes to destinations in mainland China as well as Tel Aviv, Israel. Later this summer, United will begin nonstop service to Auckland, New Zealand. \"San Francisco is a powerhouse hub, the best anywhere on the West Coast,\" Mike Hannah, United's VP of Operations - San Francisco, said at the gate for the inaugural Singapore flight. Many of United's new international routes from San Francisco are being operated with the carrier's Dreamliners, which \"have revolutionized flying for United,\" according to Compton, the carrier's revenue chief. Fittingly, one of Boeing's top executives was on hand for United's Singapore launch. Randy Tinseth, Boeing's VP of marketing, said it was gratifying to see Boeing's Dreamliners opening up new routes between cities that were impractical to connect with the larger widebodies that preceded the Dreamliner. The Deamliner's modest size and seating capacity - at least relative to other widebody planes - makes it well-suited for long \"thin\" routes where larger aircraft would have too many seats to fill. \"When we launched this aircraft, we talked about how it would open new markets,\" he said, pointing to Austin and San Jose as other U.S. cities seeing new international routes launched on Dreamliners. \"It's exceeded our expectations.\" Tinseth joined other passengers onboard the inaugural flight to Singapore, where he said he planned to take a few days to be a tourist in the city. Among the others boarding United's inaugural San Francisco-Singapore flight were Meeta Lulla and Clay Autrey. The Los Angeles couple was connecting in San Francisco en route to Singapore so Lulla could attend her sister's graduation from medical school there. It was a coincidence, however, that they booked the inaugural flight. \"We didn't know what the whole fuss was for,\" Lulla said about the gate celebration that included a Singaporean-style \"ribbon dance,\" free food and speeches by airline and city officials.

It's just as jaw-dropping as the video we saw last year featuring a Vietnam Airlines 787-9, but this time the airliner is emblazoned with the livery of Japan's ANA. The video, which Boeing published Thursday on the company's YouTube page, begins with overhead shots of the Dreamliner taxiing onto the runway at Moses Lake, Washington. Located in a flat semi-arid portion of Washington State east of the Cascade Range, Moses Lake is home to a Boeing test facility. It then takes off at a sharp angle that would make even the most courageous flyer sick while we watch it all happen from above and inside the cockpit and the cabin. After that, chase planes give us a view of the aircraft soaring above the airport before it returns for a landing. But don't take my word for how stupendous the video is, enjoy for yourself all the way through.

The carrier said that under certain flying conditions the compressor blades in the engine's interior showed corrosion. It said it will cancel nine domestic 787 flights on Friday, with other cancellations likely in the coming weeks. ANA's Dreamliners are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The Japanese airline is the biggest operator of the Boeing model with some 49 aircraft, or around a tenth of the global fleet.

It did not say whether the problem had been found in 787 engines on aircraft operated by other airlines, but when asked about any requirement to take additional action a spokesman said the issue was limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet.

According to Qantas, this is the fifth time the red-and-white image on the tail of Qantas aircraft has been updated since it was first introduced in 1944. The last update was in 2007 and coincided with the introduction of the Airbus A380 to the Qantas fleet. Before that, the logo was updated in 1984, for the B747-300, and in 1947, for the Lockheed Constellation. The new branding is already showing up the carrier's digital assets, signage and advertising and will roll out on aircraft according to the schedule of re- paints, with a goal of having the entire fleet repainted in time for the airline's centenary in 2020. What to expect on the Qantas 787? Qantas won't get its first 787 for a year and hasn't yet shared the routes the new aircraft will fly, although the carrier says tickets for the first international flights should be available before Christmas. Qantas has revealed some information about its design for its Dreamliner cabin, which will seat 236 passengers: 42 in business class, with a 1-2-1 configuration; 28 in premium economy, with a 2-3-2 configuration; and 166 economy seats, with a 3-3-3 configuration. 787-9 seats 252, while Air Canada loads in 298 passengers.) The business-class seats will extend to an 80-inch bed length, have privacy screens and will be able to be in a recline position \"from take-off right through to landing,\" according to Qantas, while the economy seats will have a 32-inch pitch, 6-inch recline, integrated mood lights, a shelf for electronic devices, a storage space for water bottles and a \"foot net\" to aid napping. Self-service snack and drink bars are planned for both the economy- and business-class cabin.

The 8,446-mile flight - the first- ever regularly scheduled service to connect those cities nonstop - is the third-longest flight by distance of any carrier in the world, according to airline data provider OAG. United Flight 1 - the westbound flight from San Francisco to Singapore - has a scheduled flying time of 16 hours, 20 minutes. The return - United Flight 2 - is scheduled for 15 hours, 30 minutes. \"This is a special time for all of us at United,\" Jim Compton - United's chief revenue officer - said during a gateside ceremony for the inaugural S.F.-Singapore flight. \"By using this flight, our customers are going to save up to four hours compared to connecting options on other airlines.\" Additionally, Compton said the new San Francisco route adds a one-stop option to Singapore from 26 U.S. cities that previously required two or more stops to get to that city. The Singapore service comes amid a sizable international expansion for United at its San Francisco hub. United also has recently launched new routes to destinations in mainland China as well as Tel Aviv, Israel. Later this summer, United will begin nonstop service to Auckland, New Zealand. \"San Francisco is a powerhouse hub, the best anywhere on the West Coast,\" Mike Hannah, United's VP of Operations - San Francisco, said at the gate for the inaugural Singapore flight. Many of United's new international routes from San Francisco are being operated with the carrier's Dreamliners, which \"have revolutionized flying for United,\" according to Compton, the carrier's revenue chief. Fittingly, one of Boeing's top executives was on hand for United's Singapore launch. Randy Tinseth, Boeing's VP of marketing, said it was gratifying to see Boeing's Dreamliners opening up new routes between cities that were impractical to connect with the larger widebodies that preceded the Dreamliner. The Deamliner's modest size and seating capacity - at least relative to other widebody planes - makes it well-suited for long \"thin\" routes where larger aircraft would have too many seats to fill. \"When we launched this aircraft, we talked about how it would open new markets,\" he said, pointing to Austin and San Jose as other U.S. cities seeing new international routes launched on Dreamliners. \"It's exceeded our expectations.\" Tinseth joined other passengers onboard the inaugural flight to Singapore, where he said he planned to take a few days to be a tourist in the city. Among the others boarding United's inaugural San Francisco-Singapore flight were Meeta Lulla and Clay Autrey. The Los Angeles couple was connecting in San Francisco en route to Singapore so Lulla could attend her sister's graduation from medical school there. It was a coincidence, however, that they booked the inaugural flight. \"We didn't know what the whole fuss was for,\" Lulla said about the gate celebration that included a Singaporean-style \"ribbon dance,\" free food and speeches by airline and city officials.

It's just as jaw-dropping as the video we saw last year featuring a Vietnam Airlines 787-9, but this time the airliner is emblazoned with the livery of Japan's ANA. The video, which Boeing published Thursday on the company's YouTube page, begins with overhead shots of the Dreamliner taxiing onto the runway at Moses Lake, Washington. Located in a flat semi-arid portion of Washington State east of the Cascade Range, Moses Lake is home to a Boeing test facility. It then takes off at a sharp angle that would make even the most courageous flyer sick while we watch it all happen from above and inside the cockpit and the cabin. After that, chase planes give us a view of the aircraft soaring above the airport before it returns for a landing. But don't take my word for how stupendous the video is, enjoy for yourself all the way through. Boeing made the 787-9 the centerpiece of its presence at the 2014 Farnborough show, which is held every two years at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire, UK.

The carrier said that under certain flying conditions the compressor blades in the engine's interior showed corrosion. It said it will cancel nine domestic 787 flights on Friday, with other cancellations likely in the coming weeks. ANA's Dreamliners are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The Japanese airline is the biggest operator of the Boeing model with some 49 aircraft, or around a tenth of the global fleet. Of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, 168 use the Rolls-Royce engines, according to Boeing's website. \"We are aware of the situation and are working with Rolls-Royce and ANA to resolve any issues impacting the airplanes in service,\" a spokesman for Boeing in Tokyo said. Rolls-Royce Holdings said in an e-mailed statement it was \"working closely with ANA to minimize the effect on aircraft service disruption\". It did not say whether the problem had been found in 787 engines on aircraft operated by other airlines, but when asked about any requirement to take additional action a spokesman said the issue was limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet. Shares in Rolls-Royce traded down 2.2 percent at 771 pence at 1505 GMT, making the company one of the biggest losers on Britain's bluechip index. Airlines that order the Dreamliner can choose either the Rolls-Royce engines or General Electric Co's GE.N GEnx engines for their aircraft. ANA said vibrations resulting from the problem with the compressor blades had occurred on a flight from Japan to Malaysia in February and on one to Vietnam in March. A 787 traveling on a domestic route on Aug. 20 had also experienced trouble, it said. Rolls-Royce is in turnaround mode after a tough 18 months after being hit by a low oil price and lower demand for servicing of some of its older engines. It has a plan to cut costs by 150 million to 200 million pounds by the end of 2017.

That seems to be the tradition at Australia's Qantas Airways, which last week revealed an update to its iconic kangaroo logo and a streamlined \"Qantas\" typography in preparation for the delivery of the carrier's first Boeing 787-9 aircraft - scheduled for a year from now. The new design was painted on an Airbus A330-300 and was revealed at an event in Sydney, along with details about the seats, seating configuration and some of the amenities passengers can expect to find on the carrier's 787 aircraft. The logo and the livery: While the classic \"Qantas red\" and white of the fuselage are unchanged, the airline has streamlined the kangaroo image seen on the tail of the aircraft. The updated kangaroo image has also been added to the inside curved edge of the wingtips so that passengers will see the image when they look out the windows and the kangaroo logo will show up in pictures passengers take from inside the aircraft. In addition to replacing and enlarging the kangaroo that appears on the outboard engine cowls, the airline has re-introduced the iconic \"winged kangaroo\" that appeared on Qantas tails in the 1960s, 70s and 80s and added it under the cockpit window, where the aircraft name is painted. The word \"Qantas\" that appears on the side of the aircraft gets a slimmer font and a slightly lighter color and, to increase visibility for the brand from the ground, the word Qantas now appears on the belly of the aircraft. \"We wanted to make sure our brand remained familiar but we also wanted it to be more modern and dynamic, like the 787 and like Qantas,\" Alan Joyce, Qantas Group CEO, said in a statement. According to Qantas, this is the fifth time the red-and-white image on the tail of Qantas aircraft has been updated since it was first introduced in 1944. The last update was in 2007 and coincided with the introduction of the Airbus A380 to the Qantas fleet. Before that, the logo was updated in 1984, for the B747-300, and in 1947, for the Lockheed Constellation. The new branding is already showing up the carrier's digital assets, signage and advertising and will roll out on aircraft according to the schedule of re- paints, with a goal of having the entire fleet repainted in time for the airline's centenary in 2020.

The new Melbourne-Perth-London flights will mean a one-hour shorter travel time between Melbourne and London due to a short transit in Perth and the 787-9's slightly faster cruising speed compared to the A380, but will also mean a significant reduction in Qantas's capacity on the route, given the airline's A380s seat 484 passengers, compared to 236 in the 787-9. However, alliance partner Emirates also announced on Thursday that it will operate an all-A380 schedule to Melbourne from March 24, upgrading the last of its thrice-daily flights from the Boeing 777-300ER. Qantas 787-9s will seat 42 business class passengers, 28 in premium economy and 166 in economy, with the 70 business and premium economy seats representing 30 per cent of the cabin, which is the highest percentage of premium seats on board any of Qantas's widebody fleet. Indeed Qantas's A380s seat far more passengers in economy class than its 787s will carry in total. Replacing the four-class A380 with the three-class 787 on Melbourne-London also means Qantas will no longer offer first class on the route. Meanwhile the A380s currently operating Melbourne-Dubai-London will be redeployed \"to meet periods of high demand from Melbourne and Sydney to destinations in Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong\", the airline said. Qantas says Melbourne will become the hub for its first four 787s, with the first two aircraft to operate the QF95/96 Melbourne-Los Angeles route six times weekly from December with the third and fourth aircraft allowing the operation of Melbourne-Perth-London. Consequently Qantas will also be able to offer a one-stop Perth-Melbourne-Los Angeles 787 service, with a 90 minute connection on the outbound leg.

Economy fares would drop below $2,000 during sales periods, according to the airline. Qantas first announced plans to operate nonstop Perth- London flights, using an upgraded Terminal 3 on the domestic side of Perth Airport, in December 2016. \"The Kangaroo Route has kept changing with new technology. It used to take four days and seven stops but now we're able to link Australia and UK in a single hop.

The first scheduled nonstop flights between Australia and Europe, the Perth- London service will take approximately 17 hours, depending on winds, and at 7,829nm will be Qantas's longest and the third longest nonstop scheduled flight in the world. Qantas chief Joyce has previously conceded the operating economics of the airline's flights to London are a \"challenge\". \"London is a challenge because you have over 30 carriers operating on that market and we have extremely low airfares,\" Joyce told the airline's annual general meeting in October 2016. \"That's one of the reasons we are considering an operation like Perth-London. If we can make it work out of Perth that is a way of actually having a very good operation we believe into London.\" London is Qantas's only online destination in Europe, with the rest of the continent largely served via codeshares on its alliance partner Emirates through Dubai. Qantas also has a codeshare in place with fellow oneworld member Finnair for Helsinki, which Emirates does not serve. Once QF9/10 switches to operating via Perth, Melbourne passengers wishing to travel to Dubai, or via Dubai on one-stop flights to European destinations other than London, will still be able to book on Qantas codeshared Emirates flights.

However, alliance partner Emirates also announced on Thursday that it will operate an all-A380 schedule to Melbourne from March 24, upgrading the last of its thrice-daily flights from the Boeing 777-300ER. Qantas 787-9s will seat 42 business class passengers, 28 in premium economy and 166 in economy, with the 70 business and premium economy seats representing 30 per cent of the cabin, which is the highest percentage of premium seats on board any of Qantas's widebody fleet. Indeed Qantas's A380s seat far more passengers in economy class than its 787s will carry in total. Replacing the four-class A380 with the three-class 787 on Melbourne-London also means Qantas will no longer offer first class on the route. Meanwhile the A380s currently operating Melbourne-Dubai-London will be redeployed \"to meet periods of high demand from Melbourne and Sydney to destinations in Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong\", the airline said. Qantas says Melbourne will become the hub for its first four 787s, with the first two aircraft to operate the QF95/96 Melbourne-Los Angeles route six times weekly from December with the third and fourth aircraft allowing the operation of Melbourne-Perth-London. Consequently Qantas will also be able to offer a one-stop Perth-Melbourne-Los Angeles 787 service, with a 90 minute connection on the outbound leg. With tickets going on sale today Qantas has also announced pricings for the routes, with economy fares for the Melbourne-London and Perth-London routes starting from $2,270, Qantas says. Premium economy fares will start from $4,450 between Melbourne and London and from $4,250 between Perth and London, while return business fares will start from $9,890 return between Melbourne and London and from $9,725 between Perth and London. Economy fares would drop below $2,000 during sales periods, according to the airline. Qantas first announced plans to operate nonstop Perth- London flights, using an upgraded Terminal 3 on the domestic side of Perth Airport, in December 2016. \"The Kangaroo Route has kept changing with new technology. It used to take four days and seven stops but now we're able to link Australia and UK in a single hop. It's a level of convenience Australians have never had before,\" Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement on Thursday. \"We're conscious that this is a long flight, but not much longer than our Sydney to Dallas service. It's the kind of route that the Dreamliner was created for, because of its built-in features to reduce jetlag and improve the overall travel experience,\" Joyce said. The first scheduled nonstop flights between Australia and Europe, the Perth- London service will take approximately 17 hours, depending on winds, and at 7,829nm will be Qantas's longest and the third longest nonstop scheduled flight in the world. Qantas chief Joyce has previously conceded the operating economics of the airline's flights to London are a \"challenge\". \"London is a challenge because you have over 30 carriers operating on that market and we have extremely low airfares,\" Joyce told the airline's annual general meeting in October 2016. \"That's one of the reasons we are considering an operation like Perth-London. If we can make it work out of Perth that is a way of actually having a very good operation we believe into London.\" London is Qantas's only online destination in Europe, with the rest of the continent largely served via codeshares on its alliance partner Emirates through Dubai. Qantas also has a codeshare in place with fellow oneworld member Finnair for Helsinki, which Emirates does not serve. Once QF9/10 switches to operating via Perth, Melbourne passengers wishing to travel to Dubai, or via Dubai on one-stop flights to European destinations other than London, will still be able to book on Qantas codeshared Emirates flights. Emirates' plans to upgrade its third daily EK408/409 Dubai-Melbourne flights from the 777-300ER to the A380 adds back 945 seats to the route, an increase of 10 per cent for the Dubai-based airline. Meanwhile, rival Gulf carrier Etihad announced on Wednesday that it is was downguaging capacity on Melbourne- Abu Dhabi, with its EY460/461 A380 flights to be operated by the 777-300ER from October 29, while from the same date the current EY462/463 rotation will see 787-9s replacing the 777-300ER.

The order will allow the airline to add widebody capacity, mainly to replace A330s, and in the words of THY Chairman \u0130lker Ayc\u0131, \"to enhance passenger satisfaction\". The majority of THY 's aircraft are narrowbodies, and this will remain the case. Its global connecting strategy is founded on its proximity to Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and much of central and western Asia, all of which are in narrowbody range of Istanbul. However, analysis of its current fleet plan suggests that a 40 aircraft order will not meet all of its widebody needs into the longer term. This raises the prospect of further orders, with Airbus also likely to be included.

After the paperwork had been signed and a substantial amount of money transferred into Boeing's coffers, it was time for the Australian national airline to finally get its plane. But first, Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner presented Qantas CEO Alan Joyce with a key to the Dreamliner. The polished key came complete with a Boeing 787 keychain and an accompanying jewelry box, fitting for an with airliner with a list price of $270.4 million. Admittedly, the key is purely ceremonial and isn't required to operate the aircraft. Boeing usually reserves the pomp and circumstance of a key presentation for special occasions. For Qantas, this is certainly a special occasion. The new Boeing Dreamliner, one of eight destined to enter the Qantas fleet by the end of 2018, will play a major role in the airline's future international expansion plans. Qantas will use four of the planes, including the one it acquired on Tuesday to launch its new non-stop between Perth, Western Australia, and London. This will be the first non-stop scheduled passenger flight between Australia and Europe. \"One of the big advantages of the Dreamliner is that it gives us a range of destinations we couldn't have done before,\" Joyce told Business Insider in an interview. \"It gives you better economics because it's 20% more fuel efficient and with a lot lower maintenance cost given the new technology. That means there are routes we could have done before with distance, but couldn't do economically that now come onto the radar screen.\" \"For Qantas, it also starts overcoming the tyranny of distance we have,\" Joyce added. After all, the 9,008 mile-long flight will be the third longest scheduled commercial flight in the world, right after Air India's 9,400-mile flight from Delhi to San Francisco and Qatar Airways' 9,032-mile flight from Doha to Auckland, New Zealand.

Over the years, the introduction of sea clippers, jets, and other technological improvements reduced the flying time as well as cost, but it wasn't until the latest technological advances that it was possible to make today's first-ever direct passenger flight. Key to the 9,000 mile non-stop journey is the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, which has been configured to carry 236 passengers and is equipped with sensors to detect and minimize air turbulence, as well as cabin-noise reduction technology.

Economy Class infotainment system Qantas QF9 is the world's third-longest regular commercial route and the longest Dreamliner route. Qantas says the marathon flight involves the study of favorable wind patterns, with different flight paths selected depending on the best winds. For the flight, there were four pilots on board as well as extra cabin crew - allowing them to rest in shifts in a special crew berths. Qantas also says it has employed new methods to make passengers more comfortable on the long haul while reducing the effects of jet lag. Before the flight, special stretching exercise sessions were available at the Perth International Transit Lounge. The cabin air pressure was increased from the equivalent of 8,000 ft to 6,000 ft and special menus were laid on to maintain hydration, help passengers to sleep, and reduce jet lag. The timing of meal services has also been adjusted to help passengers sleep.

Today, history was made as the first non-stop commercial Australia to London regular commercial service, Qantas Flight 9, took off from Perth Airport. At a little before 7:00 pm local time, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner left the terminal with over 200 passengers and 18 crew aboard and is expected to land at London's Heathrow Airport at about 5:00 am on Sunday after a 17-hour, 20-minute flight. In 1935, Qantas and Imperial Airways opened the famous Kangaroo Route between London and Brisbane. The first flights with a handful of passengers took 12 and a half days and 31 stopovers. That may sound arduous, but bear in mind that the only alternative was a six-week voyage by steamship. Over the years, the introduction of sea clippers, jets, and other technological improvements reduced the flying time as well as cost, but it wasn't until the latest technological advances that it was possible to make today's first-ever direct passenger flight. Key to the 9,000 mile non-stop journey is the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, which has been configured to carry 236 passengers and is equipped with sensors to detect and minimize air turbulence, as well as cabin-noise reduction technology. It can carry 92 tonnes of jet fuel for its two GEnx engines and, due in part to extensive use of composites, is claimed to be 20 percent more efficient than any other plane of its size. Economy Class infotainment system Qantas QF9 is the world's third-longest regular commercial route and the longest Dreamliner route. Qantas says the marathon flight involves the study of favorable wind patterns, with different flight paths selected depending on the best winds. For the flight, there were four pilots on board as well as extra cabin crew - allowing them to rest in shifts in a special crew berths. Qantas also says it has employed new methods to make passengers more comfortable on the long haul while reducing the effects of jet lag. Before the flight, special stretching exercise sessions were available at the Perth International Transit Lounge. The cabin air pressure was increased from the equivalent of 8,000 ft to 6,000 ft and special menus were laid on to maintain hydration, help passengers to sleep, and reduce jet lag. The timing of meal services has also been adjusted to help passengers sleep. The aircraft is named \"Emily\" after the indigenous Australian artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye, and its livery is inspired by her works. A GEnx engine at GE Aviation's jet engine testing facility in Peebles, Ohio GE/ Tomas Kellner \"This is a truly historic flight that opens up a new era of travel. For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link,\" says Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce, who is on the flight. \"The original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947.

This move is part of United's push to replace its last-generation fleet of widebodies and dramatically bring down the current fleet age. Presently, United operates a fleet of twenty-five 787-9s and 12 smaller 787-8s. These are used on a range of routes including the transcontinental US coast to coat lines. United have been forthcoming in telling investors it intends to expand this fleet. But is this move a safety- net measure, to fill existing demand or do United have growth in mind? Untied's latest Boeing order: On Monday, United told us it has just ordered nine more 787-9 Dreamliners. These are earmarked to replace its existing, operational models such as the Boeing 767-400ER and 777-200. This means, its total order with Boeing for the 787s is now, 14 Dreamliner 787-10s and nine 787-9s. It is presumed the 787-9s will be part of the replacement drive. The 787-10s however are part of a subtle expansion. In January of next year, the airline plans to become the first North American airline to fly the largest Dreamliner the 787-10, transcontinental. These 787-10s will join United's fleet flying its \"Premium transcontinental service\" from Newark to California. As the Dash 10 is essentially a stretched out version of the shorter 787-8 and 787-9, it has several advantages. It offers more seats, better fuel efficiency per passenger and of course more of that revenue generating cargo. So United won't have to add routes or slots to get increased passenger numbers and revenue. More revenue over the same slots: However, although larger than the -9 and -8 Dreamliners, the -10s have a shorter maximum flight range. This is to be expected, being the same plane, just heavier, with more passengers and cargo.

The 787-9s make up the mainstay of United's service and fleet. United has a fleet of around 50 Boeing widebodies. And they are very well used. However, they are also the oldest model United flies.

According to Boeing's list prices, the firm order will come in at $2.53 billion. But when you're talking 2+ billion dollars, for buyers like United, there will be some wiggle room. The Puget Sound Business Journal claims this could be a discount of up to 50 percent. And this figure is supported by the jet valuation firm Avitas.

Ltd. is scheduled to receive its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner this September, making it the first Chinese private airline to receive a widebody, long-haul jet airliner. Juneyao Airlines recently unveiled the livery plan for its 787 fleet. Juneyao Airlines' first Boeing 787 aircraft will be delivered with a colorful Chinese peony-themed livery. Peony, the national flower of China, is synonymous with grace and elegance and reflects the Chinese airline's brand and vision for itself in terms of upcoming plans for development. The new design is meant to depict the airline's hope and expectations for a peaceful, powerful and prosperous China. The aircraft, together with Juneyao Airlines' painted fleet of Airbus A320, which received the livery in preparation for the carrier's recent celebration of its 10th anniversary, also served as an announcement of the airline entering a new era, whereby it is operating with both Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The airline will continue with the Chinese Red livery, the color that is representative of China and of promise for the future and that was applied in the A320/1 series, and extend it to the Boeing 787 to showcase that promise around the world. In addition, the Chinese Ribbon livery design, which outrivaled other proposals in a public livery competition, will be used on the Boeing 787, demonstrating Juneyao Airlines' support for the direction that China is taking and its dedication in contributing to the country's One Belt, One Road initiative. Juneyao Airlines is also taking the lead when it comes to the design and configuration of the cabins in the Boeing 787. The Business Class section has been fitted with 180-degree lie-flat Thompson Vantage XL seats, each with a 42-inch pitch and arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration. Economy Class features Recaro CL3710 nine-way adjustable headrests and seats equipped with warm, fantasy lighting, in-flight HD entertainment systems with 12-inch screens, standalone USB interfaces, and other facilities allowing passengers to feel pampered during their flight. According to the delivery schedule announced by the airline and the aircraft manufacturer, Juneyao's first Boeing 787-9 will arrive at Boeing's general assembly line on August 8, and, during the month of September, be put through paintings and trial flights. Final delivery will take place in late September or early October. The airline expects to take delivery of three painted 787 planes between now and the end of the year. At first, the planes will service some key domestic routes before being transitioned to the airline's first grouping of long-haul, intercontinental routes. Juneyao Airlines, a subsidiary of Shanghai Juneyao Co. Ltd., is one of the airlines to emerge after China's aviation industry started to grow rapidly on the heels of the rollout of China's reform and opening-up policy. Shanghai Juneyao took the lead in expanding into the industry via charter flight operations. In 2006, Shanghai Juneyao made its first foray into the aviation sector when Juneyao Airlines successfully completed its maiden flight. By mid-2018, Juneyao Airlines was operating 68 single-aisle A320 planes. Last year, the airline placed an order for 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, in a move to meet the needs of its rapidly growing international network. Juneyao Airlines is committed to furnishing best of class aviation services by providing passengers with high-quality, friendly services and conveying its brand philosophy of happiness, good fortune and Chinese culture to more passengers.

This move is part of United's push to replace its last-generation fleet of widebodies and dramatically bring down the current fleet age.

So the Dash 10 as United say, can do \"up to 6,430 nautical miles.\" And while this isn't an issue on the coast-to-coast route, it does this throw light on the importance of the additional order of 787-9s. The 787-9s make up the mainstay of United's service and fleet. United has a fleet of around 50 Boeing widebodies. And they are very well used. However, they are also the oldest model United flies. According to Airfleets.net, United's 787-9s have an average age of about 21 years. Bearing this in mind, the new order doesn't necessarily mean United are looking to expand but it certainly intends to expand its 787-9 fleet. The aircraft has served United well and the airline are smart to get their orders in now. Safeguarding their future operational capacity. What did United pay for its new 787-9s? According to Boeing's list prices, the firm order will come in at $2.53 billion. But when you're talking 2+ billion dollars, for buyers like United, there will be some wiggle room. The Puget Sound Business Journal claims this could be a discount of up to 50 percent. And this figure is supported by the jet valuation firm Avitas. It puts the real value of this deal at about $1.3 billion. Still, hardly loose change for the airline. All in all, By the start of the new year, United will have 40 787s in operation and 24 on order.

The aircraft, featuring a new, Polynesia-themed livery, is due to enter service in November. This is the first Boeing airplane to join the Tahitian airline, which plans to use the longest-range Dreamliner to replace its current fleet of five A340s and connect its home base in the South Pacific with destinations like Paris, Tokyo and Los Angeles. Air Tahiti Nui has configured the aircraft to seat 294 passengers in three classes, compared with two classes on its five existing A340s. The cabin features a new business class equipped with 30 full lie-flat seats, along with 32 premium economy seats. Business Class seating is supplied by Rockwell Collins; all other seats are from Zodiac Aerospace. The airline announced in 2015 it would lease two 787s through ALC and purchase two 787s directly from Boeing as part of its plan to upgrade its fleet for the future. The aircraft will be powered by GEnx engines. All the aircraft are scheduled for delivery by September 2019.

So what does this mean for travellers? Etihad currently has 21 Dreamliners in its fleet, which it configures in two different layouts, one of which has three classes and the other just two. So first, the bad news - the aircraft taking over both these routes are the two-class variant, meaning there won't be a first class seating option. The aircraft instead offers 28 of its fully flat, direct aisle access Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart seats. The good news is that the Dreamliner is a newer aircraft than the B777-300ER and the Airbus A330-200 that currently fly Etihad's Kuala Lumpur and Brussels routes respectively, and is popular among travellers for its ability to offer a more comfortable passenger experience. And as Kamark added: \"Our customers can expect the quietest cabins and our latest in-flight products and technology, on one of the world's most technologically advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft.\" Business class passengers can also expect service from on-board food and beverage managers.

Norwegian Air, for example, used some of its eighteen 737 MAXs for transatlantic flights from the US and Canadian East Coast to Ireland, Britain and Norway. How will Norwegian replace these aircraft? For now, Norwegian has come up with an ingenious, if temporary solution. The airline says that to minimize inconvenience from its suspended 737 MAX operations, Norwegian will operate a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft on a temporary, daily basis from Stewart International Airport in New York to Dublin Airport. The big Dreamliner will provide service to customers scheduled to fly from either Providence's T.F. Green Airport in Rhode Island or from Stewart to Dublin. In a way, Norwegian is a victim of its own success, as thousands of passengers have taken advantage of sale prices to Ireland. Last week, flights to Ireland from PVD and SWF started at $99 one-way. The good news for Norwegian customers who've bought tickets to Ireland is that not only will they still be able to go, they will be traveling in style on a much larger aircraft. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner has 338 seats; Norwegian's Boeing 737 MAX has 189. The bad news? If you were scheduled to depart from Providence, Norwegian will put you on a bus from T.F. Green Airport to Stewart Airport, a four-hour journey. Norwegian, aware that the situation is less than optimal, vows to keep in touch with customers via SMS, the Norwegian website and customer care. \"Norwegian would like to apologize to customers affected by this extraordinary situation as we remain committed to ensuring our passengers can continue to travel on Norwegian's network.\" To learn how the company is addressing the situation, Forbes.com spoke with Anders Lindstr\u00f6m, Norwegian's Director of Communications, North America. So Norwegian is deploying a 787 as cover for transatlantic flights normally flown by the 737 MAX. Has Norwegian finally gotten all of its 787s back from the last problem, inspections of the Rolls-Royce engines? Or are you still flying leased aircraft to cover for those aircraft? Yes, we have gotten all our Dreamliners back. We have no wetleases in operation since early January 2019. No doubt the 787 can cover a couple of 737 MAX flights a day, but what are Norwegian's plans to cover all eighteen 737s you had to take out of service? Most MAXes operate within Europe. By consolidating certain flights, we will be able to cover most of them. In regards to MAX routes to the United States, there are currently only a few operating during the winter season, which ends March 30. Two of those routes, from Providence and Stewart to Dublin, have within 24 hours been recovered and substituted by the Boeing 787 that can handle all those customers. The only route that Norwegian is currently not covering is Stewart to Edinburgh, but we are rebooking affected customers to other routes. How did Norwegian happen to have an extra Dreamliner lying around? We have a spare Dreamliner for a short period of time ahead of the summer schedule, which is why we so quickly could deploy it on the Stewart-Dublin route. Usually we do not, so we are now maximizing our fleet. Will any flights be cancelled? Very few flights will be cancelled during this extraordinary situation but our Network team has worked exceptionally hard the last few days to ensure most affected flights are being covered by other aircraft models. Right now our full focus is on taking care of our customers and ensuring we get them to their destination as quickly as possible, which we now are able to do with the Dreamliner in place. How about revenue? Will any be lost? We do not comment on revenue at the moment, beyond our CEO Bjorn Kos saying earlier we will ask Boeing for compensation. CNN quoted Norwegian CEO Kos as saying \"We will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily...We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.\" Is there any particular form such financial relief might take, in terms of cash payments to Norwegian or better lease/payment terms on aircraft orders? It's too early to tell. Since no one knows how long the investigation will take, what are Norwegian's contingency plans to replace lift capacity for the upcoming peak spring and summer seasons? It's unfortunately a little too early to tell at this stage, but we are and will continue to be looking at various scenarios to minimize any potential disruption. Will Norwegian competitors operating Airbus equipment have a competitive advantage while the MAX aircraft are out of service? Or has the shakeout in the transatlantic market made the market less competitive? Norwegian continues to be highly competitive. We have faced similar issues in the past and come back quickly from them, only getting stronger each time. The MAX aircraft only covers a very small portion of our overall network of more than 500 routes and 160+ aircraft. Norwegian was originally going to buy 110 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Is Norwegian still taking deliveries of the plane, or are deliveries delayed until the problems are solved? We cannot comment on this at this stage. CEO Kos portrayed the MAX aircraft as integral to Norwegian's plans for low- cost routes when planes first arrived in 2017. What effect will their grounding have on Norwegian's growth? The MAX is primarily to replace our existing 737-800 fleet, of which we have around 120. Norwegian already has one of the most modern fleets in the world, with an average fleet age of only 3.8 years. Only a few MAX were placed on transatlantic routes, whereas most are to fly within Europe. Therefore it will not have much effect on Norwegian's growth plan, which has predominantly been with the 787 Dreamliner, including four new routes in the next few months. Is the fact that Norwegian is now more focused on consolidation than growth actually helpful in this situation, as there's less need for aircraft? It will be. Norwegian has been the fastest-growing airline for several years, but hit a peak of our growth strategy last year and now it's leveling out. There will still be growth, but on a much smaller scale, which will benefit us in this extraordinary situation.

Has Norwegian finally gotten all of its 787s back from the last problem, inspections of the Rolls-Royce engines? Or are you still flying leased aircraft to cover for those aircraft? Yes, we have gotten all our Dreamliners back. We have no wetleases in operation since early January 2019. No doubt the 787 can cover a couple of 737 MAX flights a day, but what are Norwegian's plans to cover all eighteen 737s you had to take out of service? Most MAXes operate within Europe. By consolidating certain flights, we will be able to cover most of them. In regards to MAX routes to the United States, there are currently only a few operating during the winter season, which ends March 30. Two of those routes, from Providence and Stewart to Dublin, have within 24 hours been recovered and substituted by the Boeing 787 that can handle all those customers. The only route that Norwegian is currently not covering is Stewart to Edinburgh, but we are rebooking affected customers to other routes. How did Norwegian happen to have an extra Dreamliner lying around? We have a spare Dreamliner for a short period of time ahead of the summer schedule, which is why we so quickly could deploy it on the Stewart-Dublin route. Usually we do not, so we are now maximizing our fleet. Will any flights be cancelled? Very few flights will be cancelled during this extraordinary situation but our Network team has worked exceptionally hard the last few days to ensure most affected flights are being covered by other aircraft models. Right now our full focus is on taking care of our customers and ensuring we get them to their destination as quickly as possible, which we now are able to do with the Dreamliner in place. How about revenue? Will any be lost? We do not comment on revenue at the moment, beyond our CEO Bjorn Kos saying earlier we will ask Boeing for compensation. CNN quoted Norwegian CEO Kos as saying \"We will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily...We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.\" Is there any particular form such financial relief might take, in terms of cash payments to Norwegian or better lease/payment terms on aircraft orders? It's too early to tell. Since no one knows how long the investigation will take, what are Norwegian's contingency plans to replace lift capacity for the upcoming peak spring and summer seasons? It's unfortunately a little too early to tell at this stage, but we are and will continue to be looking at various scenarios to minimize any potential disruption. Will Norwegian competitors operating Airbus equipment have a competitive advantage while the MAX aircraft are out of service? Or has the shakeout in the transatlantic market made the market less competitive? Norwegian continues to be highly competitive. We have faced similar issues in the past and come back quickly from them, only getting stronger each time. The MAX aircraft only covers a very small portion of our overall network of more than 500 routes and 160+ aircraft. Norwegian was originally going to buy 110 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Is Norwegian still taking deliveries of the plane, or are deliveries delayed until the problems are solved? We cannot comment on this at this stage. CEO Kos portrayed the MAX aircraft as integral to Norwegian's plans for low- cost routes when planes first arrived in 2017. What effect will their grounding have on Norwegian's growth? The MAX is primarily to replace our existing 737-800 fleet, of which we have around 120. Norwegian already has one of the most modern fleets in the world, with an average fleet age of only 3.8 years. Only a few MAX were placed on transatlantic routes, whereas most are to fly within Europe. Therefore it will not have much effect on Norwegian's growth plan, which has predominantly been with the 787 Dreamliner, including four new routes in the next few months. Is the fact that Norwegian is now more focused on consolidation than growth actually helpful in this situation, as there's less need for aircraft? It will be. Norwegian has been the fastest-growing airline for several years, but hit a peak of our growth strategy last year and now it's leveling out. There will still be growth, but on a much smaller scale, which will benefit us in this extraordinary situation.

He said that this adds to EgyptAir's competitive advantage in operating this line, as this Dreamliner model has the technology, comfort and luxury to make the journey more enjoyable for passengers. This third Dreamliner aircraft comes as part of the largest deal in EgyptAir's history, dubbed the \"Deal of the Century\" by aviation experts as it includes the purchase of 45 new aircraft from the latest worldwide models worth US$6 billion, such as six Boeing Dreamliner 787-9. EgyptAir's has now received three aircraft, which comes in preparation to join the company's fleet to work on long lines such as Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, Bangkok and Frankfurt. The Dreamliner is capable of traveling between 14,800 to 15,700 km non-stop and has 20 percent less fuel consumption than its counterparts in commercial aircraft. The Boeing 787 Dreamliners are powered by Rolls Royce engines to fly over long distances. Its capacity ranges between 210 to 330 passengers. EgyptAir announced earlier that from July 2019 to May 2020, it would receive 12 Airbus 220/300 aircraft, which were produced by Bombardier of Canada before being acquired by Airbus. In January 2020, the company will start receiving 15 Airbus A320, the latest and most advanced Airbus A320 to date, and another 12 Airbus 220/300 aircraft. This deal will update 50 percent of the size of the fleet, the company said, adding that the second phase of fleet upgrades will be from 2019 to 2027. EgyptAir's network extends to more than 70 destinations in nearly 60 countries around the world to meet the needs of all customers, and it joined the Star Alliance in July 2008, and became the 21st member of the alliance which currently includes 27 airlines from the largest companies around the world.", "url": "https://egyptindependent.com/egyptairs-third-dreamliner-aircraft-arrives-at-cairo-airport/"}, {"title": "Korean Air commits to order 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliner", "date": "2019-06-18", "content": "Korean Air plans to add a total of 30 new 787 Dreamliner airplanes to its fleet.

Norwegian Air, for example, used some of its eighteen 737 MAXs for transatlantic flights from the US and Canadian East Coast to Ireland, Britain and Norway. How will Norwegian replace these aircraft? For now, Norwegian has come up with an ingenious, if temporary solution. The airline says that to minimize inconvenience from its suspended 737 MAX operations, Norwegian will operate a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft on a temporary, daily basis from Stewart International Airport in New York to Dublin Airport. The big Dreamliner will provide service to customers scheduled to fly from either Providence's T.F. Green Airport in Rhode Island or from Stewart to Dublin. In a way, Norwegian is a victim of its own success, as thousands of passengers have taken advantage of sale prices to Ireland. Last week, flights to Ireland from PVD and SWF started at $99 one-way. The good news for Norwegian customers who've bought tickets to Ireland is that not only will they still be able to go, they will be traveling in style on a much larger aircraft. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner has 338 seats; Norwegian's Boeing 737 MAX has 189. The bad news? If you were scheduled to depart from Providence, Norwegian will put you on a bus from T.F. Green Airport to Stewart Airport, a four-hour journey. Norwegian, aware that the situation is less than optimal, vows to keep in touch with customers via SMS, the Norwegian website and customer care. \"Norwegian would like to apologize to customers affected by this extraordinary situation as we remain committed to ensuring our passengers can continue to travel on Norwegian's network.\" To learn how the company is addressing the situation, Forbes.com spoke with Anders Lindstr\u00f6m, Norwegian's Director of Communications, North America. So Norwegian is deploying a 787 as cover for transatlantic flights normally flown by the 737 MAX. Has Norwegian finally gotten all of its 787s back from the last problem, inspections of the Rolls-Royce engines? Or are you still flying leased aircraft to cover for those aircraft? Yes, we have gotten all our Dreamliners back. We have no wetleases in operation since early January 2019. No doubt the 787 can cover a couple of 737 MAX flights a day, but what are Norwegian's plans to cover all eighteen 737s you had to take out of service? Most MAXes operate within Europe. By consolidating certain flights, we will be able to cover most of them. In regards to MAX routes to the United States, there are currently only a few operating during the winter season, which ends March 30. Two of those routes, from Providence and Stewart to Dublin, have within 24 hours been recovered and substituted by the Boeing 787 that can handle all those customers. The only route that Norwegian is currently not covering is Stewart to Edinburgh, but we are rebooking affected customers to other routes. How did Norwegian happen to have an extra Dreamliner lying around? We have a spare Dreamliner for a short period of time ahead of the summer schedule, which is why we so quickly could deploy it on the Stewart-Dublin route. Usually we do not, so we are now maximizing our fleet. Will any flights be cancelled? Very few flights will be cancelled during this extraordinary situation but our Network team has worked exceptionally hard the last few days to ensure most affected flights are being covered by other aircraft models. Right now our full focus is on taking care of our customers and ensuring we get them to their destination as quickly as possible, which we now are able to do with the Dreamliner in place. How about revenue? Will any be lost? We do not comment on revenue at the moment, beyond our CEO Bjorn Kos saying earlier we will ask Boeing for compensation. CNN quoted Norwegian CEO Kos as saying \"We will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily...We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.\" Is there any particular form such financial relief might take, in terms of cash payments to Norwegian or better lease/payment terms on aircraft orders? It's too early to tell. Since no one knows how long the investigation will take, what are Norwegian's contingency plans to replace lift capacity for the upcoming peak spring and summer seasons? It's unfortunately a little too early to tell at this stage, but we are and will continue to be looking at various scenarios to minimize any potential disruption. Will Norwegian competitors operating Airbus equipment have a competitive advantage while the MAX aircraft are out of service? Or has the shakeout in the transatlantic market made the market less competitive? Norwegian continues to be highly competitive. We have faced similar issues in the past and come back quickly from them, only getting stronger each time. The MAX aircraft only covers a very small portion of our overall network of more than 500 routes and 160+ aircraft. Norwegian was originally going to buy 110 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Is Norwegian still taking deliveries of the plane, or are deliveries delayed until the problems are solved? We cannot comment on this at this stage. CEO Kos portrayed the MAX aircraft as integral to Norwegian's plans for low- cost routes when planes first arrived in 2017. What effect will their grounding have on Norwegian's growth? The MAX is primarily to replace our existing 737-800 fleet, of which we have around 120. Norwegian already has one of the most modern fleets in the world, with an average fleet age of only 3.8 years. Only a few MAX were placed on transatlantic routes, whereas most are to fly within Europe. Therefore it will not have much effect on Norwegian's growth plan, which has predominantly been with the 787 Dreamliner, including four new routes in the next few months. Is the fact that Norwegian is now more focused on consolidation than growth actually helpful in this situation, as there's less need for aircraft? It will be. Norwegian has been the fastest-growing airline for several years, but hit a peak of our growth strategy last year and now it's leveling out. There will still be growth, but on a much smaller scale, which will benefit us in this extraordinary situation.

Emirates' Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury announced a $16 billion order from the airline for 50 Airbus A350-XWB 900 aircraft at the beginning of the air show. Emirates later finalised a last-minute order worth almost $9 billion for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. Emirates' agreements follow a strategic review of its fleet requirements after Airbus in February announced that the production line for the double-decker A380, also known as the Superjumbo, would end in 2021. Emirates is the largest operator of the A380 Superjumbo, with 112 of the jets in service and 11 on order. Emirates had wanted to expand its fleet of the A380 with an upgraded version but Airbus and engine-maker Rolls Royce have seen international orders for the A380 collapse and were no longer recuperating production costs despite the plane's estimated $450 million price tag. The A380 struggled to prove its long-term commercial viability as the hub-and- spoke model it was supposed to uniquely serve in which passengers are flown to a central hub and then onward on subsequent flights did not thrive at the industry level the way Airbus had predicated. While the hub-and-spoke has worked well for Emirates and the A380 became integral to its fleet and long- haul operations, most international airlines opted for the point-to-point model, which flies customers to their destination in one flight. The efficiency of fewer flights, more flexibility and lower upfront costs have made smaller widebody twin jets, which also offer more competitive range and fuel efficiency than used to be the case, more appealing than very large aircraft options such as the A380, despite the low costs per passenger they offer. The deal between Emirates and Airbus supersedes an agreement by Emirates in February for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s after Airbus requested it to drop most of its outstanding orders for the A380. The Airbus A350-900 variant order by Emirates is a long-range, extra-wide- body, twin-engine plane, which comes with a price tag of more than $300 million. This is Airbus's first aircraft manufactured with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. With more than 70% of its airframe made from advanced materials combining composites, titanium and advanced aluminium alloys, the A350-900 offers a flying range of more than 8,000 nautical miles, enough to fly between Dubai and London 2.5 times without refuelling. Emirates completed an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at list prices, with a value of $8.8 billion and deliveries to commence in 2023. As part of the deal, Emirates will reduce its order of the delayed 777Xs, which it ordered in 2014 and is set to become the launch customer for next year, from 150 to 126. Emirates will now purchase 126 Boeing 777X aircraft and 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, orders with a combined value of $56 billion. Talks on the 787 Dreamliner had been in the works for two years between Emirates and Boeing but were delayed by uncertainty over the future of the A380 and delays with the 777X given the effect those issues would have on its long-term fleet planning. The first deliveries of 777X have faced delays over durability issues around its General Electric-produced engines. Having reduced its 777X order, Emirates opted for the smaller 787-9 version of the Dreamliner as opposed to the larger 787-10 version it was considering, a move that opens new potential across its routes with more modest passenger flows and because it can enable greater flight frequencies on existing routes. Until now Emirates' fleet was entirely composed of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 - it was the world's largest operator of both jets - but the airline is adapting to industry conditions and slowing international demand for travel with more flexibility by acquiring the Airbus A350-900s and the Boeing 787-9. One of few in the world that only operate a wide-body fleet, Emirates' meteoric rise established it as the world's largest long-haul carrier with a fleet of 234 jets. Conceived in March 1985 with backing from Dubai's royal family and support from Pakistan International Airlines, which leased it two planes, Emirates operates more than 3,600 flights every week from its hub at Dubai International Airport across a network spanning 85 countries and 161 destinations. Airbus closed the Dubai Air Show having netted around $38 billion in new plane orders while Boeing booked orders of approximately $17 billion, including for its still-grounded 737 Max. As orders in Dubai and elsewhere reflect, low-cost travel is one of the more robustly growing sectors in a subdued international travel market. Despite the travel market outlook and its new challenges, however, Emirates remains among a handful of international airlines with the capitalisation and ambition to place orders such those it did during the air show. Next year, Dubai is hosting Expo 2020, which is expected to bring up to 25 million visitors to the emirate.

The Asian carrier has approved a budget of $6.3 billion to spend on 10 787-9 and 10 787-10 Dreamliner planes. A further 10 Dreamliner aircraft are to be leased at a cost of $3.4 billion. The figures quoted are based on Boeing's commercial list pricing and a discount can be expected. Confirmation of the purchase came after the close of Thursday trade in the South Korean Kospi index. The deal was first announced in June at the Paris Air Show but has now been signed off by the board of Korean Air, according to Reuters. The investment will be made between now and 2025. Boeing's Dreamliner series, or 787, is a long-haul wide-body commercial plane that can seat up to 335 passengers. First introduced in 2011, the plane was considered a step up for fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort. At present Boeing has delivered 859 of its 1,441 Dreamliner orders. Korean Air Chairman Walter Cho has previously said the aircraft will become the \"backbone\" of the airline's mid and long-haul fleet strategy and will replace its existing Boeing 777s, 747s and its Airbus A330s. Korean Air wants to modernize its fleet to save on fuel costs and quell criticism that its planes are particularly bad for the environment. Research from the Transition Pathway Initiative in March this year identified the firm as the worst- performing major airline for emitting carbon particles into the atmosphere. In a ranking of 20 airlines, stretching back to 2014, TPI found that Korean Air flights emitted between 170 and 200 grams of CO2 per passenger-kilometer. By comparison Delta, Southwest and Qantas were calculated as closer to 100 grams of CO2 per passenger-kilometer.

Comprising ten 787-10s and ten 787-9s, the deal was announced as part of the Paris Air Show last month and is valued at $6.3bn according to list prices. Besides an agreement to lease ten additional 787-10 aircraft from Air Lease Corporation, Korean Air will quadruple its Dreamliner fleet due to the demand for the jet's efficiency and passenger comforts. The recent addition of the 787-10 to its long-haul fleet will complement Korean Air's existing 787-9 and 777 aircraft. As the largest member of the Dreamliner family, the 224ft-long 787-10 can accommodate up to 330 passengers in a standard two-class configuration, approximately 40 more than the 787-9 jet. Powered by advanced technologies and a revolutionary design, the 787-10 operates at a reduced cost. Korean Air chairman Walter Cho said: \"As we continue to innovate our product offering, the 787 Dreamliner family will become the backbone of our mid-and long-haul fleet for many years to come. \"In addition to 25% improved fuel efficiency, the stretched 787-10 offers around 15% more space for passengers and cargo than our 787-9s, which will be critical to our long-term business goals.\" The airliner plans to commission the 787-10 on medium-range routes and continues to enhance the longer-range capabilities of the 787-9 Dreamliner on long-haul flights. Boeing commercial sales and marketing senior vice-president Ihssane Mounir said: \"With the 747-8, 777 and now the 787 Dreamliner family, Korean Air operates one of the most efficient and comprehensive widebody fleets in the world.\" Korean Air's aerospace division is a key partner of Boeing on the latter's 747-8 and 787 programmes.

A statement by EgyptAir, said that prior to receiving the plane the company's technical, commercial, engineering, financial and legal delegation reviewed the procedures and the specifications contracted by the company. The delegation also visited the Boeing Everett factory, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, and observed all the procedures taken by the factory to manufacture and deliver the aircraft. EgyptAir has now received all its Dreamliner aircrafts. The Chairman of the EgyptAir Holding Company Ahmed Adel previously said that the new Dreamliner model has the technology, comfort and luxury to make journeys more enjoyable for passengers. EgyptAir contracted Boeing for the purchase of six aircrafts of the same model as part of the company's fleet modernization plan. This sixth Dreamliner aircraft comes as part of the largest deal in EgyptAir's history, dubbed the \"deal of the century\" by aviation experts as it includes the purchase of 45 new aircrafts of the latest worldwide models worth US$6 billion, such as six Boeing Dreamliner 787-9. The Dreamliner is capable of traveling between 14,800 to 15,700 km non-stop and has 20 percent less fuel consumption than its counterparts in commercial aircraft. The Boeing 787 Dreamliners are powered by Rolls Royce engines to fly over long distances. Its capacity ranges between 210 to 330 passengers. EgyptAir also announced earlier that from July 2019 to May 2020, it would receive 12 Airbus 220/300 aircraft, which were produced by Bombardier of Canada before being acquired by Airbus. In January 2020, the company will start receiving 15 Airbus A320, the latest and most advanced Airbus A320 to date, and another 12 Airbus 220/300 aircraft. This deal will update 50 percent of the size of the fleet, the company said, adding that the second phase of fleet upgrades will be from 2019 to 2027.

Boeing said the newly delivered airplane carries a special logo \"100th 787 for China\" on its nose to mark this new milestone. \"We are honored to take delivery of this special airplane,\" said Wang Junjin, chairman of Juneyao Airlines, a Shanghai-based private carrier, at the delivery ceremony in Seattle, Washington state. \"Since we received the first airplane one year ago, our 787 fleet has continued to earn profit. The Dreamliner is playing a more and more important role in our fleet and becoming one of our workhorses,\" he said. Juneyao Airlines, which has ordered 10 787-9 Dreamliners, is currently operating a fleet of five of the airplanes on international and domestic routes. \"Today marks another major milestone of our relationship with China's airline industry,\" said Peter Gao, vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing for China at Boeing. Boeing is updating the capability of a 787 simulator located at its Shanghai training campus to better support Chinese 787 operators, Gao said.

Emirates' Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury announced a $16 billion order from the airline for 50 Airbus A350-XWB 900 aircraft at the beginning of the air show. Emirates later finalised a last-minute order worth almost $9 billion for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. Emirates' agreements follow a strategic review of its fleet requirements after Airbus in February announced that the production line for the double-decker A380, also known as the Superjumbo, would end in 2021. Emirates is the largest operator of the A380 Superjumbo, with 112 of the jets in service and 11 on order. Emirates had wanted to expand its fleet of the A380 with an upgraded version but Airbus and engine-maker Rolls Royce have seen international orders for the A380 collapse and were no longer recuperating production costs despite the plane's estimated $450 million price tag. The A380 struggled to prove its long-term commercial viability as the hub-and- spoke model it was supposed to uniquely serve in which passengers are flown to a central hub and then onward on subsequent flights did not thrive at the industry level the way Airbus had predicated. While the hub-and-spoke has worked well for Emirates and the A380 became integral to its fleet and long- haul operations, most international airlines opted for the point-to-point model, which flies customers to their destination in one flight. The efficiency of fewer flights, more flexibility and lower upfront costs have made smaller widebody twin jets, which also offer more competitive range and fuel efficiency than used to be the case, more appealing than very large aircraft options such as the A380, despite the low costs per passenger they offer. The deal between Emirates and Airbus supersedes an agreement by Emirates in February for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s after Airbus requested it to drop most of its outstanding orders for the A380. The Airbus A350-900 variant order by Emirates is a long-range, extra-wide- body, twin-engine plane, which comes with a price tag of more than $300 million. This is Airbus's first aircraft manufactured with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. With more than 70% of its airframe made from advanced materials combining composites, titanium and advanced aluminium alloys, the A350-900 offers a flying range of more than 8,000 nautical miles, enough to fly between Dubai and London 2.5 times without refuelling. Emirates completed an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at list prices, with a value of $8.8 billion and deliveries to commence in 2023. As part of the deal, Emirates will reduce its order of the delayed 777Xs, which it ordered in 2014 and is set to become the launch customer for next year, from 150 to 126. Emirates will now purchase 126 Boeing 777X aircraft and 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, orders with a combined value of $56 billion. Talks on the 787 Dreamliner had been in the works for two years between Emirates and Boeing but were delayed by uncertainty over the future of the A380 and delays with the 777X given the effect those issues would have on its long-term fleet planning. The first deliveries of 777X have faced delays over durability issues around its General Electric-produced engines.

Vistara would likely not step on anyone's toes but look for opportunities to codeshare, perhaps to London with British Airways. Another possibility is partnering with Japan Airlines to operate routes to Tokyo. Currently only ANA operates routes from Tokyo to Mumbai.

Boeing said the newly delivered airplane carries a special logo \"100th 787 for China\" on its nose to mark this new milestone. \"We are honored to take delivery of this special airplane,\" said Wang Junjin, chairman of Juneyao Airlines, a Shanghai-based private carrier, at the delivery ceremony in Seattle, Washington state. \"Since we received the first airplane one year ago, our 787 fleet has continued to earn profit.

Juneyao Airlines, which has ordered 10 787-9 Dreamliners, is currently operating a fleet of five of the airplanes on international and domestic routes. \"Today marks another major milestone of our relationship with China's airline industry,\" said Peter Gao, vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing for China at Boeing. Boeing is updating the capability of a 787 simulator located at its Shanghai training campus to better support Chinese 787 operators, Gao said. Among the 10 longest routes operated by Chinese carriers including the national flag carrier Air China, Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines, three are flown by the Boeing 777 while seven by the 787 on flights from China to destinations in the U.S. cities of New York and Los Angeles.

Emirates' Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury announced a $16 billion order from the airline for 50 Airbus A350-XWB 900 aircraft at the beginning of the air show. Emirates later finalised a last-minute order worth almost $9 billion for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. Emirates' agreements follow a strategic review of its fleet requirements after Airbus in February announced that the production line for the double-decker A380, also known as the Superjumbo, would end in 2021. Emirates is the largest operator of the A380 Superjumbo, with 112 of the jets in service and 11 on order. Emirates had wanted to expand its fleet of the A380 with an upgraded version but Airbus and engine-maker Rolls Royce have seen international orders for the A380 collapse and were no longer recuperating production costs despite the plane's estimated $450 million price tag. The A380 struggled to prove its long-term commercial viability as the hub-and- spoke model it was supposed to uniquely serve in which passengers are flown to a central hub and then onward on subsequent flights did not thrive at the industry level the way Airbus had predicated. While the hub-and-spoke has worked well for Emirates and the A380 became integral to its fleet and long- haul operations, most international airlines opted for the point-to-point model, which flies customers to their destination in one flight. The efficiency of fewer flights, more flexibility and lower upfront costs have made smaller widebody twin jets, which also offer more competitive range and fuel efficiency than used to be the case, more appealing than very large aircraft options such as the A380, despite the low costs per passenger they offer. The deal between Emirates and Airbus supersedes an agreement by Emirates in February for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s after Airbus requested it to drop most of its outstanding orders for the A380. The Airbus A350-900 variant order by Emirates is a long-range, extra-wide- body, twin-engine plane, which comes with a price tag of more than $300 million. This is Airbus's first aircraft manufactured with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. With more than 70% of its airframe made from advanced materials combining composites, titanium and advanced aluminium alloys, the A350-900 offers a flying range of more than 8,000 nautical miles, enough to fly between Dubai and London 2.5 times without refuelling. Emirates completed an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at list prices, with a value of $8.8 billion and deliveries to commence in 2023. As part of the deal, Emirates will reduce its order of the delayed 777Xs, which it ordered in 2014 and is set to become the launch customer for next year, from 150 to 126. Emirates will now purchase 126 Boeing 777X aircraft and 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, orders with a combined value of $56 billion. Talks on the 787 Dreamliner had been in the works for two years between Emirates and Boeing but were delayed by uncertainty over the future of the A380 and delays with the 777X given the effect those issues would have on its long-term fleet planning. The first deliveries of 777X have faced delays over durability issues around its General Electric-produced engines. Having reduced its 777X order, Emirates opted for the smaller 787-9 version of the Dreamliner as opposed to the larger 787-10 version it was considering, a move that opens new potential across its routes with more modest passenger flows and because it can enable greater flight frequencies on existing routes. Until now Emirates' fleet was entirely composed of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 - it was the world's largest operator of both jets - but the airline is adapting to industry conditions and slowing international demand for travel with more flexibility by acquiring the Airbus A350-900s and the Boeing 787-9. One of few in the world that only operate a wide-body fleet, Emirates' meteoric rise established it as the world's largest long-haul carrier with a fleet of 234 jets. Conceived in March 1985 with backing from Dubai's royal family and support from Pakistan International Airlines, which leased it two planes, Emirates operates more than 3,600 flights every week from its hub at Dubai International Airport across a network spanning 85 countries and 161 destinations. Airbus closed the Dubai Air Show having netted around $38 billion in new plane orders while Boeing booked orders of approximately $17 billion, including for its still-grounded 737 Max. As orders in Dubai and elsewhere reflect, low-cost travel is one of the more robustly growing sectors in a subdued international travel market. Despite the travel market outlook and its new challenges, however, Emirates remains among a handful of international airlines with the capitalisation and ambition to place orders such those it did during the air show. Next year, Dubai is hosting Expo 2020, which is expected to bring up to 25 million visitors to the emirate.

MIAT Mongolian Airlines president and CEO Battur Davaakhuu said: \"Our vision is to become a globally recognised Mongolian national flag carrier, and we are making a significant step forward by adding the first 787-9 Dreamliner to our fleet. \"The Mongolian Dreamliner will fly our passengers direct and in unmatched comfort to their dream destinations. Today is a proud day for MIAT and for all Mongolians.\" The Boeing 787 Dreamliner delivers a 20% to 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions, while saving more than 36 billion pounds of fuel. Boeing has recorded more than 1,400 orders from over 80 customers since the 787's launch in 2011. The aircraft has a range of up to 7,635nm. When delivered, the flag carrier will join the likes of Hainan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Vietnam Airlines, who also operate the 787-9. Headquartered in Ulaanbaatar, MIAT's 787-9 will complement its existing fleet of four Next-Generation 737s, one 737 MAX and two 767 aeroplanes.

The first of six aircraft will be used for local expansion, international routes and to start the airline's first widebody operations. What are the details of this order? There is nothing more exciting than getting something you ordered delivered. Be it a shiny fridge, a fresh pair of shoes or a state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner. We can imagine what the team at Vistara is feeling with the news that their very own first Boeing 787 is set to be delivered in February. This will be the first widebody aircraft for Vistara, which currently has 12 Airbus A320s, 19 A320neos, and nine Boeing 737-800s. This new order is the first of six Boeing 787-9 aircraft to be delivered to the airline, and the carrier has an option waiting in the wings for another four. One of these aircraft may have originally been for Hainan Airlines. They also have six Airbus A321neos on order. Where will these aircraft fly? There are two major markets that Vistara believes the Boeing 787 will be perfect for. The first is local short-haul routes across India, that have vast demand and will give the aircraft a good run for its money. Likey, Vistara will first deploy the Boeing 787 between New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, India's three most majorly populated cities. This will be to train the crew with the new aircraft and to show off the new craft to local customers. The 2nd area that they will deploy the Boeing 787 fleet is more interesting - international routes. Vistara has not commented on where it might fly the aircraft, only that it is 'suited to routes to Europe and East Asia'. More clues lie in their current airline partners: Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, British Airways, and United Airlines. Vistara would likely not step on anyone's toes but look for opportunities to codeshare, perhaps to London with British Airways. Another possibility is partnering with Japan Airlines to operate routes to Tokyo. Currently only ANA operates routes from Tokyo to Mumbai. By opening up a route from this city, Vistara could help stem the operations of a rival airline and open up a new market for themselves. They would do a joint codeshare swap with JAL for the Tokyo - New Delhi route. \"Boeing 787 Dreamliners that start joining its fleet from February to be deployed on medium-haul routes like London and Tokyo from March-end\" What will it be like to fly on them? As Vistara has been only operating short-haul aircraft so far, the news that they will soon have a widebody fleet is exciting indeed. We can't say for sure how their premium cabin will be configured, but if they are going to stick to the industry norm they will likely have high-density lie-flat seats like Singapore's Boeing 787-10. According to Times Of India, Vistara will be configuring out the aircraft with some great features. For one, the aircraft will have internet WIFI throughout and might even extend the communication upgrades to their A320 domestic fleet. They have ruled out allowing voice communication, however, as to not disturb other passengers. Overall, this new aircraft looks like it will herald in an exciting new chapter for the Indian carrier, and we at Simple Flying can't wait to fly it.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/vistara-set-to-receive-first-boeing-787-dreamliner-in-february/"}, {"title": "Virgin Atlantic's Boeing 787 Will Soon Be Flying To Cape Town", "date": "2020-02-12", "content": "Virgin Atlantic has made further progress in the Southern Hemisphere by introducing a seasonal service from London Heathrow to Cape Town.

The aircraft type is already used on the firm's operations to one of South Africa's other key cities, Johannesburg. Virgin Atlantic CEO Juha Jarvinen shared his excitement for the new service. He also mentioned his airline's Brazilian expansion, which launches next month. \"2020 is an extremely exciting year of continued growth for Virgin Atlantic.

It will depart Heathrow each day at 16:20 and arrive in Cape Town at 05:55. Therefore, passengers will be able to catch some sleep to be fresh on their arrival.

Growth in tourism has been a key factor in this. However, the nation's growing economy has also caused a need for better connectivity. New markets: Other carriers such as United Airlines have also been identifying new opportunities in the region. The Chicago-based operator recently debuted its first flight to Cape Town from New York. This was the first time that any airline operated a non- stop service from North America to the city. Virgin Atlantic previously launched a service to Cape Town in 1999. However, it discontinued the operation in 2014. With new prospects emerging in the area, it has decided to return.

The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft is a wide-body, long-haul aircraft similar to the previous version 787-8 but can carry more passengers due to a longer fuselage and can travel farther with a range of 14,100 km instead of the 787-8's 13,600 km. It also consumes 20% less fuel compared to the earlier generation of the Dreamliner. The aircraft's fuselage is longer by 6 metres, which enables the airline to carry 280 passengers rather than the usual 240 passengers. The airline plans to employ a three-class configuration for the aircraft with economy, premium economy and business class. The economy class will have a 3-3-3 configuration across 2 cabins, one 21-seater premium economy cabin in a 2-3-2 configuration and a business class cabin with 1-2-1 configuration. Boeing's Dreamliner aircraft are known to be quieter and have an innovative 'human-centric' lighting system that will help flyers feel less jet-lagged compared to other long-haul planes. Vistara will also be the first airline to offer Wi-Fi service in India. Other than Air India, Vistara would be the only airline in the country to fly a Dreamliner. Air India's Dreamliners, however, are the previous generation of the aircraft, the 787-8s.

The aircraft is one of 14 787-9 aircraft the airline has in. Passengers on board Air New Zealand flight NZ283 on March 25th were in for a real treat. The flight's four passengers were all upgraded to the aircraft's business class cabin as they flew from Singapore to Auckland. Passenger numbers have been horrendously low due to increasing travel restrictions imposed by countries around the world attempting to contain the current outbreak. Flight details: Flight NZ283 on March 25th was operated by a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, registration ZK-NZM. The aircraft is one of 14 787-9 aircraft the airline has in its fleet. According to News Hub, there were at least 15 cabin crew onboard serving a total of just four passengers. Air New Zealand pilot Philip Kirk shared the experience on his Twitter account, posting a photo of the crew and their passengers: NZ283 was heading from Singapore to Auckland as part of the airline's reduced service. The flight is just over nine hours long, leaving Singapore at 1840 local time and arriving in Auckland at 0920 the next day. Under normal circumstances, a flight with four bookings would be canceled. However, this operation was likely being run primarily for repatriation services and cargo. According to Forbes, the country of New Zealand officially closed its borders on March 19th to non- citizens. The exceptions to this are New Zealand residents and Australian citizens who normally reside in the country. In fact, Australia followed suit with a similar policy on Friday, March 20th. Air New Zealand's 787 business class: The business class cabin of Air New Zealand's 787s has received mixed reviews by the many travelers who have written about their experience. Those who have flown it recently comment on the old and dated style of seating and the awkward layout that it presents. One of the unfortunate aspects of this cabin is the fact that the \"window seats\" of business class face away from the window and in, towards the aisle. This may allow for a denser configuration and more efficient service from flight attendants. However, it ignores the fact that those who choose a window seat usually do so for the view. Conclusion: Regardless of the unpopular design and dated seating, the four passengers on the flight were treated to a special experience. All of this took place during an extremely strange and challenging time in aviation history. With the global aviation industry operating at a fraction of its normal capacity, we can only hope that this situation will pass sooner than later.

The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft is a wide-body, long-haul aircraft similar to the previous version 787-8 but can carry more passengers due to a longer fuselage and can travel farther with a range of 14,100 km instead of the 787-8's 13,600 km. It also consumes 20% less fuel compared to the earlier generation of the Dreamliner. The aircraft's fuselage is longer by 6 metres, which enables the airline to carry 280 passengers rather than the usual 240 passengers. The airline plans to employ a three-class configuration for the aircraft with economy, premium economy and business class. The economy class will have a 3-3-3 configuration across 2 cabins, one 21-seater premium economy cabin in a 2-3-2 configuration and a business class cabin with 1-2-1 configuration. Boeing's Dreamliner aircraft are known to be quieter and have an innovative 'human-centric' lighting system that will help flyers feel less jet-lagged compared to other long-haul planes. Vistara will also be the first airline to offer Wi-Fi service in India. Other than Air India, Vistara would be the only airline in the country to fly a Dreamliner.

One of the unfortunate aspects of this cabin is the fact that the \"window seats\" of business class face away from the window and in, towards the aisle.

The first of six aircraft will be used for local expansion, international routes and to start the airline's first widebody operations. What are the details of this order? There is nothing more exciting than getting something you ordered delivered. Be it a shiny fridge, a fresh pair of shoes or a state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner. We can imagine what the team at Vistara is feeling with the news that their very own first Boeing 787 is set to be delivered in February. This will be the first widebody aircraft for Vistara, which currently has 12 Airbus A320s, 19 A320neos, and nine Boeing 737-800s. This new order is the first of six Boeing 787-9 aircraft to be delivered to the airline, and the carrier has an option waiting in the wings for another four. One of these aircraft may have originally been for Hainan Airlines. They also have six Airbus A321neos on order. Where will these aircraft fly? There are two major markets that Vistara believes the Boeing 787 will be perfect for. The first is local short-haul routes across India, that have vast demand and will give the aircraft a good run for its money. Likey, Vistara will first deploy the Boeing 787 between New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, India's three most majorly populated cities. This will be to train the crew with the new aircraft and to show off the new craft to local customers. The 2nd area that they will deploy the Boeing 787 fleet is more interesting - international routes. Vistara has not commented on where it might fly the aircraft, only that it is 'suited to routes to Europe and East Asia'. More clues lie in their current airline partners: Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, British Airways, and United Airlines. Vistara would likely not step on anyone's toes but look for opportunities to codeshare, perhaps to London with British Airways. Another possibility is partnering with Japan Airlines to operate routes to Tokyo. Currently only ANA operates routes from Tokyo to Mumbai. By opening up a route from this city, Vistara could help stem the operations of a rival airline and open up a new market for themselves. They would do a joint codeshare swap with JAL for the Tokyo - New Delhi route. \"Boeing 787 Dreamliners that start joining its fleet from February to be deployed on medium-haul routes like London and Tokyo from March-end\" What will it be like to fly on them? As Vistara has been only operating short-haul aircraft so far, the news that they will soon have a widebody fleet is exciting indeed. We can't say for sure how their premium cabin will be configured, but if they are going to stick to the industry norm they will likely have high-density lie-flat seats like Singapore's Boeing 787-10. According to Times Of India, Vistara will be configuring out the aircraft with some great features. For one, the aircraft will have internet WIFI throughout and might even extend the communication upgrades to their A320 domestic fleet. They have ruled out allowing voice communication, however, as to not disturb other passengers. Overall, this new aircraft looks like it will herald in an exciting new chapter for the Indian carrier, and we at Simple Flying can't wait to fly it.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/vistara-set-to-receive-first-boeing-787-dreamliner-in-february/"}, {"title": "Virgin Atlantic's Boeing 787 Will Soon Be Flying To Cape Town", "date": "2020-02-12", "content": "Virgin Atlantic has made further progress in the Southern Hemisphere by introducing a seasonal service from London Heathrow to Cape Town.

The carrier added, \"The forthcoming deliveries of new-generation aircraft will concern the A350s on the long-haul network followed by the A220s on the short and medium-haul network.\" Currently, Air France expects to cut around 7,500 or 15% of its workforce, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The French airline also received US$7.87 billion in aid to survive the current crisis. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the carrier from retiring one of its most iconic airframes, the A380. Why did Air France and KLM swap? In June 2019, Air France and KLM announced they were swapping their orders for new long-haul airplanes. At that time, that meant that the six remaining Boeing 787 ordered for Air France would be transferred to KLM. Meanwhile, the current seven A350-900 for KLM would go to the French carrier. Both airlines said this decision helped the optimization of their respective long-haul fleets. They could realize fleet efficiencies through harmonization and accelerated growth of similar planes. In December, the Air France-KLM Group ordered ten more Airbus A350. Two months later, the French airline took delivery of the 350th A350 and called that airplane \"Nice\" in tribute to the city on the French Mediterranean coast. Before the pandemic, Air France planned to have a total of 38 long-haul A350 by 2025. What's next for KLM? Meanwhile, KLM operated 13 Boeing 787-9 when it announced the swap with Air France. It also has an order for a few Boeing 787-10. At the end of June, Boeing was supposed to deliver KLM's first 787-10, coinciding with some celebrations for the carrier's 100th anniversary. But, Boeing missed the timing. Last year, KLM planned to have a total of 21 Boeing 787s by the end of 2020. Currently, the oldest airline in the world has a fleet of 18 Dreamliners, 29 Boeing 777s, eight Boeing 747s, 52 Boeing 737s, and 13 Airbus A330s.

The aircraft arrived in New Delhi on February 29, 2020 from Boeing's production facility in Everett, Washington. The new Dreamliner offers 30 business class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration done in premium genuine leather that recline into fully-flat beds and offer direct aisle access to every passenger in the cabin. An 18\" high definition (HD) touchscreen in-seat TV, a video handset to navigate the inflight entertainment (IFE) system and ambient lighting in stowage compartments and footwell area are some other features of this cabin. The premium economy cabin has 21 seats in a 2-3-2 configuration, also upholstered in premium genuine leather. The seats have individually adjustable calf rests, extendable footrests, 7\" reclining backrests, six-way adjustable headrests, a 13\" HD touchscreen seatback monitor and a touchpad handset control to navigate the entertainment system. The economy class has 248 seats in 3-3-3 configuration. Greater legroom during long-haul flights is one of the key aspects of this Vistara service. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is also characterised by an advanced air purification system, more headroom, greater space in overhead bins, larger windows that give an increased sense of space, turbulence-dampening technology and lower cabin altitude. Passengers will be able to enjoy 700 hours of inflight entreatment content including movies, TV shows and audio compilations of various genres as well as games. Vistara's Dreamliner is also fitted with a special wellness lighting solution that helps travellers to adjust their sleep schedules and feel less jet- lagged. Leslie Thng, chief executive officer, Vistara said, \"With the unveiling of our new cabin products, today's milestone reflects Vistara's deep-rooted commitment to providing our customers with a premium travel experience like no other carrier in India. We are confident that millions of our loyal customers will be delighted to have the choice of flying their favourite Indian airline now on long haul international routes as well.\" At the unveiling of the new aircraft, the airline's chairman Bhaskar Bhat also expressed the Tata-SIA carrier's interest in bidding for national carrier Air India.", "url": "https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2020/03/03/indias-first-boeing-787-9-dreamliner-unveiled/"}, {"title": "Here's why India's new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner matters", "date": "2020-03-04", "content": "Vistara, a Singapore Airlines and Tata Sons joint venture received its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Feb. 29, 2020. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft is a wide-body, long-haul aircraft similar to the previous version 787-8 but can carry more passengers due to a longer fuselage and can travel farther with a range of 14,100 km instead of the 787-8's 13,600 km. It also consumes 20% less fuel compared to the earlier generation of the Dreamliner. The aircraft's fuselage is longer by 6 metres, which enables the airline to carry 280 passengers rather than the usual 240 passengers. The airline plans to employ a three-class configuration for the aircraft with economy, premium economy and business class. The economy class will have a 3-3-3 configuration across 2 cabins, one 21-seater premium economy cabin in a 2-3-2 configuration and a business class cabin with 1-2-1 configuration. Boeing's Dreamliner aircraft are known to be quieter and have an innovative 'human-centric' lighting system that will help flyers feel less jet-lagged compared to other long-haul planes. Vistara will also be the first airline to offer Wi-Fi service in India. Other than Air India, Vistara would be the only airline in the country to fly a Dreamliner. Air India's Dreamliners, however, are the previous generation of the aircraft, the 787-8s. Qantas completed the third-longest ever scheduled non-stop flight using the 787-9 aircraft from Perth in Australia to London's Heathrow airport.

The aircraft is one of 14 787-9 aircraft the airline has in. Passengers on board Air New Zealand flight NZ283 on March 25th were in for a real treat. The flight's four passengers were all upgraded to the aircraft's business class cabin as they flew from Singapore to Auckland. Passenger numbers have been horrendously low due to increasing travel restrictions imposed by countries around the world attempting to contain the current outbreak. Flight details: Flight NZ283 on March 25th was operated by a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, registration ZK-NZM. The aircraft is one of 14 787-9 aircraft the airline has in its fleet. According to News Hub, there were at least 15 cabin crew onboard serving a total of just four passengers. Air New Zealand pilot Philip Kirk shared the experience on his Twitter account, posting a photo of the crew and their passengers: NZ283 was heading from Singapore to Auckland as part of the airline's reduced service. The flight is just over nine hours long, leaving Singapore at 1840 local time and arriving in Auckland at 0920 the next day. Under normal circumstances, a flight with four bookings would be canceled. However, this operation was likely being run primarily for repatriation services and cargo. According to Forbes, the country of New Zealand officially closed its borders on March 19th to non- citizens. The exceptions to this are New Zealand residents and Australian citizens who normally reside in the country. In fact, Australia followed suit with a similar policy on Friday, March 20th. Air New Zealand's 787 business class: The business class cabin of Air New Zealand's 787s has received mixed reviews by the many travelers who have written about their experience. Those who have flown it recently comment on the old and dated style of seating and the awkward layout that it presents. One of the unfortunate aspects of this cabin is the fact that the \"window seats\" of business class face away from the window and in, towards the aisle. This may allow for a denser configuration and more efficient service from flight attendants. However, it ignores the fact that those who choose a window seat usually do so for the view. Conclusion: Regardless of the unpopular design and dated seating, the four passengers on the flight were treated to a special experience. All of this took place during an extremely strange and challenging time in aviation history. With the global aviation industry operating at a fraction of its normal capacity, we can only hope that this situation will pass sooner than later.

But who are the airlines flying the Boeing 787-9? A number of leasing companies own Boeing 787-9s. Most are out with airline operators, but several lessors presently have surplus 787-9s on their hands. That includes Ireland's Aercap, which has nine of the planes. United States- based GE Capital Aviation Services has one 787-9 on its hands right now. Also in the United States, Wilmington Trust has three of the planes sitting around. Breaking it down by region: Elsewhere in North America, United Airlines has 35 Boeing 787-9s, American Airlines has 22 of the planes, and Kalair has a single 787-9. Up in Canada, WestJet operates six of the Dreamliners, and Air Canada has 29 of them. Moving down the American landmass, Aeromexico has 11 787-9s, Avianca has one, and LATAM Chile has 12. It's not a huge presence in Central and South America. Over in Africa, the primary operator of the 787-9 is Addis Ababa-based Ethiopian Airlines.

El Al Israel Airlines has a neat dozen of them. The 787-9 is popular across the Gulf nations, though. Variously, Etihad Airways flies 30 of them, near-neighbor Qatar Airways has seven of the Dreamliners. Saudi Arabian Airlines has 13 of the planes, Oman Airlines has seven, Gulf Air has nine, and the United Arab Emirates Presidental Flight owns four 787-9 Dreamliners.

The Boeing 787-9 is well represented in the United Kingdom. British Airways also has 16, and Virgin Atlantic flies 17 of the planes. The Anglo-German operator, TUI, also has half a dozen of the 787-9s. Sibling airlines Air France -KLM have 10 and 13 of the Dreamliners each. Warsaw-based LOT Polish Airlines has seven of the 787-9s.

The Boeing 787-9 a big hit in China: Over in Asia, the 787-9 is a big hit and operated by multiple airlines. In China alone, China Eastern Airlines, Air China, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Juneyao Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Suparna Airlines, and Shanghai Airlines all fly the plane. Between them, there are 85 Boeing 787-9s based in China. Across the rest of North Asia, Japan's All Nippon Airways is the world's biggest operator of the Boeing 787-9, with 41 of them. Competitor Japan Airlines has 20 of the type. In South Korea, Korean Air Lines has 10 of the Dreamliners, and the newly established Air Premia has one. In Taiwan, EVA Airways has four of the planes.

However, amid the impact of the global health crisis, the widebody will now arrive later than initially planned. Despite this delay, the carrier states that the jet will be an integral member of its fleet in 2022. A transitioning market: Simple Flying had the opportunity to interview Hawaiian Airlines SVP of marketing, Avi Mannis, about his airline's plans amid the pandemic. He spoke about the carrier's fleet following the impact of the current climate. Hawaiian's operations had been rocked by the travel restrictions in the US and across the globe. However, recently, the airline has seen improvements amid new testing protocols starting to bypass the need for quarantine. The right moment: Nonetheless, the deferral of the 787 until 2022 will give time for the market to stabilize. Until then, the operator's Airbus A330 aircraft will manage with widebody services. \"We have announced the deferral of our first 787s into late 2022. We continue to believe that the 787 is absolutely the right aircraft for our fleet and will be our flagship product, but we don't need it in 2021. In the meantime, our long-haul fleet of A330s and A321neos is well-suited to our mission and gives us the capabilities we need to adapt our network to evolving market conditions,\" Mannis told Simple Flying. \"We came into COVID with a young fleet that was ideal for our business model. So, we haven't had to do much fleet restructuring.\" The perfect balance: Altogether, Mannis says that, from a fleet standpoint, Hawaiian came into the pandemic very well positioned. The carrier has aircraft that fit all of the niches that are the focus of its network strategy. Moreover, the airline wasn't in a position of having to do a substantial fleet restructure as it didn't have a lot of old aircraft that it had to retire rapidly. Instead, Hawaiian hibernated many of its aircraft. However, the airline will be to deploy them again as the opportunity arises. Hawaiian's recovery has been the slowest of the USA's top-10 carriers to date. Photo: Getty Images. Ultimately, the 787 Dreamliner will be warmly welcomed on Hawaiian's operations on longer distances. The plane will be perfect for services such as the carrier's routes across the Pacific to Japan.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/boeing-787-set-to-become-hawaiian-airlines-flagship-aircraft-in-2022/"}, {"title": "Which Airlines Operate The Boeing 787-9?", "date": "2020-12-04", "content": "It's hard to believe, but the Boeing 787-9 has only been flying paying passengers for just over six years. The plane already seems ubiquitous. According to Boeing data, 934 of the Dreamliners have been ordered. Of that number, 556 planes have been delivered and are in service with airlines worldwide. But who are the airlines flying the Boeing 787-9? A number of leasing companies own Boeing 787-9s. Most are out with airline operators, but several lessors presently have surplus 787-9s on their hands. That includes Ireland's Aercap, which has nine of the planes.

The company lost $8.4 billion in the quarter, Boeing's largest quarterly loss ever. Major items taking a $6.5 billion charge on the upcoming 777X long-range wide-body jet. But other, less-reported news may spell further headaches for Boeing. Two weeks ago, Norwegian Airlines announced the end of its famed low-cost, long-haul flights that took budget passengers all over the world. Indeed, in 2019 Norwegian was the largest foreign carrier in New York, carrying more than two million passengers to Europe and other destinations. Hoping to survive COVID-19 and a sea of red ink, Norwegian will now concentrate on its Nordic and European network. The failure of Norwegian's long-haul service has resulted in contraction and job losses for the airline. Soon, it will also result in the departure of its long-range aircraft. Anyone want to buy 37 used Boeing 787 Dreamliners? Norwegian's current plan is to serve Europe with 50 narrow-body aircraft in 2021. While the narrow-bodies are easier to fill and cheaper to fill, this will also put Norwegian into head-to-head completion with Ryanair and other discount airiness. If all goes well Norwegian plans to increase the fleet to around 70 narrow-body aircraft in 2022. The back-to-basics approach may or may not work for the struggling airline, which has ben repeatedly bailed out by stockholders and the Norwegian government. But it's definitely bad news for Boeing. Even the 70-aircraft figure represents just half of Norwegian's current all- Boeing fleet of 140 aircraft. And a source close to the struggling airline confirmed there is no future at Norwegian for the widebody Boeing 787. Norwegian's website cheerfully notes that \"with an average fleet age of just 4.6 years, Norwegian has one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the world.\" But the airline's struggle to survive looks like breaking up that fleet is a certainty, dumping the planes on a sluggish post-COVID market. Norwegian currently has some 85 Boeing 737-800 narrow-body aircraft, with an additional 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Long-haul service was provided by the airline's 37 widebody 787 Dreamliners. Norwegian has both the 787-8, and the 787-9. Norwegian Dreamliners provided service to a dozen US cities and to European, South American and Asian destinations. Why the past tense?\" Norwegian says its entire fleet of Dreamliners has not flown since March of 2020. The airline said that with future demand highly uncertain, \"a long-haul operation is not viable for Norwegian and these operations will not continue.\" So it seems that all 37 Boeing Dreamliners are on the chopping block, as are several dozen 737-800 and/or 737 MAX aircraft. Most of Norwegian's aircraft are leased, creating issues for the leasing companies that are their actual owners. But putting the 737 and especially the 787 aircraft back on the sluggish aviation market will create more headaches for Boeing. Average prices for new 787-8 models run around $248 million, while a new 787-9 is pegged at $292 million. How about a used one? Controller.com has a 787-8 built in 2017 listed at $122 million, with three others \"Call for price.\" As of December 2020, Boeing had built 992 787s. Norwegian's orphaned Dreamliners represent almost 4% of that total. Dumping 37 expensive new widebody planes on a world aviation market struggling to come back from COVID will no doubt further depress pricing. It may also further limit 787 manufacturing, which has already been cut four times in 19 months. Boeing 787 production, which has faced a number of quality issues, is now down to just five aircraft per month. Manufacturing cuts reflects a larger problem. Reuters quoted Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith as telling a Credit Suisse conference \"We've got a large number of undelivered 787 aircraft.\" Flight Global reports that the \"large number\" is 60. But the coming dump of Norwegian's Boeing aircraft is only part of the \"relationship problem\" between the two companies. In June 2020, Norwegian issued a notice of termination of the company's purchase agreements of five Boeing 787s, 92 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and related GoldCare service agreements. Norwegian is also suing Boeing for over one billion dollars over the grounding of the 737-Max and engine issues on the 787. \"Instead of delivering what they promised, Boeing has deliberately misled and omitted information, shown gross negligence and clumsy production, and made aircraft with significantly impaired value and utility, which in the case of the MAX aircraft had tragic and fatal consequences,\" stated the lawsuit, filed with the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in July 2019. Norwegian, noted in the filing that \"737 MAX aircraft have been grounded since the world-wide grounding of the aircraft type was imposed on 12 March 2019. This has also disrupted Norwegian operations and caused significant losses. In addition, Norwegian's Rolls-Royce Trent 1000-powered 787 aircraft have suffered from long-running reliability issues that have affected reliability and resulted in premature and unplanned maintenance, which has disrupted the Company's operations and caused further significant losses.\" In November, Boeing tried to get the lawsuit dismissed, but it was deferred to a later date.

While the carrier has yet to receive the 787s, news of its first route has got aviation enthusiasts excited. The carrier already operates the fuel-efficient Airbus A350 aircraft, and the 787 will soon become a part of its fleet and network. Debut route: The delivery of Lufthansa's Dreamliners is still a few months away, but that didn't stop the airline from announcing its debut route formally. In an official tweet on Tuesday, the airline declared that the first destination of its Dreamliner will be Toronto Pearson International Airport. The carrier plans to include the 787s in its winter schedule, with aircraft delivery expected to begin in early 2022 through to 2025. There's also speculation that it could debut its brand-new business class product with the 787s. Lufthansa will launch its new premium cabins in early 2022, pretty much around the same time it is expecting to receive its first few Dreamliners. If all goes well, the airlines' first Dreamliner flight to Toronto could feature this highly anticipated product. Fleet modifications: Like many airlines worldwide, Lufthansa, too, wants to move towards the new generation of fuel-efficient twin-engine jets. The carrier has more or less written off its entire fleet of A380 superjumbos and now relies quite a lot on its 17 active Airbus A350-900 aircraft with 28 more on order, as per ch- aviation. The 787s, too, will become a part of the carrier's next-generation fleet. In March 2019, the Lufthansa Group ordered 20 Boeing 787s and then added another five to the list in May 2021. This brings the total number of Dreamliners to be delivered to the group to 25. An order of 25 Boeing 787s by the Lufthansa Group shows its commitment to a future of mostly twin-engine airplanes.

While only time will tell how long Lufthansa will continue to operate these, the carrier has shown strong signs of a twin-engine dominated fleet in the future. Lufthansa has shown huge faith in Boeing's 777X program, placing an order in November 2013. Currently, its total order for the 777X stands at 20 aircraft. The carrier was expecting its first 777X in 2020, but the delay with its certification has now pushed it to 2023. In the meantime, it continues to deploy its A350s to many key destinations, making good use of the lighter, more economical aircraft.

Willy Brandt, West Germany's Chancellor in the late 1960s and 70s, honored Lufthansa during his tenure as Mayor of West Berlin by naming the airline's first Boeing 707 \"Berlin\". More recently, an Airbus A380 with the registration identifier D-AIMI bore the prestigious name of Germany's capital. The first Lufthansa Boeing 787-9 - \"Berlin\" - will be registered D-ABPA. The first scheduled intercontinental destination for Lufthansa's 787-9 will be Toronto, Canada's financial center and hub. Lufthansa and the German capital have a long and special relationship. The prewar company was founded in Berlin in 1926 and rose again to become one of the world's leading airlines. Following the culmination of World War II and for 45 years, only the civilian aircraft of the 'allies' were allowed to land in the divided city. Since reunification, Lufthansa has been flying to Berlin for more than 30 years, with no other airline group flying so many Berliners all over the world in the past decades as Lufthansa and its sister carriers. Currently, the Lufthansa Group airlines connect the German capital to some 260 destinations worldwide, either with direct flight or through connections in one of the many group hubs.

This was despite a Qantas engineer placing \"remove before flight\" barricade streamer tape on the covered static ports the day before the flight. While the 14-plus-hour flight was uneventful, the incident triggered an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Four static probes left covered on Qantas Dreamliner: On Tuesday, the ATSB released its findings concerning the September 22, 2021, incident. The aviation safety agency found the aircraft departed with reduced redundancy to the engine electronic control system because the coverings were left intact. The ATSB also found that Qantas' own procedures did not identify all of the aircraft's static ports, and the procedure for restoring the plane back to service did not reference Boeing procedures. This allowed different interpretations of which ports would be covered. The incident involved VH-ZNJ, which was due to fly a freight flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles on September 22. The night before, an engineer prepared the aircraft for the flight. This preparation included removing covers from the pitot probes and static ports. The following morning, before departure, one of the flight crew conducted a pre-flight exterior inspection, with no anomalies detected. The aircraft was also subject to a pre-departure exterior inspection by ground service dispatch personnel. Luckily, an uneventful flight to LAX: Around 09:00 the Dreamliner took off and set course for LAX. Flying time across the Pacific was 14 and half hours. The flight was described as \"uneventful.\" It was only during the post-flight inspection that the covered static ports were discovered. Static ports provide important air pressure data to aircraft systems, but the fuselage static ports and vertical fin static ports play the primary role. The fan cowl static port air pressure data is only used when an aircraft's engine electronic control determines that the data coming from the other static ports is unreliable. Before flying out of Melbourne, VH-ZNJ had sat idle for 39 hours. When an aircraft sits on the ground between 24 and 72 hours, Qantas requires it to be subject to 'normal' parking procedures. These parking procedures include fitting pitot covers and covering the static ports, in accordance with Boeing recommendations. The Boeing 787-9 has six fuselage, four engine fan cowl, and four vertical fin static ports. On the evening of September 21, a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer was tasked to return the Dreamliner to flight status. This included uncovering the pitot and fuselage static ports and completing the other maintenance tasks. The LAME was unaware that the fan cowl ports had been covered earlier, nor did they check. Second officer fails to see covered static ports: Another LAME was tasked to complete the return to service procedure the next morning. But the LAME did not inspect the aircraft, nor were they required to as part of this procedure. The certificate of release to service was signed off ahead of the flight crew arriving. Taking the plane to Los Angeles was a captain, two first officers, and two second officers. The captain tasked one of the second officers to conduct the pre-flight exterior inspection. The second officer commenced the exterior inspection at the aircraft's nose, in line with standard procedures. The pilot found a pitot cover on the apron but could not establish whether that cover came from VH-ZNJ or another plane. The pilot gave the cover to an engineer who was also out on the apron. Back in the cockpit, the second officer mentioned the cover found on the ground but reported no other problems, and the inspection completed. Just before pushback, a contracted Dnata dispatcher conducted their walk- around inspection and also did not notice the four covered static ports. The dispatcher gave the all-clear and the jet departed within minutes. Melbourne Airport CCTV footage revealed the fan cowl static port covers could be seen in certain views. Further, one of the LAMEs and an aircraft maintenance engineer walked past the engines several times while completing other maintenance tasks. However, there was no indication either specifically looked at the engine fan cowl. The CCTV footage also showed the second officer and the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections in line with the documented procedures and exterior inspection route. \"The tape on the engine fan cowls was not removed by that engineer, as per the manufacturer's procedures, and this wasn't identified by flight crew or dispatch during pre-departure checks, \" said ATSB Director Transport Safety Stuart Macleod on Tuesday. \"While the flight was uneventful, the covered ports meant redundancy for the engine electronic control system was reduced.\" The ATSB strikes a benign tone in its findings: A similar incident occurred in Australia four years ago. In July 2018, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300 left Brisbane with its three pitot probes covered and almost immediately began getting unreliable airspeed indications. The Airbus was able to turn around and land safely with assistance from Brisbane ATC. The ATSB made several findings regarding September's incident. The agency noted the meter-long tail of the 'remove before flight' tape covering the static ports was stuck down to prevent it from being torn from the fuselage in strong winds, as per Boeing's recommended procedure. \"This likely reduced the visibility of it covering the fan cowl static port covers,\" said Mr Macleod. The ATSB notes Qantas' maintenance procedures required the static ports to be covered but did not specify the locations, allowing potentially different interpretations of the procedure between LAMEs/engineers. In addition, the emphasis of the warnings was more in line with the fuselage static ports, rather than possible issues associated with the fan cowl or vertical fin covers not being removed. Action taken by Qantas: The ATSB reserved somewhat harsher judgment for the unfortunate second pilot and Dnata dispatcher. The ATSB said the second officer's inspection was \"non- normal.\" The safety agency also said the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections per the documented procedures. \"This was a missed opportunity to assist engineers to readily access the current procedures and determine which ports were covered, and also allowed for different interpretations of which ports could be covered ,\" Mr Macleod said. \"When performing safety critical tasks like aircraft maintenance, it is very important that procedures are clear and unambiguous to avoid misinterpretation and error such as occurred in this incident.\" Qantas has since made some changes to how their engineers and flight crews deal with aircraft inspections, including issuing an internal memo issued to flight operations detailing the fan cowl static ports and that they may be covered during parking. In addition, the memo noted that engineering may not necessarily conduct an exterior inspection before dispatch and highlighted the importance of flight crew vigilance 'to ensure they are an effective last line of defense in assessing the aircraft's readiness for flight.'

A welcome addition: Regardless, there is notable excitement from the Lufthansa camp about its incoming aircraft. It is giving its first unit the name of Berlin, paying homage to the capital of the company's home country. All in all, Lufthansa is looking forward to the comfort and economic benefits to be had with the plane. Lufthansa shared the following in a recent statement: \"The German capital will receive a new \"flying\" ambassador: Lufthansa is naming its first Boeing 787-9 \"Berlin.\" The naming ceremony is set to take place following delivery of the aircraft next year. \"Berlin\" is the first of five Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners\" that Lufthansa will add to its fleet in 2022. The ultra-modern long-haul aircraft consume on average only 2.5 liters of kerosene per passenger and 100 kilometers flown. That is around 30 percent less than predecessor aircraft. The CO2 emissions are also greatly improved.\" The 787 has proved its value on long-haul journeys across the continent. Despite only being in action for just over a decade, it has become a flagship in many fleets, and its attention is expected to continue throughout the decade. A Lufthansa spokesperson told Simple Flying that it expects to enter the 787-9 in the second quarter of this year.

This was despite a Qantas engineer placing \"remove before flight\" barricade streamer tape on the covered static ports the day before the flight. While the 14-plus-hour flight was uneventful, the incident triggered an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Four static probes left covered on Qantas Dreamliner: On Tuesday, the ATSB released its findings concerning the September 22, 2021, incident. The aviation safety agency found the aircraft departed with reduced redundancy to the engine electronic control system because the coverings were left intact. The ATSB also found that Qantas' own procedures did not identify all of the aircraft's static ports, and the procedure for restoring the plane back to service did not reference Boeing procedures. This allowed different interpretations of which ports would be covered. The incident involved VH-ZNJ, which was due to fly a freight flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles on September 22. The night before, an engineer prepared the aircraft for the flight. This preparation included removing covers from the pitot probes and static ports. The following morning, before departure, one of the flight crew conducted a pre-flight exterior inspection, with no anomalies detected. The aircraft was also subject to a pre-departure exterior inspection by ground service dispatch personnel. Luckily, an uneventful flight to LAX: Around 09:00 the Dreamliner took off and set course for LAX. Flying time across the Pacific was 14 and half hours. The flight was described as \"uneventful.\" It was only during the post-flight inspection that the covered static ports were discovered. Static ports provide important air pressure data to aircraft systems, but the fuselage static ports and vertical fin static ports play the primary role. The fan cowl static port air pressure data is only used when an aircraft's engine electronic control determines that the data coming from the other static ports is unreliable. Before flying out of Melbourne, VH-ZNJ had sat idle for 39 hours. When an aircraft sits on the ground between 24 and 72 hours, Qantas requires it to be subject to 'normal' parking procedures. These parking procedures include fitting pitot covers and covering the static ports, in accordance with Boeing recommendations. The Boeing 787-9 has six fuselage, four engine fan cowl, and four vertical fin static ports. On the evening of September 21, a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer was tasked to return the Dreamliner to flight status. This included uncovering the pitot and fuselage static ports and completing the other maintenance tasks. The LAME was unaware that the fan cowl ports had been covered earlier, nor did they check. Second officer fails to see covered static ports: Another LAME was tasked to complete the return to service procedure the next morning. But the LAME did not inspect the aircraft, nor were they required to as part of this procedure. The certificate of release to service was signed off ahead of the flight crew arriving. Taking the plane to Los Angeles was a captain, two first officers, and two second officers. The captain tasked one of the second officers to conduct the pre-flight exterior inspection. The second officer commenced the exterior inspection at the aircraft's nose, in line with standard procedures. The pilot found a pitot cover on the apron but could not establish whether that cover came from VH-ZNJ or another plane. The pilot gave the cover to an engineer who was also out on the apron. Back in the cockpit, the second officer mentioned the cover found on the ground but reported no other problems, and the inspection completed. Just before pushback, a contracted Dnata dispatcher conducted their walk- around inspection and also did not notice the four covered static ports. The dispatcher gave the all-clear and the jet departed within minutes. Melbourne Airport CCTV footage revealed the fan cowl static port covers could be seen in certain views. Further, one of the LAMEs and an aircraft maintenance engineer walked past the engines several times while completing other maintenance tasks. However, there was no indication either specifically looked at the engine fan cowl. The CCTV footage also showed the second officer and the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections in line with the documented procedures and exterior inspection route. \"The tape on the engine fan cowls was not removed by that engineer, as per the manufacturer's procedures, and this wasn't identified by flight crew or dispatch during pre-departure checks, \" said ATSB Director Transport Safety Stuart Macleod on Tuesday. \"While the flight was uneventful, the covered ports meant redundancy for the engine electronic control system was reduced.\" The ATSB strikes a benign tone in its findings: A similar incident occurred in Australia four years ago. In July 2018, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300 left Brisbane with its three pitot probes covered and almost immediately began getting unreliable airspeed indications. The Airbus was able to turn around and land safely with assistance from Brisbane ATC. The ATSB made several findings regarding September's incident. The agency noted the meter-long tail of the 'remove before flight' tape covering the static ports was stuck down to prevent it from being torn from the fuselage in strong winds, as per Boeing's recommended procedure. \"This likely reduced the visibility of it covering the fan cowl static port covers,\" said Mr Macleod. The ATSB notes Qantas' maintenance procedures required the static ports to be covered but did not specify the locations, allowing potentially different interpretations of the procedure between LAMEs/engineers. In addition, the emphasis of the warnings was more in line with the fuselage static ports, rather than possible issues associated with the fan cowl or vertical fin covers not being removed. Action taken by Qantas: The ATSB reserved somewhat harsher judgment for the unfortunate second pilot and Dnata dispatcher. The ATSB said the second officer's inspection was \"non- normal.\" The safety agency also said the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections per the documented procedures. \"This was a missed opportunity to assist engineers to readily access the current procedures and determine which ports were covered, and also allowed for different interpretations of which ports could be covered ,\" Mr Macleod said. \"When performing safety critical tasks like aircraft maintenance, it is very important that procedures are clear and unambiguous to avoid misinterpretation and error such as occurred in this incident.\" Qantas has since made some changes to how their engineers and flight crews deal with aircraft inspections, including issuing an internal memo issued to flight operations detailing the fan cowl static ports and that they may be covered during parking. In addition, the memo noted that engineering may not necessarily conduct an exterior inspection before dispatch and highlighted the importance of flight crew vigilance 'to ensure they are an effective last line of defense in assessing the aircraft's readiness for flight.'

The 787 widebodies were excelling across the carrier's network before the pandemic rocked operations. Yet, Air Tahiti Nui General Manager Pacific Daniel Eggenberger highlighted to Simple Flying that in this recovery period, there is plenty of potential for twinjets. Recent additions: The flag carrier of French Polynesia outright purchased two of its 787-9s and leased another pair through Air Lease Corporation. Dubbed the Tahitian Dreamliner, the type initially debuted for the airline on flights between Tahiti and New Zealand. After two years of downturn, to the delight of carriers in the region, New Zealand's international borders opened two months ahead of schedule. Thus, since early May, Air Tahiti Nui has been the exclusive direct service carrier on the route between Auckland Airport (AUK) and Tahiti's Faa'a International Airport (PPT). The airline has also enjoyed a strong response on the connecting PPT-LAX flight. The 787-9s are continuing to increase their activity amid a strong desire to reconnect with the world after more than two years. The airline has moved from a once-weekly service in May to three flights a week starting from July for the Southern Hemisphere peak winter sun season. The thrice-weekly schedule will pick up again at the end of October for the duration of the Northern Hemisphere winter schedule. Satisfying demand: General Manager Pacific Eggenberger told Simple Flying the following about the benefits of the aircraft: \"Kiwis are among the world's greatest travellers. New Zealand has one of > the highest passport holder rates in the world and this coupled with being > so far from the rest of the world, New Zealanders are more likely to embark > on long-haul travel so their aviation experience usually carries the > expectation of larger, more comfortable aircraft.

The 787-9 Dreamliner offers a fuel > saving of roughly 30% compared to the previous aircraft type we had in our > fleet.\" The arrival of the plane brought Air Tahiti Nui's first premium economy product. It joined two other classes - economy and business. The 2-3-2 configured MOANA premium class features extra legroom and plenty of space with a 20.5-inch-wide seat at a pitch of 38 inches and a recline of eight inches. Offering a total capacity of 294 seats, there are 32 seats in premium, 30 in business, and 232 in economy. Along with the balance of comfort and capacity, Boeing's 787-9s consumed 20% less fuel than any plane in its class. Moreover, there are further costs to be saved due to factors such as the composite materials significantly reducing maintenance due to fatigue. Looking ahead: The goal for Air Tahiti Nui in the second half of 2022 is to catch up on the past two years and meet the strong demand from New Zealand and Australian markets to reconnect with the broader international network. There is also an increased focus on the transit market, and will become a bigger player from New Zealand to the United States.

Different fate from initial orders: The plane is looking good despite having been parked for three years since it rolled out from the final assembly line in Everett. It has just received a fresh coat of paint in the easily distinguishable white and blue livery of Lufthansa. However, that was not what it was first destined to look like. D-ABPD was initially intended for China's Hainan Airlines and then Indian full-service carrier Vistara but was never taken up by either airline. The first Boeing 787 registered with Lufthansa is D-ABPA. This has the same Hainan/Vistara order log and is also not yet delivered to the German airline. Meanwhile, it has also received its name - Lufthansa is calling it Berlin, after the country's once-divided capital. Lufthansa has orders for 32 of the type in total. Twenty were ordered in March 2019, and the airline added another five to the orderbook in May last year. The order was then upped by another seven in May 2022, at the same time it committed to the 777X freighter. Deliveries about to finally restart? Boeing has not delivered any new 787 since May 2021 due to safety regulators finding production flaws in the aircraft. On July 17, Boeing said it was \"very close\" to restarting deliveries. Indeed, last Friday, although not yet officially confirmed, Boeing reportedly received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for its inspection and modification plan for the Dreamliner. Just yesterday, Thursday, August 4, FAA acting Administrator Billy Nolen met with safety inspectors in South Carolina to determine whether the aerospace manufacturer had done enough to finally be allowed to resume 787 deliveries. The FAA said, as quoted by Reuters, that the purpose of the visit was \"to ensure that the FAA is satisfied that Boeing has taken the appropriate steps to improve manufacturing quality and to guarantee the autonomy of workers who ensure regulatory compliance on the company's assembly lines.\"", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/lufthansa-second-boeing-787-9-painted/"}, {"title": "China Airlines To Replace Its Airbus A330s With 16 New Boeing 787s", "date": "2022-08-30", "content": "China Airlines has announced it will purchase 16 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners to replace its aging Airbus A330 fleet.

China Airlines' billion-dollar Dreamliner deal: Taiwan's China Airlines has announced a deal with Boeing for 16 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. The carrier had been mulling over its options to replace its Airbus A330-300s and has now decided in favor of the US-based planemaker. According to Reuters, the deal is worth up to $4.6 billion at list prices, although Bloomberg reports it is worth around $2.1 billion based on estimates from aircraft appraiser Avitas. The agreement also entails options for another eight planes. This will be the first time China Airlines operates the Dreamliner and the second Taiwanese carrier to do so after EVA Air, which currently operates 10 Dreamliners and awaits delivery of a further 11 planes. The Dreamliner will become an integral part of China Airlines' medium and long-haul network, while the carrier also noted its spacious cargo capacity in the belly will further add to its value. Deliveries are set to begin in 2025 as Boeing scrambles to clear its backlog having only resumed Dreamliner deliveries earlier this month. Conversion rights to -10 variant: The agreement with Boeing also includes rights to convert parts of its order to the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner variant. The 787-10 is the largest variant in the Dreamliner program and the least popular in terms of sales at 182 orders, falling short of the 787-9 and 787-8. As for China Airlines' Airbus A330-300 fleet, the carrier has 22 of the type with an average age exceeding 14 years. The vast majority of its A330 fleet is on lease, with the first aircraft arriving back in 2004. The Taiwanese airline has been busy renewing its fleet in recent years.

This was despite a Qantas engineer placing \"remove before flight\" barricade streamer tape on the covered static ports the day before the flight. While the 14-plus-hour flight was uneventful, the incident triggered an investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Four static probes left covered on Qantas Dreamliner: On Tuesday, the ATSB released its findings concerning the September 22, 2021, incident. The aviation safety agency found the aircraft departed with reduced redundancy to the engine electronic control system because the coverings were left intact. The ATSB also found that Qantas' own procedures did not identify all of the aircraft's static ports, and the procedure for restoring the plane back to service did not reference Boeing procedures. This allowed different interpretations of which ports would be covered. The incident involved VH-ZNJ, which was due to fly a freight flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles on September 22. The night before, an engineer prepared the aircraft for the flight. This preparation included removing covers from the pitot probes and static ports. The following morning, before departure, one of the flight crew conducted a pre-flight exterior inspection, with no anomalies detected. The aircraft was also subject to a pre-departure exterior inspection by ground service dispatch personnel. Luckily, an uneventful flight to LAX: Around 09:00 the Dreamliner took off and set course for LAX. Flying time across the Pacific was 14 and half hours. The flight was described as \"uneventful.\" It was only during the post-flight inspection that the covered static ports were discovered. Static ports provide important air pressure data to aircraft systems, but the fuselage static ports and vertical fin static ports play the primary role. The fan cowl static port air pressure data is only used when an aircraft's engine electronic control determines that the data coming from the other static ports is unreliable. Before flying out of Melbourne, VH-ZNJ had sat idle for 39 hours. When an aircraft sits on the ground between 24 and 72 hours, Qantas requires it to be subject to 'normal' parking procedures. These parking procedures include fitting pitot covers and covering the static ports, in accordance with Boeing recommendations. The Boeing 787-9 has six fuselage, four engine fan cowl, and four vertical fin static ports. On the evening of September 21, a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer was tasked to return the Dreamliner to flight status. This included uncovering the pitot and fuselage static ports and completing the other maintenance tasks. The LAME was unaware that the fan cowl ports had been covered earlier, nor did they check. Second officer fails to see covered static ports: Another LAME was tasked to complete the return to service procedure the next morning. But the LAME did not inspect the aircraft, nor were they required to as part of this procedure. The certificate of release to service was signed off ahead of the flight crew arriving. Taking the plane to Los Angeles was a captain, two first officers, and two second officers. The captain tasked one of the second officers to conduct the pre-flight exterior inspection. The second officer commenced the exterior inspection at the aircraft's nose, in line with standard procedures. The pilot found a pitot cover on the apron but could not establish whether that cover came from VH-ZNJ or another plane. The pilot gave the cover to an engineer who was also out on the apron. Back in the cockpit, the second officer mentioned the cover found on the ground but reported no other problems, and the inspection completed. Just before pushback, a contracted Dnata dispatcher conducted their walk- around inspection and also did not notice the four covered static ports. The dispatcher gave the all-clear and the jet departed within minutes. Melbourne Airport CCTV footage revealed the fan cowl static port covers could be seen in certain views. Further, one of the LAMEs and an aircraft maintenance engineer walked past the engines several times while completing other maintenance tasks. However, there was no indication either specifically looked at the engine fan cowl. The CCTV footage also showed the second officer and the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections in line with the documented procedures and exterior inspection route. \"The tape on the engine fan cowls was not removed by that engineer, as per the manufacturer's procedures, and this wasn't identified by flight crew or dispatch during pre-departure checks, \" said ATSB Director Transport Safety Stuart Macleod on Tuesday. \"While the flight was uneventful, the covered ports meant redundancy for the engine electronic control system was reduced.\" The ATSB strikes a benign tone in its findings: A similar incident occurred in Australia four years ago. In July 2018, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300 left Brisbane with its three pitot probes covered and almost immediately began getting unreliable airspeed indications. The Airbus was able to turn around and land safely with assistance from Brisbane ATC. The ATSB made several findings regarding September's incident. The agency noted the meter-long tail of the 'remove before flight' tape covering the static ports was stuck down to prevent it from being torn from the fuselage in strong winds, as per Boeing's recommended procedure. \"This likely reduced the visibility of it covering the fan cowl static port covers,\" said Mr Macleod. The ATSB notes Qantas' maintenance procedures required the static ports to be covered but did not specify the locations, allowing potentially different interpretations of the procedure between LAMEs/engineers. In addition, the emphasis of the warnings was more in line with the fuselage static ports, rather than possible issues associated with the fan cowl or vertical fin covers not being removed. Action taken by Qantas: The ATSB reserved somewhat harsher judgment for the unfortunate second pilot and Dnata dispatcher. The ATSB said the second officer's inspection was \"non- normal.\" The safety agency also said the dispatcher did not conduct their exterior inspections per the documented procedures. \"This was a missed opportunity to assist engineers to readily access the current procedures and determine which ports were covered, and also allowed for different interpretations of which ports could be covered ,\" Mr Macleod said. \"When performing safety critical tasks like aircraft maintenance, it is very important that procedures are clear and unambiguous to avoid misinterpretation and error such as occurred in this incident.\" Qantas has since made some changes to how their engineers and flight crews deal with aircraft inspections, including issuing an internal memo issued to flight operations detailing the fan cowl static ports and that they may be covered during parking. In addition, the memo noted that engineering may not necessarily conduct an exterior inspection before dispatch and highlighted the importance of flight crew vigilance 'to ensure they are an effective last line of defense in assessing the aircraft's readiness for flight.'

The new addition to Lufthansa's fleet, registered D-ABPA and which will be officially named 'Berlin', is expected to arrive at the airline's maintenance facility in Frankfurt in Germany in the second half of 2022. Deliveries of the Dreamliner are curently suspended over manufacturing issues. Lufthansa, which has ordered 32 of the aircraft type, said it expected its first delivery following certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. After undergoing cabin refurbishments, the plane will be initially used on domestic routes for training purposes before operating on intercontinental flights to Toronto, Canada.. \"The Boeing 787-9 'Berlin' will have an improved cabin product - including direct aisle access for all guests in Business Class,\" Lufthansa wrote in a statement issued on June 1, 2022. Germany's largest airline estimated that the ultra-modern 787-9 will consume around 25% less kerosene than predecessor planes and will cut carbon emissions accordingly. \"The ultra-modern long-haul Dreamliner aircraft will consume an average of around 2.5 liters of kerosene per passenger and 100 kilometers flown,\" the airline noted. Lufthansa placed an initial order for 20 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2019, adding a further five in 2021. However, it decided to expand its order by a further seven aircraft on May 9, 2022, partly due to delays in the Boeing 777-9 program, where Lufthansa committed to being a launch customer for the model.

The 787 widebodies were excelling across the carrier's network before the pandemic rocked operations. Yet, Air Tahiti Nui General Manager Pacific Daniel Eggenberger highlighted to Simple Flying that in this recovery period, there is plenty of potential for twinjets. Recent additions: The flag carrier of French Polynesia outright purchased two of its 787-9s and leased another pair through Air Lease Corporation. Dubbed the Tahitian Dreamliner, the type initially debuted for the airline on flights between Tahiti and New Zealand. After two years of downturn, to the delight of carriers in the region, New Zealand's international borders opened two months ahead of schedule. Thus, since early May, Air Tahiti Nui has been the exclusive direct service carrier on the route between Auckland Airport (AUK) and Tahiti's Faa'a International Airport (PPT). The airline has also enjoyed a strong response on the connecting PPT-LAX flight. The 787-9s are continuing to increase their activity amid a strong desire to reconnect with the world after more than two years. The airline has moved from a once-weekly service in May to three flights a week starting from July for the Southern Hemisphere peak winter sun season. The thrice-weekly schedule will pick up again at the end of October for the duration of the Northern Hemisphere winter schedule. Satisfying demand: General Manager Pacific Eggenberger told Simple Flying the following about the benefits of the aircraft: \"Kiwis are among the world's greatest travellers. New Zealand has one of > the highest passport holder rates in the world and this coupled with being > so far from the rest of the world, New Zealanders are more likely to embark > on long-haul travel so their aviation experience usually carries the > expectation of larger, more comfortable aircraft.

The 787-9 Dreamliner offers a fuel > saving of roughly 30% compared to the previous aircraft type we had in our > fleet.\" The arrival of the plane brought Air Tahiti Nui's first premium economy product. It joined two other classes - economy and business. The 2-3-2 configured MOANA premium class features extra legroom and plenty of space with a 20.5-inch-wide seat at a pitch of 38 inches and a recline of eight inches. Offering a total capacity of 294 seats, there are 32 seats in premium, 30 in business, and 232 in economy. Along with the balance of comfort and capacity, Boeing's 787-9s consumed 20% less fuel than any plane in its class. Moreover, there are further costs to be saved due to factors such as the composite materials significantly reducing maintenance due to fatigue. Looking ahead: The goal for Air Tahiti Nui in the second half of 2022 is to catch up on the past two years and meet the strong demand from New Zealand and Australian markets to reconnect with the broader international network. There is also an increased focus on the transit market, and will become a bigger player from New Zealand to the United States. With costs and sustainability at the forefront of the aviation industry's mind in this next chapter, the 787-9 Dreamliner will do wonders to serve Air Tahiti Nui with its comfort and efficiency.

Different fate from initial orders: The plane is looking good despite having been parked for three years since it rolled out from the final assembly line in Everett. It has just received a fresh coat of paint in the easily distinguishable white and blue livery of Lufthansa. However, that was not what it was first destined to look like. D-ABPD was initially intended for China's Hainan Airlines and then Indian full-service carrier Vistara but was never taken up by either airline. The first Boeing 787 registered with Lufthansa is D-ABPA. This has the same Hainan/Vistara order log and is also not yet delivered to the German airline.

Boeing has not delivered any new 787 since May 2021 due to safety regulators finding production flaws in the aircraft. On July 17, Boeing said it was \"very close\" to restarting deliveries. Indeed, last Friday, although not yet officially confirmed, Boeing reportedly received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for its inspection and modification plan for the Dreamliner. Just yesterday, Thursday, August 4, FAA acting Administrator Billy Nolen met with safety inspectors in South Carolina to determine whether the aerospace manufacturer had done enough to finally be allowed to resume 787 deliveries. The FAA said, as quoted by Reuters, that the purpose of the visit was \"to ensure that the FAA is satisfied that Boeing has taken the appropriate steps to improve manufacturing quality and to guarantee the autonomy of workers who ensure regulatory compliance on the company's assembly lines.\"", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/lufthansa-second-boeing-787-9-painted/"}, {"title": "China Airlines To Replace Its Airbus A330s With 16 New Boeing 787s", "date": "2022-08-30", "content": "China Airlines has announced it will purchase 16 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners to replace its aging Airbus A330 fleet. The Taiwanese carrier also has the option for a further eight aircraft and expects deliveries to begin from 2025. China Airlines' billion-dollar Dreamliner deal: Taiwan's China Airlines has announced a deal with Boeing for 16 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. The carrier had been mulling over its options to replace its Airbus A330-300s and has now decided in favor of the US-based planemaker. According to Reuters, the deal is worth up to $4.6 billion at list prices, although Bloomberg reports it is worth around $2.1 billion based on estimates from aircraft appraiser Avitas. The agreement also entails options for another eight planes. This will be the first time China Airlines operates the Dreamliner and the second Taiwanese carrier to do so after EVA Air, which currently operates 10 Dreamliners and awaits delivery of a further 11 planes. The Dreamliner will become an integral part of China Airlines' medium and long-haul network, while the carrier also noted its spacious cargo capacity in the belly will further add to its value.

The 787-10 is the largest variant in the Dreamliner program and the least popular in terms of sales at 182 orders, falling short of the 787-9 and 787-8. As for China Airlines' Airbus A330-300 fleet, the carrier has 22 of the type with an average age exceeding 14 years. The vast majority of its A330 fleet is on lease, with the first aircraft arriving back in 2004. The Taiwanese airline has been busy renewing its fleet in recent years. This includes welcoming the Airbus A321neo to replace its Boeing 737-800s, along with the addition of the Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A350-900 in the last half-decade. Dreamliner program back on track: Today's announcement is another piece of good news for Boeing after the manufacturer resumed Dreamliner deliveries this month. As Simple Flying reported on August 10th, American Airlines took Boeing's first 787 Dreamliner delivery for 15 months. German carrier Lufthansa also took delivery of its first Boeing 787 this week, which was also the first 787-9 variant delivery in over a year. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner program has been beset with production problems that forced Boeing to suspend deliveries as it sought to fix the issues, which included poorly sized shims leaving gaps in the fuselage.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/china-airlines-to-buy-16-boeing-787s/"}, {"title": "High-Altitude Delivery: WestJet Gets 7th Boeing 787 Dreamliner", "date": "2022-09-04", "content": "On Friday, September 2nd, WestJet received its 7th Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner - its first new widebody aircraft since June 2020. With Boeing now able to deliver Dreamliners once again, WestJet can continue expanding its long-haul fleet and serve more European destinations. Today, let's take a look at the newest Boeing 787 operating out of Canada and its interesting delivery flight. Delivery flight and aircraft details: According to BOE Family Flights, the aircraft is a 787-9 variant registered as C-FAJA, with a manufacturer serial number 64982 and line number 1129. The aircraft was delivered on September 2nd and departed Boeings facilities in Charleston at 17:34. Flying for four hours and 14 minutes, FlightRadar24.com notes that the jet touched down at WestJet's main hub at Calgary International Airport at 19:48 local time. C-FAJA was first spotted at CHS in late May 2022 fully painted with engines installed. The jet had its first test flight on June 1st, with subsequent test flights taking place on June 10th and several times over the course of July and August. In total, the aircraft had nine test flights and had accumulated 16 hours and 21 minutes of flight time. High-altitude delivery flight? The one interesting point about the aircraft's delivery flight on Friday was the fact that it flew at a higher than usual altitude. Indeed, reporting on incidents and aircraft deliveries, we rarely get to see the 'red line' displayed by FlightRadar24.com for higher-altitude operations. Indeed, most flights that we see on this flight tracking service have a deep purple line, indicating a cruising altitude of around 35,000 feet. Rather than the typical cruising altitude, C-FAJA flew from Charleston to Calgary at 43,000 feet. So why is this? Well, as we explained in a 2019 article, pilots often choose to fly at this altitude as it is the optimum height for commercial operations. At this altitude, carriers avoid a massive amount of turbulence that would occur at lower levels. Additionally, most thunderstorms, severe weather incidents, and birds can be avoided while above 35,000 feet. Finally, the air at this height is even thinner, which further reduces the aircraft's drag, increasing its fuel efficiency. Newly-built, lucky number seven: Just like KLM's most recent Boeing 787-10 delivery, WestJet has had to wait quite some time for its newest 787-9 Dreamliner. This is, of course, due to Boeing's production issues, which needed to be worked out and cleared by the FAA. Interestingly, however, unlike KLM's recent 787 delivery, which has an airframe now nearly two and a half years old, WestJet's Dreamliner was actually built quite recently. With Boeing's backlog and extended time sorting out production issues, many Dreamliners were built but undeliverable. Overall, this means that many 787s which are \"newly delivered\" to airlines, will be as old as two or three years. When it comes to C-FAJA, however, the aircraft is now just four months old. WestJet's fleet of 787s is used to operate transatlantic services to London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, and Dublin. The airline also uses Boeing 737s to fly transatlantic from Halifax to several European destinations.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/westjet-gets-7th-boeing-787-dreamliner/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Lufthansa's first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner 'Berlin' will arrive in summer 2022", "date": "2022-06-01", "content": "Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa is expecting delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in summer 2022.

Interestingly, however, unlike KLM's recent 787 delivery, which has an airframe now nearly two and a half years old, WestJet's Dreamliner was actually built quite recently. With Boeing's backlog and extended time sorting out production issues, many Dreamliners were built but undeliverable. Overall, this means that many 787s which are \"newly delivered\" to airlines, will be as old as two or three years. When it comes to C-FAJA, however, the aircraft is now just four months old. WestJet's fleet of 787s is used to operate transatlantic services to London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, and Dublin. The airline also uses Boeing 737s to fly transatlantic from Halifax to several European destinations.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/westjet-gets-7th-boeing-787-dreamliner/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Why The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner Is The Perfect Fit For Air Tahiti Nui", "date": "2022-07-08", "content": "Air Tahiti Nui introduced the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to its services in November 2018, phasing out its previous Airbus A340-300 aircraft. The 787 widebodies were excelling across the carrier's network before the pandemic rocked operations. Yet, Air Tahiti Nui General Manager Pacific Daniel Eggenberger highlighted to Simple Flying that in this recovery period, there is plenty of potential for twinjets. Recent additions: The flag carrier of French Polynesia outright purchased two of its 787-9s and leased another pair through Air Lease Corporation. Dubbed the Tahitian Dreamliner, the type initially debuted for the airline on flights between Tahiti and New Zealand. After two years of downturn, to the delight of carriers in the region, New Zealand's international borders opened two months ahead of schedule. Thus, since early May, Air Tahiti Nui has been the exclusive direct service carrier on the route between Auckland Airport (AUK) and Tahiti's Faa'a International Airport (PPT). The airline has also enjoyed a strong response on the connecting PPT-LAX flight. The 787-9s are continuing to increase their activity amid a strong desire to reconnect with the world after more than two years. The airline has moved from a once-weekly service in May to three flights a week starting from July for the Southern Hemisphere peak winter sun season. The thrice-weekly schedule will pick up again at the end of October for the duration of the Northern Hemisphere winter schedule. Satisfying demand: General Manager Pacific Eggenberger told Simple Flying the following about the benefits of the aircraft: \"Kiwis are among the world's greatest travellers. New Zealand has one of > the highest passport holder rates in the world and this coupled with being > so far from the rest of the world, New Zealanders are more likely to embark > on long-haul travel so their aviation experience usually carries the > expectation of larger, more comfortable aircraft. Our all Tahitian > Dreamliner fleet satisfies this expectation and often exceeds it as our > recent design and service accolades show. Travellers the world over are also > placing an increased emphasis on 'climate friendly travel,' and so > environmental factors are very important. The 787-9 Dreamliner offers a fuel > saving of roughly 30% compared to the previous aircraft type we had in our > fleet.\" The arrival of the plane brought Air Tahiti Nui's first premium economy product. It joined two other classes - economy and business. The 2-3-2 configured MOANA premium class features extra legroom and plenty of space with a 20.5-inch-wide seat at a pitch of 38 inches and a recline of eight inches. Offering a total capacity of 294 seats, there are 32 seats in premium, 30 in business, and 232 in economy. Along with the balance of comfort and capacity, Boeing's 787-9s consumed 20% less fuel than any plane in its class. Moreover, there are further costs to be saved due to factors such as the composite materials significantly reducing maintenance due to fatigue. Looking ahead: The goal for Air Tahiti Nui in the second half of 2022 is to catch up on the past two years and meet the strong demand from New Zealand and Australian markets to reconnect with the broader international network. There is also an increased focus on the transit market, and will become a bigger player from New Zealand to the United States. With costs and sustainability at the forefront of the aviation industry's mind in this next chapter, the 787-9 Dreamliner will do wonders to serve Air Tahiti Nui with its comfort and efficiency.

The carrier had been mulling over its options to replace its Airbus A330-300s and has now decided in favor of the US-based planemaker.

As Simple Flying reported on August 10th, American Airlines took Boeing's first 787 Dreamliner delivery for 15 months. German carrier Lufthansa also took delivery of its first Boeing 787 this week, which was also the first 787-9 variant delivery in over a year. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner program has been beset with production problems that forced Boeing to suspend deliveries as it sought to fix the issues, which included poorly sized shims leaving gaps in the fuselage.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/china-airlines-to-buy-16-boeing-787s/"}, {"title": "High-Altitude Delivery: WestJet Gets 7th Boeing 787 Dreamliner", "date": "2022-09-04", "content": "On Friday, September 2nd, WestJet received its 7th Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner - its first new widebody aircraft since June 2020. With Boeing now able to deliver Dreamliners once again, WestJet can continue expanding its long-haul fleet and serve more European destinations. Today, let's take a look at the newest Boeing 787 operating out of Canada and its interesting delivery flight. Delivery flight and aircraft details: According to BOE Family Flights, the aircraft is a 787-9 variant registered as C-FAJA, with a manufacturer serial number 64982 and line number 1129. The aircraft was delivered on September 2nd and departed Boeings facilities in Charleston at 17:34. Flying for four hours and 14 minutes, FlightRadar24.com notes that the jet touched down at WestJet's main hub at Calgary International Airport at 19:48 local time. C-FAJA was first spotted at CHS in late May 2022 fully painted with engines installed. The jet had its first test flight on June 1st, with subsequent test flights taking place on June 10th and several times over the course of July and August. In total, the aircraft had nine test flights and had accumulated 16 hours and 21 minutes of flight time. High-altitude delivery flight? The one interesting point about the aircraft's delivery flight on Friday was the fact that it flew at a higher than usual altitude. Indeed, reporting on incidents and aircraft deliveries, we rarely get to see the 'red line' displayed by FlightRadar24.com for higher-altitude operations. Indeed, most flights that we see on this flight tracking service have a deep purple line, indicating a cruising altitude of around 35,000 feet. Rather than the typical cruising altitude, C-FAJA flew from Charleston to Calgary at 43,000 feet. So why is this? Well, as we explained in a 2019 article, pilots often choose to fly at this altitude as it is the optimum height for commercial operations. At this altitude, carriers avoid a massive amount of turbulence that would occur at lower levels. Additionally, most thunderstorms, severe weather incidents, and birds can be avoided while above 35,000 feet. Finally, the air at this height is even thinner, which further reduces the aircraft's drag, increasing its fuel efficiency.
