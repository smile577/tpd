NASA launched Messenger in the pre-dawn moonlight on the roundabout ramble through the inner solar system. The 6\u00bd-year trip should have started a day earlier, but clouds from Tropical Storm Alex postponed liftoff. \"A voyage of mythological proportions,\" a flight controller announced as soon as Messenger shed its final rocket stage. Applause erupted in launch control. \"That looked wonderful,\" said launch director Chuck Dovale. \"We bid Messenger farewell.\" Scientists have been yearning to study Mercury up-close ever since Mariner 10 zoomed by three times in the mid-1970s. If all goes well, come 2011, Messenger will be the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. The spacecraft cannot fly straight to Mercury; it does not carry nearly enough fuel. So it will fly once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury for gravity assists - and make 15 loops around the sun - before slowing enough to slip into orbit around the small, hot planet. Its seven scientific instruments will collect data for a full year in orbit around Mercury, an average 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) from the sun. That's 2\u00bd times closer to the sun than Earth - it would be as though 11 suns were beating down on Earth. Messenger will be blasted by up to 700-degree Fahrenheit (370-degree Celsius) heat once it reaches Mercury, but its instruments will operate at room temperature, protected by a custom-built ceramic-fabric sunshade just one-quarter of an inch (6 millimeters) thick. All Mariner 10 had was a quaintly old-fashioned umbrella. That's why, in large part, it's taken so long to return to Mercury. Scientists had to figure out how to beat the heat. Technology and opportunity converged only recently via NASA's low-cost, planetary-science Discovery program. The entire tab for the Messenger mission, developed and run by Johns Hopkins University, is $427 million. Mariner 10 provided \"a glimpse of this planet of extremes,\" said Orlando Figueroa, director of NASA's solar system exploration division. Because it only flew by Mercury and did not circle the planet, Mariner 10 observed less than half the orb. Messenger will view Mercury from all sides. \"I say we are long overdue for another visit with some permanence to help us unveil the secrets of this planet, the innermost and least understood of the terrestrial planets,\" Figueroa said.

The on-time space shoteasily made its 12-second window, with none of the delays that scrubbed a previous attempt to launch the spacecraft on Aug. 2. \"This was another great Boeing and NASA success as we bid MESSENGER farewell,\" said Chuck Dovale, NASA launch director at Kennedy SpaceCenter in Florida, after the launch.

The spacecraft used the tug of the planet's gravity to change its trajectory significantly, shrinking the radius of its orbit around the Sun and bringing it closer to Mercury. MESSENGER swung by Venus at 8:34 UTC (4:34 a.m. EDT), according to mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md. About 18 minutes after the approach, an anticipated solar eclipse cut off communication between Earth and the spacecraft. Contact was reestablished at 14:15 UTC (10:15 a.m. EDT) through NASA's Deep Space Network, and the team is collecting data to assess MESSENGER's performance during the flyby. Shortly before the Venus flyby the spacecraft entered superior conjunction, placing it on the exact opposite side of the sun as Earth, making communication between MESSENGER and Mission Operations difficult, if not impossible. \"So we are not making any scientific observations at the time of this flyby,\" says Sean C. Solomon, the mission's principal investigator, from the Carnegie Institution of Washington. \"We shall conduct a full suite of observations surrounding the second flyby in June 2007.\" In late November, when routine radio contact with the spacecraft is re-established, the team will collect data to determine how closely MESSENGER followed its plans and to update knowledge of its orbit. This information will enable operators to plan for the December 12 trajectory correction maneuver that will target the spacecraft for the second Venus flyby. The spacecraft is relying on multiple planetary flybys to \"catch\" Mercury and begin orbiting the planet. Another flyby of Venus in June of 2007 will further alter the spacecraft's orbit so that it will fly by Mercury in January of 2008. Three close approaches to Mercury will be required to bring the velocity of MESSENGER close enough to the orbital velocity of Mercury such that its main engine can brake the spacecraft into Mercury orbit in March of 2011. Earlier this month, the MESSENGER Dual Imaging System (MDIS) snapped pictures of Venus from a distance of about 16.5 million kilometers (10.3 million miles). Despite the low resolution of the images, it's possible to see that Venus is shrouded in a thick blanket of clouds that hides its surface. Also available online are updated animations, one showing Venus from the spacecraft from 90 minutes before to 90 minutes after the flyby, including the time of the eclipse. MESSENGER will conduct the first orbital study of Mercury, the least explored of the terrestrial (\"rocky\") planets that also include Venus, Earth and Mars. Over one Earth year or four Mercury years MESSENGER will provide the first images of the entire planet and collect detailed information on the composition and structure of Mercury's crust, its geologic history, the nature of its atmosphere and magnetosphere, and the makeup of its core and polar materials. MESSENGER, short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging, is the seventh mission in NASA's Discovery Program of lower cost, scientifically focused exploration projects. APL designed, built and operates the MESSENGER spacecraft and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Messenger was launched from Earth on 3 August 2004 on a mission to the solar system's innermost planet, Mercury. The Sun-scorched world has not been visited since NASA's Mariner 10 mission in the 1970s, and more than half its surface has never been mapped.

On June 5, MESSENGER will fly over Venus in a maneuver designed to use the pull of the planet's gravity to slow it down enough that it can slip into the orbit of Mercury. During the flyby, MESSENGER will decelerate from 22.7 to 17.3 miles per second (36.5 to 27.8 km/s). \"This change in MESSENGER's velocity is the largest of the mission,\" said MESSENGER mission systems engineer Eric Finnegan, of the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at John Hopkins University. MESSENGER will approach the Venus on the planet's dayside at more than 30,000 miles per hour (48,000 km/h), pass over the boundary separating day from night, and pass within 200 miles of the planet's surface while on its night side. The upcoming flyby will be MESSENGER's second pass by Venus. During the first flyby, in October 2006, no scientific observations were made because the planet was at superior conjunction, placing it on the opposite side of the sun from Earth. The closest approach on that flyby was about 1,800 miles (3,000 km) of the planet's surface. \"Because of superior conjunction, because we knew we were going into radio blackout, and we knew we had the second flyby coming up in June, we elected not to turn on any of the MESSENGER instruments at the time of that flyby,\" said the mission's principal investigator, Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The second Venus flyby will mark the first time MESSENGER's full suite of scientific instruments is turned on simultaneously, allowing scientists to test and calibrate them before turning them onto their main planetary objective next January. \"The approach geometry is sufficiently similar to that of Mercury, allowing the seven instrument-package to be turned on and operating collectively in scientific observing mode, just as they will be for Mercury,\" Finnegan said. MESSENGER is expected to collect more than 6 gigabytes of data about the Venus system and take more than 600 images during the 73- hour-flyby. The information will provide new observations about Venus's atmosphere, cloud structure, space environment, and perhaps even its surface. During its brief sojourn, MESSENGER will join a European spacecraft, Venus Express, that is currently in orbit around Venus. The two probes will work together to investigate how particles from the Sun's solar wind affects and controls the upper layers of Venus's atmosphere. \"By coordinating and comparing these observations, we will be able to maximize the science from both missions and potentially learn things that would not be revealed by one set of observations alone,\" said study team member Ralph McNutt, also of APL. Launched in August 2004, the MEcury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission is the first to visit our solar system's innermost planet in more than 30 years, ever since NASA's Mariner 10 mapped about 45 percent of its surface. MESSENGER's mission is to map the entire planet, as well as gather information about Mercury's composition and structure, its geologic history, and the makeup of its core and poles.

It also gave scientists a chance to test its instruments before reaching the innermost planet. During the flyby, Messenger teamed up with the European Venus Express (which has been orbiting Venus since April 2006) to carry out collaborative studies focusing on the planet's atmosphere. Messenger reached its closest point to Venus on Tuesday at 7:08 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, passing within 340 kilometers (210 miles) of the planet's surface. During this time, the largely solar-powered spacecraft fell into the shadow of the planet for 20 minutes and relied on its internal battery, which reached full charge again two hours later. The flyby went smoothly and all seven instruments were functional, according to scientists. \"This is the first time we are able to take observations [of Venus] from two different vantage points with complementary sets of instruments,\" said Messenger principle investigator Sean Solomon (Carnegie Institution of Washington) in a press conference. Scientists hope to observe cloud patterns, magnetic fields, and how the atmosphere interacts with the solar wind. One goal of studying Venus is to learn more about \"how climate change works on planets,\" explains Venus Express scientist Hakan Svedhem (European Space Agency). With a thick, dense atmosphere of mainly carbon dioxide and sulfuric-acid clouds, Venus has the strongest greenhouse effect of the planets in the solar system, says Svedhem, and studying it may lead to models for understanding Earth's climate. When Messenger flew by Venus the first time in October 2006, the planet was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, causing a radio blackout. Since noon Eastern time today, scientists have started to download the roughly 6 gigabits of data - 630-plus images and other observations - that Messenger took within its 73-hour observation period. By Friday they hope to have color pictures of Venus, according to Messenger engineer Eric Finnegan (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory). While past spacecraft have used planetary passes to launch themselves farther into space, Messenger's flybys of Venus are doing the opposite - the second flyby slowed the spacecraft from 36.5 to 27.8 kilometers per second so it can settle into Mercury's orbit. Aside from the planetary gravity assists, Messenger will execute three trajectory corrections using its main engine, and can take 13 additional maneuvers if needed. \"Over the next 18 months, the spacecraft will travel on a veritable roller coaster,\" says Finnegan. Messenger is scheduled to arrive at Mercury on January 14, 2008, Earth's first visitor to Mercury in more than three decades (the first was by Mariner 10). Messenger will take images of the never-before-seen side of the largely unstudied planet, sweeping by two more times in October 2008 and September 2009 to map most of the surface, record atmosphere composition, and gather data that will help scientists plan the yearlong orbital mission starting in March 2011.

Over the next several months the camera team will pore over the 614 images taken during this Venus encounter to ascertain color sensitivity and other optical properties of the instrument.

Recent photos of Mercury have revealed two new categories of crater that scientists are puzzling over how to explain. When NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft flew by the planet Jan. 14 it snapped pictures of several craters with strange dark halos and one crater with a spectacularly shiny bottom. \"The halos are really exceptional,\" said MESSENGER science team member Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"We've never seen anything like them on Mercury before and their formation is a mystery.\" Two of the craters are located in Mercury's giant Caloris Basin, a thousand- mile-wide depression formed billions of years ago when Mercury was struck by a comet or asteroid. The larger of the two is about 40 miles wide. Both craters have dark rims or \"halos,\" and one is partially filled with an unknown shiny material. Chapman offered two possible explanations for the halos: 1. The Layer Cake Theory: There could be a layer of dark material under the surface of Caloris Basin, resulting in chocolate-colored rims around craters that penetrate to just the right depth. If such a subterranean layer exists, however, it cannot be unique to the Basin. \"We've found a number of dark halos outside of Caloris as well.\" 2. The Impact Glass Model: Thermal energy from the impacts melted some of Mercury's rocky surface. Perhaps molten rock splashed to the edge of the craters where it re-solidified as a dark, glassy substance. Similar \"impact melts\" are found around craters on Earth and the moon. If this hypothesis is correct, future astronauts on Mercury exploring the crater rims would find themselves crunching across fields of tiny glass shards. Chapman noted that the moon also has some dark haloed craters. \"Tycho is a well-known example,\" he said. But lunar halos tend to be subtle and/or fragmentary. \"The ones we see on Mercury are much more eye-catching and distinct.\" The difference may be gravity. Lunar gravity is low. Any dark material flying out of a crater on the moon travels a great distance, spreading out in a diffusion that can be difficult to see. The surface gravity of Mercury, on the other hand, is more than twice as strong as the moon's. On Mercury, debris can't fly as far; it lands in concentrated form closer to the impact site where it can catch the attention of the human eye. None of these explanations account for the shiny-bottomed crater. \"That is an even bigger mystery,\" Chapman said. Superficially, the bright patch resembles an expanse of ice glistening in the sun, but that's not possible. The surface temperature of the crater at the time of the photo was around 400 degrees Celsius. Perhaps the shiny material is part of another subsurface layer, bright mixed with dark; that would be the Marbled Layer Cake Theory. \"I haven't heard any really convincing explanations from our science team,\" he said. \"We don't yet know what the material is, why it is so bright, or why it is localized in this particular crater.\" Fortunately, MESSENGER may have gathered the data researchers need to solve the puzzle. Spectrometers onboard the spacecraft scanned the craters during the flyby; the colors they measured should eventually reveal the minerals involved. \"The data are still being calibrated and analyzed,\" Chapman said. If they don't solve the mystery, scientists hope MESSENGER's two upcoming flybys - one in Oct. 2008 and another in Sept. 2009 - will do the trick. Eventually, Chapmain said, \"we'll get to the bottom of this mystery,\" and probably many more mysteries yet to be revealed.

Recent photos of Mercury have revealed two new categories of crater that scientists are puzzling over how to explain. When NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft flew by the planet Jan. 14 it snapped pictures of several craters with strange dark halos and one crater with a spectacularly shiny bottom. \"The halos are really exceptional,\" said MESSENGER science team member Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"We've never seen anything like them on Mercury before and their formation is a mystery.\" Two of the craters are located in Mercury's giant Caloris Basin, a thousand- mile-wide depression formed billions of years ago when Mercury was struck by a comet or asteroid. The larger of the two is about 40 miles wide. Both craters have dark rims or \"halos,\" and one is partially filled with an unknown shiny material. Chapman offered two possible explanations for the halos: 1. The Layer Cake Theory: There could be a layer of dark material under the surface of Caloris Basin, resulting in chocolate-colored rims around craters that penetrate to just the right depth. If such a subterranean layer exists, however, it cannot be unique to the Basin. \"We've found a number of dark halos outside of Caloris as well.\" 2. The Impact Glass Model: Thermal energy from the impacts melted some of Mercury's rocky surface. Perhaps molten rock splashed to the edge of the craters where it re-solidified as a dark, glassy substance. Similar \"impact melts\" are found around craters on Earth and the moon. If this hypothesis is correct, future astronauts on Mercury exploring the crater rims would find themselves crunching across fields of tiny glass shards. Chapman noted that the moon also has some dark haloed craters. \"Tycho is a well-known example,\" he said. But lunar halos tend to be subtle and/or fragmentary. \"The ones we see on Mercury are much more eye-catching and distinct.\" The difference may be gravity. Lunar gravity is low. Any dark material flying out of a crater on the moon travels a great distance, spreading out in a diffusion that can be difficult to see. The surface gravity of Mercury, on the other hand, is more than twice as strong as the moon's. On Mercury, debris can't fly as far; it lands in concentrated form closer to the impact site where it can catch the attention of the human eye. None of these explanations account for the shiny-bottomed crater. \"That is an even bigger mystery,\" Chapman said. Superficially, the bright patch resembles an expanse of ice glistening in the sun, but that's not possible. The surface temperature of the crater at the time of the photo was around 400 degrees Celsius. Perhaps the shiny material is part of another subsurface layer, bright mixed with dark; that would be the Marbled Layer Cake Theory. \"I haven't heard any really convincing explanations from our science team,\" he said. \"We don't yet know what the material is, why it is so bright, or why it is localized in this particular crater.\" Fortunately, MESSENGER may have gathered the data researchers need to solve the puzzle.

Scientists expect to get more than 1,200 pictures when NASA's Messenger spacecraft zips past Mercury early Monday, which would help reveal most of planet's remaining unmapped terrain. The flyby should also provide a gravity assist that will prepare Messenger to enter orbit around Mercury in March 2011. \"For needles with smaller and smaller eyes, this team is getting better and better,\" said Sean Solomon, Messenger's principal investigator at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, during a Wednesday teleconference. He described the maneuvers as a \"threading exercise\" requiring the highest precision. Messenger, short for the bulky name MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging, should pass 125 miles (200 kilometers) above Mercury, or roughly the same as the separation distance during a first flyby on Jan. 14. Its cameras and instruments will cover 30 percent of the planet surface, including never-before-seen areas on the western side of the planet opposite to the first flyby's coverage. No spacecraft has caught such close looks at the planet since NASA's Mariner 10 probe, which zipped by Mercury three times in 1974 and 1975. The earlier Mariner probe managed to map just 45 percent of the planet's surface during its three flybys, while Messenger scoped out half of the planet's uncharted surface during its first flyby. However, Messenger still needs to perform an intricate dance with Mercury before it can turn full-time photographer. Each flyby requires precise earlier adjustments to the spacecraft's course that normally use up precious onboard propellant. Mission planners skirted this issue and saved up more propellant for the spacecraft's later mission by taking advantage of the solar wind. \"Messenger is first interplanetary mission to use solar sailing as a means to control its trajectory,\" said Daniel O'Shaughnessy, the lead Messenger navigator at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. He added that they achieved accuracy within a third of a mile using \"only the subtle push of sunlight and without a single drop of propellant in over six months.\" The spacecraft will begin its 15,000-mph (24,140 kilometer per hour) flyby early Monday. Its team will occasionally lose contact as Messenger turns this way and that to take pictures and compile seven large image mosaics of the planet surface. The closest approach during the roughly 30-hour encounter is set for about 4:45 a.m. ET. A 17-minute power outage will occur as Messenger passes into Mercury's shadow, requiring the spacecraft to rely on internal batteries instead of its solar panels. The first Messenger flyby found evidence that volcanoes and not impacts had created Mercury's flat, smooth plains. It also showed that Mercury's magnetic field is elongated like a teardrop, with the solar wind pushing against the side closest to the sun and pressing it close to the surface. Messenger approaches its upcoming flyby as an experienced planetary hopper, having revisited Earth once and swung by Venus twice since its August 2004 launch. A third flyby of Mercury is scheduled for September 2009, before the spacecraft enters orbit in 2011.

The MASCS team is particularly interested in unusual surface deposits spotted by the camera during Messenger's previous flybys, McClintock says. \"One of the big questions planetary scientists have is how much iron there is on Mercury's surface,\" explains McClintock. \"We hope to pinpoint the iron, determine what chemical form it is in and how it is bound up on the planet's surface.\" Iron, which dominates Mercury's core, is responsible for maintaining the planet's magnetic field. The dynamic magnetic field of Mercury absorbs and stores energy from the powerful solar wind, periodically \"snapping like a rubber band\" and driving charged particles into the planet's surface, says McClintock. The collisions cause atoms of sodium, potassium, and calcium-and likely iron, silicon, and aluminum-to be ejected into the planet's wispy atmosphere, he adds. Some of the atoms are then accelerated by solar radiation pressure into the gigantic gas cloud tail, while others drift back down to the planet's surface, only to be lofted once again into the exosphere, where they make their way into the gaseous tail, he says.

The Messenger probe skimmed just 142 miles (228 km) above Mercury at its closest approach as it whipped around the planet during the flyby, the last of three designed to guide the spacecraft into orbit around the planet in 2011. The $446 million probe snapped several new images of Mercury during the flyby, despite a minor data hiccup that delayed the downlink of some of the images. One of the new images shows a bright spot on the planet's surface, a feature that scientists cannot yet explain. The new view was the third of the spot, which was first seen in telescopic images of Mercury obtained from Earth by astronomer Ronald Dantowitz. The second view was obtained by the Messenger Narrow Angle Camera during the spacecraft's second Mercury flyby Oct. 6, 2008. At that time, the bright feature was just on the planet's limb (edge) as seen from Messenger. Surprisingly, at the center of the bright halo is an irregular depression, which may have formed through volcanic processes. The object will be further investigated when Messenger arrives at its final orbit around Mercury. In the new images were also pictures of impact basins, including a double-ring impact basin, with another large impact crater on its south-southwestern side. Double-ring basins are formed when a large meteoroid strikes the surface of a rocky planet. The floor within the inner or peak ring appears to be smoother than the floor between the peak ring and the outer rim, possibly the result of lava flows that partially flooded the basin some time after impact. Some of these craters are relatively fresh, formed by more recent impacts. On Mercury, like the Earth's moon, even ancient impact craters can be preserved on the surface because there is no atmosphere to cause erosion and no plate tectonics to recycle the rock, as there are on Earth. One set of impact craters even coincidentally resemble a paw print. Messenger was also able to image some of the same terrain as it did in its second flyby, but this time with slightly different lightning conditions. Different angles of sunlight can better show the topography of the planet's surface.

As exciting as these observations will be, they are not the flyby's main purpose. \"The key objective for MESSENGER during this flyby is to steal a little of the planet's orbital energy,\" says Talcott. \"This will set it on a new course that will enable the spacecraft to orbit Mercury in 2011.\" When it returns to Mercury March 18, 2011, MESSENGER will fire its rocket and begin orbiting the planet. The spacecraft will follow a highly elliptical path that will bring it closest to the planet's north pole. This primary mission is scheduled to last 1 Earth year, during which scientists will get a detailed look at Mercury's global environment.

The MESSENGER probe skimmed just 142 miles (228 km) above Mercury at its closestapproach as it whipped around the planet during the flyby, the last of threedesigned to guide the spacecraft into orbit around the planet in 2011. The spacecraftwas expected to snap about 1,559 newphotographs of Mercury, some of regions never before observed up close. \"Radio signals received after the spacecraftemerged from behind the planet indicate that the spacecraft is operatingnominally,\" said flight controllers at MESSENGER \"smission operations center at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory(JHUAPL) in Laurel, Md., in a statement. \"Its instruments are now collectingimages and other scientific measurements from the planet as it departs Mercury.\" The firstnew images from the flyby are expected to be released on Wednesday. MESSENGER made its closest approach to Mercury at about 5:55 p.m. EDT (2155 GMT) when itsped by at about 12,000 mph (19,312 kph). The probethen flew behind Mercury, passing out of communications with Earth for about anhour before restoring contact. Mercury's gravity was expected to slow MESSENGER by about 6,000 mph (9,656 kph) during the flyby and place it on track to enter orbitin March 2011. MESSENGER snapped a photoof the planet Sunday that revealed it as a half-lit, desolate-looking worldas seen from a distance of about 418,000 miles (672,000 km) away. The $446 million spacecraft flew by Mercury twice in 2008 to map the planet inunprecedented detail while using the rocky world's gravitational pull to refineits flight path through space. \"Aplanetary flyby is really like Christmas morning for scientists,\" said MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution ofWashington before the rendezvous. \"We expect to be surprised and we expect to be delighted.\" In all, MESSENGER has photographed about 90 percent of Mercury's surface and was expected to cover another 5 percent of unmapped terrain when it flewby today. The spacecraft is the first probe to visit Mercury since NASA's Mariner 10 mission in the mid-1970s. Unlike MESSENGER's first two flybys - which revealed the firstclose-up views of Mercury in decades - Tuesday's rendezvous was aimed atobserving specific points onthe planet's surface. The probe was commanded to target its camera eyes at interestingcraters, measure Mercury's magnetosphere and tenuous atmosphere, as well asstudy the planet's odd, comet-like tail of trace gases. \"This isthe last look at Mercury's equatorial region, and it's the last time we flythrough the tail,\" Solomon said. When MESSENGER arrives in its final orbit around Mercury, it will begin along-awaited observation phase that will complete its new maps of the planet.NASA launched MESSENGER - short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry,and Ranging - in 2004.

Messenger will take high-resolution color images of the surface terrain before making a clever gravity-assist maneuver that will steer it into orbit around the rocky planet beginning in March 2011. The spacecraft also will be taking ultraviolet and visible light measurements of the harsh planet's surface, its tenuous atmosphere, and a comet-tailed gas cloud 25,000 miles long that trails behind the planet. Messenger is carrying seven instruments-a camera, a magnetometer, an altimeter, and four spectrometers-and includes University of Colorado at Boulder's Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, or MASCS. Despite the spacecraft's eye-popping speed, rapid rotation maneuvers during the flyby will allow the MASCS instrument to \"stare\" at a handful of selected targets such as surface craters as the spacecraft passes overhead, says CU-Boulder senior research associate William McClintock. \"We will be pointing at each individual target from several different angles during the flyby, which will allow us to collect more data,\" says McClintock of CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and a Messenger mission coinvestigator who led the development of the MASCS instrument. The MASCS team is particularly interested in unusual surface deposits spotted by the camera during Messenger's previous flybys, McClintock says. \"One of the big questions planetary scientists have is how much iron there is on Mercury's surface,\" explains McClintock. \"We hope to pinpoint the iron, determine what chemical form it is in and how it is bound up on the planet's surface.\" Iron, which dominates Mercury's core, is responsible for maintaining the planet's magnetic field. The dynamic magnetic field of Mercury absorbs and stores energy from the powerful solar wind, periodically \"snapping like a rubber band\" and driving charged particles into the planet's surface, says McClintock. The collisions cause atoms of sodium, potassium, and calcium-and likely iron, silicon, and aluminum-to be ejected into the planet's wispy atmosphere, he adds. Some of the atoms are then accelerated by solar radiation pressure into the gigantic gas cloud tail, while others drift back down to the planet's surface, only to be lofted once again into the exosphere, where they make their way into the gaseous tail, he says. McClintock says that after the third and final flyby, the researchers will have collected about the same amount of data as they will gather during a single orbit around Mercury. Once Messenger settles into a yearlong pattern of twice-a-day orbits around Mercury in 2011, analyzing the massive streams of images and data \"will be like drinking from a fire hose,\" says McClintock. The 4.9-billion-mile journey to Mercury requires Messenger to make more than 15 loops around the sun to guide it closer to Mercury's orbit. The craft is equipped with a large sunshade made from a heat-resistant ceramic fabric to protect it from the sun. \"During this third encounter, the Messenger camera will again image areas never before seen at close range, and we will obtain color images of other regions at resolutions superior to those of previous observations,\" says Messenger principal investigator Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

The $446 million probe snapped several new images of Mercury during the flyby, despite a minor data hiccup that delayed the downlink of some of the images. One of the new images shows a bright spot on the planet's surface, a feature that scientists cannot yet explain. The new view was the third of the spot, which was first seen in telescopic images of Mercury obtained from Earth by astronomer Ronald Dantowitz. The second view was obtained by the Messenger Narrow Angle Camera during the spacecraft's second Mercury flyby Oct. 6, 2008. At that time, the bright feature was just on the planet's limb (edge) as seen from Messenger. Surprisingly, at the center of the bright halo is an irregular depression, which may have formed through volcanic processes. The object will be further investigated when Messenger arrives at its final orbit around Mercury. In the new images were also pictures of impact basins, including a double-ring impact basin, with another large impact crater on its south-southwestern side. Double-ring basins are formed when a large meteoroid strikes the surface of a rocky planet. The floor within the inner or peak ring appears to be smoother than the floor between the peak ring and the outer rim, possibly the result of lava flows that partially flooded the basin some time after impact. Some of these craters are relatively fresh, formed by more recent impacts. On Mercury, like the Earth's moon, even ancient impact craters can be preserved on the surface because there is no atmosphere to cause erosion and no plate tectonics to recycle the rock, as there are on Earth. One set of impact craters even coincidentally resemble a paw print.

Which brings up one of Mercury's red herrings. Previous studies have indicated that the planet's surface is made up mostly of silicate-based minerals. That's been considered odd, since the vast majority of the planet is taken up by an iron-titanium core, notes David Lawrence, another Messenger mission scientist. Then, during the first Mercury flyby on Jan. 14, 2008, Messenger detected unexpectedly high levels of iron and titanium in surface minerals, he says. Flyby No. 3 provided an opportunity to check those initial results. It found that the first measurements were no fluke; the planet really is covered virtually universally with iron and titanium oxides. That's more consistent with what you'd expect from a largely metallic planet like Mercury, Dr. Lawrence adds. But it calls current models of the planet's formation into question. To explain how a largely Ironman planet came to be covered with a largely silicate crust, some scientists had invoked a powerful impact early in the planet's history. This would have knocked away much of the planet's original iron-rich crust, leaving a thinner shell dominated by silicates. But now that the crust appears to be dominated by these metal oxides, the cosmic smackdown theory requires a hard second look. And that's just one of three broad groups of ideas scientists have considered to explain the now-debunked surface silicate. \"This is a pretty exciting result for us,\" says Lawrence, a geochemist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, which built and runs the desk-sized Messenger spacecraft.

Sean Solomon, principal investigator for NASA's MESSENGER mission, said the spacecraftis poised to enter orbit around Mercury next March to build the most detailed maps ever made of the planet. \"Mercuryis not what we thought it was even 2 1/2 years ago,\" Solomon said during apublic lecture this week at the American Museum of Natural History here as partof the 73rd Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society. After three flybys of Mercury, MESSENGER has beamed home stunning views of the cratered world and provided a fresh look into its volcanic past and tenuous atmosphere. But the best is still to come, Solomon said. NASA'sMESSENGER probe, short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry,and Ranging, is the first spacecraft to examine Mercury up close since thespace agency's Mariner 10 mission in the mid-1970s. Inaddition to the new global maps, MESSENGER scientists hope the mission willfind new clues on how Mercury was formed, how it evolved, and how it generated its magneticfield. \"We'retrying to learn how a planet very near its host star differs from others thatare more far out and more massive,\" Solomon said. \"Exploring theinner part of our solar system is to understand our place in the solarsystem.\" While MESSENGER's main mission is to orbit Mercury, the probe had to perform six different flybys that took it past Earth once, Venus twice and Mercury three times.Each time, the spacecraft used the gravity of each planet flyby to refine itsflight path through space. Thegravitational tugs from the flybys also work to slow the spacecraft's speedenough so that MESSENGER's propulsion system can successfully execute itsscheduled \"orbital insertion\" on March 18, 2011, putting thespacecraft in an elliptical orbit around Mercury. \"Wecould have gotten to Mercury in four or five months, as Mariner 10 did, but wecan't get into orbit flying that fast,\" Solomon said. \"We have to begoing by Mercury slowly enough so that the propulsion system can perform theorbit insertion.\" Threeof the six flybys had MESSENGER swooping by Mercury itself ? in January andOctober of 2008, then again in September 2009. Theflyby events allowed the probe to snap pictures of Mercury's surface, enabling scientists to map the planet inunprecedented detail. The first flyby alone returned 1,317 images. Inone of the flybys, MESSENGER was also able to take measurements of the planet'smagnetic field over one hemisphere. Mercury was found to have a dominantlydipolar magnetic field 'with opposite magnetic poles' with the dipole beingclosely aligned with the planet's spin axis, said Solomon. This seems to suggest that Mercury's magnetic field is similar to Earth, and waspossibly generated in the same way. Once MESSENGER enters the orbital stage ofits mission, researchers will be able to study this in greater detail.Scientists will also be interested in looking for evidence of volcanicprocesses on Mercury, said Solomon. MESSENGER is expected to enter Mercury's orbit on March 18, 2011. The propulsion systemwill fire for 15 minutes, placing the spacecraft in an initial orbit aroundMercury at an altitude of 124 miles. Eachelliptical orbit will last 12 hours, meaning the probe will circle the planettwice per Earth day. At the time of orbit insertion, MESSENGER will be 28.7million miles from the sun, and 96.4 million miles away from Earth. The $446 million MESSENGER spacecraft launched in August 2004 and is fully fundedto orbit Mercury for one Earth year, which is equivalent to just over four ofMercury's 88-day years. Solomon is currently writing a proposal to extend themission beyond the initial timeframe. \"Wethink we have ample propellant not only for that one year, but probably for ayear or two after that,\" Solomon said. \"But, we'll eventually run outof propellant or NASA dollars, and that will cause the probe to impact thesurface.\" Still,the MESSENGER probe has already yielded important results, and has paved theway for future missions to our innermost planet including a joint European Space Agency and Japanese space agency mission that will launch two spacecraft in 2014 to study Mercury. And beyond that, Solomon has his sights set on a future sample-return mission to Mercury. \"It'll probably not happen nearly as soon as one to an asteroid and eventually Mars, but I think it's the next thing to do,\" Solomon said.

Since its launch in August 2004, Messenger has revolutionized the way astronomers think about the closest planet to the sun. Combined with data from the Mariner 10 mission in the '70s, astronomers have mapped 98 percent of the planet's surface. The video above, compiled from photos snapped as Messenger flew by Mercury in 2008, reveals huge impact craters and evidence of recent volcanic eruptions that were thought to be impossible on such a small, hot world. Other on-board instruments measured Mercury's magnetic field and tenuous atmosphere. But so far, Messenger's trip has been a tease. The spacecraft has spent the last seven years careening around the inner solar system, catching just three quick glances of Mercury as it flew by. Once Messenger gets into orbit, the real work will begin. \"We'll be constantly taking data,\" said principal investigator Sean C. Solomon, a planetary scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, in a talk Feb. 20 at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. One of the most exciting questions Messenger might answer is whether Mercury, like the moon, hides water ice in shadowed craters. Every part of Mercury's surface spends some time in daylight. But there are impact craters near the poles that are in permanent shadow. \"They don't see the sun for millions, probably billions of years,\" Solomon said. \"They're very cold - cold enough to preserve water ice for geologically long periods of time.\" Messenger's neutron spectrometer, an instrument that measures the concentrations of different kinds of uncharged particles that are knocked off Mercury's surface by cosmic rays, should be able to detect hydrogen in craters' dark corners, a signature of water ice. Other spectrometers - one that measures gamma rays and another that measures X-rays - could help figure out what Mercury's surface is made of. The flybys showed definitively that Mercury has had active volcanoes in its recent past, but didn't show the makeup of the stuff that was erupted. \"We're building up a catalog of probable volcanic centers, many of which appear to involve explosive volcanism,\" Solomon said. \"That is a surprise.\" On Earth, Mars and the moon, volcanic eruptions are explosive only if the magma is full of volatile materials that form bubbles easily, like nitrogen, carbon dioxide and ammonia. For Mercury to have as many explosive volcanoes as it seems to, it would have to have much higher concentrations of volatile chemicals than Earth. That's surprising because Mercury was thought to have been extremely hot when it formed, which ought to have forced all the volatiles to evaporate, Solomon said. Instead, Mercury's formation might have been more like the moon's. \"The comparison between Mercury and the moon will have a lot to tell us,\" Solomon said. Planetary scientists hope to decipher the planet's inside as well as its outside. Earlier observations show that Mercury's core makes up 60 percent of the planet by mass, making the planet unusually dense. Mercury is also the only planet in our solar system other than Earth whose magnetic field is probably driven by a molten metal core that drives a dynamo. Under Messenger's continuous watch, astronomers can finally figure out what's going on inside Mercury, which can give insight into how all the rocky planets formed in the early solar system.

Scientists are hoping the mission will solve a host of mysteries about our neighboring planet. Entering orbit will be \"the culmination of the mission, the principle objective,\" said Messenger principal investigator Sean Solomon, speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February. \"We can look forward to an enormous increase in understanding of one of our nearest planetary neighbors,\" said Solomon, who also serves as the director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Messenger is slated to conduct a 14-minute engine burn on March 17at 8:45 p.m. EDT to arrive in orbit around Mercury. After a short checkout, the spacecraft will begin high-resolution mapping of the planet's surface by April 4. \"We cannot wait for orbital insertion,\" Solomon told SPACE.com. \"The science team is ready to start taking orbital observations, so we are very much looking forward to what all of us hope is a successful orbit insertion into the desired science orbit.\" The $446 million Messenger probe launched in August 2004. Over the course of three flybys of Mercury, the spacecraft has already furthered scientists' understanding of the closest planet to the sun. It has revealed a tenuous atmosphere around the small planet, and evidence for a volcanic past. Volcanism on Mercury is \"aquestion that had been debated for 30 years,\" Solomon said. NASA's Mariner 10 probe, which flew by the planet in the mid-1970s, imaged some plains on Mercury that suggested they may have been laid down as lava flows, but the images were inconclusive. More recent studies from Messenger imaging provide further evidence for volcanic activity on Mercury in the last 1 million to 2 million years. \"We're building up a catalog of probable volcanic centers, many of which seem to have involved explosive volcanism,\" Solomon said. \"That's surprising.\" Messenger has also revealed features called lobate scarps, where one block of the planet's crust has been thrust over another, in what seems to be the result of a planet-wide contraction. At this point, about 98 percent of Mercury's surface has been imaged. Messenger will make up the rest, and image the surface in greater detail, and under better lighting conditions, than ever before. Overall, the new knowledge gained will help paint a better picture of how Mercury, as well as the solar system as a whole, formed and evolved.

On Thursday, the NASA MESSENGER started orbiting the planet. In the 50-year history of solar-system exploration, instrument-loaded orbiters have circled Earth, Mars, the moon, and Venus, as well as giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. Tiny Mercury, however, long had been excluded from the itinerary as just too tough a mission to pull off - until now. At 9:10 Eastern time Thursday night, controllers overseeing the NASA MESSENGER mission to Mercury saw the first evidence that their spacecraft had safely inserted itself into orbit around the first rock from the sun. The news met with an eruption of cheers and handshakes from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which built the craft. \"You only go into orbit for the first time around Mercury once in human history, and that's what we've done tonight,\" said Edward Weiler, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, who was on hand as the mission achieved the crucial milestone. Twelve years ago, the project existed only as PowerPoint slides and charts, he said. Now, the team has added Mercury as the sixth planet to come under the scrutiny of an instrument-laden artificial satellite. \"We're all a little sleep deprived, but it's tremendously exciting\" to see the craft safely in orbit, said the the mission's lead scientist, Sean Solomon, Friday morning. Dr. Solomon is a planetary scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington. The only other mission to take Mercury's measure was NASA's Mariner 10, which conducted three flybys of the planet in 1974. Despite its relative dearth of robotic visitors, the planet is of keen interest to scientists studying the solar system and its evolution. Mercury is the smallest planet, yet for its size, it's thought to have an enormous iron core - accounting for 60 percent of the planet's mass, compared with some 30 percent for Earth's core. Far more of Mercury's core is thought to be solid, compared with Earth's. Although Mariner's results sparked interest in sending an orbiter, Mercury has languished on the solar-system-exploration agenda in large part because of its extreme environment, which a spacecraft must endure. At some 36 million miles from the sun, temperatures on the planet's daylight half hit 800 degrees F., while temperatures on the night half plunge to nearly minus 300 degrees F. - a 1,100-degree temperature swing that the craft will experience every 12 hours. The craft is outfitted with a ceramic-cloth sun shield that sheds enough of the sun's heat to keep instruments inside the orbiter at room temperature. Solar panels, which ordinarily would aim face-on to the sun, must be feathered, like a rowboat oar, to keep the panels from overheating. In addition, the panels contain mirrors to help shed some of the intense sunlight. The business side of the craft, which will be facing the planet's roasting surface on the sunlit side, also requires a cool-down. Thus the craft's orbit will take it to within 124 miles of the surface on the sunlit side and out to just over 9,000 miles on the night side for cooling. Also on that side, the craft will take measurements of the space environment in Mercury's immediate vicinity. MESSENGER is expected to help provide an explanation for the planet's structure, in addition to gathering detailed information on the topography and composition of its surface. One intriguing mystery involves odd signatures from Earth-based radar observations of crater floors at Mercury's poles. The bottoms of these craters are in permanent shadow, similar to craters at the moon's poles. On the moon, those crater floors have been shown to contain relatively high abundances of water ice. With Mercury's polar craters returning radar signatures similar to those from other, well-known icy regions on Mars or on Jupiter's moons, scientists are eager to see if Mercury also might have frigid reservoirs of water ice, despite its proximity to the sun. The MESSENGER craft will undergo about two weeks of commissioning, where scientists will test their instruments in a true Mercury environment. After that, \"the fun begins,\" Solomon says, anticipating a stream of intriguing results that will have the science team \"drinking from a fire hose.\"", "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0318/NASA-milestone-MESSENGER-spacecraft-enters-orbit-around-Mercury"}, {"title": "Ice on Mercury? NASA Probe May Solve That Mystery and Others", "date": "2011-03-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft now circling Mercury is set to tackle some big mysteries of the scorched, tiny world - including whether or not water ice lurks in its shadowy craters. NASA's Messenger probe became the first spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury when it arrived at the planet on March 17. While the spacecraft won't officially start its yearlong science mission until April 4, the observations it's already made hint at many discoveries to come, researchers said. \"We're really seeing Mercury now with new eyes,\" Messenger principal investigator Sean Solomon, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, told reporters today. \"As a result, an entire global perspective is unfolding, and will continue to unfold over the next few months.\" The search for water ice on the blisteringly hot planet is one of the mission's driving motivations. Though Mercury's surface temperatures can top 842 degrees Fahrenheit, ice may survive on the floors of permanently shadowed polar craters. And about 20 years ago, radar data first picked up intriguing evidence of reflective materials at Mercury's poles that might just be water ice, researchers said. \"Could ice be trapped there? The thermal models say yes, it's possible,\" Solomon said. \"But is it water ice? There are alternative ideas.\" Messenger will also investigate other questions about Mercury - why it's so much denser than the other rocky planets, for example. Also, the mission team wants to learn more about how the planet's core is structured, the nature of its global magnetic field and other aspects of Mercury's composition and history. That work will start in earnest next week. In the meantime, scientists are sifting through the spacecraft's increasing pile of new Mercury photos. By the end of tomorrow, it will have snapped 1,500 photos of the planet from orbit, researchers said - more than it captured during its three previous flybys of the planet in 2008 and 2009. Messenger - whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging - is still officially in a commissioning phase, during which time mission scientists are checking out its cameras and other instruments. But the probe has not been idly waiting for its main mission to start. Messenger snapped the first photos of Mercury from orbit yesterday, imaging previously unseen areas of the planet - terrain near the poles that Messenger missed on its three flybys. \"We are delighted to be able to see the surface at the very high latitudes,\" Solomon said. So far, everything is going well with Messenger's mission and its instruments. \"All subsystems and instruments are on and operating nominally, within specifications,\" said Messenger mission systems engineer Eric Finnegan, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. \"This is a tremendous achievement for the entire Messenger team.\" Over the next 12 months, Messenger will continue taking pictures and peering at Mercury with its seven instruments, mapping the planet's surface and helping scientists better understand its composition, tenuous atmosphere and geologic history. This information could shed light on how our solar system formed and evolved - and perhaps, by extension, how alien planetary systems have come about as well, researchers said. The observations Messenger has made from orbit thus far suggest the probe will beam home all sorts of eye-opening information, researchers said. It may, for instance, help researchers learn why Mercury - like Earth - has a global magnetic field, while its rocky planet cousins Mars and Venus do not. In its first five days in orbit, Messenger tripled the number of spacecraft observations of Mercury's magnetic field available to astronomers, researchers said. \"We are rapidly ramping up a much larger dataset with which to characterize the geometry of Mercury's magnetic field,\" Solomon said. \"That will tell us a lot about Mercury's internal structure and dynamics.\" The $446 million Messenger probe launched in August 2004. The spacecraft is now in an extremely elliptical orbit that brings it within 124 miles of Mercury at the closest point and retreats to more than 9,300 miles away at the farthest point. While Messenger is the first mission ever to orbit Mercury, it is not the first spacecraft to visit the planet. NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft flew by the planet three times in the mid-1970s. On April 4, Messenger will start mapping and studying the entire surface of Mercury, a process that is expected to require about 75,000 images. But the early science returns have whetted the appetites of mission scientists, who can't wait for the data to really start pouring in. \"It's just a wonderful adventure for those of us on the science team that have front-row seats for these new data that are coming down,\" Solomon said. \"It's a wonderful time in the history of exploration of planet Earth's neighborhood, and we are delighted to be a part of that.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/11263-nasa-mercury-photos-results-messenger.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Extends MESSENGER Mission", "date": "2011-11-15", "content": "NASA has announced that it will extend the MESSENGER mission for an additional year of orbital operations at Mercury beyond the planned end of the primary mission on March 17, 2012.

Using observations from NASA's Messenger spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, researchers have found that the planet's huge iron core is even larger than they had thought, and it's likely overlain with a solid shell of iron and sulfur - a layered structure not known to exist on Earth, Venus or Mars. And there's more: Mercury appears to have remained geologically active for a surprisingly large chunk of its evolutionary history, researchers said. \"Many scientists expected Mercury, being a small planet only slightly larger than the moon, to have cooled off not long after it formed and to be essentially 'dead' for most of its evolution,\" said Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lead author of one of the new studies and a co-author on the other. \"But it appears that Mercury had an exciting and active middle age.\" The $446 million Messenger spacecraft launched in 2004. It then took a circuitous route to the solar system's innermost planet, becoming the first probe ever to orbit Mercury in March 2011. Since then, Messenger has been zipping around the baking-hot planet - which orbits the sun from just 36 million miles away, compared to 93 million miles for Earth - once every 12 hours. The probe is mapping Mercury's surface and gathering data on the planet's composition, magnetic environment and tenuous atmosphere, among other features. To date, Messenger has taken nearly 100,000 images and made more than 4 million measurements of the planet's surface, researchers said. Messenger's original science campaign was designed to last one Earth year, but NASA announced in November that it had granted the spacecraft a one-year mission extension. Messenger officially began its extended mission earlier this week. The two new studies, which both appear in the March 23 issue of the journal Science, detail findings that should help scientists better understand Mercury's murky past. In one study, researchers used observations made by Messenger's laser altimeter to map the topography of Mercury's northern hemisphere. They found that the range of elevations was smaller than that found on either Mars or the moon. Messenger also observed that the floors of many Mercury craters have been tilted substantially. Part of the floor of the Caloris basin - at 960 miles across one of the largest impact features in the solar system - has even been raised above its rim. These discoveries suggest that internal forces pushed the craters up after the impacts created them, providing strong evidence that Mercury remained geologically active long after its formation. This may surprise many scientists given the planet's small size, Zuber said. \"It is not out of the question that Mercury is still active today,\" she told SPACE.com via email, \"though I note that this is not very likely, and for sure we have not observed an active eruption or extrusion.\" Researchers also estimated Mercury's gravity field by precisely radio-tracking Messenger's movements around the planet. From these estimates, they determined that Mercury has \"mascons,\" large positive gravity anomalies associated with big impact basins. \"These were first discovered on the moon in 1968 and caused great problems in the Apollo program because they tugged low-orbiting spacecraft around and made navigation difficult,\" Zuber said. \"Subsequently mascons were discovered on Mars, and now we find out that Mercury has them, so they appear to be a common feature of terrestrial planetary bodies.\" The team's gravity calculations also suggest that Mercury has an iron core that comprises roughly 85 percent of the planet's radius. Scientists had suspected the planet's core is big, but many will be surprised that it's so gigantic, Zuber said. Further, it looks like a layer of solid iron sulfide overlies Mercury's core - a feature not known to exist on any other terrestrial planet, researchers said. The new findings should help shed light on Mercury's past, and on the formation and evolution of rocky planets in general. But they also serve to remind scientists that they're in for many more surprises as they continue to probe the solar system's many mysteries, Zuber said. \"With new data, we are continually reminded that when you think you know what's going on you probably don't,\" she added. \"Nature is more perplexing than we can possibly conceive.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/14978-mercury-discoveries-messenger-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Data from MESSENGER spacecraft reveals new insights on planet Mercury", "date": "2012-03-22", "content": "Thanks to the MErcury Surface, Space Environment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft, and a mission that took more than 10 years to complete, scientists now have a good picture of the solar system's innermost planet. On March 17, MESSENGER completed its one-year primary mission, orbiting Mercury, capturing nearly 100,000 images, and recording data that reveals new information about the planet's core, topography, and the mysterious radar-bright material in the permanently shadowed areas near the poles. \"Mercury is the last unexplored planet,\" said Stanton Peale from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The way Mercury was formed, he said, may show some constraints on the formation of the solar system. For one thing, Mercury's core is larger than expected - almost 85 percent of the planetary radius. The Earth's core, in contrast, is just over half of the planet's radius. Additionally, Mercury appears to have a more complex core than Earth's - a solid iron sulfide layer that is now part of the mantle that encases a liquid core, which may float on a solid inner core. The scientists also found that Mercury's solid outer core and liquid inner core contain more iron than Earth, relative to the whole planet, which influences the way Mercury's magnetic field was generated. However, Peale noted that the surface is comprised of lighter elements. \"We didn't expect so much sulfur,\" he said, adding that there was almost no iron found on the surface of the planet. With no iron, the volcanic surface rocks are too light to have come from a mantle with the large average density derived for the internal structure. This led to the concept of a two-layer mantle - a light upper silicate layer that could provide the low-density surface material over a dense iron sulfide layer. In the larger picture, the presence of inordinately large amounts of sulfur on the surface indicates that Mercury's formation was not as orderly as some scientists had previously assumed, according to Peale. \"Mercury is composed of material that had condensed over a wide range from the Sun,\" he said. Other findings include a precise topographic model of the planet's northern hemisphere, which reveals a smaller spread in elevations compared to those of Mars or the Moon. Additionally, radar-bright features at the poles located in areas of permanent shadow have been found to be consistent with a water-ice hypothesis; however, the notion has yet to be tested further with MESSENGER's neutron spectrometer.

The magnetic field of this magnetosphere reaches all the way to Mercury's core, limiting the strength of the field created by the planet's interior, researchers said. \"The magnetic coupling between the magnetosphere and the dynamo in the planetary interior yields a weakened dynamo that can explain the enigmatic weakness of the magnetic field of Mercury,\" said study lead author Daniel Heyner, a physicist at Technical University in Braunschweig, Germany. Scientists plan to test the accuracy of their models using data on Mercury's magnetic field and magnetosphere collected by MESSENGER and by the European BepiColombo mission due to launch in 2014, researchers said. \"This is quite a challenge, as the magnetosphere is small and very dynamic,\" Heyner told SPACE.com. The growing number of alien planets that astronomers are discovering around distant stars may also offer insights into how planetary dynamos \"are controlled by the stellar wind of stars that are in a different evolutionary phase compared to our sun,\" Heyner added. Heyner and his colleagues detail their findings in the Dec. 23 issue of the journal Science.

Using observations from NASA's Messenger spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, researchers have found that the planet's huge iron core is even larger than they had thought, and it's likely overlain with a solid shell of iron and sulfur - a layered structure not known to exist on Earth, Venus or Mars. And there's more: Mercury appears to have remained geologically active for a surprisingly large chunk of its evolutionary history, researchers said. \"Many scientists expected Mercury, being a small planet only slightly larger than the moon, to have cooled off not long after it formed and to be essentially 'dead' for most of its evolution,\" said Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lead author of one of the new studies and a co-author on the other. \"But it appears that Mercury had an exciting and active middle age.\" The $446 million Messenger spacecraft launched in 2004. It then took a circuitous route to the solar system's innermost planet, becoming the first probe ever to orbit Mercury in March 2011. Since then, Messenger has been zipping around the baking-hot planet - which orbits the sun from just 36 million miles away, compared to 93 million miles for Earth - once every 12 hours. The probe is mapping Mercury's surface and gathering data on the planet's composition, magnetic environment and tenuous atmosphere, among other features. To date, Messenger has taken nearly 100,000 images and made more than 4 million measurements of the planet's surface, researchers said. Messenger's original science campaign was designed to last one Earth year, but NASA announced in November that it had granted the spacecraft a one-year mission extension. Messenger officially began its extended mission earlier this week. The two new studies, which both appear in the March 23 issue of the journal Science, detail findings that should help scientists better understand Mercury's murky past. In one study, researchers used observations made by Messenger's laser altimeter to map the topography of Mercury's northern hemisphere. They found that the range of elevations was smaller than that found on either Mars or the moon. Messenger also observed that the floors of many Mercury craters have been tilted substantially. Part of the floor of the Caloris basin - at 960 miles across one of the largest impact features in the solar system - has even been raised above its rim. These discoveries suggest that internal forces pushed the craters up after the impacts created them, providing strong evidence that Mercury remained geologically active long after its formation. This may surprise many scientists given the planet's small size, Zuber said. \"It is not out of the question that Mercury is still active today,\" she told SPACE.com via email, \"though I note that this is not very likely, and for sure we have not observed an active eruption or extrusion.\" Researchers also estimated Mercury's gravity field by precisely radio-tracking Messenger's movements around the planet. From these estimates, they determined that Mercury has \"mascons,\" large positive gravity anomalies associated with big impact basins. \"These were first discovered on the moon in 1968 and caused great problems in the Apollo program because they tugged low-orbiting spacecraft around and made navigation difficult,\" Zuber said. \"Subsequently mascons were discovered on Mars, and now we find out that Mercury has them, so they appear to be a common feature of terrestrial planetary bodies.\" The team's gravity calculations also suggest that Mercury has an iron core that comprises roughly 85 percent of the planet's radius. Scientists had suspected the planet's core is big, but many will be surprised that it's so gigantic, Zuber said. Further, it looks like a layer of solid iron sulfide overlies Mercury's core - a feature not known to exist on any other terrestrial planet, researchers said. The new findings should help shed light on Mercury's past, and on the formation and evolution of rocky planets in general. But they also serve to remind scientists that they're in for many more surprises as they continue to probe the solar system's many mysteries, Zuber said. \"With new data, we are continually reminded that when you think you know what's going on you probably don't,\" she added. \"Nature is more perplexing than we can possibly conceive.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/14978-mercury-discoveries-messenger-spacecraft.html"}, {"title": "Data from MESSENGER spacecraft reveals new insights on planet Mercury", "date": "2012-03-22", "content": "Thanks to the MErcury Surface, Space Environment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft, and a mission that took more than 10 years to complete, scientists now have a good picture of the solar system's innermost planet. On March 17, MESSENGER completed its one-year primary mission, orbiting Mercury, capturing nearly 100,000 images, and recording data that reveals new information about the planet's core, topography, and the mysterious radar-bright material in the permanently shadowed areas near the poles. \"Mercury is the last unexplored planet,\" said Stanton Peale from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The way Mercury was formed, he said, may show some constraints on the formation of the solar system. For one thing, Mercury's core is larger than expected - almost 85 percent of the planetary radius. The Earth's core, in contrast, is just over half of the planet's radius. Additionally, Mercury appears to have a more complex core than Earth's - a solid iron sulfide layer that is now part of the mantle that encases a liquid core, which may float on a solid inner core. The scientists also found that Mercury's solid outer core and liquid inner core contain more iron than Earth, relative to the whole planet, which influences the way Mercury's magnetic field was generated. However, Peale noted that the surface is comprised of lighter elements. \"We didn't expect so much sulfur,\" he said, adding that there was almost no iron found on the surface of the planet. With no iron, the volcanic surface rocks are too light to have come from a mantle with the large average density derived for the internal structure. This led to the concept of a two-layer mantle - a light upper silicate layer that could provide the low-density surface material over a dense iron sulfide layer. In the larger picture, the presence of inordinately large amounts of sulfur on the surface indicates that Mercury's formation was not as orderly as some scientists had previously assumed, according to Peale. \"Mercury is composed of material that had condensed over a wide range from the Sun,\" he said. Other findings include a precise topographic model of the planet's northern hemisphere, which reveals a smaller spread in elevations compared to those of Mars or the Moon.

I know, it sounds completely crazy, but hang tight. It all makes sense. Mercury is a mere 58 million kilometers from the Sun and has a surface temperature of 430 degrees Celsius. But that's a _maximum_ temperature. In shadows that temperature can drop drastically. At Mercury's north pole there are some deep craters. For example, the large crater Prokofiev is the deepest crater measured on Mercury so far. It's over 110 kilometers across. Because the crater is deep, and the Sun never gets very high off the horizon at the pole, there are parts of the crater floor that are permanently in shadow; they literally are never illuminated by the Sun. Those spots can be very cold; _well_ below the freezing point of water. There are actually quite a few spots like that at Mercury's north pole. Over many years, astronomers have sent pulses of radar at Mercury to map its surface. They were surprised to find that there were spots near the north pole where the radar pulses were reflected back to Earth far more strongly than expected from mere rock. Ice, literally frozen water, is a good reflector of radar, so it was hypothesized that there might be ice there. The MESSENGER space probe has been orbiting Mercury since March 2011. It has a piece of equipment called a neutron spectrometer, which measures neutrons-subatomic particles-blasted off Mercury by cosmic radiation. It's complicated, but the speed of neutrons coming from Mercury can be changed if there's hydrogen present, and that's just what has now been seen at Mercury's north pole. Combined with the radar data, that's _strong_ evidence that there's water there-water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Furthermore, the bright spots seen by Earth radar together with the neutron data from MESSENGER were superposed on a map of Mercury made using MESSENGER's cameras, and all those spots correspond to deep craters. And the final bit of evidence that makes this so convincing: thermal maps made using infrared-\"heat vision,\" if you like-shows these very same spots are ones that stay permanently cold! That's what this picture shows: Red spots show permanently shadowed spots at Mercury's north pole, and yellow shows where the radar from Earth indicates ice. Note how strongly they correlate to craters! The ice appears to be buried a few dozen centimeters beneath the surface, and may be from half a meter to 20 meters thick. That adds up to an amazing _100 billion to one trillion tons of ice! And we're not done: Further observation indicates that some regions in these craters are intrinsically dark, and others bright. The best explanation of this is the presence of organic, that is carbon-based, molecules on the surface. This does _not_ mean life! But carbon molecules are very interesting because we know comets have lots of organic compounds like that, as well as water ice. And this is starting to give us a complete picture of what's going on. Comets hit Mercury, and have been doing so for billions of years. Most of the water ice in a comet impact gets blown back into space or destroyed by solar radiation over time. But if some of that cometary material settles down in Mercury's shaded north pole crater areas, it can survive, protected. Over the eons it's built up, and now with our technology we can actually see it! This is simply amazing. The irony of finding water ice on such a hot planet is obvious, but also an indication that water is _everywhere_ in our solar system, from close in to the Sun to the farthest reaches we can see, billions of kilometers out past Neptune. We know our kind of life is based on carbon and needs water. I don't think we'll find life on Mercury, but what this says to me is that the basic ingredients of life can survive formidable circumstances. And _that_ makes me wonder even more if life can get a toehold in places where we might have earlier thought it impossible. Mercury is an unlikely place to teach us about life in the Universe. Still, perhaps it's good to remember that life itself may seem unlikely at first, but the conditions for it to arise may be common in the cosmos.

Confirming decades of suspicion, a NASA spacecraft has spotted vast deposits of water ice on the planet closest to the sun. Temperatures on Mercury can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but around the north pole, in areas permanently shielded from the sun's heat, NASA's Messenger spacecraft found a mix of frozen water and possible organic materials. Evidence of big pockets of ice is visible from a latitude of 85 degrees north up to the pole, with smaller deposits scattered as far away as 65 degrees north. The find is so enticing that NASA will direct Messenger's observation toward that area in the coming months - when the angle of the sun allows - to get a better look, said Gregory Neumann, a Messenger instrument scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. \"There is an ongoing campaign, when the spacecraft permits, to look further northward,\" said Neumann, the lead author of one of three Mercury studies published online in the Nov. 29 edition of the journal Science. Researchers also believe the south pole has ice, but Messenger's orbit has not allowed them to obtain extensive measurements of that region yet. Messenger will spiral closer to the planet in 2014 and 2015 as it runs out of fuel and is perturbed by the sun's and Mercury's gravity. This will let researchers peer closer at the water ice as they figure out how much is there. Speculation about water ice on Mercury dates back more than 20 years. In 1991, Earth-bound astronomers fired radar signals to Mercury and received results showing there could be ice at both poles. This was reinforced by 1999 measurements using the more powerful Arecibo Observatorymicrowave beam in Puerto Rico. Radar pictures beamed back to New Mexico's Very Large Array showed white areas that researchers suspected was water ice. A closer view, however, required a spacecraft. Messenger settled into Mercury's orbit in March 2011, after a few flybys. Almost immediately, NASA used a laser altimeter to probe the poles. The laser is weak - about the strength of a flashlight - but just powerful enough to distinguish bright icy areas from the darker, surrounding Mercury regolith. Neumann said the result was \"curious\": There were few bright spots inside craters. Team member John Cavanaugh was pretty sure of what they were finding, Neumann recalled. Cavanaugh had been a part of NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter team, and he had seen a similar strange pattern on Earth's moon when LRO found ice at the lunar poles in 2009. Flash heating on Mercury would mix nearly all of its ice with the surrounding regolith - as well as with possible organic material borne to the planet by comets and ice-rich asteroids. \"So what you're seeing is the fact that water ice can't survive indefinitely in these locations because the temperatures apparently spike up,\" Neumann said. The team expected to find water ice on Mercury. Indeed, Messenger already drew a linkthis year between permanently shadowed areas on the planet and the \"radar bright\" spots seen from Earth. All researchers needed to do was point their instruments in the right spot, seek out bright areas and then measure the temperature and composition. Messenger's neutron spectrometer spotted hydrogen, which is a large component of water ice. But the temperature profile unexpectedly showed that dark, volatile materials - consistent with climes in which organics survive - are mixing in with the ice. \"This was very exciting. You are looking for bright stuff, and you see dark stuff - gee, it's something new,\" Neumann said. Organic materials are life's ingredients, though they do not necessarily lead to life itself. While some scientists think organics-bearing comets sparkedlife on Earth, the presence of organics is also suspected on airless, distant worlds such as Pluto. Scientists say comets carrying organic bits smashed into other planets frequently during the solar system's history. Researchers are now working to determine if they indeed saw organics on Mercury. So far, they suspect Mercury's water ice is coated with a 4-inch blanket of \"thermally insulating material,\" according to Neumann's paper. It will take further study to figure out exactly what this material is, but Neumann said the early temperature curves could show organic materials such as amino acids.

I know, it sounds completely crazy, but hang tight. It all makes sense. Mercury is a mere 58 million kilometers from the Sun and has a surface temperature of 430 degrees Celsius. But that's a _maximum_ temperature. In shadows that temperature can drop drastically. At Mercury's north pole there are some deep craters. For example, the large crater Prokofiev is the deepest crater measured on Mercury so far. It's over 110 kilometers across. Because the crater is deep, and the Sun never gets very high off the horizon at the pole, there are parts of the crater floor that are permanently in shadow; they literally are never illuminated by the Sun. Those spots can be very cold; _well_ below the freezing point of water. There are actually quite a few spots like that at Mercury's north pole. Over many years, astronomers have sent pulses of radar at Mercury to map its surface. They were surprised to find that there were spots near the north pole where the radar pulses were reflected back to Earth far more strongly than expected from mere rock. Ice, literally frozen water, is a good reflector of radar, so it was hypothesized that there might be ice there. The MESSENGER space probe has been orbiting Mercury since March 2011. It has a piece of equipment called a neutron spectrometer, which measures neutrons-subatomic particles-blasted off Mercury by cosmic radiation. It's complicated, but the speed of neutrons coming from Mercury can be changed if there's hydrogen present, and that's just what has now been seen at Mercury's north pole. Combined with the radar data, that's _strong_ evidence that there's water there-water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Furthermore, the bright spots seen by Earth radar together with the neutron data from MESSENGER were superposed on a map of Mercury made using MESSENGER's cameras, and all those spots correspond to deep craters. And the final bit of evidence that makes this so convincing: thermal maps made using infrared-\"heat vision,\" if you like-shows these very same spots are ones that stay permanently cold! That's what this picture shows: Red spots show permanently shadowed spots at Mercury's north pole, and yellow shows where the radar from Earth indicates ice. Note how strongly they correlate to craters! The ice appears to be buried a few dozen centimeters beneath the surface, and may be from half a meter to 20 meters thick. That adds up to an amazing _100 billion to one trillion tons of ice! And we're not done: Further observation indicates that some regions in these craters are intrinsically dark, and others bright.

The find is so enticing that NASA will direct Messenger's observation toward that area in the coming months - when the angle of the sun allows - to get a better look, said Gregory Neumann, a Messenger instrument scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. \"There is an ongoing campaign, when the spacecraft permits, to look further northward,\" said Neumann, the lead author of one of three Mercury studies published online in the Nov. 29 edition of the journal Science. Researchers also believe the south pole has ice, but Messenger's orbit has not allowed them to obtain extensive measurements of that region yet. Messenger will spiral closer to the planet in 2014 and 2015 as it runs out of fuel and is perturbed by the sun's and Mercury's gravity. This will let researchers peer closer at the water ice as they figure out how much is there. Speculation about water ice on Mercury dates back more than 20 years. In 1991, Earth-bound astronomers fired radar signals to Mercury and received results showing there could be ice at both poles. This was reinforced by 1999 measurements using the more powerful Arecibo Observatorymicrowave beam in Puerto Rico. Radar pictures beamed back to New Mexico's Very Large Array showed white areas that researchers suspected was water ice. A closer view, however, required a spacecraft. Messenger settled into Mercury's orbit in March 2011, after a few flybys. Almost immediately, NASA used a laser altimeter to probe the poles. The laser is weak - about the strength of a flashlight - but just powerful enough to distinguish bright icy areas from the darker, surrounding Mercury regolith. Neumann said the result was \"curious\": There were few bright spots inside craters. Team member John Cavanaugh was pretty sure of what they were finding, Neumann recalled. Cavanaugh had been a part of NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter team, and he had seen a similar strange pattern on Earth's moon when LRO found ice at the lunar poles in 2009. Flash heating on Mercury would mix nearly all of its ice with the surrounding regolith - as well as with possible organic material borne to the planet by comets and ice-rich asteroids. \"So what you're seeing is the fact that water ice can't survive indefinitely in these locations because the temperatures apparently spike up,\" Neumann said. The team expected to find water ice on Mercury. Indeed, Messenger already drew a linkthis year between permanently shadowed areas on the planet and the \"radar bright\" spots seen from Earth. All researchers needed to do was point their instruments in the right spot, seek out bright areas and then measure the temperature and composition. Messenger's neutron spectrometer spotted hydrogen, which is a large component of water ice. But the temperature profile unexpectedly showed that dark, volatile materials - consistent with climes in which organics survive - are mixing in with the ice. \"This was very exciting. You are looking for bright stuff, and you see dark stuff - gee, it's something new,\" Neumann said. Organic materials are life's ingredients, though they do not necessarily lead to life itself. While some scientists think organics-bearing comets sparkedlife on Earth, the presence of organics is also suspected on airless, distant worlds such as Pluto. Scientists say comets carrying organic bits smashed into other planets frequently during the solar system's history. Researchers are now working to determine if they indeed saw organics on Mercury. So far, they suspect Mercury's water ice is coated with a 4-inch blanket of \"thermally insulating material,\" according to Neumann's paper. It will take further study to figure out exactly what this material is, but Neumann said the early temperature curves could show organic materials such as amino acids.

Life on sun-scorched Mercury remains an extreme longshot, the researchers stressed, but the new results should still put a spring in the step of astrobiologists around the world. \"The more we examine the solar system, the more we realize it's a soggy place,\" Jim Green, the director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, said during a press conference today. \"And that's really quite exciting, because that means the amount of water that we have here on Earth - that was not only inherent when it was originally formed but probably brought here - that water and other volatiles were brought to many other places in the solar system,\" Green added. \"So it really bodes well for us to continue on the exploration, following the water and its signs throughout the solar system.\" The observations by Messenger, which has been orbiting Mercury since March 2011, provide compelling evidence that reflective patches first spotted near the planet's poles by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico two decades ago are indeed water ice, researchers said. In the coldest parts of Mercury - permanently shadowed regions where temperatures drop to perhaps minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit - this ice can lie bare and exposed. But Messenger's data also show that much more frozen water is found in slightly warmer areas, buried beneath a strange dark material that acts as an insulator. This dark stuff is likely a mixture of complex organic compounds, the carbon- containing building blocks of life as we know it, researchers said during Thursday's news conference. \"This organic material may be the same type of organic material that ultimately gave rise to life on Earth,\" said Messenger participating scientist David Paige of UCLA. Mercury probably acquired much of its water and organic material the same way Earth did, researchers said - via comet impacts and asteroid strikes.

From its close-up perch, the probe identified two distinct types of rocks that compose the planet's surface, which scientists were at a loss to explain. Now, experiments in a lab at MIT suggest Mercury's puzzling surface makeup is most likely explained by a huge ocean of magma that existed shortly after the planet formed about 4.5 billion years ago. \"The thing that's really amazing on Mercury is, this didn't happen yesterday,\" Timothy Grove, a professor of geology at MIT, said in a statement. \"The crust is probably more than 4 billion years old, so this magma ocean is a really ancient feature.\" Messenger identified the two rock types using its X-ray spectrometer, which was able to distinguish the chemical composition of materials on the planet's surface. Scientists made synthetic rocks in the lab to simulate the two types of material, using finely powdered chemicals to piece together the closest possible matches to what was seen on the planet. \"We just mix these together in the right proportions and we've got a synthetic copy of what's on the surface of Mercury,\" Grove said. The researchers then subjected these samples to high temperatures and pressures to recreate the conditions they might have experienced throughout Mercury's evolution. The analysis pointed to only one possible origin for the two rock types, the researchers said. An early ocean of magma created two layers of crystals, which eventually solidified and then re-melted into magma that was spread onto the surface of Mercury through volcanic eruptions. \"We're gradually filling in more blanks, and the story may well change, but this work sets up a framework for thinking about new data,\" said Larry Nittler, a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Nittler led the team that originally identified the two rock types on Mercury, but was not involved in the MIT laboratory study. \"It's a very important first step toward going from exciting data to real understanding.\" The scientists detailed their findings in the Feb. 1 issue of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

I know, it sounds completely crazy, but hang tight. It all makes sense. Mercury is a mere 58 million kilometers from the Sun and has a surface temperature of 430 degrees Celsius. But that's a _maximum_ temperature. In shadows that temperature can drop drastically. At Mercury's north pole there are some deep craters. For example, the large crater Prokofiev is the deepest crater measured on Mercury so far. It's over 110 kilometers across. Because the crater is deep, and the Sun never gets very high off the horizon at the pole, there are parts of the crater floor that are permanently in shadow; they literally are never illuminated by the Sun. Those spots can be very cold; _well_ below the freezing point of water. There are actually quite a few spots like that at Mercury's north pole. Over many years, astronomers have sent pulses of radar at Mercury to map its surface. They were surprised to find that there were spots near the north pole where the radar pulses were reflected back to Earth far more strongly than expected from mere rock. Ice, literally frozen water, is a good reflector of radar, so it was hypothesized that there might be ice there. The MESSENGER space probe has been orbiting Mercury since March 2011. It has a piece of equipment called a neutron spectrometer, which measures neutrons-subatomic particles-blasted off Mercury by cosmic radiation. It's complicated, but the speed of neutrons coming from Mercury can be changed if there's hydrogen present, and that's just what has now been seen at Mercury's north pole. Combined with the radar data, that's _strong_ evidence that there's water there-water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Furthermore, the bright spots seen by Earth radar together with the neutron data from MESSENGER were superposed on a map of Mercury made using MESSENGER's cameras, and all those spots correspond to deep craters. And the final bit of evidence that makes this so convincing: thermal maps made using infrared-\"heat vision,\" if you like-shows these very same spots are ones that stay permanently cold! That's what this picture shows: Red spots show permanently shadowed spots at Mercury's north pole, and yellow shows where the radar from Earth indicates ice. Note how strongly they correlate to craters! The ice appears to be buried a few dozen centimeters beneath the surface, and may be from half a meter to 20 meters thick. That adds up to an amazing _100 billion to one trillion tons of ice! And we're not done: Further observation indicates that some regions in these craters are intrinsically dark, and others bright. The best explanation of this is the presence of organic, that is carbon-based, molecules on the surface. This does _not_ mean life! But carbon molecules are very interesting because we know comets have lots of organic compounds like that, as well as water ice. And this is starting to give us a complete picture of what's going on. Comets hit Mercury, and have been doing so for billions of years. Most of the water ice in a comet impact gets blown back into space or destroyed by solar radiation over time. But if some of that cometary material settles down in Mercury's shaded north pole crater areas, it can survive, protected. Over the eons it's built up, and now with our technology we can actually see it! This is simply amazing. The irony of finding water ice on such a hot planet is obvious, but also an indication that water is _everywhere_ in our solar system, from close in to the Sun to the farthest reaches we can see, billions of kilometers out past Neptune. We know our kind of life is based on carbon and needs water. I don't think we'll find life on Mercury, but what this says to me is that the basic ingredients of life can survive formidable circumstances. And _that_ makes me wonder even more if life can get a toehold in places where we might have earlier thought it impossible. Mercury is an unlikely place to teach us about life in the Universe. Still, perhaps it's good to remember that life itself may seem unlikely at first, but the conditions for it to arise may be common in the cosmos.

The results suggest an answer to ripples in the solar wind observed by NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft, in orbit around Mercury, that start on the dusk side of the planet, where sunset starts in the shadow of the sun. The solar wind is made up of highly charged particles spewed out by the sun, their direction deflected by magnetic fields around most planets. The closest planet to the sun, about 36 million miles away, Mercury feels a blast from the solar wind about 10 times stronger than Earth. That in turn strongly compresses its magnetic field, so its effects peter out very close to the planet's surface. \"our sawtooth patterns in the magnetic field,\" observed by the spacecraft as it approached Mercury in 2009 have puzzled scientists, says the new simulation study by University of Alberta scientists Jan Paral and Robert Rankin in the journal _Nature Communications_.

But scientists are now in the process of sorting through a plethora of new data about the planet. \"Mercury is an oddball planet of contradictions,\" said David Blewett, a MESSENGER science team member also at APL, which NASA contracted to build and operate the mission. \"It has a huge iron core, but the surface rocks are almost totally bereft of iron. Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun, yet it has a \"polar cap\" in the form of ice lurking in the eternal darkness of polar craters.\" And although Mercury has no apparent current tectonic or volcanic activity; in its distant past, after formation and cooling; the planet did shrink in a manner not unlike a shriveled orange. Mercury's surface also has hundreds of surface \"hollows\" no deeper than a km, says Lawrence, who notes that they cover the planet. \"You don't see these hollows on any other planet in the solar system,\" he said. \"They're not craters and they don't look like volcanoes.\" Blewett says they have shapes similar to certain depressions found on the South polar cap of Mars, who points out that as the Sun warms the Red Planet's surface, these Martian features form from the transformation of carbon dioxide from ice and into a gaseous state. It appears that a similar process is happening on Mercury, says Blewett, but \"instead of ice being lost, it is solid rock.\" As the planet closest to the Sun, however, Lawrence said he would have expected such volatile elements, like sodium, chlorine and sulfur, to have already been \"baked off the surface.\" Yet he notes that surprisingly that's not the case. \"But compared to the Moon, Mercury doesn't have a lot of compositional surface variability,\" said Lawrence. \"In visible light, Mercury is kind of dark gray, bland and uniform.\" In fact, Mercury's close 88-day solar orbit makes it gravitationally into what is known as a 3:2 spin resonance. In other words, Mercury makes three complete rotations on its axis for every two orbits it makes around the Sun. And at an average solar distance of only 58 million km, to an astronaut on Mercury's surface; the Sun would appear some two and half times larger than it does from earth. \"The 3:2 spin-orbit resonance doesn't cause one side to be much hotter than the others,\" said Nancy Chabot, a MESSENGER instrument scientist at APL. \"Rather, there are two colder longitudes and two hotter longitudes and the permanently-shadowed craters by Mercury's poles are cold enough to have water ice.\" MESSENGER has confirmed that Mercury does indeed have significant amounts of water ice at its poles. \"We've confirmed that there's a lot of hydrogen at Mercury's poles indicative of water ice where it congregates in permanently-shaded craters,\" said Lawrence. \"But Mercury has a lot more water at the poles than the Moon and we don't know why. Maybe there was a recent cometary impact on Mercury.\" In principle, the act of cometary impact on Mercury, says Lawrence, would liberate the comet's water. Although he says most of that water would be lost to space, at least some of it would find its way into the planet's permanent \"cold traps\" and persist there. Why would Mercury be more prone to attract cometary impactors than the Moon? Mercury may simply get impacted with more cometary material than the moon, says Lawrence. It's closer to the Sun, he says, so there are a lot of sun- grazing comets with a high probability of also impacting Mercury. And to understand the plethora of weird and wacky extrasolar planets out there, we must first understand our own inner solar system. \"In order to really understand how solar systems and planets form and evolve, we need to understand Mercury's formation and history,\" said Blewett. The next step involves the $850 million BepiColombo mission, a joint European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency effort; due for launch in Summer 2016 with an arrival at Mercury in early 2024. Two separate spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will collect new data on Mercury's origin and evolution; its structure as a planet itself; its vestigial exosphere; and the origin and current state of its magnetic field and magnetosphere. But missions to Mercury are never easy. MESSENGER took 6.5 years to get there doing orbital gravity assists around Earth, Venus and then Mercury itself in order to slow the spacecraft down enough so that it could be captured into Mercury orbit. Partly as a result, Lawrence and colleagues are savoring the last six months of Mercury science before MESSENGER impacts the surface, likely on the side hidden from Earth --- near the end of March. Lawrence says the plan is to take a lot of high-resolution images of the planned impact area in advance, so that when BepiColombo arrives in Mercury orbit, its two spacecraft will be able to see the effects of MESSENGER's impact. Thus, Mercury seems to finally be coming out of the scientific shadows. \"There's been a resurgence of interest in Mercury; having a lot of new data really helps,\" said Lawrence. \"We're starting to open the hood on and ask more detailed questions about the planet .\" ", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2014/09/22/nasas-messenger-spacecraft-headed-for-mercury-impact/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's MESSENGER Spacecraft Headed For Mercury Impact", "date": "2014-09-22", "content": "After three and a half years in orbit around Mercury --- the tiny shriveled and pockmarked orb that boasts temperatures in excess of 650 degrees --- NASA's MESSENGER mission to our solar system's innermost planet is headed for a controlled late March 2015 surface impact. \"The spacecraft is getting closer to the planet than we've ever been which helps our surface composition measurements a lot,\" said David Lawrence, a MESSENGER science team member at Johns Hopkins University 's Applied Physics Lab. \"Between now and impact the spacecraft's elliptical orbit is going to get down to 10 km above the surface; we're talking airplane altitudes.\" Until the $450 million MESSENGER, Mercury rarely registered as a blip on most researchers' radars.

And to understand the plethora of weird and wacky extrasolar planets out there, we must first understand our own inner solar system. \"In order to really understand how solar systems and planets form and evolve, we need to understand Mercury's formation and history,\" said Blewett. The next step involves the $850 million BepiColombo mission, a joint European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency effort; due for launch in Summer 2016 with an arrival at Mercury in early 2024. Two separate spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will collect new data on Mercury's origin and evolution; its structure as a planet itself; its vestigial exosphere; and the origin and current state of its magnetic field and magnetosphere. But missions to Mercury are never easy. MESSENGER took 6.5 years to get there doing orbital gravity assists around Earth, Venus and then Mercury itself in order to slow the spacecraft down enough so that it could be captured into Mercury orbit. Partly as a result, Lawrence and colleagues are savoring the last six months of Mercury science before MESSENGER impacts the surface, likely on the side hidden from Earth --- near the end of March. Lawrence says the plan is to take a lot of high-resolution images of the planned impact area in advance, so that when BepiColombo arrives in Mercury orbit, its two spacecraft will be able to see the effects of MESSENGER's impact. Thus, Mercury seems to finally be coming out of the scientific shadows. \"There's been a resurgence of interest in Mercury; having a lot of new data really helps,\" said Lawrence. \"We're starting to open the hood on and ask more detailed questions about the planet .\" ", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2014/09/22/nasas-messenger-spacecraft-headed-for-mercury-impact/"}, {"title": "Want to Name a Crater on Mercury?

But scientists are now in the process of sorting through a plethora of new data about the planet. \"Mercury is an oddball planet of contradictions,\" said David Blewett, a MESSENGER science team member also at APL, which NASA contracted to build and operate the mission. \"It has a huge iron core, but the surface rocks are almost totally bereft of iron. Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun, yet it has a \"polar cap\" in the form of ice lurking in the eternal darkness of polar craters.\" And although Mercury has no apparent current tectonic or volcanic activity; in its distant past, after formation and cooling; the planet did shrink in a manner not unlike a shriveled orange. Mercury's surface also has hundreds of surface \"hollows\" no deeper than a km, says Lawrence, who notes that they cover the planet. \"You don't see these hollows on any other planet in the solar system,\" he said. \"They're not craters and they don't look like volcanoes.\" Blewett says they have shapes similar to certain depressions found on the South polar cap of Mars, who points out that as the Sun warms the Red Planet's surface, these Martian features form from the transformation of carbon dioxide from ice and into a gaseous state. It appears that a similar process is happening on Mercury, says Blewett, but \"instead of ice being lost, it is solid rock.\" As the planet closest to the Sun, however, Lawrence said he would have expected such volatile elements, like sodium, chlorine and sulfur, to have already been \"baked off the surface.\" Yet he notes that surprisingly that's not the case. \"But compared to the Moon, Mercury doesn't have a lot of compositional surface variability,\" said Lawrence. \"In visible light, Mercury is kind of dark gray, bland and uniform.\" In fact, Mercury's close 88-day solar orbit makes it gravitationally into what is known as a 3:2 spin resonance. In other words, Mercury makes three complete rotations on its axis for every two orbits it makes around the Sun. And at an average solar distance of only 58 million km, to an astronaut on Mercury's surface; the Sun would appear some two and half times larger than it does from earth. \"The 3:2 spin-orbit resonance doesn't cause one side to be much hotter than the others,\" said Nancy Chabot, a MESSENGER instrument scientist at APL. \"Rather, there are two colder longitudes and two hotter longitudes and the permanently-shadowed craters by Mercury's poles are cold enough to have water ice.\" MESSENGER has confirmed that Mercury does indeed have significant amounts of water ice at its poles. \"We've confirmed that there's a lot of hydrogen at Mercury's poles indicative of water ice where it congregates in permanently-shaded craters,\" said Lawrence. \"But Mercury has a lot more water at the poles than the Moon and we don't know why. Maybe there was a recent cometary impact on Mercury.\" In principle, the act of cometary impact on Mercury, says Lawrence, would liberate the comet's water. Although he says most of that water would be lost to space, at least some of it would find its way into the planet's permanent \"cold traps\" and persist there. Why would Mercury be more prone to attract cometary impactors than the Moon? Mercury may simply get impacted with more cometary material than the moon, says Lawrence.

The previously unidentified regions of Mercury have compositions that differ significantly from the crust around them. Known as geochemical terranes, these zones provide insight into the formation of the outer skin of the planet. The maps appear in two new studies, which suggest that the most recently identified features may have formed not from the planet's crust but from just below it, in the mantle. Created using the X-Ray Spectrometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instruments on NASA's MESSENGER probe, the maps are used to study the surface chemistry of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. This analysis will provide information about the concentrations of elements like potassium, uranium and sodium on Mercury's surface. The experiment will also provide scientists with ratios of silicon to other elements on the planet's surface. The first study used the XRS to produce the first global geochemical maps of Mercury, using a novel method performed for the first time on a planetary scale. By studying X-rays streaming from the sun, the authors were able to examine the composition of geochemical terranes on the planet. \"The consistency of the new XRS and GRS maps provides a new dimension to our view of Mercury's surface,\" lead author Shoshana Weider, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said in a statement. \"The terranes we observed had not been previously identified on the basis of spectral reflectance or geographical mapping.\" The most obvious of these unusual terranes is a large feature that covers more than 3 million square miles of the planet's surface. This terrane exhibits the highest observed ratios of silicon to each of the elements of magnesium, sulfur and calcium, as well as some of the lowest aluminum-to-silicon ratios on the planet, according to a new paper published this week in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. One possible explanation for the unusual region is that it stems from an impact that occurred long ago. The exposed mantle could have aided in the creation of the extremely large feature. A second map used GRS to trace the absorption of low-energy neutrons across the surface of Mercury. This map shows the distribution across Mercury's northern hemisphere of elements that absorb thermal neutrons. By combining that information with previously obtained data, the authors were able to identify four distinct geochemical terranes on the planet. The Caloris basin on Mercury, the planet's largest well-preserved impact basin, contains smooth interior plains that the new results reveal have a distinct composition from other volcanic plains on the planet. According to the authors, these plains formed by partial melting of the mantle. \"Earlier MESSENGER data have shown that Mercury's surface was pervasively shaped by volcanic activity,\" Patrick Peplowski, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper concerning the second map, said in the same statement. \"The magmas erupted long ago and were derived from the partial melting of Mercury's mantle,\" he said. \"The differences in composition that we are observing among geochemical terranes indicate that Mercury has a chemically heterogeneous mantle.\" The second study appeared online in the journal Icarus. \"The crust we see on Mercury was largely formed more than 3 billion years ago,\" said Larry Nittler, deputy principle investigator of the mission and co- author on both studies. \"The remarkable chemical variability revealed by MESSENGER observations will provide critical constraints on future efforts to model and understand Mercury's bulk composition and the ancient geological processes that shaped the planet's mantle and crust.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28836-mercury-surface-mapped-nasa-messenger.html"}, {"title": "NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month", "date": "2015-03-29", "content": "A NASA Mercury probe isn't ready to finish its groundbreaking work at the solar system's innermost planet just yet. Last week, NASA's Messenger spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly and delay its inevitable impact into Mercury's surface by up to a month. \"We decided on a strategy that includes five maneuvers in as many weeks to keep the spacecraft within a tight altitude range of 5 to 39 kilometers 3 to 24 miles above the surface of Mercury at closest approach,\" Messenger Mission Design Lead Engineer Jim McAdams, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, said in a statement. If everything goes according to plan, Messenger could keep observing Mercury through April 30 or so, mission team members have said. The $450 million Messenger mission, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched in August 2004. After taking a circuitous route through the inner solar system, in March 2011 Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. The probe has achieved a great deal in its four years at the planet. For example, the mission has constructed the best-ever maps of Mercury, and it also discovered carbon-containing organic compounds and water ice inside permanently shadowed craters near the rocky world's north pole. Messenger is currently operating on an extended mission, and the spacecraft is almost out of fuel. When its tank is empty, Messenger will succumb to the force of the sun's gravity and spiral down to its doom on Mercury. The probe's handlers want to wring as much science out of the mission as possible - hence, the current sequence of orbit-raising maneuvers, which seeks to extend a low-altitude \"hover\" campaign designed to get great close-up looks at Mercury. Messenger's final days of operation will prioritize observations made by the spacecraft's magnetometer and neutron spectrometer, mission team members said. \"With NS, scientists will hone in on shadowed craters at northern high latitudes to search for water ice. We have found such evidence previously in the mission, but we hope to find more at low altitudes and spatially resolve the distribution within individual craters if we are lucky,\" Messenger Deputy Project Scientist Haje Korth, also of APL, said in the same statement. \"With MAG, we will look for crustal magnetic anomalies,\" Korth added. \"Establishing the presence of crustal magnetic anomalies on Mercury would be a huge result, because it would extend the known temporal baseline for Mercury's internal magnetic field by eight orders of magnitude.\" Last week's 32-second engine burn, which occurred March 18, increased Messenger's closest-approach altitude from 7.2 miles to 21.4 miles, mission representatives said.

The previously unidentified regions of Mercury have compositions that differ significantly from the crust around them. Known as geochemical terranes, these zones provide insight into the formation of the outer skin of the planet. The maps appear in two new studies, which suggest that the most recently identified features may have formed not from the planet's crust but from just below it, in the mantle. Created using the X-Ray Spectrometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instruments on NASA's MESSENGER probe, the maps are used to study the surface chemistry of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. This analysis will provide information about the concentrations of elements like potassium, uranium and sodium on Mercury's surface. The experiment will also provide scientists with ratios of silicon to other elements on the planet's surface. The first study used the XRS to produce the first global geochemical maps of Mercury, using a novel method performed for the first time on a planetary scale. By studying X-rays streaming from the sun, the authors were able to examine the composition of geochemical terranes on the planet. \"The consistency of the new XRS and GRS maps provides a new dimension to our view of Mercury's surface,\" lead author Shoshana Weider, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said in a statement. \"The terranes we observed had not been previously identified on the basis of spectral reflectance or geographical mapping.\" The most obvious of these unusual terranes is a large feature that covers more than 3 million square miles of the planet's surface. This terrane exhibits the highest observed ratios of silicon to each of the elements of magnesium, sulfur and calcium, as well as some of the lowest aluminum-to-silicon ratios on the planet, according to a new paper published this week in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. One possible explanation for the unusual region is that it stems from an impact that occurred long ago. The exposed mantle could have aided in the creation of the extremely large feature. A second map used GRS to trace the absorption of low-energy neutrons across the surface of Mercury. This map shows the distribution across Mercury's northern hemisphere of elements that absorb thermal neutrons. By combining that information with previously obtained data, the authors were able to identify four distinct geochemical terranes on the planet. The Caloris basin on Mercury, the planet's largest well-preserved impact basin, contains smooth interior plains that the new results reveal have a distinct composition from other volcanic plains on the planet. According to the authors, these plains formed by partial melting of the mantle. \"Earlier MESSENGER data have shown that Mercury's surface was pervasively shaped by volcanic activity,\" Patrick Peplowski, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper concerning the second map, said in the same statement. \"The magmas erupted long ago and were derived from the partial melting of Mercury's mantle,\" he said. \"The differences in composition that we are observing among geochemical terranes indicate that Mercury has a chemically heterogeneous mantle.\" The second study appeared online in the journal Icarus. \"The crust we see on Mercury was largely formed more than 3 billion years ago,\" said Larry Nittler, deputy principle investigator of the mission and co- author on both studies. \"The remarkable chemical variability revealed by MESSENGER observations will provide critical constraints on future efforts to model and understand Mercury's bulk composition and the ancient geological processes that shaped the planet's mantle and crust.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28836-mercury-surface-mapped-nasa-messenger.html"}, {"title": "NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month", "date": "2015-03-29", "content": "A NASA Mercury probe isn't ready to finish its groundbreaking work at the solar system's innermost planet just yet. Last week, NASA's Messenger spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly and delay its inevitable impact into Mercury's surface by up to a month. \"We decided on a strategy that includes five maneuvers in as many weeks to keep the spacecraft within a tight altitude range of 5 to 39 kilometers 3 to 24 miles above the surface of Mercury at closest approach,\" Messenger Mission Design Lead Engineer Jim McAdams, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, said in a statement. If everything goes according to plan, Messenger could keep observing Mercury through April 30 or so, mission team members have said. The $450 million Messenger mission, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched in August 2004. After taking a circuitous route through the inner solar system, in March 2011 Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. The probe has achieved a great deal in its four years at the planet. For example, the mission has constructed the best-ever maps of Mercury, and it also discovered carbon-containing organic compounds and water ice inside permanently shadowed craters near the rocky world's north pole. Messenger is currently operating on an extended mission, and the spacecraft is almost out of fuel. When its tank is empty, Messenger will succumb to the force of the sun's gravity and spiral down to its doom on Mercury. The probe's handlers want to wring as much science out of the mission as possible - hence, the current sequence of orbit-raising maneuvers, which seeks to extend a low-altitude \"hover\" campaign designed to get great close-up looks at Mercury. Messenger's final days of operation will prioritize observations made by the spacecraft's magnetometer and neutron spectrometer, mission team members said. \"With NS, scientists will hone in on shadowed craters at northern high latitudes to search for water ice. We have found such evidence previously in the mission, but we hope to find more at low altitudes and spatially resolve the distribution within individual craters if we are lucky,\" Messenger Deputy Project Scientist Haje Korth, also of APL, said in the same statement. \"With MAG, we will look for crustal magnetic anomalies,\" Korth added. \"Establishing the presence of crustal magnetic anomalies on Mercury would be a huge result, because it would extend the known temporal baseline for Mercury's internal magnetic field by eight orders of magnitude.\" Last week's 32-second engine burn, which occurred March 18, increased Messenger's closest-approach altitude from 7.2 miles to 21.4 miles, mission representatives said.

The Messenger probe launched from Earth in 2004 and has been mapping Mercury in exquisite detail since it arrived in orbit in 2011. The spacecraft has beamed back a series of breathtaking images of the tiny, scorched world, which orbits so close to the sun that daytime temperatures reach 427 Celsius. Mercury swings around the sun at an average distance of 36m miles, much closer than Earth, which orbits at a distance of about 93m miles. \"Messenger has been an amazing mission. The only previous Mercury mission, Mariner 10, flew post the planet three times in 1974 and 1975 giving us only an incomplete view. Messenger revealed the whole globe in detail,\" said David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University. The spacecraft is close to running out of fuel and is expected to crash into the surface of the planet at 8,750 miles per hour on Thursday at 8.30pm UK time. Nasa scientists said the probe would crash into the far side of Mercury, beyond the view of ground-based telescopes. The space agency will only confirm that the impact has taken place when Messenger fails to reappear hours later. John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the science mission directorate at Nasa's HQ in Washington said: \"While spacecraft operations will end, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission. It's the beginning of a longer journey to analyse the data that reveals all the scientific mysteries of Mercury.\" Data beamed back from the spacecraft suggest that large quantities of frozen water - enough to cover Washington DC in a two mile thick layer of ice - lie in Mercury's permanently shadowed polar craters. The surface of the ice is tainted with dark patches that are thought to be organic compounds. \"It is now apparent that Mercury is a misfit planet that seems not to belong where we now find it. It is dense even for a rocky planet, showing that its iron-rich core occupies more than 80% of Mercury's radius,\" said Rothery. \"The outer part of the core must still be molten, because this is where Mercury's magnetic field is generated - a characteristic shared with the Earth, but not with Venus, Mars or the Moon.\" Images from Messenger have revealed signs of recent volcanic eruptions blasting upwards through Mercury's ancient lava fields. Others point to mysterious \"hollows\", which are steep, flat-bottomed depressions in the planet where the top 10 metres or so of the surface are missing. \"Airless Mercury has no wind to blow it away, and there are no signs of collapse into underground cavities, so we are forced to conclude that something in the ground has been turned to vapour and lost to space,\" Rothery said.

The first spacecraft to circle Mercury, Messenger is expected to slip out of orbit and slam into Mercury on Thursday following a successful four-year tour of the rocky planet. The spacecraft will be travelling 14,081 kilometres per hour when it hits, fast enough to carve out a crater 16 metres wide. The spacecraft itself stretches 3 metres solar wingtip to wingtip. Messenger has run out of fuel, but ground controllers managed in recent weeks to eke out some extra life, raising Messenger's orbit by dipping into helium gas reserves not originally intended for use as fuel. But now that's all gone and Messenger is at the mercy of gravity. \"I guess the end is coming,\" the Messenger team said via Twitter earlier this week. \"After 10 years, spacecraft will end life as just another crater on Mercury's surface.\" A look at Mercury's soon-to-be-obliterated travel companion: Roundabout flight. Messenger rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 2004. It flew twice past Venus and three times past Mercury, before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011. Only one other spacecraft, NASA's Mariner 10, has ever visited Mercury, and that was back in the 1970s. Mariner 10 flew past, but did not orbit the innermost planet. The $427 million Messenger mission was developed and run for NASA by Johns Hopkins University. During its four years in orbit - comprising more than 4,000 laps - Messenger has revealed volcanic deposits that are helping to explain the planet's important eruptive and interior-melting past; polar caps of frozen water at or near the surface; and incredible global shrinkage thanks to a cooling interior. In addition, despite its proximity to the sun, Mercury is more abundant in volatile elements, like potassium and sulfur, than anticipated before Messenger's arrival, according to Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Planetary scientists will be looking at Messenger's huge stash of data \"for years, probably for decades, as we try to understand the origin and evolution of Mercury,\" Solomon said. Super sunshade. Messenger's creators needed to keep the spacecraft cool during its super-hot mission at Mercury. \"It's an enormously hostile environment,\" said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Designers came up with a novel sunshade of lightweight ceramic cloth. This sunscreen tolerated more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit on the front, while keeping everything behind it at room temperature, including the seven scientific instruments. Messenger also regularly performed \"an intricate dance\" to balance all the infrared heat that was reflected off Mercury back at the spacecraft. At the same time, engineers equipped Messenger with numerous heaters to keep the fuel from freezing and the electronics from faltering when the spacecraft ducked behind the planet, away from the sun. On Thursday, Messenger is expected to crash into the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. So there will be no cameras or observatories to witness the impact. Scientists expect to gather information from Messenger until 10 to 15 minutes before its fatal plunge. The expected crash site is about two-thirds of the way up the planet, near the north pole. Mercury is the smallest planet - a little bigger than our moon. A pair of European and Japanese spacecraft will aim for Mercury following a 2017 launch from South America's French Guiana. It will take seven years for the two satellites to reach Mercury and enter its orbit, in 2024. The mission is called BepiColombo after the late Italian scientist who came up with the calculations for repeated fly-bys of Mercury by Mariner 10.

Out of fuel after more than a decade in space, the robotic Messenger probe slammed into the planet at about 3.26pm ET, on the far side of Mercury and out of sight of telescopes. Hurtling toward the planet at more than 8,700mph, Messenger smashed into a plain smoothed over by past lava floods, according to Nasa's estimates. The probe crashed near a large impact basin named Shakespeare, a 250-mile-diameter zone of craters; Messenger's own crater is estimated to be 52ft at its widest. Nasa confirmed the impact at 3.26 pm ET after the spacecraft failed to reappear for its 4,105th orbit and make contact with its handlers on Earth. \"Going out with a bang as it impacts the surface of Mercury, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for Nasa Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Messenger is the first spacecraft to have orbited the planet closest to the sun, and has sent back to Earth hundreds of thousands of images of the blistered world, where temperatures can surpass 800F in the day and -290F at night. Nancy Chabot, an instrument scientist for Messenger with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, said \"the mission has revolutionized what we know about Mercury, we are rewriting the book on it. We literally have plans for a new Mercury book\". \"It's definitely said but we are trying to celebrate how much it's accomplished,\" Chabot said. \"It's a challenging thing to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, where, well, it gets hot. It's been a constant learning curve and the spacecraft has had to do some interesting maneuvers - it's not just the sun that's hot, the planet's surface is also radiating heat.\" Nasa launched Messenger toward Mercury in 2004, and the vessel borrowed gravity and sailed the pressure of sunlight \" for seven years, looping its way around planets until finally it reached orbit around the planet closest to the sun. \"The mission was designed to last one year, and here we are four years later, with 277,000 images. In the original proposal it said something like 2,500 images. We've really surpassed all expectations.\" There was no doubt however that Messenger's time had come to finally reach the surface of the planet it had circled for years: \"It's just a matter of when at this point,\" Chabot said. During its four years in orbit, Messenger delivered massive amounts of data to scientists, who have hailed the mission as a spectacular success. Among its discoveries was Mercury's polar regions contain large quantities of frozen water, under a mysterious \"dark layer\" of material that may be organic compounds. Chabot and others will now set to work mining the massive trove of data about the planet. They will map the polar deposits in detail and try to pin down when ice reached the planet, which in turn could help understand how water is distributed around the solar system. Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission and recent recipient of the national medal of science, said earlier in April that \"this dark material may in fact be organic, carbonaceous material delivered to Mercury the building blocks for organic chemistry and life.\" Messenger also found that the planet's volcanic, scarred surface comprises a far greater variety of elements and minerals than scientists had expected, and that the planet has a puzzling magnetic field that is offset 20% from the north pole, unlike the more centred, symmetrical field of Earth, where the offset is more like 11%. The discoveries of Mercury's strange makeup \"throws some of their models out\" about how the planet and solar system formed, Chabot said, forcing scientists to overhaul their hypotheses. The mission has also provided striking mapped images of the planet, showing signs of volcanoes erupting from underneath ancient lava fields and strange \"hollows\", which are steep holes in the surface where materials seemingly vaporized or boiled away into airless space. \"The hollows are still this mysterious feature,\" Chabot said, \"where it looks like we're actively losing material off of the planet, but we don't have detailed explanation why.\" Other discoveries include the curious facts that Mercury has shrunk by several kilometers since the planet formed, that swirling space weather event s occur at Mercury, and that Mercury may be \" a giant dust collector \", as Nasa planetary dynamist Joseph Hahn said last year, where periodic meteor showers strike and scatter material. Chabot said the Messenger teams plan to put as much as possible of the data into public archives, so that people can study the knowledge without necessarily needing Nasa's sophisticated technology - and to inspire new questions and answers. \"There will be things we haven't even thought of,\" Chabot said. \"If you make all the data available, new science questions come.\" Although Nasa scientists hope for an eventual lander mission to Mercury, the next mission to the planet will be run by the European Space Agency, whose BepiColombo mission should reach orbit in the 2020s.

NASA Probe Crashes Into Mercury", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft slammed into the surface of Mercury on Thursday, bringing a groundbreaking mission to a dramatic end. The MESSENGER probe crashed at 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday, gouging a new crater into Mercury's heavily pockmarked surface. This violent demise was inevitable for MESSENGER, which had been orbiting Mercury since March 2011 and had run out of fuel. The 10-foot-wide spacecraft was traveling about 8,750 mph at the time of impact, and it likely created a smoking hole in the ground about 52 feet wide in Mercury's northern terrain, NASA officials said. No observers or instruments witnessed today's crash, which occurred on the opposite side of Mercury from Earth. MESSENGER was the first spacecraft ever to orbit the solar system's innermost planet, and its observations over the last four years helped lift the veil on mysterious Mercury, mission team members said. \"Although Mercury is one of Earth's nearest planetary neighbors, astonishingly little was known when we set out,\" MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. \"MESSENGER has at last brought Mercury up to the level of understanding of its sister planets in the inner solar system,\" Solomon added. \"Of course, the more we learn, the more new questions we can ask, and there are ample reasons to return to Mercury with new missions.\" Confirmation of MESSENGER's death came at 3:40 p.m. EDT, when NASA's Deep Space Network station in Goldstone, California, was unable to detect a signal from the spacecraft, NASA officials said. \"On behalf of MESSENGER, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it,\" mission team members tweeted Thursday, via the @MESSENGER2011 account. The $450 million MESSENGER spacecraft, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The probe took a long and looping trip through the inner solar system, relying on flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow down enough to be captured by Mercury's gravity. MESSENGER finally arrived at Mercury on March 17, 2011, becoming the first probe ever to orbit the heat-blasted world, and just the second spacecraft ever to study it up close. performed three Mercury flybys in 1974 and 1975. MESSENGER's original mission at Mercury was supposed to last just one year, but NASA extended operations twice so the probe could continue its observations, which team members say have revolutionized our understanding of the planet. For example, MESSENGER mapped the planet in unprecedented detail, discovered that Mercury hosts a strangely offset magnetic field and confirmed that permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles harbor deposits of water ice. \"The water now stored in ice deposits in the permanently shadowed floors of impact craters at Mercury's poles most likely was delivered to the innermost planet by the impacts of comets and volatile-rich asteroids,\" Solomon said. \"By this interpretation, Mercury's polar regions serve as a witness plate to the delivery to the inner solar system of water and organic compounds from the outer solar system, a process that much earlier may have led to prebiotic chemical synthesis and the origin of life on Earth.\" During the course of its four years at Mercury, MESSENGER captured more than 250,000 images and used its seven scientific instruments to gather extensive data sets that will keep scientists busy for years to come, NASA officials said. The mission also leaves a technological legacy that could help future spacecraft work in harsh environments, officials added. For instance, MESSENGER's ceramic-cloth sunshade effectively protected the probe's instruments against powerful solar radiation. \"The front side of the sunshade routinely experience d temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of components in its shadow routinely operate d near room temperature ,\" MESSENGER project manager Helene Winters, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in the same statement. MESSENGER blazed a trail that another spacecraft will be following soon: The joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo consists of two different orbiters. One of them will study Mercury's surface and internal composition, and the other will focus on the planet's magnetosphere. During the course of its work, BepiColombo may identify and investigate MESSENGER's grave, in an attempt to better understand how space weathering affects Mercury's surface, Solomon said. The BepiColombo team \"will be looking for signs of MESSENGER's crater, and if they can make measurements of it, they will know precisely how long that region has been exposed to space,\" Solomon said during a news briefing earlier this month. \"That will be an important study that comes a decade from now.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29281-messenger-spacecraft-mercury-crash.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Want to Name a Crater on Mercury?

The mission has lasted much longer and returned much more data than NASA officials expected. The probe launched in 2004 and traveled almost 8 billion miles to reach Mercury. MESSENGER was supposed to capture only 2,500 images of its target planet but has returned more than 250,000 snapshots. However, next spring, the spacecraft will finally run out of fuel, succumb to the planet's gravitational pull and crash-land on its surface. The mission has radically changed astronomers' understanding of Mercury. The spacecraft revealed that Mercury likely harbors ice water around its north and south poles - two areas of the planet that are constantly shaded from the sun.

The spacecraft's propellent supply is running low and it will eventually crash into the surface of Mercury. On Jan. 21, MESSENGER will fire its thrusters in a 120-second burst which will boost it up to an altitude of 50 miles. Before that happens, MESSENGER will descend to an altitude of 16 miles, closer than ever to the planet's surface, subjecting it to heat extreme enough to melt the solder of some of its scientific instruments.While MESSENGER's sun shade is designed to withstand temperatures up to 350 degrees Celsius, The Surface of Mercury will radiate heat back onto the shaded instruments. When MESSENGER's Altitude dips below 26 kilometers, the shaded area will warm up to 185 degrees Celsius and the solder will begin to melt. \"When we designed the vehicle, we of course knew what temperature the solder melted at, but we weren't anticipating operating this long, and at these low altitudes,\" said MESSENGER engineer Dan O'Shaughnessy. During MESSENGER's close approach of Mercury, the spacecraft will get an unprecedented view of the planet's cratered surface and collect data on its gravity field, surface makeup and the contents of its craters. MESSENGER was originally expected to impact on the surface of Mercury in late March but engineers believe they have found a way to extend the mission by as much as a month. The strategy would exploit the gaseous helium used to pressurize the spacecrafts propellent tanks. The gas can be used to make small corrections to MESSENGER's trajectory. \"The team continues to find inventive ways to keep MESSENGER going, all while providing an unprecedented vantage point for studying Mercury,\" said Stewart Bushman, lead propulsion engineer for the mission. \"To my knowledge this is the first time that helium pressurant has been intentionally used as a cold- gas propellant through hydrazine thrusters. These engines are not optimized to use pressurized gas as a propellant source. They have flow restrictors and orifices for hydrazine that reduce the feed pressure, hampering performance compared with actual cold-gas engines, which are little more than valves with a nozzle.\" MESSENGER's eventual crash site is uncertain due to Mercury's uneven gravity. It is likely to land on the planet's far side, where it will be out of site until the European Space Agency's BepiColombo mission arrives in 2024.

For example, the mission has constructed the best-ever maps of Mercury, and it also discovered carbon-containing organic compounds and water ice inside permanently shadowed craters near the rocky world's north pole. Messenger is currently operating on an extended mission, and the spacecraft is almost out of fuel. When its tank is empty, Messenger will succumb to the force of the sun's gravity and spiral down to its doom on Mercury. The probe's handlers want to wring as much science out of the mission as possible - hence, the current sequence of orbit-raising maneuvers, which seeks to extend a low-altitude \"hover\" campaign designed to get great close-up looks at Mercury. Messenger's final days of operation will prioritize observations made by the spacecraft's magnetometer and neutron spectrometer, mission team members said. \"With NS, scientists will hone in on shadowed craters at northern high latitudes to search for water ice. We have found such evidence previously in the mission, but we hope to find more at low altitudes and spatially resolve the distribution within individual craters if we are lucky,\" Messenger Deputy Project Scientist Haje Korth, also of APL, said in the same statement. \"With MAG, we will look for crustal magnetic anomalies,\" Korth added. \"Establishing the presence of crustal magnetic anomalies on Mercury would be a huge result, because it would extend the known temporal baseline for Mercury's internal magnetic field by eight orders of magnitude.\" Last week's 32-second engine burn, which occurred March 18, increased Messenger's closest-approach altitude from 7.2 miles to 21.4 miles, mission representatives said.

The Messenger probe launched from Earth in 2004 and has been mapping Mercury in exquisite detail since it arrived in orbit in 2011. The spacecraft has beamed back a series of breathtaking images of the tiny, scorched world, which orbits so close to the sun that daytime temperatures reach 427 Celsius. Mercury swings around the sun at an average distance of 36m miles, much closer than Earth, which orbits at a distance of about 93m miles. \"Messenger has been an amazing mission. The only previous Mercury mission, Mariner 10, flew post the planet three times in 1974 and 1975 giving us only an incomplete view.

The spacecraft is close to running out of fuel and is expected to crash into the surface of the planet at 8,750 miles per hour on Thursday at 8.30pm UK time. Nasa scientists said the probe would crash into the far side of Mercury, beyond the view of ground-based telescopes. The space agency will only confirm that the impact has taken place when Messenger fails to reappear hours later.

It's the beginning of a longer journey to analyse the data that reveals all the scientific mysteries of Mercury.\" Data beamed back from the spacecraft suggest that large quantities of frozen water - enough to cover Washington DC in a two mile thick layer of ice - lie in Mercury's permanently shadowed polar craters. The surface of the ice is tainted with dark patches that are thought to be organic compounds. \"It is now apparent that Mercury is a misfit planet that seems not to belong where we now find it. It is dense even for a rocky planet, showing that its iron-rich core occupies more than 80% of Mercury's radius,\" said Rothery. \"The outer part of the core must still be molten, because this is where Mercury's magnetic field is generated - a characteristic shared with the Earth, but not with Venus, Mars or the Moon.\" Images from Messenger have revealed signs of recent volcanic eruptions blasting upwards through Mercury's ancient lava fields. Others point to mysterious \"hollows\", which are steep, flat-bottomed depressions in the planet where the top 10 metres or so of the surface are missing. \"Airless Mercury has no wind to blow it away, and there are no signs of collapse into underground cavities, so we are forced to conclude that something in the ground has been turned to vapour and lost to space,\" Rothery said.

The first spacecraft to circle Mercury, Messenger is expected to slip out of orbit and slam into Mercury on Thursday following a successful four-year tour of the rocky planet. The spacecraft will be travelling 14,081 kilometres per hour when it hits, fast enough to carve out a crater 16 metres wide. The spacecraft itself stretches 3 metres solar wingtip to wingtip. Messenger has run out of fuel, but ground controllers managed in recent weeks to eke out some extra life, raising Messenger's orbit by dipping into helium gas reserves not originally intended for use as fuel. But now that's all gone and Messenger is at the mercy of gravity. \"I guess the end is coming,\" the Messenger team said via Twitter earlier this week. \"After 10 years, spacecraft will end life as just another crater on Mercury's surface.\" A look at Mercury's soon-to-be-obliterated travel companion: Roundabout flight. Messenger rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 2004. It flew twice past Venus and three times past Mercury, before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011. Only one other spacecraft, NASA's Mariner 10, has ever visited Mercury, and that was back in the 1970s. Mariner 10 flew past, but did not orbit the innermost planet. The $427 million Messenger mission was developed and run for NASA by Johns Hopkins University. During its four years in orbit - comprising more than 4,000 laps - Messenger has revealed volcanic deposits that are helping to explain the planet's important eruptive and interior-melting past; polar caps of frozen water at or near the surface; and incredible global shrinkage thanks to a cooling interior. In addition, despite its proximity to the sun, Mercury is more abundant in volatile elements, like potassium and sulfur, than anticipated before Messenger's arrival, according to Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Planetary scientists will be looking at Messenger's huge stash of data \"for years, probably for decades, as we try to understand the origin and evolution of Mercury,\" Solomon said. Super sunshade. Messenger's creators needed to keep the spacecraft cool during its super-hot mission at Mercury. \"It's an enormously hostile environment,\" said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Designers came up with a novel sunshade of lightweight ceramic cloth. This sunscreen tolerated more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit on the front, while keeping everything behind it at room temperature, including the seven scientific instruments. Messenger also regularly performed \"an intricate dance\" to balance all the infrared heat that was reflected off Mercury back at the spacecraft. At the same time, engineers equipped Messenger with numerous heaters to keep the fuel from freezing and the electronics from faltering when the spacecraft ducked behind the planet, away from the sun. On Thursday, Messenger is expected to crash into the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. So there will be no cameras or observatories to witness the impact. Scientists expect to gather information from Messenger until 10 to 15 minutes before its fatal plunge. The expected crash site is about two-thirds of the way up the planet, near the north pole. Mercury is the smallest planet - a little bigger than our moon. A pair of European and Japanese spacecraft will aim for Mercury following a 2017 launch from South America's French Guiana. It will take seven years for the two satellites to reach Mercury and enter its orbit, in 2024. The mission is called BepiColombo after the late Italian scientist who came up with the calculations for repeated fly-bys of Mercury by Mariner 10.

Out of fuel after more than a decade in space, the robotic Messenger probe slammed into the planet at about 3.26pm ET, on the far side of Mercury and out of sight of telescopes. Hurtling toward the planet at more than 8,700mph, Messenger smashed into a plain smoothed over by past lava floods, according to Nasa's estimates. The probe crashed near a large impact basin named Shakespeare, a 250-mile-diameter zone of craters; Messenger's own crater is estimated to be 52ft at its widest. Nasa confirmed the impact at 3.26 pm ET after the spacecraft failed to reappear for its 4,105th orbit and make contact with its handlers on Earth. \"Going out with a bang as it impacts the surface of Mercury, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for Nasa Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Messenger is the first spacecraft to have orbited the planet closest to the sun, and has sent back to Earth hundreds of thousands of images of the blistered world, where temperatures can surpass 800F in the day and -290F at night. Nancy Chabot, an instrument scientist for Messenger with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, said \"the mission has revolutionized what we know about Mercury, we are rewriting the book on it. We literally have plans for a new Mercury book\". \"It's definitely said but we are trying to celebrate how much it's accomplished,\" Chabot said. \"It's a challenging thing to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, where, well, it gets hot. It's been a constant learning curve and the spacecraft has had to do some interesting maneuvers - it's not just the sun that's hot, the planet's surface is also radiating heat.\" Nasa launched Messenger toward Mercury in 2004, and the vessel borrowed gravity and sailed the pressure of sunlight \" for seven years, looping its way around planets until finally it reached orbit around the planet closest to the sun. \"The mission was designed to last one year, and here we are four years later, with 277,000 images. In the original proposal it said something like 2,500 images. We've really surpassed all expectations.\" There was no doubt however that Messenger's time had come to finally reach the surface of the planet it had circled for years: \"It's just a matter of when at this point,\" Chabot said. During its four years in orbit, Messenger delivered massive amounts of data to scientists, who have hailed the mission as a spectacular success. Among its discoveries was Mercury's polar regions contain large quantities of frozen water, under a mysterious \"dark layer\" of material that may be organic compounds. Chabot and others will now set to work mining the massive trove of data about the planet. They will map the polar deposits in detail and try to pin down when ice reached the planet, which in turn could help understand how water is distributed around the solar system. Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission and recent recipient of the national medal of science, said earlier in April that \"this dark material may in fact be organic, carbonaceous material delivered to Mercury the building blocks for organic chemistry and life.\" Messenger also found that the planet's volcanic, scarred surface comprises a far greater variety of elements and minerals than scientists had expected, and that the planet has a puzzling magnetic field that is offset 20% from the north pole, unlike the more centred, symmetrical field of Earth, where the offset is more like 11%. The discoveries of Mercury's strange makeup \"throws some of their models out\" about how the planet and solar system formed, Chabot said, forcing scientists to overhaul their hypotheses. The mission has also provided striking mapped images of the planet, showing signs of volcanoes erupting from underneath ancient lava fields and strange \"hollows\", which are steep holes in the surface where materials seemingly vaporized or boiled away into airless space. \"The hollows are still this mysterious feature,\" Chabot said, \"where it looks like we're actively losing material off of the planet, but we don't have detailed explanation why.\" Other discoveries include the curious facts that Mercury has shrunk by several kilometers since the planet formed, that swirling space weather event s occur at Mercury, and that Mercury may be \" a giant dust collector \", as Nasa planetary dynamist Joseph Hahn said last year, where periodic meteor showers strike and scatter material. Chabot said the Messenger teams plan to put as much as possible of the data into public archives, so that people can study the knowledge without necessarily needing Nasa's sophisticated technology - and to inspire new questions and answers. \"There will be things we haven't even thought of,\" Chabot said. \"If you make all the data available, new science questions come.\" Although Nasa scientists hope for an eventual lander mission to Mercury, the next mission to the planet will be run by the European Space Agency, whose BepiColombo mission should reach orbit in the 2020s.

NASA Probe Crashes Into Mercury", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft slammed into the surface of Mercury on Thursday, bringing a groundbreaking mission to a dramatic end. The MESSENGER probe crashed at 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday, gouging a new crater into Mercury's heavily pockmarked surface. This violent demise was inevitable for MESSENGER, which had been orbiting Mercury since March 2011 and had run out of fuel. The 10-foot-wide spacecraft was traveling about 8,750 mph at the time of impact, and it likely created a smoking hole in the ground about 52 feet wide in Mercury's northern terrain, NASA officials said. No observers or instruments witnessed today's crash, which occurred on the opposite side of Mercury from Earth. MESSENGER was the first spacecraft ever to orbit the solar system's innermost planet, and its observations over the last four years helped lift the veil on mysterious Mercury, mission team members said. \"Although Mercury is one of Earth's nearest planetary neighbors, astonishingly little was known when we set out,\" MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. \"MESSENGER has at last brought Mercury up to the level of understanding of its sister planets in the inner solar system,\" Solomon added. \"Of course, the more we learn, the more new questions we can ask, and there are ample reasons to return to Mercury with new missions.\" Confirmation of MESSENGER's death came at 3:40 p.m. EDT, when NASA's Deep Space Network station in Goldstone, California, was unable to detect a signal from the spacecraft, NASA officials said. \"On behalf of MESSENGER, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it,\" mission team members tweeted Thursday, via the @MESSENGER2011 account. The $450 million MESSENGER spacecraft, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The probe took a long and looping trip through the inner solar system, relying on flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow down enough to be captured by Mercury's gravity. MESSENGER finally arrived at Mercury on March 17, 2011, becoming the first probe ever to orbit the heat-blasted world, and just the second spacecraft ever to study it up close. performed three Mercury flybys in 1974 and 1975. MESSENGER's original mission at Mercury was supposed to last just one year, but NASA extended operations twice so the probe could continue its observations, which team members say have revolutionized our understanding of the planet. For example, MESSENGER mapped the planet in unprecedented detail, discovered that Mercury hosts a strangely offset magnetic field and confirmed that permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles harbor deposits of water ice. \"The water now stored in ice deposits in the permanently shadowed floors of impact craters at Mercury's poles most likely was delivered to the innermost planet by the impacts of comets and volatile-rich asteroids,\" Solomon said. \"By this interpretation, Mercury's polar regions serve as a witness plate to the delivery to the inner solar system of water and organic compounds from the outer solar system, a process that much earlier may have led to prebiotic chemical synthesis and the origin of life on Earth.\" During the course of its four years at Mercury, MESSENGER captured more than 250,000 images and used its seven scientific instruments to gather extensive data sets that will keep scientists busy for years to come, NASA officials said. The mission also leaves a technological legacy that could help future spacecraft work in harsh environments, officials added. For instance, MESSENGER's ceramic-cloth sunshade effectively protected the probe's instruments against powerful solar radiation. \"The front side of the sunshade routinely experience d temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of components in its shadow routinely operate d near room temperature ,\" MESSENGER project manager Helene Winters, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in the same statement. MESSENGER blazed a trail that another spacecraft will be following soon: The joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo consists of two different orbiters. One of them will study Mercury's surface and internal composition, and the other will focus on the planet's magnetosphere. During the course of its work, BepiColombo may identify and investigate MESSENGER's grave, in an attempt to better understand how space weathering affects Mercury's surface, Solomon said. The BepiColombo team \"will be looking for signs of MESSENGER's crater, and if they can make measurements of it, they will know precisely how long that region has been exposed to space,\" Solomon said during a news briefing earlier this month. \"That will be an important study that comes a decade from now.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29281-messenger-spacecraft-mercury-crash.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Messenger spacecraft falls from orbit into Mercury", "date": "2015-05-01", "content": "Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit hot, little Mercury, in 2011.

Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys - once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit - and survived \"both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation\" to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravity's relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system - also counting Mars and Venus - to be littered by mankind. Thursday's crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone - a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. \"Well I guess it is time to say goodbye,\" the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: \"On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it.\" Astronomers who used Messenger to detect Mercury's frozen water-covered poles and significantly off-center magnetic field called it an end of an era. Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planet's eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. \"It has been an amazing journey of discovery,\" said the University of British Columbia's Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messenger's $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission.

The spacecraft's propellent supply is running low and it will eventually crash into the surface of Mercury. On Jan. 21, MESSENGER will fire its thrusters in a 120-second burst which will boost it up to an altitude of 50 miles. Before that happens, MESSENGER will descend to an altitude of 16 miles, closer than ever to the planet's surface, subjecting it to heat extreme enough to melt the solder of some of its scientific instruments.While MESSENGER's sun shade is designed to withstand temperatures up to 350 degrees Celsius, The Surface of Mercury will radiate heat back onto the shaded instruments. When MESSENGER's Altitude dips below 26 kilometers, the shaded area will warm up to 185 degrees Celsius and the solder will begin to melt. \"When we designed the vehicle, we of course knew what temperature the solder melted at, but we weren't anticipating operating this long, and at these low altitudes,\" said MESSENGER engineer Dan O'Shaughnessy. During MESSENGER's close approach of Mercury, the spacecraft will get an unprecedented view of the planet's cratered surface and collect data on its gravity field, surface makeup and the contents of its craters. MESSENGER was originally expected to impact on the surface of Mercury in late March but engineers believe they have found a way to extend the mission by as much as a month. The strategy would exploit the gaseous helium used to pressurize the spacecrafts propellent tanks. The gas can be used to make small corrections to MESSENGER's trajectory. \"The team continues to find inventive ways to keep MESSENGER going, all while providing an unprecedented vantage point for studying Mercury,\" said Stewart Bushman, lead propulsion engineer for the mission. \"To my knowledge this is the first time that helium pressurant has been intentionally used as a cold- gas propellant through hydrazine thrusters. These engines are not optimized to use pressurized gas as a propellant source. They have flow restrictors and orifices for hydrazine that reduce the feed pressure, hampering performance compared with actual cold-gas engines, which are little more than valves with a nozzle.\" MESSENGER's eventual crash site is uncertain due to Mercury's uneven gravity. It is likely to land on the planet's far side, where it will be out of site until the European Space Agency's BepiColombo mission arrives in 2024.

The previously unidentified regions of Mercury have compositions that differ significantly from the crust around them. Known as geochemical terranes, these zones provide insight into the formation of the outer skin of the planet. The maps appear in two new studies, which suggest that the most recently identified features may have formed not from the planet's crust but from just below it, in the mantle. Created using the X-Ray Spectrometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instruments on NASA's MESSENGER probe, the maps are used to study the surface chemistry of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. This analysis will provide information about the concentrations of elements like potassium, uranium and sodium on Mercury's surface. The experiment will also provide scientists with ratios of silicon to other elements on the planet's surface. The first study used the XRS to produce the first global geochemical maps of Mercury, using a novel method performed for the first time on a planetary scale. By studying X-rays streaming from the sun, the authors were able to examine the composition of geochemical terranes on the planet. \"The consistency of the new XRS and GRS maps provides a new dimension to our view of Mercury's surface,\" lead author Shoshana Weider, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said in a statement. \"The terranes we observed had not been previously identified on the basis of spectral reflectance or geographical mapping.\" The most obvious of these unusual terranes is a large feature that covers more than 3 million square miles of the planet's surface. This terrane exhibits the highest observed ratios of silicon to each of the elements of magnesium, sulfur and calcium, as well as some of the lowest aluminum-to-silicon ratios on the planet, according to a new paper published this week in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. One possible explanation for the unusual region is that it stems from an impact that occurred long ago. The exposed mantle could have aided in the creation of the extremely large feature. A second map used GRS to trace the absorption of low-energy neutrons across the surface of Mercury. This map shows the distribution across Mercury's northern hemisphere of elements that absorb thermal neutrons. By combining that information with previously obtained data, the authors were able to identify four distinct geochemical terranes on the planet. The Caloris basin on Mercury, the planet's largest well-preserved impact basin, contains smooth interior plains that the new results reveal have a distinct composition from other volcanic plains on the planet. According to the authors, these plains formed by partial melting of the mantle. \"Earlier MESSENGER data have shown that Mercury's surface was pervasively shaped by volcanic activity,\" Patrick Peplowski, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper concerning the second map, said in the same statement. \"The magmas erupted long ago and were derived from the partial melting of Mercury's mantle,\" he said. \"The differences in composition that we are observing among geochemical terranes indicate that Mercury has a chemically heterogeneous mantle.\" The second study appeared online in the journal Icarus. \"The crust we see on Mercury was largely formed more than 3 billion years ago,\" said Larry Nittler, deputy principle investigator of the mission and co- author on both studies. \"The remarkable chemical variability revealed by MESSENGER observations will provide critical constraints on future efforts to model and understand Mercury's bulk composition and the ancient geological processes that shaped the planet's mantle and crust.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28836-mercury-surface-mapped-nasa-messenger.html"}, {"title": "NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month", "date": "2015-03-29", "content": "A NASA Mercury probe isn't ready to finish its groundbreaking work at the solar system's innermost planet just yet.

The first spacecraft to circle Mercury, Messenger is expected to slip out of orbit and slam into Mercury on Thursday following a successful four-year tour of the rocky planet. The spacecraft will be travelling 14,081 kilometres per hour when it hits, fast enough to carve out a crater 16 metres wide. The spacecraft itself stretches 3 metres solar wingtip to wingtip. Messenger has run out of fuel, but ground controllers managed in recent weeks to eke out some extra life, raising Messenger's orbit by dipping into helium gas reserves not originally intended for use as fuel. But now that's all gone and Messenger is at the mercy of gravity. \"I guess the end is coming,\" the Messenger team said via Twitter earlier this week. \"After 10 years, spacecraft will end life as just another crater on Mercury's surface.\" A look at Mercury's soon-to-be-obliterated travel companion: Roundabout flight. Messenger rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 2004. It flew twice past Venus and three times past Mercury, before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011. Only one other spacecraft, NASA's Mariner 10, has ever visited Mercury, and that was back in the 1970s. Mariner 10 flew past, but did not orbit the innermost planet. The $427 million Messenger mission was developed and run for NASA by Johns Hopkins University. During its four years in orbit - comprising more than 4,000 laps - Messenger has revealed volcanic deposits that are helping to explain the planet's important eruptive and interior-melting past; polar caps of frozen water at or near the surface; and incredible global shrinkage thanks to a cooling interior. In addition, despite its proximity to the sun, Mercury is more abundant in volatile elements, like potassium and sulfur, than anticipated before Messenger's arrival, according to Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Planetary scientists will be looking at Messenger's huge stash of data \"for years, probably for decades, as we try to understand the origin and evolution of Mercury,\" Solomon said. Super sunshade. Messenger's creators needed to keep the spacecraft cool during its super-hot mission at Mercury. \"It's an enormously hostile environment,\" said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Designers came up with a novel sunshade of lightweight ceramic cloth. This sunscreen tolerated more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit on the front, while keeping everything behind it at room temperature, including the seven scientific instruments. Messenger also regularly performed \"an intricate dance\" to balance all the infrared heat that was reflected off Mercury back at the spacecraft. At the same time, engineers equipped Messenger with numerous heaters to keep the fuel from freezing and the electronics from faltering when the spacecraft ducked behind the planet, away from the sun. On Thursday, Messenger is expected to crash into the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. So there will be no cameras or observatories to witness the impact. Scientists expect to gather information from Messenger until 10 to 15 minutes before its fatal plunge. The expected crash site is about two-thirds of the way up the planet, near the north pole. Mercury is the smallest planet - a little bigger than our moon. A pair of European and Japanese spacecraft will aim for Mercury following a 2017 launch from South America's French Guiana. It will take seven years for the two satellites to reach Mercury and enter its orbit, in 2024. The mission is called BepiColombo after the late Italian scientist who came up with the calculations for repeated fly-bys of Mercury by Mariner 10.

Out of fuel after more than a decade in space, the robotic Messenger probe slammed into the planet at about 3.26pm ET, on the far side of Mercury and out of sight of telescopes. Hurtling toward the planet at more than 8,700mph, Messenger smashed into a plain smoothed over by past lava floods, according to Nasa's estimates. The probe crashed near a large impact basin named Shakespeare, a 250-mile-diameter zone of craters; Messenger's own crater is estimated to be 52ft at its widest. Nasa confirmed the impact at 3.26 pm ET after the spacecraft failed to reappear for its 4,105th orbit and make contact with its handlers on Earth. \"Going out with a bang as it impacts the surface of Mercury, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for Nasa Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Messenger is the first spacecraft to have orbited the planet closest to the sun, and has sent back to Earth hundreds of thousands of images of the blistered world, where temperatures can surpass 800F in the day and -290F at night. Nancy Chabot, an instrument scientist for Messenger with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, said \"the mission has revolutionized what we know about Mercury, we are rewriting the book on it. We literally have plans for a new Mercury book\". \"It's definitely said but we are trying to celebrate how much it's accomplished,\" Chabot said. \"It's a challenging thing to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, where, well, it gets hot. It's been a constant learning curve and the spacecraft has had to do some interesting maneuvers - it's not just the sun that's hot, the planet's surface is also radiating heat.\" Nasa launched Messenger toward Mercury in 2004, and the vessel borrowed gravity and sailed the pressure of sunlight \" for seven years, looping its way around planets until finally it reached orbit around the planet closest to the sun. \"The mission was designed to last one year, and here we are four years later, with 277,000 images. In the original proposal it said something like 2,500 images. We've really surpassed all expectations.\" There was no doubt however that Messenger's time had come to finally reach the surface of the planet it had circled for years: \"It's just a matter of when at this point,\" Chabot said. During its four years in orbit, Messenger delivered massive amounts of data to scientists, who have hailed the mission as a spectacular success. Among its discoveries was Mercury's polar regions contain large quantities of frozen water, under a mysterious \"dark layer\" of material that may be organic compounds. Chabot and others will now set to work mining the massive trove of data about the planet. They will map the polar deposits in detail and try to pin down when ice reached the planet, which in turn could help understand how water is distributed around the solar system. Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission and recent recipient of the national medal of science, said earlier in April that \"this dark material may in fact be organic, carbonaceous material delivered to Mercury the building blocks for organic chemistry and life.\" Messenger also found that the planet's volcanic, scarred surface comprises a far greater variety of elements and minerals than scientists had expected, and that the planet has a puzzling magnetic field that is offset 20% from the north pole, unlike the more centred, symmetrical field of Earth, where the offset is more like 11%. The discoveries of Mercury's strange makeup \"throws some of their models out\" about how the planet and solar system formed, Chabot said, forcing scientists to overhaul their hypotheses. The mission has also provided striking mapped images of the planet, showing signs of volcanoes erupting from underneath ancient lava fields and strange \"hollows\", which are steep holes in the surface where materials seemingly vaporized or boiled away into airless space. \"The hollows are still this mysterious feature,\" Chabot said, \"where it looks like we're actively losing material off of the planet, but we don't have detailed explanation why.\" Other discoveries include the curious facts that Mercury has shrunk by several kilometers since the planet formed, that swirling space weather event s occur at Mercury, and that Mercury may be \" a giant dust collector \", as Nasa planetary dynamist Joseph Hahn said last year, where periodic meteor showers strike and scatter material. Chabot said the Messenger teams plan to put as much as possible of the data into public archives, so that people can study the knowledge without necessarily needing Nasa's sophisticated technology - and to inspire new questions and answers. \"There will be things we haven't even thought of,\" Chabot said. \"If you make all the data available, new science questions come.\" Although Nasa scientists hope for an eventual lander mission to Mercury, the next mission to the planet will be run by the European Space Agency, whose BepiColombo mission should reach orbit in the 2020s.

NASA Probe Crashes Into Mercury", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft slammed into the surface of Mercury on Thursday, bringing a groundbreaking mission to a dramatic end. The MESSENGER probe crashed at 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday, gouging a new crater into Mercury's heavily pockmarked surface. This violent demise was inevitable for MESSENGER, which had been orbiting Mercury since March 2011 and had run out of fuel. The 10-foot-wide spacecraft was traveling about 8,750 mph at the time of impact, and it likely created a smoking hole in the ground about 52 feet wide in Mercury's northern terrain, NASA officials said. No observers or instruments witnessed today's crash, which occurred on the opposite side of Mercury from Earth. MESSENGER was the first spacecraft ever to orbit the solar system's innermost planet, and its observations over the last four years helped lift the veil on mysterious Mercury, mission team members said. \"Although Mercury is one of Earth's nearest planetary neighbors, astonishingly little was known when we set out,\" MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. \"MESSENGER has at last brought Mercury up to the level of understanding of its sister planets in the inner solar system,\" Solomon added. \"Of course, the more we learn, the more new questions we can ask, and there are ample reasons to return to Mercury with new missions.\" Confirmation of MESSENGER's death came at 3:40 p.m. EDT, when NASA's Deep Space Network station in Goldstone, California, was unable to detect a signal from the spacecraft, NASA officials said. \"On behalf of MESSENGER, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it,\" mission team members tweeted Thursday, via the @MESSENGER2011 account. The $450 million MESSENGER spacecraft, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The probe took a long and looping trip through the inner solar system, relying on flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow down enough to be captured by Mercury's gravity. MESSENGER finally arrived at Mercury on March 17, 2011, becoming the first probe ever to orbit the heat-blasted world, and just the second spacecraft ever to study it up close. performed three Mercury flybys in 1974 and 1975. MESSENGER's original mission at Mercury was supposed to last just one year, but NASA extended operations twice so the probe could continue its observations, which team members say have revolutionized our understanding of the planet. For example, MESSENGER mapped the planet in unprecedented detail, discovered that Mercury hosts a strangely offset magnetic field and confirmed that permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles harbor deposits of water ice. \"The water now stored in ice deposits in the permanently shadowed floors of impact craters at Mercury's poles most likely was delivered to the innermost planet by the impacts of comets and volatile-rich asteroids,\" Solomon said. \"By this interpretation, Mercury's polar regions serve as a witness plate to the delivery to the inner solar system of water and organic compounds from the outer solar system, a process that much earlier may have led to prebiotic chemical synthesis and the origin of life on Earth.\" During the course of its four years at Mercury, MESSENGER captured more than 250,000 images and used its seven scientific instruments to gather extensive data sets that will keep scientists busy for years to come, NASA officials said. The mission also leaves a technological legacy that could help future spacecraft work in harsh environments, officials added. For instance, MESSENGER's ceramic-cloth sunshade effectively protected the probe's instruments against powerful solar radiation. \"The front side of the sunshade routinely experience d temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of components in its shadow routinely operate d near room temperature ,\" MESSENGER project manager Helene Winters, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in the same statement. MESSENGER blazed a trail that another spacecraft will be following soon: The joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo consists of two different orbiters. One of them will study Mercury's surface and internal composition, and the other will focus on the planet's magnetosphere. During the course of its work, BepiColombo may identify and investigate MESSENGER's grave, in an attempt to better understand how space weathering affects Mercury's surface, Solomon said. The BepiColombo team \"will be looking for signs of MESSENGER's crater, and if they can make measurements of it, they will know precisely how long that region has been exposed to space,\" Solomon said during a news briefing earlier this month. \"That will be an important study that comes a decade from now.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29281-messenger-spacecraft-mercury-crash.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Messenger spacecraft falls from orbit into Mercury", "date": "2015-05-01", "content": "Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit hot, little Mercury, in 2011.

Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys - once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit - and survived \"both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation\" to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravity's relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system - also counting Mars and Venus - to be littered by mankind. Thursday's crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone - a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. \"Well I guess it is time to say goodbye,\" the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: \"On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it.\" Astronomers who used Messenger to detect Mercury's frozen water-covered poles and significantly off-center magnetic field called it an end of an era. Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planet's eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. \"It has been an amazing journey of discovery,\" said the University of British Columbia's Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messenger's $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission. The Europeans and Japanese are teaming up for Mercury's next guests, a pair of satellites known as BepiColombo. They're scheduled for launch in 2017 and arrival in Mercury's orbit in 2024.

Mercury is the solar system's smallest and innermost world. It was an enigmatic planet for years. Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft became the first probe to orbit Mercury, the only other visits it received were the flybys made by NASA's Mariner 10 probe four decades ago. MESSENGER ended its mission in April by crashing into Mercury's surface. Images that MESSENGER collected during its more than four years in orbit revealed a vast array of large fault scarps, or cliffs, on Mercury. These scarps resemble giant stair steps in the landscape - the largest are more than 600 miles long and more than 1.8 miles high. These fault scarps form when rocks are pushed together, break and thrust upward along faults - or fractures - in the planet's crust. The most widely accepted model of the origin of these faults and scarps is that they are essentially wrinkles that formed on Mercury's surface as the planet's heart cooled over time, leading Mercury to shrink in size. Prior research has suggested that Mercury may have contracted by about 2.5 to 8.7 miles in diameter. If this planetwide array of fault scarps formed as Mercury shrank in size, these features should be uniformly scattered over the planet's surface. However, scientists now find there is a bewildering pattern to these fault scarps. \"It is a real mystery,\" study lead author Thomas Watters, a planetary scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, told Space.com. The scientists analyzed the largest, most prominent fault scarps on Mercury's surface, which were more than about 30 miles long. Unexpectedly, they discovered many scarps are concentrated in two wide bands that run north to south and are located on almost opposite sides of the planet from each other. One potential explanation for these bands might lie in the flow of hot rock in Mercury's mantle layer. \"However, the scale of flow in Mercury's mantle is too small to explain these bands, because Mercury's mantle is not very thick - only 400 kilometers or so, we think,\" Watters said. \"There must be other factors at play here we don't really have a grasp on yet.\" In addition, about twice as many of Mercury's large fault scarps are located in its southern hemisphere than in its northern hemisphere. Of the 407 fault scarps that were more than about 30 miles long that the researchers analyzed, 264 are in the south, adding up to about 20,500 miles, while 143 are in the north, for a total of about 8,700 miles. \"None of the models we have at present can account for the lopsided number of scarps between the hemispheres,\" Watters said. \"We still have a lot to learn about Mercury.\" The researchers will continue to analyze images and data from MESSENGER to shed light on this mystery. In addition, Watters noted that the BepiColombo spacecraft, set to launch in 2017, \"may be able to give us a better picture of the global structure of the crust of Mercury.\" The BepiColumbo spacecraft is a joint mission of the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. While Earth's surface is made up of multiple tectonic plates, Mercury only has one. \"Mercury is ideal for investigating how one-plate planets evolve,\" Watters said. \"Understanding Mercury is essential to explaining how planets may evolve elsewhere in the galaxy.\" The scientists detailed their findings online May 29 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

But up close, it's a different story. Thanks to images from NASA's Messenger probe, the solar system's innermost planet looks iridescent blue with patches of sandy-colored plains with strands of grayish white. Early images released by NASA have even shown purples and aquamarine -- a truly psychedelic planet. The different colors represent differences in Mercury's composition. The blue hues, for example, are younger parts of the planet while the darker sections represent areas that have long been exposed to the planet's harsh environment. The yellowish, tan-colored regions are \"intermediate terrain.\" Mercury also hosts brighter and smoother terrain known as high-reflectance red plains. One example can be seen towards the upper right, where there is a prominent patch that is roughly circular. This is the Caloris basin, an impact crater thought to have been created by an asteroid collision during the solar system's early days. Launched in 2004, Messenger spent the past four years in orbit around the closest planet to the sun -- a first in the history of planetary exploration -- working behind a sunshade to endure temperatures higher than 600 degrees Fahrenheit while beaming back more than 10 terabytes of data from a suite of sophisticated instruments. The images were taken before Messenger ended its orbit around Mercury in late April, crashing into the planet's surface. The probe managed to extend its mission by several weeks, after the spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly. The investigation of Mercury will be continued by ESA's BepiColombo, due for launch in 2017.

The probe fired the last of its maneuvering propellant two days before, ensuring contact with Earth for as long as possible. In the end, only 10 minutes of data was lost out of the 1,500 days worth of information collected by Messenger. Messenger was launched by NASA on August 3, 2004 and operated by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The spacecraft first flew by Mercury on January 14, 2008 and finally entered orbit March 18, 2011, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury since the 1975 flyby by Mariner 10 and the first orbital study of the planet ever. Before Messenger, there had never been a detailed study of Mercury. Due to the planet's proximity to the Sun, it has short and difficult viewing windows for ground based telescopes. It is also difficult for a spacecraft to travel to Mercury. The maneuver to match Mercury's close and fast orbit to the Sun takes more rocket fuel than it does to escape the Solar System. As a result, Mariner 10's three flybys were partial observations, mapping only 45 percent of Mercury's surface and providing only a small amount of high- resolution data that could be used to understand Mercury's geological history. Moreover, Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to Earth's, which was wholly unexpected. As only the third flyby was truly dedicated to studying the planet's magnetosphere, the data necessary to explore theories for the origin of the field would not be available until Messenger's arrival. Ground-based telescopes faced different predicaments. Instead of observing in visible light, astronomers bounced radio signals off Mercury, gathering information about the planet's surface temperature and rotation rate. The first of these studies was done by Soviet scientists led by Vladimir Kotelnikov in 1962. Subsequent studies were also able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the surface, including maps done by the Arecibo radar telescope which detected possible water ice at Mercury's poles. To answer the questions posed by these earlier observations, Messenger was launched with a suite of seven instruments. These were the Mercury Dual Imaging System, the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, the X-Ray Spectrometer, the Magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and the Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer. Combined, these experiments mapped the whole of Mercury in visible and infrared light, measured the topographical and chemical characteristics of the planet's surface, studied the changes in Mercury's magnetic field and observed shifts in the planet's atmosphere. By every measure, Messenger achieved its science goals. With a budget of just under $450 million, it sent back ten terabytes of data, including more than 275,000 high resolution images of the rocky world. Already, 181 articles have been produced with this data since Messenger entered orbit, involving an international team of more than 125 scientists and engineering labor from Canada, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy and the United States. One of the surprising findings is that Mercury has a high abundance of the elements potassium, sulfur and chlorine, along with an unexpectedly low content of thorium. The high sulfur content in particular indicates that Mercury's formation involved less oxygen than the other terrestrial planets. This rules out certain theories for Mercury's formation as well as for the formation of all the planets in the inner Solar System. Another constraint on theories of Mercury's formation is the presence of ice water at the poles. Previous ground-based radio observations detected highly reflective materials at the poles, but the geometry between Earth and Mercury is such that those observations couldn't get enough detail to determine the chemical composition of the deposits. Messenger's orbit allowed to get a clear view of what had previously been hidden and provided many lines of evidence - including direct observations and measuring the amount of neutrons emitted from Mercury's surface - to determine that there is in fact water ice present in the shadows of Mercury's polar craters. Work was also done studying Mercury's atmosphere. While thin, it does exist and was shown to vary seasonally. When Mercury is at it's farthest from the Sun, its sodium-rich atmosphere forms a thin shell near the surface of the planet. When it nears the Sun, however, the sunlight becomes intense enough to strip the atmosphere into a glowing tail that someone standing on Mercury's nightside would find reminiscent of the faint orange of a sky illuminated by a city's sodium streetlights. How the atmosphere regenerates itself is still unknown. One of the features noted about Mercury by Mariner 10 is that the planet appears to have contracted well after it was mostly formed. In a general sense, this can be seen from careful visible and radar imaging of the surface topography. With Messenger's ability to make highly accurate topographical maps, study Mercury's volcanic past and it's ability to trace the planet's geological history by looking at the layers in various craters, astronomers determined that Mercury's radius has shrunk by at least 7 kilometers since its formation. This is most likely as a result of a crust forming around Mercury's molten core that buckled as the core collapsed. Neither Earth, the Moon, Venus or Mars exhibit any evidence of a similar process. A number of things were discovered by Messenger about Mercury's magnetic field. First, the north and south ends of the field do not align as one would expect, but are offset by about 45 degrees. This, combined with the more intense solar magnetic fields, leads to complex interactions between the planet's magnetic field and the Sun's that are far more dynamic than those between the Sun and Earth. The magnetic measurements in particular provide a probe deep into Mercury's interior: from Messenger's data, the size, mass, composition and rotation rate of Mercury's iron core have been determined. The Messenger mission also provided a number of technical insights for future space missions, both to Mercury and elsewhere. As noted before, simply getting to Mercury turns out to be not so simple. As the mission was a low budget Discovery class mission, it did not have the payload size for the fuel needed to go directly that deep into the Sun's gravitational influence. Instead, it took a convoluted route first developed by Taiwanese physicist Chen-wan Yen in 1985 that involves six planetary flybys and five thruster corrections to match Mercury's orbit. Teams working on the craft also had to develop a ceramic cloth sunshade to protect both the scientific and communications instruments from the temperature changes between the harsh radiation of the Sun and the lack thereof when the spacecraft went into the shadow of Mercury. Being so close to the Sun also provided opportunities for the mission. Messenger was primarily powered by high-end solar panels. The soft pressure from the Sun's radiation was also used during the planetary flybys to make corrections that would have otherwise needed fuel. Messenger's most significant technical accomplishment is what has been termed hovering. It was known from the beginning that the Sun's gravitational influence would alter a spacecraft's orbit enough to need constant corrections. In the early part of Messenger's life, this gravitational attraction pulled the spacecraft towards the Sun. In the later part of the spacecraft's life, however, it drifted towards Mercury's surface. By using this effect and a clever use of propellant, Messenger was able to carry out measurements at distances from 35 kilometers to as little as five kilometers above Mercury's surface, making possible unprecedented measurement precision in the last several weeks of the spacecraft's life. Though the loss of Messenger was known about, planned for, and even used for science, it is still tragic. The past four years have uncovered a world which is key to understanding the Solar System and about which many questions, some motivated by Messenger's study alone, remain. The opportunities for future study will be limited: the European/Japanese probe BepiColombo will launch after years of delay - largely caused by funding starvation - in 2017, with arrival in 2024. This mission, whose originally planned lander component was cancelled by funding cutbacks in 2003, has been under development for 18 years. No further visits to Mercury are at present being planned.

The previously unidentified regions of Mercury have compositions that differ significantly from the crust around them. Known as geochemical terranes, these zones provide insight into the formation of the outer skin of the planet. The maps appear in two new studies, which suggest that the most recently identified features may have formed not from the planet's crust but from just below it, in the mantle. Created using the X-Ray Spectrometer and Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instruments on NASA's MESSENGER probe, the maps are used to study the surface chemistry of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. This analysis will provide information about the concentrations of elements like potassium, uranium and sodium on Mercury's surface. The experiment will also provide scientists with ratios of silicon to other elements on the planet's surface. The first study used the XRS to produce the first global geochemical maps of Mercury, using a novel method performed for the first time on a planetary scale. By studying X-rays streaming from the sun, the authors were able to examine the composition of geochemical terranes on the planet. \"The consistency of the new XRS and GRS maps provides a new dimension to our view of Mercury's surface,\" lead author Shoshana Weider, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said in a statement. \"The terranes we observed had not been previously identified on the basis of spectral reflectance or geographical mapping.\" The most obvious of these unusual terranes is a large feature that covers more than 3 million square miles of the planet's surface. This terrane exhibits the highest observed ratios of silicon to each of the elements of magnesium, sulfur and calcium, as well as some of the lowest aluminum-to-silicon ratios on the planet, according to a new paper published this week in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. One possible explanation for the unusual region is that it stems from an impact that occurred long ago. The exposed mantle could have aided in the creation of the extremely large feature. A second map used GRS to trace the absorption of low-energy neutrons across the surface of Mercury. This map shows the distribution across Mercury's northern hemisphere of elements that absorb thermal neutrons. By combining that information with previously obtained data, the authors were able to identify four distinct geochemical terranes on the planet. The Caloris basin on Mercury, the planet's largest well-preserved impact basin, contains smooth interior plains that the new results reveal have a distinct composition from other volcanic plains on the planet. According to the authors, these plains formed by partial melting of the mantle. \"Earlier MESSENGER data have shown that Mercury's surface was pervasively shaped by volcanic activity,\" Patrick Peplowski, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper concerning the second map, said in the same statement. \"The magmas erupted long ago and were derived from the partial melting of Mercury's mantle,\" he said. \"The differences in composition that we are observing among geochemical terranes indicate that Mercury has a chemically heterogeneous mantle.\" The second study appeared online in the journal Icarus. \"The crust we see on Mercury was largely formed more than 3 billion years ago,\" said Larry Nittler, deputy principle investigator of the mission and co- author on both studies. \"The remarkable chemical variability revealed by MESSENGER observations will provide critical constraints on future efforts to model and understand Mercury's bulk composition and the ancient geological processes that shaped the planet's mantle and crust.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/28836-mercury-surface-mapped-nasa-messenger.html"}, {"title": "NASA Mercury Probe Trying to Survive for Another Month", "date": "2015-03-29", "content": "A NASA Mercury probe isn't ready to finish its groundbreaking work at the solar system's innermost planet just yet. Last week, NASA's Messenger spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly and delay its inevitable impact into Mercury's surface by up to a month. \"We decided on a strategy that includes five maneuvers in as many weeks to keep the spacecraft within a tight altitude range of 5 to 39 kilometers 3 to 24 miles above the surface of Mercury at closest approach,\" Messenger Mission Design Lead Engineer Jim McAdams, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, said in a statement. If everything goes according to plan, Messenger could keep observing Mercury through April 30 or so, mission team members have said. The $450 million Messenger mission, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched in August 2004. After taking a circuitous route through the inner solar system, in March 2011 Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. The probe has achieved a great deal in its four years at the planet. For example, the mission has constructed the best-ever maps of Mercury, and it also discovered carbon-containing organic compounds and water ice inside permanently shadowed craters near the rocky world's north pole. Messenger is currently operating on an extended mission, and the spacecraft is almost out of fuel. When its tank is empty, Messenger will succumb to the force of the sun's gravity and spiral down to its doom on Mercury. The probe's handlers want to wring as much science out of the mission as possible - hence, the current sequence of orbit-raising maneuvers, which seeks to extend a low-altitude \"hover\" campaign designed to get great close-up looks at Mercury. Messenger's final days of operation will prioritize observations made by the spacecraft's magnetometer and neutron spectrometer, mission team members said. \"With NS, scientists will hone in on shadowed craters at northern high latitudes to search for water ice. We have found such evidence previously in the mission, but we hope to find more at low altitudes and spatially resolve the distribution within individual craters if we are lucky,\" Messenger Deputy Project Scientist Haje Korth, also of APL, said in the same statement. \"With MAG, we will look for crustal magnetic anomalies,\" Korth added. \"Establishing the presence of crustal magnetic anomalies on Mercury would be a huge result, because it would extend the known temporal baseline for Mercury's internal magnetic field by eight orders of magnitude.\" Last week's 32-second engine burn, which occurred March 18, increased Messenger's closest-approach altitude from 7.2 miles to 21.4 miles, mission representatives said.

The Messenger probe launched from Earth in 2004 and has been mapping Mercury in exquisite detail since it arrived in orbit in 2011. The spacecraft has beamed back a series of breathtaking images of the tiny, scorched world, which orbits so close to the sun that daytime temperatures reach 427 Celsius. Mercury swings around the sun at an average distance of 36m miles, much closer than Earth, which orbits at a distance of about 93m miles. \"Messenger has been an amazing mission. The only previous Mercury mission, Mariner 10, flew post the planet three times in 1974 and 1975 giving us only an incomplete view. Messenger revealed the whole globe in detail,\" said David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University. The spacecraft is close to running out of fuel and is expected to crash into the surface of the planet at 8,750 miles per hour on Thursday at 8.30pm UK time. Nasa scientists said the probe would crash into the far side of Mercury, beyond the view of ground-based telescopes. The space agency will only confirm that the impact has taken place when Messenger fails to reappear hours later. John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the science mission directorate at Nasa's HQ in Washington said: \"While spacecraft operations will end, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission. It's the beginning of a longer journey to analyse the data that reveals all the scientific mysteries of Mercury.\" Data beamed back from the spacecraft suggest that large quantities of frozen water - enough to cover Washington DC in a two mile thick layer of ice - lie in Mercury's permanently shadowed polar craters. The surface of the ice is tainted with dark patches that are thought to be organic compounds. \"It is now apparent that Mercury is a misfit planet that seems not to belong where we now find it. It is dense even for a rocky planet, showing that its iron-rich core occupies more than 80% of Mercury's radius,\" said Rothery. \"The outer part of the core must still be molten, because this is where Mercury's magnetic field is generated - a characteristic shared with the Earth, but not with Venus, Mars or the Moon.\" Images from Messenger have revealed signs of recent volcanic eruptions blasting upwards through Mercury's ancient lava fields. Others point to mysterious \"hollows\", which are steep, flat-bottomed depressions in the planet where the top 10 metres or so of the surface are missing. \"Airless Mercury has no wind to blow it away, and there are no signs of collapse into underground cavities, so we are forced to conclude that something in the ground has been turned to vapour and lost to space,\" Rothery said.

The first spacecraft to circle Mercury, Messenger is expected to slip out of orbit and slam into Mercury on Thursday following a successful four-year tour of the rocky planet. The spacecraft will be travelling 14,081 kilometres per hour when it hits, fast enough to carve out a crater 16 metres wide. The spacecraft itself stretches 3 metres solar wingtip to wingtip. Messenger has run out of fuel, but ground controllers managed in recent weeks to eke out some extra life, raising Messenger's orbit by dipping into helium gas reserves not originally intended for use as fuel. But now that's all gone and Messenger is at the mercy of gravity. \"I guess the end is coming,\" the Messenger team said via Twitter earlier this week. \"After 10 years, spacecraft will end life as just another crater on Mercury's surface.\" A look at Mercury's soon-to-be-obliterated travel companion: Roundabout flight. Messenger rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 2004. It flew twice past Venus and three times past Mercury, before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011. Only one other spacecraft, NASA's Mariner 10, has ever visited Mercury, and that was back in the 1970s. Mariner 10 flew past, but did not orbit the innermost planet. The $427 million Messenger mission was developed and run for NASA by Johns Hopkins University. During its four years in orbit - comprising more than 4,000 laps - Messenger has revealed volcanic deposits that are helping to explain the planet's important eruptive and interior-melting past; polar caps of frozen water at or near the surface; and incredible global shrinkage thanks to a cooling interior. In addition, despite its proximity to the sun, Mercury is more abundant in volatile elements, like potassium and sulfur, than anticipated before Messenger's arrival, according to Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Planetary scientists will be looking at Messenger's huge stash of data \"for years, probably for decades, as we try to understand the origin and evolution of Mercury,\" Solomon said. Super sunshade. Messenger's creators needed to keep the spacecraft cool during its super-hot mission at Mercury. \"It's an enormously hostile environment,\" said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Designers came up with a novel sunshade of lightweight ceramic cloth. This sunscreen tolerated more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit on the front, while keeping everything behind it at room temperature, including the seven scientific instruments. Messenger also regularly performed \"an intricate dance\" to balance all the infrared heat that was reflected off Mercury back at the spacecraft. At the same time, engineers equipped Messenger with numerous heaters to keep the fuel from freezing and the electronics from faltering when the spacecraft ducked behind the planet, away from the sun. On Thursday, Messenger is expected to crash into the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. So there will be no cameras or observatories to witness the impact. Scientists expect to gather information from Messenger until 10 to 15 minutes before its fatal plunge. The expected crash site is about two-thirds of the way up the planet, near the north pole. Mercury is the smallest planet - a little bigger than our moon. A pair of European and Japanese spacecraft will aim for Mercury following a 2017 launch from South America's French Guiana. It will take seven years for the two satellites to reach Mercury and enter its orbit, in 2024. The mission is called BepiColombo after the late Italian scientist who came up with the calculations for repeated fly-bys of Mercury by Mariner 10.

Out of fuel after more than a decade in space, the robotic Messenger probe slammed into the planet at about 3.26pm ET, on the far side of Mercury and out of sight of telescopes. Hurtling toward the planet at more than 8,700mph, Messenger smashed into a plain smoothed over by past lava floods, according to Nasa's estimates. The probe crashed near a large impact basin named Shakespeare, a 250-mile-diameter zone of craters; Messenger's own crater is estimated to be 52ft at its widest. Nasa confirmed the impact at 3.26 pm ET after the spacecraft failed to reappear for its 4,105th orbit and make contact with its handlers on Earth. \"Going out with a bang as it impacts the surface of Mercury, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for Nasa Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Messenger is the first spacecraft to have orbited the planet closest to the sun, and has sent back to Earth hundreds of thousands of images of the blistered world, where temperatures can surpass 800F in the day and -290F at night. Nancy Chabot, an instrument scientist for Messenger with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, said \"the mission has revolutionized what we know about Mercury, we are rewriting the book on it. We literally have plans for a new Mercury book\". \"It's definitely said but we are trying to celebrate how much it's accomplished,\" Chabot said. \"It's a challenging thing to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, where, well, it gets hot. It's been a constant learning curve and the spacecraft has had to do some interesting maneuvers - it's not just the sun that's hot, the planet's surface is also radiating heat.\" Nasa launched Messenger toward Mercury in 2004, and the vessel borrowed gravity and sailed the pressure of sunlight \" for seven years, looping its way around planets until finally it reached orbit around the planet closest to the sun. \"The mission was designed to last one year, and here we are four years later, with 277,000 images. In the original proposal it said something like 2,500 images. We've really surpassed all expectations.\" There was no doubt however that Messenger's time had come to finally reach the surface of the planet it had circled for years: \"It's just a matter of when at this point,\" Chabot said. During its four years in orbit, Messenger delivered massive amounts of data to scientists, who have hailed the mission as a spectacular success. Among its discoveries was Mercury's polar regions contain large quantities of frozen water, under a mysterious \"dark layer\" of material that may be organic compounds. Chabot and others will now set to work mining the massive trove of data about the planet. They will map the polar deposits in detail and try to pin down when ice reached the planet, which in turn could help understand how water is distributed around the solar system. Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission and recent recipient of the national medal of science, said earlier in April that \"this dark material may in fact be organic, carbonaceous material delivered to Mercury the building blocks for organic chemistry and life.\" Messenger also found that the planet's volcanic, scarred surface comprises a far greater variety of elements and minerals than scientists had expected, and that the planet has a puzzling magnetic field that is offset 20% from the north pole, unlike the more centred, symmetrical field of Earth, where the offset is more like 11%. The discoveries of Mercury's strange makeup \"throws some of their models out\" about how the planet and solar system formed, Chabot said, forcing scientists to overhaul their hypotheses. The mission has also provided striking mapped images of the planet, showing signs of volcanoes erupting from underneath ancient lava fields and strange \"hollows\", which are steep holes in the surface where materials seemingly vaporized or boiled away into airless space. \"The hollows are still this mysterious feature,\" Chabot said, \"where it looks like we're actively losing material off of the planet, but we don't have detailed explanation why.\" Other discoveries include the curious facts that Mercury has shrunk by several kilometers since the planet formed, that swirling space weather event s occur at Mercury, and that Mercury may be \" a giant dust collector \", as Nasa planetary dynamist Joseph Hahn said last year, where periodic meteor showers strike and scatter material. Chabot said the Messenger teams plan to put as much as possible of the data into public archives, so that people can study the knowledge without necessarily needing Nasa's sophisticated technology - and to inspire new questions and answers. \"There will be things we haven't even thought of,\" Chabot said. \"If you make all the data available, new science questions come.\" Although Nasa scientists hope for an eventual lander mission to Mercury, the next mission to the planet will be run by the European Space Agency, whose BepiColombo mission should reach orbit in the 2020s.

NASA Probe Crashes Into Mercury", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft slammed into the surface of Mercury on Thursday, bringing a groundbreaking mission to a dramatic end. The MESSENGER probe crashed at 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday, gouging a new crater into Mercury's heavily pockmarked surface. This violent demise was inevitable for MESSENGER, which had been orbiting Mercury since March 2011 and had run out of fuel. The 10-foot-wide spacecraft was traveling about 8,750 mph at the time of impact, and it likely created a smoking hole in the ground about 52 feet wide in Mercury's northern terrain, NASA officials said. No observers or instruments witnessed today's crash, which occurred on the opposite side of Mercury from Earth. MESSENGER was the first spacecraft ever to orbit the solar system's innermost planet, and its observations over the last four years helped lift the veil on mysterious Mercury, mission team members said. \"Although Mercury is one of Earth's nearest planetary neighbors, astonishingly little was known when we set out,\" MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. \"MESSENGER has at last brought Mercury up to the level of understanding of its sister planets in the inner solar system,\" Solomon added. \"Of course, the more we learn, the more new questions we can ask, and there are ample reasons to return to Mercury with new missions.\" Confirmation of MESSENGER's death came at 3:40 p.m. EDT, when NASA's Deep Space Network station in Goldstone, California, was unable to detect a signal from the spacecraft, NASA officials said. \"On behalf of MESSENGER, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it,\" mission team members tweeted Thursday, via the @MESSENGER2011 account. The $450 million MESSENGER spacecraft, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The probe took a long and looping trip through the inner solar system, relying on flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow down enough to be captured by Mercury's gravity. MESSENGER finally arrived at Mercury on March 17, 2011, becoming the first probe ever to orbit the heat-blasted world, and just the second spacecraft ever to study it up close. performed three Mercury flybys in 1974 and 1975. MESSENGER's original mission at Mercury was supposed to last just one year, but NASA extended operations twice so the probe could continue its observations, which team members say have revolutionized our understanding of the planet. For example, MESSENGER mapped the planet in unprecedented detail, discovered that Mercury hosts a strangely offset magnetic field and confirmed that permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles harbor deposits of water ice. \"The water now stored in ice deposits in the permanently shadowed floors of impact craters at Mercury's poles most likely was delivered to the innermost planet by the impacts of comets and volatile-rich asteroids,\" Solomon said. \"By this interpretation, Mercury's polar regions serve as a witness plate to the delivery to the inner solar system of water and organic compounds from the outer solar system, a process that much earlier may have led to prebiotic chemical synthesis and the origin of life on Earth.\" During the course of its four years at Mercury, MESSENGER captured more than 250,000 images and used its seven scientific instruments to gather extensive data sets that will keep scientists busy for years to come, NASA officials said. The mission also leaves a technological legacy that could help future spacecraft work in harsh environments, officials added. For instance, MESSENGER's ceramic-cloth sunshade effectively protected the probe's instruments against powerful solar radiation. \"The front side of the sunshade routinely experience d temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of components in its shadow routinely operate d near room temperature ,\" MESSENGER project manager Helene Winters, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in the same statement. MESSENGER blazed a trail that another spacecraft will be following soon: The joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo consists of two different orbiters. One of them will study Mercury's surface and internal composition, and the other will focus on the planet's magnetosphere. During the course of its work, BepiColombo may identify and investigate MESSENGER's grave, in an attempt to better understand how space weathering affects Mercury's surface, Solomon said. The BepiColombo team \"will be looking for signs of MESSENGER's crater, and if they can make measurements of it, they will know precisely how long that region has been exposed to space,\" Solomon said during a news briefing earlier this month. \"That will be an important study that comes a decade from now.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29281-messenger-spacecraft-mercury-crash.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Messenger spacecraft falls from orbit into Mercury", "date": "2015-05-01", "content": "Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit hot, little Mercury, in 2011.

Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys - once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit - and survived \"both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation\" to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravity's relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system - also counting Mars and Venus - to be littered by mankind. Thursday's crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone - a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. \"Well I guess it is time to say goodbye,\" the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: \"On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries.

Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planet's eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. \"It has been an amazing journey of discovery,\" said the University of British Columbia's Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messenger's $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission.

Mercury is the solar system's smallest and innermost world. It was an enigmatic planet for years. Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft became the first probe to orbit Mercury, the only other visits it received were the flybys made by NASA's Mariner 10 probe four decades ago. MESSENGER ended its mission in April by crashing into Mercury's surface. Images that MESSENGER collected during its more than four years in orbit revealed a vast array of large fault scarps, or cliffs, on Mercury. These scarps resemble giant stair steps in the landscape - the largest are more than 600 miles long and more than 1.8 miles high. These fault scarps form when rocks are pushed together, break and thrust upward along faults - or fractures - in the planet's crust. The most widely accepted model of the origin of these faults and scarps is that they are essentially wrinkles that formed on Mercury's surface as the planet's heart cooled over time, leading Mercury to shrink in size. Prior research has suggested that Mercury may have contracted by about 2.5 to 8.7 miles in diameter. If this planetwide array of fault scarps formed as Mercury shrank in size, these features should be uniformly scattered over the planet's surface. However, scientists now find there is a bewildering pattern to these fault scarps. \"It is a real mystery,\" study lead author Thomas Watters, a planetary scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, told Space.com. The scientists analyzed the largest, most prominent fault scarps on Mercury's surface, which were more than about 30 miles long. Unexpectedly, they discovered many scarps are concentrated in two wide bands that run north to south and are located on almost opposite sides of the planet from each other. One potential explanation for these bands might lie in the flow of hot rock in Mercury's mantle layer. \"However, the scale of flow in Mercury's mantle is too small to explain these bands, because Mercury's mantle is not very thick - only 400 kilometers or so, we think,\" Watters said. \"There must be other factors at play here we don't really have a grasp on yet.\" In addition, about twice as many of Mercury's large fault scarps are located in its southern hemisphere than in its northern hemisphere. Of the 407 fault scarps that were more than about 30 miles long that the researchers analyzed, 264 are in the south, adding up to about 20,500 miles, while 143 are in the north, for a total of about 8,700 miles. \"None of the models we have at present can account for the lopsided number of scarps between the hemispheres,\" Watters said. \"We still have a lot to learn about Mercury.\" The researchers will continue to analyze images and data from MESSENGER to shed light on this mystery. In addition, Watters noted that the BepiColombo spacecraft, set to launch in 2017, \"may be able to give us a better picture of the global structure of the crust of Mercury.\" The BepiColumbo spacecraft is a joint mission of the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. While Earth's surface is made up of multiple tectonic plates, Mercury only has one. \"Mercury is ideal for investigating how one-plate planets evolve,\" Watters said. \"Understanding Mercury is essential to explaining how planets may evolve elsewhere in the galaxy.\" The scientists detailed their findings online May 29 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

But up close, it's a different story. Thanks to images from NASA's Messenger probe, the solar system's innermost planet looks iridescent blue with patches of sandy-colored plains with strands of grayish white. Early images released by NASA have even shown purples and aquamarine -- a truly psychedelic planet. The different colors represent differences in Mercury's composition. The blue hues, for example, are younger parts of the planet while the darker sections represent areas that have long been exposed to the planet's harsh environment. The yellowish, tan-colored regions are \"intermediate terrain.\" Mercury also hosts brighter and smoother terrain known as high-reflectance red plains. One example can be seen towards the upper right, where there is a prominent patch that is roughly circular. This is the Caloris basin, an impact crater thought to have been created by an asteroid collision during the solar system's early days. Launched in 2004, Messenger spent the past four years in orbit around the closest planet to the sun -- a first in the history of planetary exploration -- working behind a sunshade to endure temperatures higher than 600 degrees Fahrenheit while beaming back more than 10 terabytes of data from a suite of sophisticated instruments. The images were taken before Messenger ended its orbit around Mercury in late April, crashing into the planet's surface.

The probe fired the last of its maneuvering propellant two days before, ensuring contact with Earth for as long as possible. In the end, only 10 minutes of data was lost out of the 1,500 days worth of information collected by Messenger. Messenger was launched by NASA on August 3, 2004 and operated by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The spacecraft first flew by Mercury on January 14, 2008 and finally entered orbit March 18, 2011, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury since the 1975 flyby by Mariner 10 and the first orbital study of the planet ever. Before Messenger, there had never been a detailed study of Mercury. Due to the planet's proximity to the Sun, it has short and difficult viewing windows for ground based telescopes. It is also difficult for a spacecraft to travel to Mercury. The maneuver to match Mercury's close and fast orbit to the Sun takes more rocket fuel than it does to escape the Solar System. As a result, Mariner 10's three flybys were partial observations, mapping only 45 percent of Mercury's surface and providing only a small amount of high- resolution data that could be used to understand Mercury's geological history. Moreover, Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to Earth's, which was wholly unexpected. As only the third flyby was truly dedicated to studying the planet's magnetosphere, the data necessary to explore theories for the origin of the field would not be available until Messenger's arrival. Ground-based telescopes faced different predicaments. Instead of observing in visible light, astronomers bounced radio signals off Mercury, gathering information about the planet's surface temperature and rotation rate. The first of these studies was done by Soviet scientists led by Vladimir Kotelnikov in 1962. Subsequent studies were also able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the surface, including maps done by the Arecibo radar telescope which detected possible water ice at Mercury's poles. To answer the questions posed by these earlier observations, Messenger was launched with a suite of seven instruments. These were the Mercury Dual Imaging System, the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, the X-Ray Spectrometer, the Magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and the Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer. Combined, these experiments mapped the whole of Mercury in visible and infrared light, measured the topographical and chemical characteristics of the planet's surface, studied the changes in Mercury's magnetic field and observed shifts in the planet's atmosphere. By every measure, Messenger achieved its science goals. With a budget of just under $450 million, it sent back ten terabytes of data, including more than 275,000 high resolution images of the rocky world. Already, 181 articles have been produced with this data since Messenger entered orbit, involving an international team of more than 125 scientists and engineering labor from Canada, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy and the United States. One of the surprising findings is that Mercury has a high abundance of the elements potassium, sulfur and chlorine, along with an unexpectedly low content of thorium. The high sulfur content in particular indicates that Mercury's formation involved less oxygen than the other terrestrial planets. This rules out certain theories for Mercury's formation as well as for the formation of all the planets in the inner Solar System. Another constraint on theories of Mercury's formation is the presence of ice water at the poles. Previous ground-based radio observations detected highly reflective materials at the poles, but the geometry between Earth and Mercury is such that those observations couldn't get enough detail to determine the chemical composition of the deposits. Messenger's orbit allowed to get a clear view of what had previously been hidden and provided many lines of evidence - including direct observations and measuring the amount of neutrons emitted from Mercury's surface - to determine that there is in fact water ice present in the shadows of Mercury's polar craters. Work was also done studying Mercury's atmosphere. While thin, it does exist and was shown to vary seasonally. When Mercury is at it's farthest from the Sun, its sodium-rich atmosphere forms a thin shell near the surface of the planet. When it nears the Sun, however, the sunlight becomes intense enough to strip the atmosphere into a glowing tail that someone standing on Mercury's nightside would find reminiscent of the faint orange of a sky illuminated by a city's sodium streetlights. How the atmosphere regenerates itself is still unknown. One of the features noted about Mercury by Mariner 10 is that the planet appears to have contracted well after it was mostly formed. In a general sense, this can be seen from careful visible and radar imaging of the surface topography. With Messenger's ability to make highly accurate topographical maps, study Mercury's volcanic past and it's ability to trace the planet's geological history by looking at the layers in various craters, astronomers determined that Mercury's radius has shrunk by at least 7 kilometers since its formation. This is most likely as a result of a crust forming around Mercury's molten core that buckled as the core collapsed. Neither Earth, the Moon, Venus or Mars exhibit any evidence of a similar process. A number of things were discovered by Messenger about Mercury's magnetic field. First, the north and south ends of the field do not align as one would expect, but are offset by about 45 degrees. This, combined with the more intense solar magnetic fields, leads to complex interactions between the planet's magnetic field and the Sun's that are far more dynamic than those between the Sun and Earth. The magnetic measurements in particular provide a probe deep into Mercury's interior: from Messenger's data, the size, mass, composition and rotation rate of Mercury's iron core have been determined. The Messenger mission also provided a number of technical insights for future space missions, both to Mercury and elsewhere. As noted before, simply getting to Mercury turns out to be not so simple. As the mission was a low budget Discovery class mission, it did not have the payload size for the fuel needed to go directly that deep into the Sun's gravitational influence. Instead, it took a convoluted route first developed by Taiwanese physicist Chen-wan Yen in 1985 that involves six planetary flybys and five thruster corrections to match Mercury's orbit. Teams working on the craft also had to develop a ceramic cloth sunshade to protect both the scientific and communications instruments from the temperature changes between the harsh radiation of the Sun and the lack thereof when the spacecraft went into the shadow of Mercury. Being so close to the Sun also provided opportunities for the mission. Messenger was primarily powered by high-end solar panels. The soft pressure from the Sun's radiation was also used during the planetary flybys to make corrections that would have otherwise needed fuel. Messenger's most significant technical accomplishment is what has been termed hovering. It was known from the beginning that the Sun's gravitational influence would alter a spacecraft's orbit enough to need constant corrections. In the early part of Messenger's life, this gravitational attraction pulled the spacecraft towards the Sun. In the later part of the spacecraft's life, however, it drifted towards Mercury's surface. By using this effect and a clever use of propellant, Messenger was able to carry out measurements at distances from 35 kilometers to as little as five kilometers above Mercury's surface, making possible unprecedented measurement precision in the last several weeks of the spacecraft's life. Though the loss of Messenger was known about, planned for, and even used for science, it is still tragic. The past four years have uncovered a world which is key to understanding the Solar System and about which many questions, some motivated by Messenger's study alone, remain. The opportunities for future study will be limited: the European/Japanese probe BepiColombo will launch after years of delay - largely caused by funding starvation - in 2017, with arrival in 2024. This mission, whose originally planned lander component was cancelled by funding cutbacks in 2003, has been under development for 18 years. No further visits to Mercury are at present being planned.

The Messenger probe launched from Earth in 2004 and has been mapping Mercury in exquisite detail since it arrived in orbit in 2011. The spacecraft has beamed back a series of breathtaking images of the tiny, scorched world, which orbits so close to the sun that daytime temperatures reach 427 Celsius. Mercury swings around the sun at an average distance of 36m miles, much closer than Earth, which orbits at a distance of about 93m miles. \"Messenger has been an amazing mission. The only previous Mercury mission, Mariner 10, flew post the planet three times in 1974 and 1975 giving us only an incomplete view. Messenger revealed the whole globe in detail,\" said David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University. The spacecraft is close to running out of fuel and is expected to crash into the surface of the planet at 8,750 miles per hour on Thursday at 8.30pm UK time. Nasa scientists said the probe would crash into the far side of Mercury, beyond the view of ground-based telescopes. The space agency will only confirm that the impact has taken place when Messenger fails to reappear hours later. John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the science mission directorate at Nasa's HQ in Washington said: \"While spacecraft operations will end, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission. It's the beginning of a longer journey to analyse the data that reveals all the scientific mysteries of Mercury.\" Data beamed back from the spacecraft suggest that large quantities of frozen water - enough to cover Washington DC in a two mile thick layer of ice - lie in Mercury's permanently shadowed polar craters. The surface of the ice is tainted with dark patches that are thought to be organic compounds. \"It is now apparent that Mercury is a misfit planet that seems not to belong where we now find it. It is dense even for a rocky planet, showing that its iron-rich core occupies more than 80% of Mercury's radius,\" said Rothery. \"The outer part of the core must still be molten, because this is where Mercury's magnetic field is generated - a characteristic shared with the Earth, but not with Venus, Mars or the Moon.\" Images from Messenger have revealed signs of recent volcanic eruptions blasting upwards through Mercury's ancient lava fields. Others point to mysterious \"hollows\", which are steep, flat-bottomed depressions in the planet where the top 10 metres or so of the surface are missing. \"Airless Mercury has no wind to blow it away, and there are no signs of collapse into underground cavities, so we are forced to conclude that something in the ground has been turned to vapour and lost to space,\" Rothery said.

The first spacecraft to circle Mercury, Messenger is expected to slip out of orbit and slam into Mercury on Thursday following a successful four-year tour of the rocky planet. The spacecraft will be travelling 14,081 kilometres per hour when it hits, fast enough to carve out a crater 16 metres wide. The spacecraft itself stretches 3 metres solar wingtip to wingtip. Messenger has run out of fuel, but ground controllers managed in recent weeks to eke out some extra life, raising Messenger's orbit by dipping into helium gas reserves not originally intended for use as fuel. But now that's all gone and Messenger is at the mercy of gravity. \"I guess the end is coming,\" the Messenger team said via Twitter earlier this week. \"After 10 years, spacecraft will end life as just another crater on Mercury's surface.\" A look at Mercury's soon-to-be-obliterated travel companion: Roundabout flight. Messenger rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in August 2004. It flew twice past Venus and three times past Mercury, before entering orbit around Mercury in March 2011. Only one other spacecraft, NASA's Mariner 10, has ever visited Mercury, and that was back in the 1970s. Mariner 10 flew past, but did not orbit the innermost planet. The $427 million Messenger mission was developed and run for NASA by Johns Hopkins University. During its four years in orbit - comprising more than 4,000 laps - Messenger has revealed volcanic deposits that are helping to explain the planet's important eruptive and interior-melting past; polar caps of frozen water at or near the surface; and incredible global shrinkage thanks to a cooling interior. In addition, despite its proximity to the sun, Mercury is more abundant in volatile elements, like potassium and sulfur, than anticipated before Messenger's arrival, according to Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Planetary scientists will be looking at Messenger's huge stash of data \"for years, probably for decades, as we try to understand the origin and evolution of Mercury,\" Solomon said. Super sunshade. Messenger's creators needed to keep the spacecraft cool during its super-hot mission at Mercury. \"It's an enormously hostile environment,\" said Jim Green, director of planetary science for NASA. Designers came up with a novel sunshade of lightweight ceramic cloth. This sunscreen tolerated more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit on the front, while keeping everything behind it at room temperature, including the seven scientific instruments. Messenger also regularly performed \"an intricate dance\" to balance all the infrared heat that was reflected off Mercury back at the spacecraft. At the same time, engineers equipped Messenger with numerous heaters to keep the fuel from freezing and the electronics from faltering when the spacecraft ducked behind the planet, away from the sun. On Thursday, Messenger is expected to crash into the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. So there will be no cameras or observatories to witness the impact. Scientists expect to gather information from Messenger until 10 to 15 minutes before its fatal plunge. The expected crash site is about two-thirds of the way up the planet, near the north pole. Mercury is the smallest planet - a little bigger than our moon. A pair of European and Japanese spacecraft will aim for Mercury following a 2017 launch from South America's French Guiana. It will take seven years for the two satellites to reach Mercury and enter its orbit, in 2024. The mission is called BepiColombo after the late Italian scientist who came up with the calculations for repeated fly-bys of Mercury by Mariner 10.

Out of fuel after more than a decade in space, the robotic Messenger probe slammed into the planet at about 3.26pm ET, on the far side of Mercury and out of sight of telescopes. Hurtling toward the planet at more than 8,700mph, Messenger smashed into a plain smoothed over by past lava floods, according to Nasa's estimates. The probe crashed near a large impact basin named Shakespeare, a 250-mile-diameter zone of craters; Messenger's own crater is estimated to be 52ft at its widest. Nasa confirmed the impact at 3.26 pm ET after the spacecraft failed to reappear for its 4,105th orbit and make contact with its handlers on Earth. \"Going out with a bang as it impacts the surface of Mercury, we are celebrating Messenger as more than a successful mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for Nasa Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Messenger is the first spacecraft to have orbited the planet closest to the sun, and has sent back to Earth hundreds of thousands of images of the blistered world, where temperatures can surpass 800F in the day and -290F at night. Nancy Chabot, an instrument scientist for Messenger with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, said \"the mission has revolutionized what we know about Mercury, we are rewriting the book on it. We literally have plans for a new Mercury book\". \"It's definitely said but we are trying to celebrate how much it's accomplished,\" Chabot said. \"It's a challenging thing to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mercury, where, well, it gets hot. It's been a constant learning curve and the spacecraft has had to do some interesting maneuvers - it's not just the sun that's hot, the planet's surface is also radiating heat.\" Nasa launched Messenger toward Mercury in 2004, and the vessel borrowed gravity and sailed the pressure of sunlight \" for seven years, looping its way around planets until finally it reached orbit around the planet closest to the sun. \"The mission was designed to last one year, and here we are four years later, with 277,000 images. In the original proposal it said something like 2,500 images. We've really surpassed all expectations.\" There was no doubt however that Messenger's time had come to finally reach the surface of the planet it had circled for years: \"It's just a matter of when at this point,\" Chabot said. During its four years in orbit, Messenger delivered massive amounts of data to scientists, who have hailed the mission as a spectacular success. Among its discoveries was Mercury's polar regions contain large quantities of frozen water, under a mysterious \"dark layer\" of material that may be organic compounds. Chabot and others will now set to work mining the massive trove of data about the planet. They will map the polar deposits in detail and try to pin down when ice reached the planet, which in turn could help understand how water is distributed around the solar system. Sean Solomon, the principal investigator for the mission and recent recipient of the national medal of science, said earlier in April that \"this dark material may in fact be organic, carbonaceous material delivered to Mercury the building blocks for organic chemistry and life.\" Messenger also found that the planet's volcanic, scarred surface comprises a far greater variety of elements and minerals than scientists had expected, and that the planet has a puzzling magnetic field that is offset 20% from the north pole, unlike the more centred, symmetrical field of Earth, where the offset is more like 11%. The discoveries of Mercury's strange makeup \"throws some of their models out\" about how the planet and solar system formed, Chabot said, forcing scientists to overhaul their hypotheses. The mission has also provided striking mapped images of the planet, showing signs of volcanoes erupting from underneath ancient lava fields and strange \"hollows\", which are steep holes in the surface where materials seemingly vaporized or boiled away into airless space. \"The hollows are still this mysterious feature,\" Chabot said, \"where it looks like we're actively losing material off of the planet, but we don't have detailed explanation why.\" Other discoveries include the curious facts that Mercury has shrunk by several kilometers since the planet formed, that swirling space weather event s occur at Mercury, and that Mercury may be \" a giant dust collector \", as Nasa planetary dynamist Joseph Hahn said last year, where periodic meteor showers strike and scatter material. Chabot said the Messenger teams plan to put as much as possible of the data into public archives, so that people can study the knowledge without necessarily needing Nasa's sophisticated technology - and to inspire new questions and answers. \"There will be things we haven't even thought of,\" Chabot said. \"If you make all the data available, new science questions come.\" Although Nasa scientists hope for an eventual lander mission to Mercury, the next mission to the planet will be run by the European Space Agency, whose BepiColombo mission should reach orbit in the 2020s.

NASA Probe Crashes Into Mercury", "date": "2015-04-30", "content": "A NASA spacecraft slammed into the surface of Mercury on Thursday, bringing a groundbreaking mission to a dramatic end. The MESSENGER probe crashed at 3:26 p.m. EDT Thursday, gouging a new crater into Mercury's heavily pockmarked surface. This violent demise was inevitable for MESSENGER, which had been orbiting Mercury since March 2011 and had run out of fuel. The 10-foot-wide spacecraft was traveling about 8,750 mph at the time of impact, and it likely created a smoking hole in the ground about 52 feet wide in Mercury's northern terrain, NASA officials said. No observers or instruments witnessed today's crash, which occurred on the opposite side of Mercury from Earth. MESSENGER was the first spacecraft ever to orbit the solar system's innermost planet, and its observations over the last four years helped lift the veil on mysterious Mercury, mission team members said. \"Although Mercury is one of Earth's nearest planetary neighbors, astonishingly little was known when we set out,\" MESSENGER principal investigator Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a statement. \"MESSENGER has at last brought Mercury up to the level of understanding of its sister planets in the inner solar system,\" Solomon added. \"Of course, the more we learn, the more new questions we can ask, and there are ample reasons to return to Mercury with new missions.\" Confirmation of MESSENGER's death came at 3:40 p.m. EDT, when NASA's Deep Space Network station in Goldstone, California, was unable to detect a signal from the spacecraft, NASA officials said. \"On behalf of MESSENGER, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it,\" mission team members tweeted Thursday, via the @MESSENGER2011 account. The $450 million MESSENGER spacecraft, whose name is short for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging, launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The probe took a long and looping trip through the inner solar system, relying on flybys of Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow down enough to be captured by Mercury's gravity. MESSENGER finally arrived at Mercury on March 17, 2011, becoming the first probe ever to orbit the heat-blasted world, and just the second spacecraft ever to study it up close. performed three Mercury flybys in 1974 and 1975. MESSENGER's original mission at Mercury was supposed to last just one year, but NASA extended operations twice so the probe could continue its observations, which team members say have revolutionized our understanding of the planet. For example, MESSENGER mapped the planet in unprecedented detail, discovered that Mercury hosts a strangely offset magnetic field and confirmed that permanently shadowed craters near Mercury's poles harbor deposits of water ice. \"The water now stored in ice deposits in the permanently shadowed floors of impact craters at Mercury's poles most likely was delivered to the innermost planet by the impacts of comets and volatile-rich asteroids,\" Solomon said. \"By this interpretation, Mercury's polar regions serve as a witness plate to the delivery to the inner solar system of water and organic compounds from the outer solar system, a process that much earlier may have led to prebiotic chemical synthesis and the origin of life on Earth.\" During the course of its four years at Mercury, MESSENGER captured more than 250,000 images and used its seven scientific instruments to gather extensive data sets that will keep scientists busy for years to come, NASA officials said. The mission also leaves a technological legacy that could help future spacecraft work in harsh environments, officials added. For instance, MESSENGER's ceramic-cloth sunshade effectively protected the probe's instruments against powerful solar radiation. \"The front side of the sunshade routinely experience d temperatures in excess of 300 degrees Celsius, whereas the majority of components in its shadow routinely operate d near room temperature ,\" MESSENGER project manager Helene Winters, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said in the same statement. MESSENGER blazed a trail that another spacecraft will be following soon: The joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission is scheduled to launch in 2017 and arrive in orbit around Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo consists of two different orbiters. One of them will study Mercury's surface and internal composition, and the other will focus on the planet's magnetosphere. During the course of its work, BepiColombo may identify and investigate MESSENGER's grave, in an attempt to better understand how space weathering affects Mercury's surface, Solomon said. The BepiColombo team \"will be looking for signs of MESSENGER's crater, and if they can make measurements of it, they will know precisely how long that region has been exposed to space,\" Solomon said during a news briefing earlier this month. \"That will be an important study that comes a decade from now.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29281-messenger-spacecraft-mercury-crash.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Messenger spacecraft falls from orbit into Mercury", "date": "2015-05-01", "content": "Messenger became the first spacecraft to orbit hot, little Mercury, in 2011.

Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys - once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit - and survived \"both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation\" to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravity's relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system - also counting Mars and Venus - to be littered by mankind. Thursday's crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone - a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. \"Well I guess it is time to say goodbye,\" the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: \"On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it.\" Astronomers who used Messenger to detect Mercury's frozen water-covered poles and significantly off-center magnetic field called it an end of an era. Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planet's eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. \"It has been an amazing journey of discovery,\" said the University of British Columbia's Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messenger's $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission.

Mercury is the solar system's smallest and innermost world. It was an enigmatic planet for years. Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft became the first probe to orbit Mercury, the only other visits it received were the flybys made by NASA's Mariner 10 probe four decades ago. MESSENGER ended its mission in April by crashing into Mercury's surface. Images that MESSENGER collected during its more than four years in orbit revealed a vast array of large fault scarps, or cliffs, on Mercury. These scarps resemble giant stair steps in the landscape - the largest are more than 600 miles long and more than 1.8 miles high. These fault scarps form when rocks are pushed together, break and thrust upward along faults - or fractures - in the planet's crust. The most widely accepted model of the origin of these faults and scarps is that they are essentially wrinkles that formed on Mercury's surface as the planet's heart cooled over time, leading Mercury to shrink in size. Prior research has suggested that Mercury may have contracted by about 2.5 to 8.7 miles in diameter. If this planetwide array of fault scarps formed as Mercury shrank in size, these features should be uniformly scattered over the planet's surface. However, scientists now find there is a bewildering pattern to these fault scarps. \"It is a real mystery,\" study lead author Thomas Watters, a planetary scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, told Space.com. The scientists analyzed the largest, most prominent fault scarps on Mercury's surface, which were more than about 30 miles long. Unexpectedly, they discovered many scarps are concentrated in two wide bands that run north to south and are located on almost opposite sides of the planet from each other. One potential explanation for these bands might lie in the flow of hot rock in Mercury's mantle layer. \"However, the scale of flow in Mercury's mantle is too small to explain these bands, because Mercury's mantle is not very thick - only 400 kilometers or so, we think,\" Watters said. \"There must be other factors at play here we don't really have a grasp on yet.\" In addition, about twice as many of Mercury's large fault scarps are located in its southern hemisphere than in its northern hemisphere. Of the 407 fault scarps that were more than about 30 miles long that the researchers analyzed, 264 are in the south, adding up to about 20,500 miles, while 143 are in the north, for a total of about 8,700 miles. \"None of the models we have at present can account for the lopsided number of scarps between the hemispheres,\" Watters said. \"We still have a lot to learn about Mercury.\" The researchers will continue to analyze images and data from MESSENGER to shed light on this mystery. In addition, Watters noted that the BepiColombo spacecraft, set to launch in 2017, \"may be able to give us a better picture of the global structure of the crust of Mercury.\" The BepiColumbo spacecraft is a joint mission of the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. While Earth's surface is made up of multiple tectonic plates, Mercury only has one. \"Mercury is ideal for investigating how one-plate planets evolve,\" Watters said. \"Understanding Mercury is essential to explaining how planets may evolve elsewhere in the galaxy.\" The scientists detailed their findings online May 29 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

But up close, it's a different story. Thanks to images from NASA's Messenger probe, the solar system's innermost planet looks iridescent blue with patches of sandy-colored plains with strands of grayish white. Early images released by NASA have even shown purples and aquamarine -- a truly psychedelic planet. The different colors represent differences in Mercury's composition. The blue hues, for example, are younger parts of the planet while the darker sections represent areas that have long been exposed to the planet's harsh environment. The yellowish, tan-colored regions are \"intermediate terrain.\" Mercury also hosts brighter and smoother terrain known as high-reflectance red plains. One example can be seen towards the upper right, where there is a prominent patch that is roughly circular. This is the Caloris basin, an impact crater thought to have been created by an asteroid collision during the solar system's early days. Launched in 2004, Messenger spent the past four years in orbit around the closest planet to the sun -- a first in the history of planetary exploration -- working behind a sunshade to endure temperatures higher than 600 degrees Fahrenheit while beaming back more than 10 terabytes of data from a suite of sophisticated instruments. The images were taken before Messenger ended its orbit around Mercury in late April, crashing into the planet's surface. The probe managed to extend its mission by several weeks, after the spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly. The investigation of Mercury will be continued by ESA's BepiColombo, due for launch in 2017.

The probe fired the last of its maneuvering propellant two days before, ensuring contact with Earth for as long as possible. In the end, only 10 minutes of data was lost out of the 1,500 days worth of information collected by Messenger. Messenger was launched by NASA on August 3, 2004 and operated by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The spacecraft first flew by Mercury on January 14, 2008 and finally entered orbit March 18, 2011, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury since the 1975 flyby by Mariner 10 and the first orbital study of the planet ever. Before Messenger, there had never been a detailed study of Mercury. Due to the planet's proximity to the Sun, it has short and difficult viewing windows for ground based telescopes. It is also difficult for a spacecraft to travel to Mercury. The maneuver to match Mercury's close and fast orbit to the Sun takes more rocket fuel than it does to escape the Solar System. As a result, Mariner 10's three flybys were partial observations, mapping only 45 percent of Mercury's surface and providing only a small amount of high- resolution data that could be used to understand Mercury's geological history. Moreover, Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to Earth's, which was wholly unexpected. As only the third flyby was truly dedicated to studying the planet's magnetosphere, the data necessary to explore theories for the origin of the field would not be available until Messenger's arrival. Ground-based telescopes faced different predicaments. Instead of observing in visible light, astronomers bounced radio signals off Mercury, gathering information about the planet's surface temperature and rotation rate. The first of these studies was done by Soviet scientists led by Vladimir Kotelnikov in 1962. Subsequent studies were also able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the surface, including maps done by the Arecibo radar telescope which detected possible water ice at Mercury's poles. To answer the questions posed by these earlier observations, Messenger was launched with a suite of seven instruments. These were the Mercury Dual Imaging System, the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, the X-Ray Spectrometer, the Magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and the Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer. Combined, these experiments mapped the whole of Mercury in visible and infrared light, measured the topographical and chemical characteristics of the planet's surface, studied the changes in Mercury's magnetic field and observed shifts in the planet's atmosphere. By every measure, Messenger achieved its science goals. With a budget of just under $450 million, it sent back ten terabytes of data, including more than 275,000 high resolution images of the rocky world. Already, 181 articles have been produced with this data since Messenger entered orbit, involving an international team of more than 125 scientists and engineering labor from Canada, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy and the United States. One of the surprising findings is that Mercury has a high abundance of the elements potassium, sulfur and chlorine, along with an unexpectedly low content of thorium. The high sulfur content in particular indicates that Mercury's formation involved less oxygen than the other terrestrial planets. This rules out certain theories for Mercury's formation as well as for the formation of all the planets in the inner Solar System. Another constraint on theories of Mercury's formation is the presence of ice water at the poles. Previous ground-based radio observations detected highly reflective materials at the poles, but the geometry between Earth and Mercury is such that those observations couldn't get enough detail to determine the chemical composition of the deposits. Messenger's orbit allowed to get a clear view of what had previously been hidden and provided many lines of evidence - including direct observations and measuring the amount of neutrons emitted from Mercury's surface - to determine that there is in fact water ice present in the shadows of Mercury's polar craters. Work was also done studying Mercury's atmosphere. While thin, it does exist and was shown to vary seasonally. When Mercury is at it's farthest from the Sun, its sodium-rich atmosphere forms a thin shell near the surface of the planet. When it nears the Sun, however, the sunlight becomes intense enough to strip the atmosphere into a glowing tail that someone standing on Mercury's nightside would find reminiscent of the faint orange of a sky illuminated by a city's sodium streetlights. How the atmosphere regenerates itself is still unknown. One of the features noted about Mercury by Mariner 10 is that the planet appears to have contracted well after it was mostly formed. In a general sense, this can be seen from careful visible and radar imaging of the surface topography. With Messenger's ability to make highly accurate topographical maps, study Mercury's volcanic past and it's ability to trace the planet's geological history by looking at the layers in various craters, astronomers determined that Mercury's radius has shrunk by at least 7 kilometers since its formation. This is most likely as a result of a crust forming around Mercury's molten core that buckled as the core collapsed. Neither Earth, the Moon, Venus or Mars exhibit any evidence of a similar process. A number of things were discovered by Messenger about Mercury's magnetic field. First, the north and south ends of the field do not align as one would expect, but are offset by about 45 degrees. This, combined with the more intense solar magnetic fields, leads to complex interactions between the planet's magnetic field and the Sun's that are far more dynamic than those between the Sun and Earth. The magnetic measurements in particular provide a probe deep into Mercury's interior: from Messenger's data, the size, mass, composition and rotation rate of Mercury's iron core have been determined. The Messenger mission also provided a number of technical insights for future space missions, both to Mercury and elsewhere. As noted before, simply getting to Mercury turns out to be not so simple. As the mission was a low budget Discovery class mission, it did not have the payload size for the fuel needed to go directly that deep into the Sun's gravitational influence. Instead, it took a convoluted route first developed by Taiwanese physicist Chen-wan Yen in 1985 that involves six planetary flybys and five thruster corrections to match Mercury's orbit. Teams working on the craft also had to develop a ceramic cloth sunshade to protect both the scientific and communications instruments from the temperature changes between the harsh radiation of the Sun and the lack thereof when the spacecraft went into the shadow of Mercury. Being so close to the Sun also provided opportunities for the mission. Messenger was primarily powered by high-end solar panels. The soft pressure from the Sun's radiation was also used during the planetary flybys to make corrections that would have otherwise needed fuel. Messenger's most significant technical accomplishment is what has been termed hovering. It was known from the beginning that the Sun's gravitational influence would alter a spacecraft's orbit enough to need constant corrections. In the early part of Messenger's life, this gravitational attraction pulled the spacecraft towards the Sun. In the later part of the spacecraft's life, however, it drifted towards Mercury's surface. By using this effect and a clever use of propellant, Messenger was able to carry out measurements at distances from 35 kilometers to as little as five kilometers above Mercury's surface, making possible unprecedented measurement precision in the last several weeks of the spacecraft's life. Though the loss of Messenger was known about, planned for, and even used for science, it is still tragic. The past four years have uncovered a world which is key to understanding the Solar System and about which many questions, some motivated by Messenger's study alone, remain. The opportunities for future study will be limited: the European/Japanese probe BepiColombo will launch after years of delay - largely caused by funding starvation - in 2017, with arrival in 2024. This mission, whose originally planned lander component was cancelled by funding cutbacks in 2003, has been under development for 18 years. No further visits to Mercury are at present being planned.

It circled the solar system's innermost planet 4,105 times and collected more than 277,000 images. \"Today we bid a fond farewell to one of the most resilient and accomplished spacecraft ever to have explored our neighboring planets,\" said lead scientist Sean Solomon, director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Solomon noted in a statement that Messenger set a record for planetary flybys - once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury before entering Mercury's orbit - and survived \"both punishing heat and extreme doses of radiation\" to surpass expectations. Flight controllers managed to keep the spacecraft going a few extra weeks by using helium gas not originally intended as fuel. But the gas tank finally emptied and gravity's relentless tug did Messenger in. Mercury is the last of the rocky inner planets in our solar system - also counting Mars and Venus - to be littered by mankind. Thursday's crash occurred on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth and telescopes. Several minutes passed before NASA received confirmation. Controllers received no signal from Messenger when it was supposed to be back in the coverage zone - a sign that the spacecraft, measuring 10 feet solar wingtip to wingtip, had, indeed, succumbed to gravity. \"Well I guess it is time to say goodbye,\" the Messenger Twitter feed stated as the end drew near. Then after the impact: \"On behalf of Messenger, thank you all for your support. We will continue to update you on our great discoveries. We will miss it.\" Astronomers who used Messenger to detect Mercury's frozen water-covered poles and significantly off-center magnetic field called it an end of an era. Other discoveries: volcanic deposits that are evidence of the planet's eruptive past, and noticeable global shrinkage. \"It has been an amazing journey of discovery,\" said the University of British Columbia's Catherine Johnson, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. Data analyses will continue for at least another year. Messenger's $427 million mission began with a launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2004. Johns Hopkins University handled everything for NASA. Until Messenger, the only spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10 back in the 1970s. That was only a fly-by mission. The Europeans and Japanese are teaming up for Mercury's next guests, a pair of satellites known as BepiColombo. They're scheduled for launch in 2017 and arrival in Mercury's orbit in 2024.

Mercury is the solar system's smallest and innermost world. It was an enigmatic planet for years. Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft became the first probe to orbit Mercury, the only other visits it received were the flybys made by NASA's Mariner 10 probe four decades ago. MESSENGER ended its mission in April by crashing into Mercury's surface. Images that MESSENGER collected during its more than four years in orbit revealed a vast array of large fault scarps, or cliffs, on Mercury. These scarps resemble giant stair steps in the landscape - the largest are more than 600 miles long and more than 1.8 miles high. These fault scarps form when rocks are pushed together, break and thrust upward along faults - or fractures - in the planet's crust. The most widely accepted model of the origin of these faults and scarps is that they are essentially wrinkles that formed on Mercury's surface as the planet's heart cooled over time, leading Mercury to shrink in size. Prior research has suggested that Mercury may have contracted by about 2.5 to 8.7 miles in diameter. If this planetwide array of fault scarps formed as Mercury shrank in size, these features should be uniformly scattered over the planet's surface. However, scientists now find there is a bewildering pattern to these fault scarps. \"It is a real mystery,\" study lead author Thomas Watters, a planetary scientist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, told Space.com. The scientists analyzed the largest, most prominent fault scarps on Mercury's surface, which were more than about 30 miles long. Unexpectedly, they discovered many scarps are concentrated in two wide bands that run north to south and are located on almost opposite sides of the planet from each other. One potential explanation for these bands might lie in the flow of hot rock in Mercury's mantle layer. \"However, the scale of flow in Mercury's mantle is too small to explain these bands, because Mercury's mantle is not very thick - only 400 kilometers or so, we think,\" Watters said. \"There must be other factors at play here we don't really have a grasp on yet.\" In addition, about twice as many of Mercury's large fault scarps are located in its southern hemisphere than in its northern hemisphere. Of the 407 fault scarps that were more than about 30 miles long that the researchers analyzed, 264 are in the south, adding up to about 20,500 miles, while 143 are in the north, for a total of about 8,700 miles. \"None of the models we have at present can account for the lopsided number of scarps between the hemispheres,\" Watters said. \"We still have a lot to learn about Mercury.\" The researchers will continue to analyze images and data from MESSENGER to shed light on this mystery. In addition, Watters noted that the BepiColombo spacecraft, set to launch in 2017, \"may be able to give us a better picture of the global structure of the crust of Mercury.\" The BepiColumbo spacecraft is a joint mission of the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. While Earth's surface is made up of multiple tectonic plates, Mercury only has one. \"Mercury is ideal for investigating how one-plate planets evolve,\" Watters said. \"Understanding Mercury is essential to explaining how planets may evolve elsewhere in the galaxy.\" The scientists detailed their findings online May 29 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

But up close, it's a different story. Thanks to images from NASA's Messenger probe, the solar system's innermost planet looks iridescent blue with patches of sandy-colored plains with strands of grayish white. Early images released by NASA have even shown purples and aquamarine -- a truly psychedelic planet. The different colors represent differences in Mercury's composition. The blue hues, for example, are younger parts of the planet while the darker sections represent areas that have long been exposed to the planet's harsh environment. The yellowish, tan-colored regions are \"intermediate terrain.\" Mercury also hosts brighter and smoother terrain known as high-reflectance red plains. One example can be seen towards the upper right, where there is a prominent patch that is roughly circular. This is the Caloris basin, an impact crater thought to have been created by an asteroid collision during the solar system's early days. Launched in 2004, Messenger spent the past four years in orbit around the closest planet to the sun -- a first in the history of planetary exploration -- working behind a sunshade to endure temperatures higher than 600 degrees Fahrenheit while beaming back more than 10 terabytes of data from a suite of sophisticated instruments. The images were taken before Messenger ended its orbit around Mercury in late April, crashing into the planet's surface. The probe managed to extend its mission by several weeks, after the spacecraft executed the first of a series of engine burns designed to lift the probe's orbit slightly. The investigation of Mercury will be continued by ESA's BepiColombo, due for launch in 2017.

The probe fired the last of its maneuvering propellant two days before, ensuring contact with Earth for as long as possible. In the end, only 10 minutes of data was lost out of the 1,500 days worth of information collected by Messenger. Messenger was launched by NASA on August 3, 2004 and operated by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The spacecraft first flew by Mercury on January 14, 2008 and finally entered orbit March 18, 2011, becoming the first probe to visit Mercury since the 1975 flyby by Mariner 10 and the first orbital study of the planet ever. Before Messenger, there had never been a detailed study of Mercury. Due to the planet's proximity to the Sun, it has short and difficult viewing windows for ground based telescopes. It is also difficult for a spacecraft to travel to Mercury. The maneuver to match Mercury's close and fast orbit to the Sun takes more rocket fuel than it does to escape the Solar System. As a result, Mariner 10's three flybys were partial observations, mapping only 45 percent of Mercury's surface and providing only a small amount of high- resolution data that could be used to understand Mercury's geological history. Moreover, Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to Earth's, which was wholly unexpected. As only the third flyby was truly dedicated to studying the planet's magnetosphere, the data necessary to explore theories for the origin of the field would not be available until Messenger's arrival. Ground-based telescopes faced different predicaments. Instead of observing in visible light, astronomers bounced radio signals off Mercury, gathering information about the planet's surface temperature and rotation rate. The first of these studies was done by Soviet scientists led by Vladimir Kotelnikov in 1962. Subsequent studies were also able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the surface, including maps done by the Arecibo radar telescope which detected possible water ice at Mercury's poles. To answer the questions posed by these earlier observations, Messenger was launched with a suite of seven instruments. These were the Mercury Dual Imaging System, the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, the X-Ray Spectrometer, the Magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and the Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer. Combined, these experiments mapped the whole of Mercury in visible and infrared light, measured the topographical and chemical characteristics of the planet's surface, studied the changes in Mercury's magnetic field and observed shifts in the planet's atmosphere. By every measure, Messenger achieved its science goals. With a budget of just under $450 million, it sent back ten terabytes of data, including more than 275,000 high resolution images of the rocky world. Already, 181 articles have been produced with this data since Messenger entered orbit, involving an international team of more than 125 scientists and engineering labor from Canada, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy and the United States. One of the surprising findings is that Mercury has a high abundance of the elements potassium, sulfur and chlorine, along with an unexpectedly low content of thorium. The high sulfur content in particular indicates that Mercury's formation involved less oxygen than the other terrestrial planets. This rules out certain theories for Mercury's formation as well as for the formation of all the planets in the inner Solar System. Another constraint on theories of Mercury's formation is the presence of ice water at the poles. Previous ground-based radio observations detected highly reflective materials at the poles, but the geometry between Earth and Mercury is such that those observations couldn't get enough detail to determine the chemical composition of the deposits. Messenger's orbit allowed to get a clear view of what had previously been hidden and provided many lines of evidence - including direct observations and measuring the amount of neutrons emitted from Mercury's surface - to determine that there is in fact water ice present in the shadows of Mercury's polar craters. Work was also done studying Mercury's atmosphere. While thin, it does exist and was shown to vary seasonally. When Mercury is at it's farthest from the Sun, its sodium-rich atmosphere forms a thin shell near the surface of the planet. When it nears the Sun, however, the sunlight becomes intense enough to strip the atmosphere into a glowing tail that someone standing on Mercury's nightside would find reminiscent of the faint orange of a sky illuminated by a city's sodium streetlights. How the atmosphere regenerates itself is still unknown. One of the features noted about Mercury by Mariner 10 is that the planet appears to have contracted well after it was mostly formed. In a general sense, this can be seen from careful visible and radar imaging of the surface topography.

In its final orbits, MESSENGER not only confirmed Mercury's dark hue is due to carbon, but also revealed the carbon was not deposited by impacting comets, as some researchers suspected. Instead, scientists now believe they are seeing remnants of the planet's primordial crust, which likely formed when a global ocean of super-heated magma cooled, allowing minerals to solidify. Computer simulations and experiments show most of these crystallised minerals would sink - with one key exception. Graphite, the studies show, would float. Scientists used an instrument on MESSENGER called a neutron spectrometer to make low-altitude measurements of the darkest regions on the planet's surface, which were suspected of having the most low-reflectance material. \"The measurements showed enhanced fluxes of thermal neutrons over three areas of LRM, so only graphite as the darkening agent fits both the spectral reflectance observations and the neutron measurements,\" said MESSENGER's lead scientist, Professor Sean Solomon of Columbia University. Scientists also were able to match the carbon-rich material with large impact craters, evidence the material stemmed from deep within Mercury's crust and was exposed after an impacting body gouged out a crater. \"Because LRM deposits on Mercury are all associated with material excavated from depth by large impact craters, they must come from the mid to lower crust,\" Professor Solomon said. Scientists estimate the ancient crust was about one kilometre thick. The crust of present-day Mercury has been bashed by impacts, covered with lava, melted and otherwise disturbed. \"The processes ... would dilute any primordial crust,\" physicist Dr Patrick Peplowski of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab and colleagues wrote in a paper published this week in Nature Geoscience. The finding also reinforces a hypothesis that Mercury's birthplace had higher concentrations of carbon than where the rest of the inner planets formed. \"This inference adds to our deepening appreciation that Mercury formed from a portion of the early solar nebula that was chemically much more reduced and was rich in other volatiles compared with the portions of the nebula well sampled by Venus, Earth and Mars,\" Professor Solomon said.
