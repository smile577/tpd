NASA today announced that it has selected the University of Arizona \"Phoenix\" mission for launch in 2007 as what is hoped will be the first in a new line of smaller competed \"Scout\" missions in the agency's Mars Exploration Program. Dr. Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory heads the Phoenix mission, named for the mythological bird that is repeatedly reborn of ashes. The $325 million NASA award is more than six times larger than any other single research grant in University of Arizona history. \"The selection of Phoenix completes almost two years of intense competition with other institutions,\" Smith said. \"I am overjoyed that we can now begin the real work that will lead to a successful mission to Mars.\" Phoenix is a partnership of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The science instruments and operations will be a University of Arizona responsibility. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., will manage the project and provide mission design.

Phoenix has the scientific capability \"to change our thinking about the origins of life on other worlds,\" Smith said. \"Even though the northern plains are thought to be too cold now for water to exist as a liquid, periodic variations in the martian orbit allow a warmer climate to develop every 50,000 years. During these periods the ice can melt, dormant organisms could come back to life, (if there are indeed any), and evolution can proceed. Our mission will verify whether the northern plains are indeed a last viable habitat on Mars.\" The lander for Phoenix was built and was being tested to fly as part of the 2001 Mars Surveyor Program, but the program was canceled after the Mars Polar Lander was lost upon landing near Mars' south pole in December 1999. Since then, the 2001 lander has been stored in a clean room at Lockheed Martin in Denver, managed by NASA's new Mars Exploration Program as a flight asset. Renamed Phoenix, it will carry improved versions of University of Arizona panoramic cameras and volatiles-analysis instrument from the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, as well as experiments that had been built for the 2001 Mars Surveyor Program, including a JPL trench-digging robot arm and a chemistry-microscopy instrument. The science payload also includes a descent imager and a suite of meteorological instruments. The mission has two goals. One is to study the geologic history of water, the key to unlocking the story of past climate change. Two is to search for evidence of a habitable zone that may exist in the ice-soil boundary, the \"biological paydirt.\" The Phoenix robotic arm will scoop up martian soil samples and deliver them for heating into tiny ovens of the volatiles-analysis instrument so team members can measure how much water vapor and carbon dioxide gas are given off, how much water ice the samples contain, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument, called thermal evolved gas analyzer, will also measure any organic volatiles. Using another instrument, researchers will examine soil particles as small as 16 microns across. They will measure electrical and thermal conductivity of soil particles using a probe on the robotic arm scoop. One of the most interesting experiments is the wet chemistry laboratory, Smith said. \"We plan to scoop up some soil, put it in a cell, add water, shake it up, and measure the impurities dissolved in the water that have leached out from the soil. This is important, because if the soil ever gets wet, we'll know if microbes could survive. We'll know if the wet soil is super acidic or alkaline and salty, or full of oxidants that can destroy life. We'll test the environment that microbes might have had to live and grow in,\" Smith said.

Drake said, \"Phoenix has the potential to be the smoking gun for the evolution of life elsewhere in the universe. While it will not directly seek to detect life, it will look for complex organic molecules. If they are there, they are hinting strongly at present or past life. Detection of complex organics will drive all future Mars exploration, and the Lunar and Planetary Lab will play a prominent role. The discovery that we are not alone in the universe, that science fiction of Star Trek may in fact be science fact, will change the way humanity thinks about itself. The existence of even primitive life forms on Mars raises the probability of advanced life elsewhere, and emphasizes our commonality rather than our differences.\" Drake predicts that the Phoenix project will have a $120 million economic impact on Tucson during the next few years. \"No previous UA project has had the economic impact on Tucson that this mission will have,\" he said. \"People, especially legislators, usually don't think about the economic impact of the university on our city and state. They regard the university as a consumer of tax dollars rather than a generator of net wealth. But even before the Phoenix mission, for the state's annual investment of $2.5 million in the Lunar and Planetary Lab, the state realized an annual return of $15 million in federal research dollars.\" UA Vice President for Research Richard Powell said, \"This is a tremendous accomplishment for the faculty and students of our Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.

True to its namesake, Phoenix has risen from the ashes of two unsuccessful attempts to reach Mars: The ill-fated Mars Polar Lander that was lost at the planet in 1999 and a Mars Surveyor Program lander that was cancelled and mothballed in 2000. Work on preparing Phoenix for its Earth departure has reached the half-way point. Many of the scientific instruments for Phoenix were already built, needing little or no modification for Mars duties. Still, the craft is undergoing extensive testing and technological tweaking. One-stop shopping: Phoenix is the first in NASA's Scout Program. This class of mission is deemed as innovative, relatively low-cost, and complements \"major missions\" slated as part of the space agency's Mars exploration program. Unlike the up-and-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers, the Phoenix is a one-stop shopping, fixed lander. Once firmly sitting on the planet, the craft literally swings into action, using a robotic arm to furrow into the local landscape, as well as analyze bits of scooped up material with a bevy of instruments. The Phoenix Mission is operated for NASA by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson, in partnership with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Lockheed Martin, and the Canadian Space Agency. Peter Smith of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory heads the Phoenix lander effort. He outlined the goals of the $386 million mission during the 8th International Mars Society Convention, held here August 11-14 at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Ice/soil boundary \"Mars is our sister planet. It's small, cold and no liquid on the surface ... however, we do see water in its frozen form,\" Smith reported. \"The Phoenix mission was designed specifically to look at current processes on Mars...not billions of years ago, but what's happening today.\" Having Phoenix targeted to a still-to-be-picked specific northern polar spot on the red planet, Smith said, \"really provides an opportunity for finding a habitable zone on Mars today...not an ancient one, but a modern one.\" He stressed that Phoenix will do more than look for life, and is well-equipped to study the polar processes on Mars. On arrival at its exploration site in May 2008, Phoenix is designed to investigate the ice/soil boundary. \"Basically, the clock is ticking once we land,\" Smith reported. Touching down inside the arctic circle, just before summer on Mars and at the end of spring, ice will have retreated from the area. \"We're going to land on dry soil. We can start digging immediately,\" Smith said. Life-giving elements Phoenix has two prime directives. First is to probe the history of liquid water that may have existed in that area as recently as 100,000 years ago. Scientists will analyze the chemistry and mineralogy of the soil and ice using lander instruments. Furthermore, Phoenix will assess the habitability of the martian polar environment by tasking sophisticated chemical experiments to assess the soil's composition of life-giving elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and hydrogen. Phoenix will dig deep enough into the soil to analyze the soil environment, presumably protected from ultraviolet rays, and look for organic signatures and assess the potential habitability of the subsurface. Ease on down But setting the spacecraft down safely onto Mars is a bit of dej\u00e0 vu all over again. When Phoenix plows through Mars' atmosphere in May 2008 and speeds toward the planet's surface, its touchdown won't rely on airbags and bouncing to full- stop - as has been the case for the last three NASA Mars landings. Once free of a parachute, Phoenix will depend upon an \"ease on down\" propulsion system that was last utilized on the failed Mars Polar Lander mission. Lockheed Martin Space Systems near Denver, Colorado--the builder of both Phoenix and the lost Mars Polar Lander--has been busy performing shakeout tests of the rebuilt descent propulsion hardware. For example, in a test stand, water jets have been attached where Phoenix thrusters are placed and then fired to mimic the kind of machine-gun like pulsing and vibration the lander will undergo en route to a hoped for soft touchdown. Bellagio test run Showing a film clip of a \"water hammer\" trial run, \"some call it the Bellagio test,\" Smith noted. \"If you turn it upside down, you'd have the fountains,\" likening it to the Bellagio luxury resort in Las Vegas and its majestic spouting water show. In the descent to Mars, however, Phoenix thrusters will gulp and heave out hydrazine. The engine effluents striking the landing spot in which Phoenix will conduct science \"is a matter of some concern to those members of the science team,\" Smith explained. While the most ultra-pure hydrazine is to be used, some un- combusted fuel will reach the surface. \"So we are very much worried about this issue,\" Smith said. \"We are trying to find ways that we can work with the soil and try to avoid the contamination from the hydrazine and the exhaust gases.\" Science on deck Shortly after landing, Phoenix will unleash its two solar panels. They unfurl like Chinese fans. The tip to tip spread of the solar arrays covers nearly twelve feet, with the lander sitting roughly four feet above the terrain. The \"deck\" of the legged lander is 4 feet across--about the size of a breakfast table--and is loaded with science equipment. Other critical instruments are also deployed right after the lander touches down. A camera system begins snapping images of the surrounding terrain and the area in which the robotic arm will be digging. Also, gear onboard starts to sample the weather at the landing site. Presently, only a UHF antenna is on the lander, meaning all communications with the spacecraft are handled through Mars orbiters. An X band antenna was dropped, shaving off 33 pounds of weight and $10 million in cost to the project. Sterilized \"body bag\" A critical item on Phoenix is a nearly 8 foot long robot arm. \"It's quite a strong arm,\" Smith noted, \"but not strong enough to dig through solid ice.\" Like a back hoe, this appendage can use its sharp prongs and serrated blades to tear and scrape the soil. In the first few weeks of the Phoenix mission, the arm is destined to dig very rapidly, \"just to see if we can find quickly the depth to ice,\" Smith pointed out. Samples successfully scooped up by the arm are placed into a Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer - a combination high-temperature furnace and mass spectrometer instrument that scientists will use to analyze martian ice and soil samples. Specimens are also delivered to water chambers and a microscope station. However, before the agile robot arm is put to work, it must first unsheathe itself from a sterilized \"body bag\" in which it is housed during the ride to Mars. That's necessary as the arm itself will also be sterilized, precluding it from introducing tag-along microbes from Earth to the surface of Mars, Smith said. Humans to Mars: destination and a real purpose Firmly planted on the martian arctic plains, Phoenix operations can confirm what NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter discovered earlier--evidence of ice-rich soil very near the surface. Discoveries made by Odyssey in 2002 include finding large amounts of subsurface water ice in the northern arctic plain \"The first thing we want to do is make sure that Mars Odyssey got it right,\" Smith said, \"that there actually is ice under the soil.\" Smith said that life is believed to form very quickly after the formation of a planet, once water is stable on the surface. Given the clear evidence for a wetter Mars in the past, he added, \"why couldn't life exist on Mars and even have found a niche to continue?\" \"I think the discovery of habitable environments--even the possibility of current life on Mars--by robotic missions would not only focus the human program but would give us a destination and a real purpose,\" Smith observed. Through one of the microscopes carried by Phoenix, that device is powerful enough to detect a lineup or colony of bacteria, he said. Buried in ice Using the TEGA, any tiny martian critters at the site will be receiving a warm reception. \"I hate to say it, but we're not very nice to any microbes that might be on the surface,\" Smith related. If they are contained in the robot arm-delivered ice and soil specimens, they would be vaporized in TEGA ovens. The vapors from the high-heating go into a mass spectrometer to tell scientists about sample composition, he said. Using Phoenix as a life detection package has never been a goal, Smith said. \"We're looking for a habitable zone. We're not necessarily trying to study what out of the thousands and thousands of possibilities might actually inhabit that zone. That's a whole different question...and requires a whole new set of instruments.\" The Phoenix lander is to dig away at Mars for about three months. As Sun- provided solar energy diminishes at the site, less battery power is available to run the craft's robotic arm. \"Then we go into weather station mode...for maybe another two months,\" Smith said. As the ice starts advancing off Mars' northern polar cap and moves southward, Phoenix will become entombed in several feet of solid carbon dioxide. The lander is not designed to survive being buried in solid ice for six to seven months, Smith said. Elegance of Phoenix The Phoenix mission will exhibit extraordinary abilities to help pin down conditions now present on Mars, said Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist in Washington, D.C. Garvin was the original Mars Scout Program Scientist and Evaluation Chairperson for NASA. \"The elegance of Phoenix is its unprecedented ability to 'follow the modern water cycle' at the surface of Mars by investigating the geochemical signatures of water ice and the polar water transport story in the atmosphere,\" Garvin explained to SPACE.com via email. Garvin said that Phoenix uniquely addresses issues that combine the sources and sinks of modern water on the red planet--as ice and water vapor--with the history of that planet's recent polar climate Additionally, the lander begins the search for evidence of organic molecules by searching for some of them within the martian ice record. \"To me, Phoenix recaptures the science lost with the demise of the Mars Polar Lander, while adding new dimensions relevant to future human exploration and the understanding of climate on Mars, Garvin said.

Phoenix will dig deep enough into the soil to analyze the soil environment, presumably protected from ultraviolet rays, and look for organic signatures and assess the potential habitability of the subsurface. Ease on down But setting the spacecraft down safely onto Mars is a bit of dej\u00e0 vu all over again. When Phoenix plows through Mars' atmosphere in May 2008 and speeds toward the planet's surface, its touchdown won't rely on airbags and bouncing to full- stop - as has been the case for the last three NASA Mars landings. Once free of a parachute, Phoenix will depend upon an \"ease on down\" propulsion system that was last utilized on the failed Mars Polar Lander mission. Lockheed Martin Space Systems near Denver, Colorado--the builder of both Phoenix and the lost Mars Polar Lander--has been busy performing shakeout tests of the rebuilt descent propulsion hardware. For example, in a test stand, water jets have been attached where Phoenix thrusters are placed and then fired to mimic the kind of machine-gun like pulsing and vibration the lander will undergo en route to a hoped for soft touchdown. Bellagio test run Showing a film clip of a \"water hammer\" trial run, \"some call it the Bellagio test,\" Smith noted. \"If you turn it upside down, you'd have the fountains,\" likening it to the Bellagio luxury resort in Las Vegas and its majestic spouting water show. In the descent to Mars, however, Phoenix thrusters will gulp and heave out hydrazine. The engine effluents striking the landing spot in which Phoenix will conduct science \"is a matter of some concern to those members of the science team,\" Smith explained. While the most ultra-pure hydrazine is to be used, some un- combusted fuel will reach the surface. \"So we are very much worried about this issue,\" Smith said. \"We are trying to find ways that we can work with the soil and try to avoid the contamination from the hydrazine and the exhaust gases.\" Science on deck Shortly after landing, Phoenix will unleash its two solar panels. They unfurl like Chinese fans. The tip to tip spread of the solar arrays covers nearly twelve feet, with the lander sitting roughly four feet above the terrain. The \"deck\" of the legged lander is 4 feet across--about the size of a breakfast table--and is loaded with science equipment. Other critical instruments are also deployed right after the lander touches down. A camera system begins snapping images of the surrounding terrain and the area in which the robotic arm will be digging. Also, gear onboard starts to sample the weather at the landing site. Presently, only a UHF antenna is on the lander, meaning all communications with the spacecraft are handled through Mars orbiters. An X band antenna was dropped, shaving off 33 pounds of weight and $10 million in cost to the project. Sterilized \"body bag\" A critical item on Phoenix is a nearly 8 foot long robot arm. \"It's quite a strong arm,\" Smith noted, \"but not strong enough to dig through solid ice.\" Like a back hoe, this appendage can use its sharp prongs and serrated blades to tear and scrape the soil. In the first few weeks of the Phoenix mission, the arm is destined to dig very rapidly, \"just to see if we can find quickly the depth to ice,\" Smith pointed out. Samples successfully scooped up by the arm are placed into a Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer - a combination high-temperature furnace and mass spectrometer instrument that scientists will use to analyze martian ice and soil samples. Specimens are also delivered to water chambers and a microscope station. However, before the agile robot arm is put to work, it must first unsheathe itself from a sterilized \"body bag\" in which it is housed during the ride to Mars. That's necessary as the arm itself will also be sterilized, precluding it from introducing tag-along microbes from Earth to the surface of Mars, Smith said. Humans to Mars: destination and a real purpose Firmly planted on the martian arctic plains, Phoenix operations can confirm what NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter discovered earlier--evidence of ice-rich soil very near the surface. Discoveries made by Odyssey in 2002 include finding large amounts of subsurface water ice in the northern arctic plain \"The first thing we want to do is make sure that Mars Odyssey got it right,\" Smith said, \"that there actually is ice under the soil.\" Smith said that life is believed to form very quickly after the formation of a planet, once water is stable on the surface. Given the clear evidence for a wetter Mars in the past, he added, \"why couldn't life exist on Mars and even have found a niche to continue?\" \"I think the discovery of habitable environments--even the possibility of current life on Mars--by robotic missions would not only focus the human program but would give us a destination and a real purpose,\" Smith observed. Through one of the microscopes carried by Phoenix, that device is powerful enough to detect a lineup or colony of bacteria, he said. Buried in ice Using the TEGA, any tiny martian critters at the site will be receiving a warm reception. \"I hate to say it, but we're not very nice to any microbes that might be on the surface,\" Smith related. If they are contained in the robot arm-delivered ice and soil specimens, they would be vaporized in TEGA ovens. The vapors from the high-heating go into a mass spectrometer to tell scientists about sample composition, he said. Using Phoenix as a life detection package has never been a goal, Smith said. \"We're looking for a habitable zone. We're not necessarily trying to study what out of the thousands and thousands of possibilities might actually inhabit that zone. That's a whole different question...and requires a whole new set of instruments.\" The Phoenix lander is to dig away at Mars for about three months. As Sun- provided solar energy diminishes at the site, less battery power is available to run the craft's robotic arm. \"Then we go into weather station mode...for maybe another two months,\" Smith said. As the ice starts advancing off Mars' northern polar cap and moves southward, Phoenix will become entombed in several feet of solid carbon dioxide. The lander is not designed to survive being buried in solid ice for six to seven months, Smith said. Elegance of Phoenix The Phoenix mission will exhibit extraordinary abilities to help pin down conditions now present on Mars, said Jim Garvin, NASA Chief Scientist in Washington, D.C. Garvin was the original Mars Scout Program Scientist and Evaluation Chairperson for NASA. \"The elegance of Phoenix is its unprecedented ability to 'follow the modern water cycle' at the surface of Mars by investigating the geochemical signatures of water ice and the polar water transport story in the atmosphere,\" Garvin explained to SPACE.com via email. Garvin said that Phoenix uniquely addresses issues that combine the sources and sinks of modern water on the red planet--as ice and water vapor--with the history of that planet's recent polar climate Additionally, the lander begins the search for evidence of organic molecules by searching for some of them within the martian ice record. \"To me, Phoenix recaptures the science lost with the demise of the Mars Polar Lander, while adding new dimensions relevant to future human exploration and the understanding of climate on Mars, Garvin said.

True to its namesake, Phoenix has risen from the ashes of two unsuccessful attempts to reach Mars: The ill-fated Mars Polar Lander that was lost at the planet in 1999 and a Mars Surveyor Program lander that was cancelled and mothballed in 2000. Work on preparing Phoenix for its Earth departure has reached the half-way point. Many of the scientific instruments for Phoenix were already built, needing little or no modification for Mars duties. Still, the craft is undergoing extensive testing and technological tweaking. One-stop shopping: Phoenix is the first in NASA's Scout Program. This class of mission is deemed as innovative, relatively low-cost, and complements \"major missions\" slated as part of the space agency's Mars exploration program. Unlike the up-and-running Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers, the Phoenix is a one-stop shopping, fixed lander. Once firmly sitting on the planet, the craft literally swings into action, using a robotic arm to furrow into the local landscape, as well as analyze bits of scooped up material with a bevy of instruments. The Phoenix Mission is operated for NASA by the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson, in partnership with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Lockheed Martin, and the Canadian Space Agency. Peter Smith of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory heads the Phoenix lander effort. He outlined the goals of the $386 million mission during the 8th International Mars Society Convention, held here August 11-14 at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Ice/soil boundary \"Mars is our sister planet. It's small, cold and no liquid on the surface ... however, we do see water in its frozen form,\" Smith reported. \"The Phoenix mission was designed specifically to look at current processes on Mars...not billions of years ago, but what's happening today.\" Having Phoenix targeted to a still-to-be-picked specific northern polar spot on the red planet, Smith said, \"really provides an opportunity for finding a habitable zone on Mars today...not an ancient one, but a modern one.\" He stressed that Phoenix will do more than look for life, and is well-equipped to study the polar processes on Mars. On arrival at its exploration site in May 2008, Phoenix is designed to investigate the ice/soil boundary. \"Basically, the clock is ticking once we land,\" Smith reported. Touching down inside the arctic circle, just before summer on Mars and at the end of spring, ice will have retreated from the area. \"We're going to land on dry soil. We can start digging immediately,\" Smith said. Life-giving elements Phoenix has two prime directives. First is to probe the history of liquid water that may have existed in that area as recently as 100,000 years ago. Scientists will analyze the chemistry and mineralogy of the soil and ice using lander instruments. Furthermore, Phoenix will assess the habitability of the martian polar environment by tasking sophisticated chemical experiments to assess the soil's composition of life-giving elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and hydrogen.

This probe is equipped to dig deep, quite literally, into an ongoing mystery--the history of water on Mars and the planet's potential as an extraterrestrial address for life. NASA's Phoenix Mars mission is the first in the space agency's Scout series, a class of spacecraft designed to be inventive but relatively low-cost in furthering Mars exploration. Phoenix is headed for liftoff in August 2007, cruise across the vacuum void for 10 months and set itself down on the red planet in late May 2008. This time there's no bouncing to full-stop on air bags. It will come to a soft touchdown using controlled thrusters. Muddy mission The Mars-bound spacecraft and related parts--a heatshield and protective backshell--sit within a cleanroom here at Lockheed Martin Space Systems--the firm that has designed, built, integrated, and is testing the Phoenix for its journey. Gigantic, below-the-floor filters keep the airflow around Phoenix in clean and dust-free condition. \"We do have planetary protection requirements for the mission. We don't want to contaminate Mars,\" said Peter Doukas, engineering manager for the Phoenix Mars Scout program at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"So every step of the way we're performing what we call bio-assays...to literally take spore counts of things so we're not contaminating Mars when we get there,\" he told SPACE.com. Doukas reiterated a phrase that has been attached to Phoenix. \"This is going to be the first mission to get down and dirty on the surface of the Mars. With all due respect to the Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers...we're going to get muddy. They got dusty,\" Doukas noted. Living up to its namesake Still to arrive are the various instruments that are to be mounted on the \"deck\" of the three-legged Phoenix. They will fit alongside the craft's robotic arm. Icy, muddy samples of the martian soil are to be scooped up via the mechanical appendage, with those specimens deposited into instruments for detailed chemical and geological analysis. \"It's not like we're going to incubate bacteria on Mars. But we are going to study the soil for its ability to harbor life,\" Doukas explained. The Phoenix mission has lived up to its namesake as it \"raises from the ashes\" a spacecraft and science gear from two previous unsuccessful attempts to explore Mars: the Mars Polar Lander failure of 1999, as well as a Mars Surveyor 2001 lander that was well along in development, but mothballed in the wake of back-to-back failures at Mars. That 2001 lander was overhauled to improve the spacecrafts robustness. Also, the revamped probe includes \"here's what I'm doing\" ways to advise Earth controllers of critical events as Phoenix plunges toward Mars for a landing. \"It has been a tough job to put a new mission into an existing box,\", Doukas noted. Throttle up to get down To get down and dirty on Mars, Phoenix must first ease itself down on the planet. For the first time since NASA's Viking missions of the 1970's, the intent is for the spacecraft to achieve a successful and safe self-powered landing onto Mars utilizing onboard engines. Punching through the martian atmosphere, Phoenix will slow down to Mach 1.7. At that moment a parachute is deployed. Shortly after the parachute blossoms, the vehicle's protective heat shield is jettisoned. Then the probe's landing radar is turned on and its legs extended. Even under parachute, Phoenix speeds through the martian atmosphere until it comes within .6 miles of Mars' landscape. At this point, the lander frees itself from the parachute. It then throttles up a set of landing thrusters fed by ultra-pure hydrazine and decelerates. When Phoenix is either at an altitude of 39 feet or traveling at 7.9 feet per second the spacecraft starts traveling at a constant velocity. On touchdown, the landing engines are turned off, controlled by footpad-mounted sensors that detect contact with the surface. Fixed lander Once down, Phoenix is a fixed lander--a firm-footed, stay-put probe ready for research in the northern polar plains of Mars. At a special hot fire test facility here, the Phoenix propulsion system design has undergone extensive shakeout. These were very successful, Doukas said, with thruster firing tests wrapped up first of the year. Between early this month and mid-May of next year, Doukas said, Phoenix goes through A ssembly, T est, and L aunch O perations, or ATLO for short. Completing ATLO, the Mars lander will be transported to Florida for launch atop a Boeing Delta 2 booster. The sojourn to Mars will start sometime within a 22 day launch window in August 2007. While engineers are busy prepping Phoenix for its sendoff, scientists are on track in plotting out their own high-expectations for mission success. On-the-spot examination At the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held March 13-17 in Houston, Texas, Phoenix team members presented both excitement and nervousness about the Phoenix Mars endeavor--specifically, addressing the dangers lurking at the spacecraft's landing zone. During the summer season, the Phoenix robotic arm will dig a trench and provide samples to instruments on the deck of the spacecraft, reported Peter Smith of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. He heads the Phoenix Mission. A set of experiments is planned to help researchers understand the chemistry and mineralogy of the surface materials down to a layer where ice is stable, Smith said. Because the landing site is selected with the expectation of finding water ice near the surface, the Phoenix mission may provide the first on-the-spot examination of water on Mars, he explained. The search for evidence of a habitable zone and assess the biologic potential of the ice-soil boundary is high on the scientific agenda for Phoenix. Biological communities Microbial colonies can survive in a dormant state for extremely long periods of time, Smith reported at LPSC. He highlighted recent work showing that as water ice melts onto soil crystals at temperatures as cold as - 20 C, microbes are activated and are able to search for food. As temperatures increase, growth and reproduction begin. The question is, Smith asked: Can this cycle take place on Mars? \"It is unlikely that a single trench in the vast northern plains will find evidence for biological communities even if they exist there,\" Smith noted in a research paper issued at LPSC. \"Our goal is to determine whether conditions favor their preservation.\" Phoenix is to drop itself down on the high northern latitudes of Mars. But what awaits the lander in terms of dangerous geography is still being thrashed out. No egregious landforms Mars scientist, Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, said the region under review where Phoenix is to touch down does not have \"egregious landforms\" in terms of safety. That belief, Arvidson added, will be strengthened by imagery from the just arrived Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express--orbiters all. Still, there's a host of engineering issues that must be addressed to get Phoenix safely down on Mars, said Joe Guinn, mission system manager for Phoenix at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Guinn said the spacecraft is quite robust as it enters the martian atmosphere and descends to Mars. \"But it is pretty risky,\" he added. \"If we lose an engine, the other engines are guaranteed to get us to the scene.\" Additional uncertainties include air density, winds, lander attitude control...and just how well Phoenix will deal with slopes and rocks, Guinn explained. Fortunately, the northern plains of Mars are very flat and low. Belly up to Mars \"As far as we can tell from all available data...slopes look relatively benign,\" added Matt Golombek, a JPL planetary geologist and Mars landing site specialist. However, rock distribution remains the least understood safety hazard for Phoenix. Golombek pointed out at the LPSC that the Phoenix lander has about 14 inches of clearance above the surface, depending on the force taken by the lander's legs. \"If there is a pointy rock that you come down on, the belly pan of the lander could hit that rock...and that would be of serious concern,\" Golombek said. \"So there is concern here. We will be looking at the MRO data with great interest,\" he concluded.", "url": "https://www.space.com/2249-phoenix-mars-lander-dirty-red-planet.html"}, {"title": "Pieces of NASA's Next Mars Mission are Coming Together", "date": "2006-04-26", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander, the next mission to the surface of Mars, is beginning a new phase in preparation for a launch in August 2007. As part of this \"assembly, test and launch operations\" phase, Phoenix team members are beginning to add complex subsystems such as the flight computer, power systems and science instruments to the main structure of the spacecraft. The work combines efforts of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver; the University of Arizona, Tucson; and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"All the subsystems and instruments from a wide range of suppliers are tested separately, but now we are beginning the vital stage of assembling them together and testing how they will function with each other,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, project manager for Phoenix. Phoenix will land near the red planet's north polar ice cap to analyze scooped-up samples of icy soil. \"We know there is plenty of water frozen into the surface layer of Mars at high latitudes. We've designed Phoenix to tell us more about this region as a possible habitat for life,\" said the University of Arizona's Peter Smith, principal investigator for the mission. Phoenix is the first mission of NASA's Mars Scout Program of competitively proposed, relatively low-cost missions to Mars. The program is currently soliciting proposals for a 2011 Scout mission. The Phoenix proposal, selected in 2003, saves expense by using a lander structure, subsystem components and protective aeroshell originally built for a 2001 lander mission that was canceled while in development. The budget for the Phoenix mission, including launch, is $386 million. The spacecraft will land using descent thrusters just prior to touchdown, rather than airbags like those used by the current Mars Exploration Rovers. As Phoenix parachutes through Mars' lower atmosphere in May 2008, a descent camera will take images for providing geological context about the landing site. The robotic arm being built for Phoenix will be about 2 meters (7 feet) long, jointed at the elbow and wrist, and equipped with a camera and scoop. It will dig as deep as about 50 centimeters (20 inches) and deliver samples to instruments on the spacecraft deck that will analyze physical and chemical properties of the ices and other materials. A stereo color camera will examine the landing site's terrain and provide positioning information for the arm. The Canadian Space Agency is providing a suite of weather instruments for Phoenix. \"The propulsion system and the wiring harness have been added to the vehicle,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager for Lockheed Martin. \"We will be loading flight software onto the flight computer in the next few days. The flight software is much more mature than typical for a planetary program at this stage.

This probe is equipped to dig deep, quite literally, into an ongoing mystery--the history of water on Mars and the planet's potential as an extraterrestrial address for life. NASA's Phoenix Mars mission is the first in the space agency's Scout series, a class of spacecraft designed to be inventive but relatively low-cost in furthering Mars exploration. Phoenix is headed for liftoff in August 2007, cruise across the vacuum void for 10 months and set itself down on the red planet in late May 2008. This time there's no bouncing to full-stop on air bags. It will come to a soft touchdown using controlled thrusters. Muddy mission The Mars-bound spacecraft and related parts--a heatshield and protective backshell--sit within a cleanroom here at Lockheed Martin Space Systems--the firm that has designed, built, integrated, and is testing the Phoenix for its journey. Gigantic, below-the-floor filters keep the airflow around Phoenix in clean and dust-free condition. \"We do have planetary protection requirements for the mission. We don't want to contaminate Mars,\" said Peter Doukas, engineering manager for the Phoenix Mars Scout program at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. \"So every step of the way we're performing what we call bio-assays...to literally take spore counts of things so we're not contaminating Mars when we get there,\" he told SPACE.com. Doukas reiterated a phrase that has been attached to Phoenix. \"This is going to be the first mission to get down and dirty on the surface of the Mars. With all due respect to the Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers...we're going to get muddy. They got dusty,\" Doukas noted. Living up to its namesake Still to arrive are the various instruments that are to be mounted on the \"deck\" of the three-legged Phoenix. They will fit alongside the craft's robotic arm. Icy, muddy samples of the martian soil are to be scooped up via the mechanical appendage, with those specimens deposited into instruments for detailed chemical and geological analysis. \"It's not like we're going to incubate bacteria on Mars. But we are going to study the soil for its ability to harbor life,\" Doukas explained. The Phoenix mission has lived up to its namesake as it \"raises from the ashes\" a spacecraft and science gear from two previous unsuccessful attempts to explore Mars: the Mars Polar Lander failure of 1999, as well as a Mars Surveyor 2001 lander that was well along in development, but mothballed in the wake of back-to-back failures at Mars. That 2001 lander was overhauled to improve the spacecrafts robustness. Also, the revamped probe includes \"here's what I'm doing\" ways to advise Earth controllers of critical events as Phoenix plunges toward Mars for a landing. \"It has been a tough job to put a new mission into an existing box,\", Doukas noted. Throttle up to get down To get down and dirty on Mars, Phoenix must first ease itself down on the planet. For the first time since NASA's Viking missions of the 1970's, the intent is for the spacecraft to achieve a successful and safe self-powered landing onto Mars utilizing onboard engines. Punching through the martian atmosphere, Phoenix will slow down to Mach 1.7. At that moment a parachute is deployed. Shortly after the parachute blossoms, the vehicle's protective heat shield is jettisoned. Then the probe's landing radar is turned on and its legs extended. Even under parachute, Phoenix speeds through the martian atmosphere until it comes within .6 miles of Mars' landscape. At this point, the lander frees itself from the parachute. It then throttles up a set of landing thrusters fed by ultra-pure hydrazine and decelerates. When Phoenix is either at an altitude of 39 feet or traveling at 7.9 feet per second the spacecraft starts traveling at a constant velocity. On touchdown, the landing engines are turned off, controlled by footpad-mounted sensors that detect contact with the surface. Fixed lander Once down, Phoenix is a fixed lander--a firm-footed, stay-put probe ready for research in the northern polar plains of Mars. At a special hot fire test facility here, the Phoenix propulsion system design has undergone extensive shakeout. These were very successful, Doukas said, with thruster firing tests wrapped up first of the year. Between early this month and mid-May of next year, Doukas said, Phoenix goes through A ssembly, T est, and L aunch O perations, or ATLO for short. Completing ATLO, the Mars lander will be transported to Florida for launch atop a Boeing Delta 2 booster. The sojourn to Mars will start sometime within a 22 day launch window in August 2007. While engineers are busy prepping Phoenix for its sendoff, scientists are on track in plotting out their own high-expectations for mission success. On-the-spot examination At the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held March 13-17 in Houston, Texas, Phoenix team members presented both excitement and nervousness about the Phoenix Mars endeavor--specifically, addressing the dangers lurking at the spacecraft's landing zone. During the summer season, the Phoenix robotic arm will dig a trench and provide samples to instruments on the deck of the spacecraft, reported Peter Smith of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. He heads the Phoenix Mission. A set of experiments is planned to help researchers understand the chemistry and mineralogy of the surface materials down to a layer where ice is stable, Smith said. Because the landing site is selected with the expectation of finding water ice near the surface, the Phoenix mission may provide the first on-the-spot examination of water on Mars, he explained. The search for evidence of a habitable zone and assess the biologic potential of the ice-soil boundary is high on the scientific agenda for Phoenix. Biological communities Microbial colonies can survive in a dormant state for extremely long periods of time, Smith reported at LPSC. He highlighted recent work showing that as water ice melts onto soil crystals at temperatures as cold as - 20 C, microbes are activated and are able to search for food. As temperatures increase, growth and reproduction begin. The question is, Smith asked: Can this cycle take place on Mars? \"It is unlikely that a single trench in the vast northern plains will find evidence for biological communities even if they exist there,\" Smith noted in a research paper issued at LPSC. \"Our goal is to determine whether conditions favor their preservation.\" Phoenix is to drop itself down on the high northern latitudes of Mars. But what awaits the lander in terms of dangerous geography is still being thrashed out. No egregious landforms Mars scientist, Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, said the region under review where Phoenix is to touch down does not have \"egregious landforms\" in terms of safety. That belief, Arvidson added, will be strengthened by imagery from the just arrived Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express--orbiters all. Still, there's a host of engineering issues that must be addressed to get Phoenix safely down on Mars, said Joe Guinn, mission system manager for Phoenix at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Guinn said the spacecraft is quite robust as it enters the martian atmosphere and descends to Mars. \"But it is pretty risky,\" he added. \"If we lose an engine, the other engines are guaranteed to get us to the scene.\" Additional uncertainties include air density, winds, lander attitude control...and just how well Phoenix will deal with slopes and rocks, Guinn explained. Fortunately, the northern plains of Mars are very flat and low. Belly up to Mars \"As far as we can tell from all available data...slopes look relatively benign,\" added Matt Golombek, a JPL planetary geologist and Mars landing site specialist. However, rock distribution remains the least understood safety hazard for Phoenix. Golombek pointed out at the LPSC that the Phoenix lander has about 14 inches of clearance above the surface, depending on the force taken by the lander's legs. \"If there is a pointy rock that you come down on, the belly pan of the lander could hit that rock...and that would be of serious concern,\" Golombek said. \"So there is concern here. We will be looking at the MRO data with great interest,\" he concluded.", "url": "https://www.space.com/2249-phoenix-mars-lander-dirty-red-planet.html"}, {"title": "Pieces of NASA's Next Mars Mission are Coming Together", "date": "2006-04-26", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander, the next mission to the surface of Mars, is beginning a new phase in preparation for a launch in August 2007.

(ASI), and delivered-one month early-to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for integration onto the Mars Phoenix lander, due for launch to the Red Planet next year. It will be the first trenching device to visit Mars, and has a different capability than the robotic arms ASI built for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, says Ren\u00e9 Fradet, ASI president and CEO. \"The robotic arm for Phoenix works like a mini-backhoe and is designed to dig a two-foot deep trench in Mars' north-polar region,\" Fradet says. The long-lived robotic arms on the rovers, meanwhile, perform more delicate tasks, precisely moving cameras and other instruments close to rock and soil targets. Phoenix mission scientists anticipate that the robotic arm will uncover a layer of water ice near the surface of Mars' northern plains, where Phoenix, equipped with small thrusters, is scheduled to softly touch down in late May 2007. At the business end of the arm is a scoop about the size of a garden trowel that will do the digging down to a potentially rock-hard ice layer. In addition, a drill will penetrate, break up and retrieve hard ice samples for scientific study. Endowed with four degrees-of-freedom and a 7.5-foot reach, the aluminum and titanium device weighs less than 22 pounds. The agile arm also will deliver Mars soil and, scientists hope, frozen water samples to the suite of scientific instruments on the lander for close-up study. A camera will also be mounted on the arm to provide a view of layers in the trench wall. The three-month mission is expected to yield new clues to the history of water on Mars and whether the environment was ever conducive to life. The delivery of the Phoenix arm follows the recent announcement of a merger between ASI and Vision Composites (Signal Hill, CA). Due to take effect July 1, the merger will enable the combined companies to provide aerospace customers with a single resource for the design and fabrication of composite space structures.

The lights are in. The computer \"brain\" that simulates the workings of the Phoenix Mars Lander spacecraft and runs its science payload and telecommunications system is ready for action. Now a team at the Phoenix Science Operations Center (SOC) at The University of Arizona in Tucson has begun adding engineering models of science payload instruments to a mock lander. The mock lander is central to the Payload Interoperability Testbed, or \"PIT.\" SOC and the PIT will be the theater of operations for the Phoenix Mission, both for pre-landing practice and post-landing science surface mission operations. The first in NASA's \"Scout\" program, the Phoenix Mars Lander will launch in August 2007 for a May 2008 touchdown. The Phoenix mission is led by Principal Investigator Peter H. Smith, of the University of Arizona, with project management at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and development partnership with Lockheed Martin Space Systems. International contributions for Phoenix are provided by the Canadian Space Agency, the University of Neuchatel (Switzerland), the University of Copenhagen, and the Max Planck Institute in Germany.. The mission will explore a Mars polar landing site to uncover clues about the history of water and potential for habitat to support life. The payload includes a nearly eight-foot long robotic arm for digging down through soil into ice, a robotic arm camera, a surface stereo camera, a descent camera, a meteorological station, a high-temperature furnace and mass spectrometer, a powerful atomic force microscope and a miniature wet chemistry laboratory. \"The PIT is going to be a Martian stage set, the mission's rehearsal theater,\" said Smith, a senior research scienetis at UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL). \"We'll create an interesting scene for the science team to interact with. We'll set up puzzles in the terrain we'll dig into and have the science team solve the puzzles in paydirt. You won't mistake this for Mars, but it will look Mars-like.\" \"The PIT is a complete test environment that will allow us to test all of the commands that will be sent to the lander,\" SOC Manager Chris Shinohara said. \"The PIT allows us to have a dedicated testbed for testing science instruments so we can verify how we will operate them on the surface of Mars.\" The 2,500-square-foot PIT doesn't look much like the Red Planet yet. But by fall, the 30-inch-high, 1,600-square-foot mock lander platform will sport terrain fashioned from painted drop cloths, a Mars crater, a dust devil and other Martian features. The mock lander is perched next to a 16-foot by 8-foot digging slot. Technicians will slide bins of prepared soil into the slot in tests of the robotic arm. The \"Payload Test Lab\" (PTL) computer occupies a 170-square-foot cubicle with walls covered by silver antistatic material. PIT workers are erecting a PTL cubicle canopy of the same silver stuff. The computer has 30-foot extension cables for controlling the PIT lander deck. The PTL can be remotely operated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena or Lockheed Martin, which has an identical twin computer in Denver, if needed. Aluminum foil on the ceiling above the raised platform helps create ambient Mars-like lighting. The wrinkled foil diffuses light from a dozen 1,000-watt floodlights pointing upwards. In addition, four very narrow 1,000-watt spotlights mounted in a line on a single, adjustable stand can be moved around the lander platform to simulate light from sun's disk on its daily journey across the Martian sky. Swamp coolers help humidify PIT air -- not because real Mars air is humid, but to control electrical sparks that could fry sensitive electrical parts on science instruments in the mock lander payload. Electrical discharges won't be a problem with the real payload on Mars, of course, because there's no one around to touch the devices on Mars. One corner of the 20,000-square-foot room has been painted a Mars-like reddish brown. The painted wall sets off Phoenix Mars Lander exhibits designed by the Pima Air and Space Museum. The PIT also includes an operations room, office space and a conference room. The mission team will use the PIT to develop and test efficient \"integrated payload surface operations,\" Shinohara said. Phoenix operations sequences have to be efficient if the team is to get the most science data possible before the arctic sun sets and the three-month-or-more mission ends in 2008. Teams from UA's LPL, Lockheed Martin and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will be adding flight science instruments to the Phoenix spacecraft at Lockheed Martin in Denver next month. When the mock lander instruments have been installed, engineers and scientists will begin using the PIT to test payload instruments for any hardware and software glitches, said PIT manager Rick McCloskey. \"It's cheaper and easier to troubleshoot any problems here than to do it with the real instruments being installed on the real lander at Lockheed Martin,\" McCloskey said. \"The PIT also plays an important role in training science and engineering teams,\" Shinohara added. Phoenix mission scientists from academic institutions and laboratories around the world will convene for PIT rehearsals, called \"ORTs,\" or operations readiness tests next March. Two more ORTs are scheduled before landing, in September 2007 and January 2008. Team members will write the sequences that will command the robotic arm to dig into frozen soil that ranges from rock-hard ice to loose sand. They'll practice delivering samples to the suite of sophisticated instruments on the lander deck, then simulate running experiments for analyzing the soils. They'll photograph the mock Mars environment in ambient lighting that simulates the harsh Martian light. \"We'll play 'What ifs',\" McCloskey said. \"What if there's a rock right in the middle of where we want the robotic arm to dig? Or what if there's a data drop-out and we don't have all the data we'd like to decide what we're going to do the next day?\" Mission operations will move to the UA's SOC building after the Phoenix spacecraft has landed safely and is found to be operating normally. The SOC facility then will support about 100 people from all over the world who are on instrument, spacecraft, ground data system and science teams, Shinohara said.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/engineering-science-payload-delivered-to-mars-phoenix-mission-pit/"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander is Coming Together", "date": "2006-06-20", "content": "NASA's next mission to the surface of the Red Planet is the Phoenix Mars Lander, due for launch in August 2007.

But by fall, the 30-inch-high, 1,600-square-foot mock lander platform will sport terrain fashioned from painted drop cloths, a Mars crater, a dust devil and other Martian features. The mock lander is perched next to a 16-foot by 8-foot digging slot. Technicians will slide bins of prepared soil into the slot in tests of the robotic arm. The \"Payload Test Lab\" (PTL) computer occupies a 170-square-foot cubicle with walls covered by silver antistatic material. PIT workers are erecting a PTL cubicle canopy of the same silver stuff. The computer has 30-foot extension cables for controlling the PIT lander deck. The PTL can be remotely operated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena or Lockheed Martin, which has an identical twin computer in Denver, if needed. Aluminum foil on the ceiling above the raised platform helps create ambient Mars-like lighting. The wrinkled foil diffuses light from a dozen 1,000-watt floodlights pointing upwards. In addition, four very narrow 1,000-watt spotlights mounted in a line on a single, adjustable stand can be moved around the lander platform to simulate light from sun's disk on its daily journey across the Martian sky. Swamp coolers help humidify PIT air - not because real Mars air is humid, but to control electrical sparks that could fry sensitive electrical parts on science instruments in the mock lander payload. Electrical discharges won't be a problem with the real payload on Mars, of course, because there's no one around to touch the devices on Mars. One corner of the 20,000-square-foot room has been painted a Mars-like reddish brown. The painted wall sets off Phoenix Mars Lander exhibits designed by the Pima Air and Space Museum.

The mission team will use the PIT to develop and test efficient \"integrated payload surface operations,\" Shinohara said. Phoenix operations sequences have to be efficient if the team is to get the most science data possible before the arctic sun sets and the three-month-or-more mission ends in 2008. Teams from UA's LPL, Lockheed Martin and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will be adding flight science instruments to the Phoenix spacecraft at Lockheed Martin in Denver next month. When the mock lander instruments have been installed, engineers and scientists will begin using the PIT to test payload instruments for any hardware and software glitches, said PIT manager Rick McCloskey. \"It's cheaper and easier to troubleshoot any problems here than to do it with the real instruments being installed on the real lander at Lockheed Martin,\" McCloskey said.

As part of this assembly, test, and launch operations phase, Phoenix team members are beginning to add complex subsystems such as the flight computer, power systems, and science instruments to the main structure of the spacecraft. The work combines efforts of Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver, the University of Arizona in Tucson, Ariz., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"All the subsystems and instruments from a wide range of suppliers are tested separately, but now we are beginning the vital stage of assembling them together and testing how they will function with each other,\" says JPL's Barry Goldstein, project manager for Phoenix. \"The propulsion system and the wiring harness have been added to the vehicle,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager for Lockheed Martin. \"We will be loading flight software onto the flight computer in the next few days. The flight software is much more mature than typical for a planetary program at this stage. As soon as the flight computer is mated up, we can apply external power to the vehicle.\" Navigation components, such as star trackers, and communication subsystems will become part of the spacecraft in coming weeks, followed by science instruments in the summer. Phoenix will land near the red planet's north polar ice cap to analyze scooped-up samples of icy Martian soil. \"We know there is plenty of water frozen into the surface layer of Mars at high latitudes. We've designed Phoenix to tell us more about this region as a possible habitat for life,\" said the University of Arizona's Peter Smith, principal investigator for the mission. The spacecraft will land using descent thrusters just prior to touchdown, rather than airbags like those used by the current Mars Exploration Rovers. As Phoenix parachutes through Mars's lower atmosphere in May 2008, a descent camera will take images for providing geological context about the landing site. The robotic arm being built for Phoenix will be about seven feet long, jointed at the elbow and wrist, and equipped with a camera and scoop. It will dig as deep as about 20 inches and deliver samples to instruments on the spacecraft deck that will analyze physical and chemical properties of the ices and other materials. A stereo color camera will examine the landing site's terrain and provide positioning information for the arm. The Canadian Space Agency is providing a suite of weather instruments for Phoenix. Phoenix is the first mission of NASA's Mars Scout Program of competitively proposed, relatively low-cost missions to Mars. The program is currently soliciting proposals for a 2011 Scout mission. The Phoenix proposal, selected in 2003, saves expense by using a lander structure, subsystem components, and protective aeroshell originally built for a 2001 lander mission that was canceled while in development. The budget for the Phoenix mission, including launch, is $386 million. Phoenix will be shipped to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Fla., in May 2007, for final preparations leading up to launch. Before that, testing in Colorado will subject the spacecraft to expected operational environments. This includes thermal and vacuum tests simulating the 10-month trip to Mars and conditions on Mars's surface. Meanwhile, the mission is preparing a test facility in Tucson for practicing and testing procedures for operating the spacecraft on Mars.

(ASI), and delivered-one month early-to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for integration onto the Mars Phoenix lander, due for launch to the Red Planet next year. It will be the first trenching device to visit Mars, and has a different capability than the robotic arms ASI built for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, says Ren\u00e9 Fradet, ASI president and CEO. \"The robotic arm for Phoenix works like a mini-backhoe and is designed to dig a two-foot deep trench in Mars' north-polar region,\" Fradet says. The long-lived robotic arms on the rovers, meanwhile, perform more delicate tasks, precisely moving cameras and other instruments close to rock and soil targets. Phoenix mission scientists anticipate that the robotic arm will uncover a layer of water ice near the surface of Mars' northern plains, where Phoenix, equipped with small thrusters, is scheduled to softly touch down in late May 2007. At the business end of the arm is a scoop about the size of a garden trowel that will do the digging down to a potentially rock-hard ice layer. In addition, a drill will penetrate, break up and retrieve hard ice samples for scientific study. Endowed with four degrees-of-freedom and a 7.5-foot reach, the aluminum and titanium device weighs less than 22 pounds. The agile arm also will deliver Mars soil and, scientists hope, frozen water samples to the suite of scientific instruments on the lander for close-up study. A camera will also be mounted on the arm to provide a view of layers in the trench wall. The three-month mission is expected to yield new clues to the history of water on Mars and whether the environment was ever conducive to life. The delivery of the Phoenix arm follows the recent announcement of a merger between ASI and Vision Composites (Signal Hill, CA). Due to take effect July 1, the merger will enable the combined companies to provide aerospace customers with a single resource for the design and fabrication of composite space structures.

For the first time since NASA's Viking missions in the 1970's, the plan calls for Phoenix to safely settle down on Mars using a set of on board rocket thrusters -- no airbags this time as successfully used by NASA's last three red planet landings. When Phoenix touches down within the northern polar plains of Mars, it will be ready for research duties. This stationary probe is armed with a robotic scoop to dig and scratch into the martian surface for answers regarding the history of water on Mars and the planet's potential as an extrater restrial address forlife. The spacecraft is the first in the space agency's low-cost, Scout-class of a space mission. Phoenix did experience technical challenges, particularly in the craft's radar system, causing a cost overrun from an earlier cost-cap figure of $386 million. Phoenix project officials discussed the spacecraft's status and future voyage today at a press briefing held at Lockheed Martin Space Systems near Denver, the site where the Mars landerwas built and being readied for flight. Green Valley: Stillbeing discussed is exactly where to touch down in order to avoid dangerous geography, said Peter Smith, Phoenix principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Smith said that scientists thought they had selected a safe Phoenix landing spot. However, new imagery of that selected area taken by a super-powerful camera system onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found it littered with enormous boulders. \"It was not a very safe place to land,\" he said. Usingboth the MRO and NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, three sites are now being intensely mapped, to assure that Phoenix has a high probability of touching down safely. Inplotting out landing areas, \"we paint the parts green that we think are thesafest places ... and we have a place we call 'Green Valley' now that's so greenthat it looks very secure for us,\" Smith told reporters today. Picking the actual piece of martian real estate that Phoenix will plop down on isexpected in early March, Smith said. \"We want to select both a safe site and ascientifically interesting site...with safety being number one of course...or elsewe don't get anything.\" Seven minutes of terror: Getting Phoenix down through the red planet's atmosphere onto the landscape of Mars isthe most harrowing part of the mission, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix projectmanager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Weget seven minutes of terror,\" Goldstein explained. Trying to deliver a vehiclelike this from a high speed and heated plunge of 12,600 miles per hour to zeroand a100 million miles away \"is no easy shot,\" he added. Goldsteinsaid that in March of last year, the Phoenix project started having \"somesignificant challenges\" in bringing the mission in at a $386 million cost cap.The team notified NASA Headquarters of the overrun last August, requesting anew slug of money, he added, roughly $31 million. Ata meeting last week, Goldstein said that NASA officials gave the project ago-ahead, although the final price tag of the mission has yet to be fullyvetted. \"The vehicle is behaving very nicely. Things are looking goodtechnically as well as with the schedule and where we are headed. We have nothreats to launch at this point,\" he said.

The lander had come under NASA's scrutiny because it did not have adequate funds in reserve to get through its intended lifetime of about 150 days. NASA had capped the mission's cost at &dollar;386 million, but mission planners estimated they would exceed that limit by &dollar;31 million due to development problems and delays in selecting a landing site. That forced NASA to conduct a 'termination review' to determine whether the mission should be allowed to proceed. \"I've been fretting about that for three months now,\" says Peter Smith, the mission's principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson, US. But on Friday, NASA officials in Washington DC, US, gave the mission the go- ahead to proceed with launch preparations, as first reported by the Rocky Mountain News. Perilous landing: Phoenix will be a stationary lander that will use a robotic arm to dig trenches near Mars's north pole. It will examine layers of water ice beneath the surface and sniff out organic molecules. One of the elements that has given the mission team problems is the mission's radar altimeter, which will measure the lander's altitude and velocity as it descends through Mars's atmosphere. The spacecraft inherited the altimeter - along with many other components - from NASA's Mars Polar Lander, a spacecraft that was lost during its descent to the Martian surface in December 1999. A faulty altimeter may have been to blame. The altimeter's design is based on one used in F-16 fighter planes. Some software problems on the F-16 altimeter were fixed, but the altimeter for Phoenix did not get the same software upgrade. Mission managers were concerned that the altimeter would not give the correct measurements or its signal could drop out completely, making a potential landing on Mars quite perilous. Boulder fields: So they spent about six months fixing the device, driving up costs. Since then, an independent review team has confirmed that they have solved the problem. A prolonged hunt for a safe landing spot has also driven up the cost of the mission. One of the early favourites for a landing site was ruled out because the agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed that it was strewn with large boulders. Now, the mission team has narrowed the search down to three possible landing sites, and it is set to pick a site in March. Phoenix is expected to touch down at a latitude between 65\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 in the northern hemisphere. Phoenix is the first of NASA's Scout missions, which are designed to be lower- cost ways of reaching and investigating Mars.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11078-phoenix-mars-lander-survives-cancellation-review/"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Readied For Mars Exploration", "date": "2007-02-01", "content": "NASA's next mission to Mars -- the Phoenix lander -- is undergoing readiness testing in preparation for an early August launch window.

Phoenix is designed to use its robotic arm-mounted scoop to dig into and collect samples of Mars' surface, then scan them with a host of onboard instruments. But reaching Mars has historically been tough, particularly since the planet is rather unforgiving to small errors. More than half of all the missions sent to Mars have ended infailure. NASA's ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, for example, suffered an apparent early shutdown of its descent rocket engines in 1999, likely sending the craft plummeting to its destruction on the martian surface. Phoenix carries many of the same instrumentsas its polar-bound predecessor in an effort to recoup some of that lost science. \"It's challenging, no doubt.

Lining the probe's top, or deck, are more cameras, a wet chemistry laboratory, eight miniatureovens and other tools to determine the chemical makeup of Mars' ice and soilwith a special focus on the presence of organic compounds. Such complex compoundsand liquid water are thought to be among the requirements needed to supportprimitive life, Phoenix researchers said. Each tinyoven can only be used once and will cook just a pinch of martian soil -- about 30microliters -- and then analyze the leftovers. \"When theoven is heated? it gives off vapor just like cookie dough in your kitchen,\" saidthe oven instrument's lead scientist William Boyton, of the University ofArizona. \"And we use that to see what's going on.\" Red planet weather station: Phoenix isalso equipped to serve as the first polar weather station on Mars.

The 772-pound spacecraft's launch was so precise that Phoenix was able to conserve about 22 pounds of precious propellant, which will add some maneuvering flexibility once the probe prepares for its Mars descent next year. NASA's $420 million Phoenix mission is aimed at an icy, flat region of northern Mars known as Vastitas Borealis. There, the lander is expected to use its eight-foot robotic arm like a backhoe to carve out samples of the surrounding martian soil and ice. The samples will be analyzed by onboard ovens, cameras, microscopes and a wet chemistry laboratory to determine their chemical makeup. Researchers are hoping to learn whether the icy terrain has preserved any organic molecules or compounds within the martian soil, which may prove useful in determining whether the area may have once been habitable for microbial life. Phoenix also carries a laser ranging and detection tool and other instruments mounted to a meteorology mast to study the arctic weather on Mars. Much of Phoenix's structure and seven-suite science package were developed for or recycled from NASA's canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander and the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, which was lost during its 1999 descent to the martian surface. Phoenix scientists hope their probe will recover some science lost from the 1999 mission's failure. \"It's a great day for America, it's a great day to continue exploration,\" NASA's Mars program director Doug McCuistion said after the successful Saturday launch.", "url": "https://www.space.com/4165-nasa-phoenix-mars-lander-good-health-launch.html"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Spacecraft Corrects Course", "date": "2007-08-15", "content": "NASA's Mars-bound Phoenix lander completed its first and biggest course correctionplanned during the spacecraft's journey.

After launch, Phoenix will land on a Martian arctic plain next spring. It will use a robotic digging arm and other instruments to determine whether the soil environment just beneath the surface could have been a favorable habitat for microbial life. Studies from orbit suggest that within arm's reach of the surface, the soil holds frozen water. \"This is a critical milestone for our mission,\" said Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson, principal investigator for Phoenix. \"Our expert engineering team has completed assembly and testing of the spacecraft. The testing shows our instruments are capable of meeting the high-level requirements for the mission.\" Workers have been assembling and testing the spacecraft for more than a year in Denver. \"We're excited to be going back to Mars,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co., Denver. \"Assembly, integration and testing of the spacecraft have gone very well. We delivered Phoenix stowed inside its back shell and it will stay in that configuration until it lands softly on Mars.\" A Delta II launch vehicle will start Phoenix on its longer trip from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla. The earliest possible launch time will be Aug. 3, at 5:35 a.m. EDT. Opportunities for energy-efficient launches to Mars come about every two years. Orbital geometries of Mars and Earth make this year particularly favorable for sending a lander to far-northern Mars to arrive when sunshine is at a maximum there. \"The arctic plains are the right place for the next step in Mars exploration, and this is the right time to go there,\" said Leslie Tamppari, Phoenix project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We expect to touch Martian ice for the first time, a real leap in NASA's follow-the-water strategy. The lander needs solar energy, and we will arrive for a three-month prime mission right at the end of northern Mars' spring.\" Phoenix will be prepared for launch in a payload processing facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The first checkout activity will be a spin-balance test May 10 and 11. This will be followed on May 15 by installation of the heat shield and then a separation test. The next major milestones, during the third week of May, will be a landing radar integration test and launch system verification test. The last week of May will include an entry, descent and landing system verification test, followed by a guidance navigation and control test. The rocket that will launch Phoenix is a Delta II 7925, manufactured by United Launch Alliance, Denver. The first stage is scheduled to be hoisted into the launcher of Pad 17-A at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station the third week of June. Nine strap-on solid rocket boosters will then be raised and attached. The second stage, which burns hypergolic propellants, will be hoisted atop the first stage the first week of July. The fairing, which surrounds the spacecraft, will then be hoisted into the clean room of the mobile service tower. Next, engineers will perform several tests of the Delta II. In mid-July, as a leak check, the first stage will be loaded with liquid oxygen during a simulated countdown. The next day, a simulated flight test will be performed, simulating the vehicle's post-liftoff flight events without fuel aboard. The electrical and mechanical systems of the entire Delta II will be exercised during this test. Once the Phoenix payload is placed atop the launch vehicle in the third week of July, a major test will be conducted: an integrated test of the Delta II and Phoenix working together. This will be a combined minus count and plus count, simulating all events as they will take place on launch day, but without propellants aboard the vehicle.

Gearing up of the space agency's Phoenix Mars mission comes as another mission stands down due to weather concerns. The launch of Dawn, a mission to explore two rocky objects in the solar system's Asteroid Belt, has been pushed back to no earlier than September, at an additional estimated cost of $20 to $25 million. If Phoenix launches as planned on Aug. 3, it will reach Mars on May 25, 2008. Once it reaches its target, the spacecraft will barrel directly into the Martian atmosphere and attempt the first soft-landing on the red planet since the NASA's Viking missions more than 30 years ago. Phoenix will use a heat shield and parachute to slow its high-speed entry, and pulsed descent rockets to lower it down safely. \"Entry, descent and landing is a challenge no matter what mission you're flying,\" said Doug McCuistion, NASA's Mars Exploration Program manager. \"Mars has a tendency to throw you curveballs that are somewhat unexpected.\" Of all the attempts to land spacecraft on Mars, less than half have been successful. A second chance: Phoenix is the first spacecraft of NASA's Mars Scout Program, designed to explore the red planet using small, low-cost robots. \"They're smaller, less expensive ... and tend to be a little more adventurous than the strategic missions; a little higher risk with a potentially higher payoff,\" McCuistion said. The total cost of the mission is estimated to be about $420 million.

The 772-pound spacecraft's launch was so precise that Phoenix was able to conserve about 22 pounds of precious propellant, which will add some maneuvering flexibility once the probe prepares for its Mars descent next year. NASA's $420 million Phoenix mission is aimed at an icy, flat region of northern Mars known as Vastitas Borealis. There, the lander is expected to use its eight-foot robotic arm like a backhoe to carve out samples of the surrounding martian soil and ice. The samples will be analyzed by onboard ovens, cameras, microscopes and a wet chemistry laboratory to determine their chemical makeup. Researchers are hoping to learn whether the icy terrain has preserved any organic molecules or compounds within the martian soil, which may prove useful in determining whether the area may have once been habitable for microbial life. Phoenix also carries a laser ranging and detection tool and other instruments mounted to a meteorology mast to study the arctic weather on Mars. Much of Phoenix's structure and seven-suite science package were developed for or recycled from NASA's canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander and the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, which was lost during its 1999 descent to the martian surface. Phoenix scientists hope their probe will recover some science lost from the 1999 mission's failure. \"It's a great day for America, it's a great day to continue exploration,\" NASA's Mars program director Doug McCuistion said after the successful Saturday launch.", "url": "https://www.space.com/4165-nasa-phoenix-mars-lander-good-health-launch.html"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Spacecraft Corrects Course", "date": "2007-08-15", "content": "NASA's Mars-bound Phoenix lander completed its first and biggest course correctionplanned during the spacecraft's journey.

It will use a robotic digging arm and other instruments to determine whether the soil environment just beneath the surface could have been a favorable habitat for microbial life. Studies from orbit suggest that within arm's reach of the surface, the soil holds frozen water. \"This is a critical milestone for our mission,\" said Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson, principal investigator for Phoenix. \"Our expert engineering team has completed assembly and testing of the spacecraft. The testing shows our instruments are capable of meeting the high-level requirements for the mission.\" Workers have been assembling and testing the spacecraft for more than a year in Denver. \"We're excited to be going back to Mars,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co., Denver. \"Assembly, integration and testing of the spacecraft have gone very well.

The earliest possible launch time will be Aug. 3, at 5:35 a.m. EDT. Opportunities for energy-efficient launches to Mars come about every two years. Orbital geometries of Mars and Earth make this year particularly favorable for sending a lander to far-northern Mars to arrive when sunshine is at a maximum there. \"The arctic plains are the right place for the next step in Mars exploration, and this is the right time to go there,\" said Leslie Tamppari, Phoenix project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We expect to touch Martian ice for the first time, a real leap in NASA's follow-the-water strategy. The lander needs solar energy, and we will arrive for a three-month prime mission right at the end of northern Mars' spring.\" Phoenix will be prepared for launch in a payload processing facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The first checkout activity will be a spin-balance test May 10 and 11. This will be followed on May 15 by installation of the heat shield and then a separation test. The next major milestones, during the third week of May, will be a landing radar integration test and launch system verification test. The last week of May will include an entry, descent and landing system verification test, followed by a guidance navigation and control test. The rocket that will launch Phoenix is a Delta II 7925, manufactured by United Launch Alliance, Denver. The first stage is scheduled to be hoisted into the launcher of Pad 17-A at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station the third week of June. Nine strap-on solid rocket boosters will then be raised and attached. The second stage, which burns hypergolic propellants, will be hoisted atop the first stage the first week of July. The fairing, which surrounds the spacecraft, will then be hoisted into the clean room of the mobile service tower. Next, engineers will perform several tests of the Delta II. In mid-July, as a leak check, the first stage will be loaded with liquid oxygen during a simulated countdown. The next day, a simulated flight test will be performed, simulating the vehicle's post-liftoff flight events without fuel aboard. The electrical and mechanical systems of the entire Delta II will be exercised during this test. Once the Phoenix payload is placed atop the launch vehicle in the third week of July, a major test will be conducted: an integrated test of the Delta II and Phoenix working together. This will be a combined minus count and plus count, simulating all events as they will take place on launch day, but without propellants aboard the vehicle.

Gearing up of the space agency's Phoenix Mars mission comes as another mission stands down due to weather concerns. The launch of Dawn, a mission to explore two rocky objects in the solar system's Asteroid Belt, has been pushed back to no earlier than September, at an additional estimated cost of $20 to $25 million. If Phoenix launches as planned on Aug. 3, it will reach Mars on May 25, 2008. Once it reaches its target, the spacecraft will barrel directly into the Martian atmosphere and attempt the first soft-landing on the red planet since the NASA's Viking missions more than 30 years ago. Phoenix will use a heat shield and parachute to slow its high-speed entry, and pulsed descent rockets to lower it down safely. \"Entry, descent and landing is a challenge no matter what mission you're flying,\" said Doug McCuistion, NASA's Mars Exploration Program manager. \"Mars has a tendency to throw you curveballs that are somewhat unexpected.\" Of all the attempts to land spacecraft on Mars, less than half have been successful. A second chance: Phoenix is the first spacecraft of NASA's Mars Scout Program, designed to explore the red planet using small, low-cost robots. \"They're smaller, less expensive ... and tend to be a little more adventurous than the strategic missions; a little higher risk with a potentially higher payoff,\" McCuistion said. The total cost of the mission is estimated to be about $420 million. As its name implies, Phoenix is NASA's second attempt to explore the Martian polar regions after the Mars Polar Lander was lost in 1999. It will carry many of the same instruments as that ill-fated spacecraft, as well as instruments recycled from the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. Phoenix carries a robotic arm that can extend up to eight feet and is capable of digging down to a depth of three feet into the red planet's permafrost in search of ice. \"Phoenix has been designed to examine the history of the ice by measuring how liquid water has modified the chemistry and mineralogy of the soil,\" said Peter Smith, the Phoenix principal investigator at the University of Arizona. It is also equipped with instruments to analyze the chemistry of the soil and detect complex organic molecules, a stereo camera to survey the landing site and a laser that will shoot a beam of green light into the Martian sky to monitor weather conditions. Digging in: The spacecraft will land on Mar's unexplored northern polar region. The landing site is located around 70 degrees north latitude. On Earth, this is equivalent to northern parts of Alaska, Greenland and Siberia. Scientists predict that up to 58 percent of the Martian subsurface at the planet's poles is water ice. \"Phoenix will land in the northern plains, touch down and dig down into the subsurface to actually touch this water,\" said Phoenix program scientist Bobby Fogel. \"It's going to get its chemical composition, its physical properties, and try to tell us something about the history of water on Mars and the potential habitability of microbes on Mars.\" The mission is officially set to last three months, but could be extended if the lander manages to survive the harsh Martian winter. \"I'd be thrilled to actually see the ice starting to form in the winter,\" Smith said. \"We're hopeful that we can survive long enough to see ice, but it's probably unlikely.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/4049-nasa-spacecraft-set-study-mars-icy-north-pole.html"}, {"title": "NASA Postpones Phoenix Launch", "date": "2007-07-31", "content": "Friday's launch of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket has been postponed 24 hours.

Current weather forecasts offer an 80 percent chance of favorable conditions during Phoenix's first launch opportunity, as well a second window that opens at 6:02:59 a.m. EDT, Tumbiolo added. About the only weather concern is the possibility of thick clouds near the Mars probe's launch site, he added. The $420 million Phoenix lander carries a mix of new science tools and recycled instruments originally designed for NASA's ill-fated 1999Mars Polar Lander and the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 missions. The planned 90-day mission, researchers hope, will unlock secrets hidden within the red planet's subsurface ice and soil near its north pole, and shed light on whether the region could have once been habitable. \"Our instruments are specially designed to find evidence for periodic melting of theice and to assess whether this large region represents a habitable environment for Martian microbes,\" Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, said of the mission's planned landing zone. Phoenix carries seven primary experiment packages, including an eight-foot roboticarm designed to scoop up martian soil and ice like a backhoe. It also carriestiny, deck-mounted ovens and other instruments to sift for signs of organiccompounds within the martian soil, as well as a suite of Mars weathermonitoring tools. If all goeswell, Phoenix is expected to land on May 25, 2008 in a flat region known asVastitas Borealis at a northern Mars latitude that is comparable to those ofnorthern Alaska, Greenland or Siberia on Earth, mission managers have said. Phoenix'sdescent to the martian surface, which relies on parachutes and a series ofpulse rocket thrusters, will mark NASA's first soft landing on Mars since the Vikingmissions of the 1970s. NASA launchdirector Chuck Dovale said engineers are currently analyzing the impact of adropout in air conditioning around the protective, shroud-like launch fairing envelopingPhoenix atop its Delta 2 rocket, but the glitch is not expected to be a problemfor Saturday's planned liftoff. Originallyslated for an Aug. 3 launch, Phoenix's Earth departure was delayedearlier this week after bad weather prevented the second stagefueling of the probe's Delta 2 rocket. NASA has a 22-day launch window to sendPhoenix off towards Mars that closes Aug. 24. Beyond that, the space agencywould have to wait 26 months - just over two years - for Mars and Earth to onceagain return to the proper orbital alignment for the mission. With such arestricted launch window NASA officials have said they would consider delayingthe plannedAug. 7 launch of the space shuttle Endeavour from KSC to offer more flightopportunities for Phoenix. \"Wehave a three-week launch window, which is quite an extensive period,\"Deborah Bass, NASA's deputy project scientist for Phoenix at JPL, toldreporters Wednesday during a series of interviews on NASA TV. \"I feelconfident that we'll get off Earth and on towards Mars within that time.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/4154-nasa-phoenix-mars-probe-set-saturday-launch.html"}, {"title": "Aiming for Mars: NASA's Phoenix Lander Prepares to Fly", "date": "2007-08-03", "content": "A NASA spacecraft wielding a trench-digging robotic arm is poised for a Saturday launch towards thenorth pole of Mars to find out whether the icy region sports an environment suitable for microbial life.

It's destination: the arctic martianplains of Vastitas Borealis. \"Is this ahabitable zone? This is really a major question for us,\" said Peter Smith, the Phoenix mission's principal investigator at the University of Arizona, during a Thursday briefing. \"One that we hope to answer.\" Observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown Phoenix's planned landing site to be rich in subsurface ice, atantalizing target for researchers tracking the history and role ofwater on the red planet. Phoenix is designed to use its robotic arm-mounted scoop to dig into and collect samples of Mars' surface, then scan them with a host of onboard instruments. But reaching Mars has historically been tough, particularly since the planet is rather unforgiving to small errors. More than half of all the missions sent to Mars have ended infailure. NASA's ill-fated Mars Polar Lander, for example, suffered an apparent early shutdown of its descent rocket engines in 1999, likely sending the craft plummeting to its destruction on the martian surface. Phoenix carries many of the same instrumentsas its polar-bound predecessor in an effort to recoup some of that lost science. \"It's challenging, no doubt. Anytime you try to land on Mars, it's a challenge,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of NASA's Mars Exploration program. \"But the payoffis worth the risk.\" The $420 million Phoenix mission is expected to land on Mars on May 25, 2008 for aninitial 90-Martian day expedition. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California will manage the expedition. If successful, Phoenix's Mars landing next year will be the first soft touchdown since NASA's Viking missions in the 1970s, mission managers said. Sampling Mars: Built byLockheed Martin, the 772-pound Phoenix lander is NASA's first Mars Scout Program mission to explore the red planet with small, relatively low-cost robots. \"We're there to study the air, the dirt and the ice in this northern polar region,\" said Leslie Tamppari, NASA's Phoenix project scientist at JPL, of the probe's mission.

Lining the probe's top, or deck, are more cameras, a wet chemistry laboratory, eight miniatureovens and other tools to determine the chemical makeup of Mars' ice and soilwith a special focus on the presence of organic compounds. Such complex compoundsand liquid water are thought to be among the requirements needed to supportprimitive life, Phoenix researchers said. Each tinyoven can only be used once and will cook just a pinch of martian soil -- about 30microliters -- and then analyze the leftovers. \"When theoven is heated? it gives off vapor just like cookie dough in your kitchen,\" saidthe oven instrument's lead scientist William Boyton, of the University ofArizona. \"And we use that to see what's going on.\" Red planet weather station: Phoenix isalso equipped to serve as the first polar weather station on Mars. The lander's four-foot meteorology mast gives the probe a total height of justover seven feet and carries a series of heat sensors to measure atmospheric temperature at different heights. A small cylinder tethered to thetop of the mast will indicate wind direction, Phoenix researchers said. A laserdetection and ranging tool will beam light into the martian sky, thenmeasure the amount reflected back to track atmospheric particles and clouds. \"I'mexcited about finding Earth-like clouds at Mars,\" Deborah Bass, NASA's deputy Phoenix project scientist at JPL, told reporters Wednesday. While Marsre searchers are targeting a 90-Martian day mission for Phoenix, they don'texpect the lander to last as long as NASA's hardy rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are currently hunkered down to weather a massive dust storm in their fourth year of an initial three-month mission. \"Once winter approaches, we will be immersed in solid carbon dioxide ice,\" Smith said. \"It will certainly not survive that kind of winter.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/4157-aiming-mars-nasa-phoenix-lander-prepares-fly.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander in Good Health After Launch", "date": "2007-08-04", "content": "A NASA probe bound to dig into the icy Arctic Circle of Mars is in good health after a picturesque predawn launch, mission managers said Saturday.

At Mars, Phoenix will face a challenging 7-minute descent through the atmosphere to land in the far north on May 25, 2008. After landing, it will use a robotic digging arm and other instruments during a three-month period to investigate whether icy soil of the Martian arctic could have ever been a favorable environment for microbial life. The solar-powered lander will also look for clues about the history of the water in the ice and will monitor weather as northern Mars' summer progresses toward fall. The second course adjustment had been postponed a week to allow time for carefully returning the spacecraft to full operations after a cosmic-ray strike disrupted a computer memory chip Oct. 6. Experiences with previous spacecraft have shown hits by cosmic rays are a known hazard in deep space. The Phoenix spacecraft properly followed its onboard safety programming by putting itself into a precautionary standby state when the event occurred. Mission controllers then followed step-by-step procedures to understand the cause and resume regular operations. \"Our engineers responded in a very careful and deliberate manner. Since this was a very well-understood anomaly, it was a good experience for the team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. This week's trajectory correction maneuver, plus the flight's first one on Aug. 10, were planned in advance to adjust for a launch-day course that was intentionally designed to be slightly offset from Mars. The offset had prevented the possibility of the third stage of the launch vehicle hitting Mars. Before the Oct. 24 maneuver, the spacecraft's planned trajectory would have missed Mars by about 95,000 kilometers (59,000 miles). Now, Phoenix is on track to intercept Mars in its orbit next year. \"The first and second trajectory correct maneuvers were designed together,\" said JPL's Brian Portock, chief of the navigation team for Phoenix. \"We gain a more efficient use of fuel by splitting the necessary adjustment into two maneuvers.\" The second maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by about 3.6 meters per second (8.05 miles per hour), about one-fifth as much as the first maneuver. Four additional opportunities for trajectory corrections are scheduled in April and May 2008. \"The remaining ones are really for fine tuning,\" Portock said. The landing site is a broad valley at about 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude.

A second chance: Phoenix is the first spacecraft of NASA's Mars Scout Program, designed to explore the red planet using small, low-cost robots. \"They're smaller, less expensive ... and tend to be a little more adventurous than the strategic missions; a little higher risk with a potentially higher payoff,\" McCuistion said. The total cost of the mission is estimated to be about $420 million. As its name implies, Phoenix is NASA's second attempt to explore the Martian polar regions after the Mars Polar Lander was lost in 1999. It will carry many of the same instruments as that ill-fated spacecraft, as well as instruments recycled from the canceled Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. Phoenix carries a robotic arm that can extend up to eight feet and is capable of digging down to a depth of three feet into the red planet's permafrost in search of ice. \"Phoenix has been designed to examine the history of the ice by measuring how liquid water has modified the chemistry and mineralogy of the soil,\" said Peter Smith, the Phoenix principal investigator at the University of Arizona. It is also equipped with instruments to analyze the chemistry of the soil and detect complex organic molecules, a stereo camera to survey the landing site and a laser that will shoot a beam of green light into the Martian sky to monitor weather conditions. Digging in: The spacecraft will land on Mar's unexplored northern polar region. The landing site is located around 70 degrees north latitude. On Earth, this is equivalent to northern parts of Alaska, Greenland and Siberia. Scientists predict that up to 58 percent of the Martian subsurface at the planet's poles is water ice. \"Phoenix will land in the northern plains, touch down and dig down into the subsurface to actually touch this water,\" said Phoenix program scientist Bobby Fogel. \"It's going to get its chemical composition, its physical properties, and try to tell us something about the history of water on Mars and the potential habitability of microbes on Mars.\" The mission is officially set to last three months, but could be extended if the lander manages to survive the harsh Martian winter. \"I'd be thrilled to actually see the ice starting to form in the winter,\" Smith said. \"We're hopeful that we can survive long enough to see ice, but it's probably unlikely.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/4049-nasa-spacecraft-set-study-mars-icy-north-pole.html"}, {"title": "NASA Postpones Phoenix Launch", "date": "2007-07-31", "content": "Friday's launch of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket has been postponed 24 hours.

The 45.9-second burn nudged the spacecraft just the right amount to put it on a course to arrive at the red planet seven months from today. At Mars, Phoenix will face a challenging 7-minute descent through the atmosphere to land in the far north on May 25, 2008. After landing, it will use a robotic digging arm and other instruments during a three-month period to investigate whether icy soil of the Martian arctic could have ever been a favorable environment for microbial life. The solar-powered lander will also look for clues about the history of the water in the ice and will monitor weather as northern Mars' summer progresses toward fall. The second course adjustment had been postponed a week to allow time for carefully returning the spacecraft to full operations after a cosmic-ray strike disrupted a computer memory chip Oct. 6. Experiences with previous spacecraft have shown hits by cosmic rays are a known hazard in deep space. The Phoenix spacecraft properly followed its onboard safety programming by putting itself into a precautionary standby state when the event occurred. Mission controllers then followed step-by-step procedures to understand the cause and resume regular operations. \"Our engineers responded in a very careful and deliberate manner. Since this was a very well-understood anomaly, it was a good experience for the team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. This week's trajectory correction maneuver, plus the flight's first one on Aug. 10, were planned in advance to adjust for a launch-day course that was intentionally designed to be slightly offset from Mars. The offset had prevented the possibility of the third stage of the launch vehicle hitting Mars. Before the Oct. 24 maneuver, the spacecraft's planned trajectory would have missed Mars by about 95,000 kilometers (59,000 miles). Now, Phoenix is on track to intercept Mars in its orbit next year. \"The first and second trajectory correct maneuvers were designed together,\" said JPL's Brian Portock, chief of the navigation team for Phoenix. \"We gain a more efficient use of fuel by splitting the necessary adjustment into two maneuvers.\" The second maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by about 3.6 meters per second (8.05 miles per hour), about one-fifth as much as the first maneuver. Four additional opportunities for trajectory corrections are scheduled in April and May 2008. \"The remaining ones are really for fine tuning,\" Portock said. The landing site is a broad valley at about 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude. Initial in-flight checks of all the science instruments were completed with Oct. 26 testing of the Canadian-provided weather station, which includes a laser-reflection device called a lidar. \"With the activation of Canada's weather station, the testing of the precision lidar instrument and the temperature and pressure sensors, we will be receiving our first space weather report from Phoenix as it continues its voyage to Mars,\" said Alain Berinstain, Director of Planetary Exploration and Space Astronomy at the Canadian Space Agency. In recent weeks, flight controllers have conducted two sessions of heating the spacecraft's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer to drive off water vapor that was carried from Earth in the instrument.

Phoenix scientists hope their probe will recover some science lost from the 1999 mission's failure. \"It's a great day for America, it's a great day to continue exploration,\" NASA's Mars program director Doug McCuistion said after the successful Saturday launch.", "url": "https://www.space.com/4165-nasa-phoenix-mars-lander-good-health-launch.html"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Spacecraft Corrects Course", "date": "2007-08-15", "content": "NASA's Mars-bound Phoenix lander completed its first and biggest course correctionplanned during the spacecraft's journey.

A planned maneuver to adjust Phoenix's course was canceled last Saturday because the spacecraft is on track for its May 25 landing, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Another maneuver is set for this coming Saturday. NASA also released enhanced images of Phoenix's landing site, located at 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude in Vastitas Borealis, the northern arctic plains of Mars. This latitude corresponds to northern Canada, just below the Arctic sea, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson. Below the surface layer of dust in these plains lies a layer of water ice mixed with sandand dust. During its three-month mission, Phoenix will use its 7.7-foot (2.3-meter) robotic arm to dig up samples of this dirty ice and analyze it with onboard science instruments to shed light on the history of water in the Martian arctic and see if the icysoil could support life. In these polarregions, \"there's a very large abundance of water,\" Smith said. \"We expect atremendous abundance of ice in the landing site.\" Phoenix ispicking up where its ill-fated brother, the Mars Polar Lander (MPL), left offafter it failed to make a safe landing in at the Martian south pole in 1999.Though it will use nearly the same landing strategy, Phoenix contains differentinstrumentation to explore the planet. \"Phoenix istruly an appropriate name for this lander as it has risen from two Marsfailures,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The $420-million mission launched last August and has traveled about 422 million miles (679 million km) to reach our red-hued neighbor. The lander currently has about 10 million miles(about 16 million km) left to go before setting down in the Martian arctic. Phoenix is slated to touchdown at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) on May 25. Unlike its rovercousins Spirit and Opportunity (currently exploring closer to Mars' equator), Phoenix will not use airbags to land. Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver. Mission management and navigation were handled by JPL and spacecraft operations were performed by Lockheed Martin. The joint team stayed in daily contact with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network since its launch on Aug. 4, 2007. \"We are absolutely delighted by the successful landing of the Phoenix spacecraft,\" said Jim Crocker, vice president of Sensing & Exploration Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"Years of patience, planning, preparation and teamwork paid off handsomely this afternoon. We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. Most of the scientific study for the mission will be performed out of the university's Science Operations Center. The NASA mission, valued at $420 million, includes the spacecraft development, science instruments, the Delta II launch vehicle, mission operations and science operations. \"I'm truly pleased that we are back at Mars. The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company. Lockheed Martin has been an industry partner with NASA and the JPL for more than three decades on many interplanetary missions that have ushered in a new and exciting era in the scientific study of our universe and, particularly Mars. Beginning in 1971 with the Atlas/Centaur launch of Mariner 9 as well as the Viking missions in 1976, and continuing with aero shell and heat shield development for the Mars Science Laboratory, Lockheed Martin has been at the forefront in the development of spacecraft and systems used to explore Mars.

Phoenix set down on the flat, cracked terrain of Mars' northern polar region aftera harrowing, but successful, plunge through the planet's atmosphere. \"I know it looks like a parking lot, but it's a safe place to land,\"said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, where the mission will be controlled for the majority of its primary 90-day run. \"This is a scientist's dream right here on this landing site.\" Mission scientists received the probe's first call home here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at about 7:53 p.m. EDT on Sunday, though it takes signals about 15 minutes to traverse the 171 million miles between Mars and back on Earth. Phoenix's $420 million mission is designed to test the Martian soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. The instruments include a robotic arm that will scoop up dust and ice, as well as a wet chemistry lab and tiny ovens that will analyze the soil to see what compounds might be in it. But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday. Commands to deploy Phoenix's scoop-tipped robotic arm were uploaded to the probe today, even as scientists poredover the newest images of the spacecraft's Martian arctic landing site. The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said.

The new views revealed patches of smooth, level surfaces beneath Phoenix's thrusters, boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft's pulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice. \"This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil,\" said Horst Uwe Keller, the lead scientist for Phoenix's roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg-Lindau, Germany. Phoenix, a stationary lander, setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three-month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop-mounted robotic arm,as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab. The probe's $422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life. \"We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of theUniversity of Arizona in a statement. \"The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice.

A planned maneuver to adjust Phoenix's course was canceled last Saturday because the spacecraft is on track for its May 25 landing, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Another maneuver is set for this coming Saturday. NASA also released enhanced images of Phoenix's landing site, located at 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude in Vastitas Borealis, the northern arctic plains of Mars. This latitude corresponds to northern Canada, just below the Arctic sea, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson. Below the surface layer of dust in these plains lies a layer of water ice mixed with sandand dust. During its three-month mission, Phoenix will use its 7.7-foot (2.3-meter) robotic arm to dig up samples of this dirty ice and analyze it with onboard science instruments to shed light on the history of water in the Martian arctic and see if the icysoil could support life. In these polarregions, \"there's a very large abundance of water,\" Smith said. \"We expect atremendous abundance of ice in the landing site.\" Phoenix ispicking up where its ill-fated brother, the Mars Polar Lander (MPL), left offafter it failed to make a safe landing in at the Martian south pole in 1999.Though it will use nearly the same landing strategy, Phoenix contains differentinstrumentation to explore the planet. \"Phoenix istruly an appropriate name for this lander as it has risen from two Marsfailures,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The $420-million mission launched last August and has traveled about 422 million miles (679 million km) to reach our red-hued neighbor. The lander currently has about 10 million miles(about 16 million km) left to go before setting down in the Martian arctic. Phoenix is slated to touchdown at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) on May 25. Unlike its rovercousins Spirit and Opportunity (currently exploring closer to Mars' equator), Phoenix will not use airbags to land. Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver. Mission management and navigation were handled by JPL and spacecraft operations were performed by Lockheed Martin. The joint team stayed in daily contact with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network since its launch on Aug. 4, 2007. \"We are absolutely delighted by the successful landing of the Phoenix spacecraft,\" said Jim Crocker, vice president of Sensing & Exploration Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"Years of patience, planning, preparation and teamwork paid off handsomely this afternoon. We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. Most of the scientific study for the mission will be performed out of the university's Science Operations Center. The NASA mission, valued at $420 million, includes the spacecraft development, science instruments, the Delta II launch vehicle, mission operations and science operations. \"I'm truly pleased that we are back at Mars. The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company. Lockheed Martin has been an industry partner with NASA and the JPL for more than three decades on many interplanetary missions that have ushered in a new and exciting era in the scientific study of our universe and, particularly Mars. Beginning in 1971 with the Atlas/Centaur launch of Mariner 9 as well as the Viking missions in 1976, and continuing with aero shell and heat shield development for the Mars Science Laboratory, Lockheed Martin has been at the forefront in the development of spacecraft and systems used to explore Mars.

Phoenix set down on the flat, cracked terrain of Mars' northern polar region aftera harrowing, but successful, plunge through the planet's atmosphere. \"I know it looks like a parking lot, but it's a safe place to land,\"said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, where the mission will be controlled for the majority of its primary 90-day run. \"This is a scientist's dream right here on this landing site.\" Mission scientists received the probe's first call home here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at about 7:53 p.m. EDT on Sunday, though it takes signals about 15 minutes to traverse the 171 million miles between Mars and back on Earth. Phoenix's $420 million mission is designed to test the Martian soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. The instruments include a robotic arm that will scoop up dust and ice, as well as a wet chemistry lab and tiny ovens that will analyze the soil to see what compounds might be in it. But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday. Commands to deploy Phoenix's scoop-tipped robotic arm were uploaded to the probe today, even as scientists poredover the newest images of the spacecraft's Martian arctic landing site. The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach. The teamhas gone back to their original plan of delivering the first sample to thelander's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which heats up samples andanalyzes the vapors they give off, after a glitch over the weekend has beenworked out. A filament in part of the analyzer shorted out, but missionengineers have found that they can use a second, back-up filament to do theanalysis with the same amount of sensitivity.

NASA scientists will now start relaying signals through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which had its own glitch last month. But the good news is that the Lander is fine and digging will commence tomorrow. The Mars Phoenix Lander, after a successful landing and series of tests with its robotic arm, will begin digging for Martian soil samples that it will actually analyze today tomorrow. Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt.

With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago. We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer.\" The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of The University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin, located in Denver.

Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver. Mission management and navigation were handled by JPL and spacecraft operations were performed by Lockheed Martin. The joint team stayed in daily contact with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network since its launch on Aug. 4, 2007. \"We are absolutely delighted by the successful landing of the Phoenix spacecraft,\" said Jim Crocker, vice president of Sensing & Exploration Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"Years of patience, planning, preparation and teamwork paid off handsomely this afternoon. We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. Most of the scientific study for the mission will be performed out of the university's Science Operations Center. The NASA mission, valued at $420 million, includes the spacecraft development, science instruments, the Delta II launch vehicle, mission operations and science operations. \"I'm truly pleased that we are back at Mars. The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company. Lockheed Martin has been an industry partner with NASA and the JPL for more than three decades on many interplanetary missions that have ushered in a new and exciting era in the scientific study of our universe and, particularly Mars. Beginning in 1971 with the Atlas/Centaur launch of Mariner 9 as well as the Viking missions in 1976, and continuing with aero shell and heat shield development for the Mars Science Laboratory, Lockheed Martin has been at the forefront in the development of spacecraft and systems used to explore Mars.

Phoenix set down on the flat, cracked terrain of Mars' northern polar region aftera harrowing, but successful, plunge through the planet's atmosphere. \"I know it looks like a parking lot, but it's a safe place to land,\"said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, where the mission will be controlled for the majority of its primary 90-day run. \"This is a scientist's dream right here on this landing site.\" Mission scientists received the probe's first call home here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at about 7:53 p.m. EDT on Sunday, though it takes signals about 15 minutes to traverse the 171 million miles between Mars and back on Earth. Phoenix's $420 million mission is designed to test the Martian soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. The instruments include a robotic arm that will scoop up dust and ice, as well as a wet chemistry lab and tiny ovens that will analyze the soil to see what compounds might be in it. But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday. Commands to deploy Phoenix's scoop-tipped robotic arm were uploaded to the probe today, even as scientists poredover the newest images of the spacecraft's Martian arctic landing site. The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix sent moreimages of the surrounding Martian terrain on Wednesday morning, including acolor image that it took as part of a back-up command sequence it used when itfailed to receive instructions from MRO on Tuesday morning.

The new views revealed patches of smooth, level surfaces beneath Phoenix's thrusters, boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft's pulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice. \"This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil,\" said Horst Uwe Keller, the lead scientist for Phoenix's roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg-Lindau, Germany. Phoenix, a stationary lander, setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three-month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop-mounted robotic arm,as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab. The probe's $422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life. \"We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of theUniversity of Arizona in a statement. \"The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice. It's notimpossible that it's something else, but our leading interpretation is ice.\" Phoenix pulsed its rocket engines to make a three-point landing on abroad, flat valley in a region similar in latitude northwestern Canada onEarth. The area is in a region where spacecraft orbiting Mars have spottedindications of subsurface water ice in the past, making it a prime digging sitefor Phoenix's robotic arm.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach. The teamhas gone back to their original plan of delivering the first sample to thelander's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which heats up samples andanalyzes the vapors they give off, after a glitch over the weekend has beenworked out. A filament in part of the analyzer shorted out, but missionengineers have found that they can use a second, back-up filament to do theanalysis with the same amount of sensitivity. Missioncontrollers will look at the data from Phoenix's downlink on Monday night andif the TEGA covers have fully retracted, \"then TEGA will be good togo,\" Arvidson said.

The satellite Odyssey, the AP reports, failed to relay a signal to the Lander to start digging after high-energy space particles essentially crashed the craft's OS. NASA scientists will now start relaying signals through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which had its own glitch last month. But the good news is that the Lander is fine and digging will commence tomorrow. The Mars Phoenix Lander, after a successful landing and series of tests with its robotic arm, will begin digging for Martian soil samples that it will actually analyze today tomorrow. Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt.

With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago. We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer.\" The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of The University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin, located in Denver.

The activities, initiated on Tuesday, allowed mission scientists to test the procedure for using Phoenix's robotic arm to stick the four spikes of the probe into undisturbed dirt on the planet's surface. The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere.

Mission scientists planned to tell Phoenix to insert the probe into the ground againand then proceed to take its first measurements on Thursday. As for the atomic force microscope, after making its first touch test Tuesday, Phoenix took its first image from the instrument Wednesday. The atomicforce microscope builds an image of the shape of the surface of a particle by running a sharp tip mounted on the end of a spring up and down across the contours of the surface. It can provide details as small as about 100nanometers, less than one-hundredth the width of a human hair.

Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week.

The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis.

InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels. As the sun sets and winter approaches, the temperatureat Phoenix's landing site will start dropping and carbon dioxide ice willprecipitate out of the atmosphere. \"Asthe seasons move from fall to winter on Mars it's something like 20 to 30centimeters about 8 to 12 inches of CO2 ice forms out of the atmosphere,\"Arvidson said. The colderwinter temperatures and carbon dioxide ice accumulating on the spacecraft willultimately spell its end, because the craft is not built to withstand thesefrigid conditions.

Engineers determined the rasping and scraping activity collected a total of 3 cubic centimeters of icy soil, more than enough to fill the tiny oven cell of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, or TEGA. However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action. The lander conducted these activities overnight Friday to Saturday, Pacific Time, during Martian morning hours of the mission's 60th Martian day, or sol. The Phoenix team planned Saturday to send the spacecraft commands to take images on Sunday, the mission's Sol 61, of areas around and under the TEGA instrument. The images by the Robotic Arm Camera would be a way to check for additional material that might have been released by the scoop on Sol 60. The aim of the $420 million mission, which landed on May 25, is to characterize the dirt and icy layer that lies below it in the north polar regions of Mars to look for signs that the planet might have been habitable at some point in the past.

The team tried two methods over the weekend to pick up and deliver a sample of icy soil to a laboratory oven of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. In both cases, most of the sample stuck inside the lander's inverted scoop. Images returned early Monday showed a small amount of soil reached the screened opening, but other data indicated that not enough had been funneled into the oven for beginning an analysis of the composition. Samples obtained Friday and late Sunday contained material churned up from a hard layer by the motorized rasp on the scoop. That layer is believed to include water ice mixed with the soil. Sunday's attempt to deliver a sample to cell number zero of Phoenix's TEGA instrument used more vibration with a motor inside the scoop and held the scoop upside down over the opened doors for longer than was used on Friday. The team plans to keep gaining experience in handling the icy soil while continuing with other Phoenix studies of the soil and the atmosphere.

A planned maneuver to adjust Phoenix's course was canceled last Saturday because the spacecraft is on track for its May 25 landing, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Another maneuver is set for this coming Saturday. NASA also released enhanced images of Phoenix's landing site, located at 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude in Vastitas Borealis, the northern arctic plains of Mars. This latitude corresponds to northern Canada, just below the Arctic sea, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson. Below the surface layer of dust in these plains lies a layer of water ice mixed with sandand dust. During its three-month mission, Phoenix will use its 7.7-foot (2.3-meter) robotic arm to dig up samples of this dirty ice and analyze it with onboard science instruments to shed light on the history of water in the Martian arctic and see if the icysoil could support life. In these polarregions, \"there's a very large abundance of water,\" Smith said. \"We expect atremendous abundance of ice in the landing site.\" Phoenix ispicking up where its ill-fated brother, the Mars Polar Lander (MPL), left offafter it failed to make a safe landing in at the Martian south pole in 1999.Though it will use nearly the same landing strategy, Phoenix contains differentinstrumentation to explore the planet. \"Phoenix istruly an appropriate name for this lander as it has risen from two Marsfailures,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The $420-million mission launched last August and has traveled about 422 million miles (679 million km) to reach our red-hued neighbor. The lander currently has about 10 million miles(about 16 million km) left to go before setting down in the Martian arctic. Phoenix is slated to touchdown at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) on May 25. Unlike its rovercousins Spirit and Opportunity (currently exploring closer to Mars' equator), Phoenix will not use airbags to land. Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver. Mission management and navigation were handled by JPL and spacecraft operations were performed by Lockheed Martin. The joint team stayed in daily contact with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network since its launch on Aug. 4, 2007. \"We are absolutely delighted by the successful landing of the Phoenix spacecraft,\" said Jim Crocker, vice president of Sensing & Exploration Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"Years of patience, planning, preparation and teamwork paid off handsomely this afternoon. We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. Most of the scientific study for the mission will be performed out of the university's Science Operations Center. The NASA mission, valued at $420 million, includes the spacecraft development, science instruments, the Delta II launch vehicle, mission operations and science operations. \"I'm truly pleased that we are back at Mars. The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company. Lockheed Martin has been an industry partner with NASA and the JPL for more than three decades on many interplanetary missions that have ushered in a new and exciting era in the scientific study of our universe and, particularly Mars. Beginning in 1971 with the Atlas/Centaur launch of Mariner 9 as well as the Viking missions in 1976, and continuing with aero shell and heat shield development for the Mars Science Laboratory, Lockheed Martin has been at the forefront in the development of spacecraft and systems used to explore Mars.

Phoenix set down on the flat, cracked terrain of Mars' northern polar region aftera harrowing, but successful, plunge through the planet's atmosphere. \"I know it looks like a parking lot, but it's a safe place to land,\"said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, where the mission will be controlled for the majority of its primary 90-day run. \"This is a scientist's dream right here on this landing site.\" Mission scientists received the probe's first call home here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at about 7:53 p.m. EDT on Sunday, though it takes signals about 15 minutes to traverse the 171 million miles between Mars and back on Earth. Phoenix's $420 million mission is designed to test the Martian soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. The instruments include a robotic arm that will scoop up dust and ice, as well as a wet chemistry lab and tiny ovens that will analyze the soil to see what compounds might be in it. But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday.

The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said.

The new views revealed patches of smooth, level surfaces beneath Phoenix's thrusters, boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft's pulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice. \"This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil,\" said Horst Uwe Keller, the lead scientist for Phoenix's roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg-Lindau, Germany. Phoenix, a stationary lander, setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three-month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop-mounted robotic arm,as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab. The probe's $422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life. \"We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of theUniversity of Arizona in a statement. \"The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach. The teamhas gone back to their original plan of delivering the first sample to thelander's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which heats up samples andanalyzes the vapors they give off, after a glitch over the weekend has beenworked out. A filament in part of the analyzer shorted out, but missionengineers have found that they can use a second, back-up filament to do theanalysis with the same amount of sensitivity.

NASA scientists will now start relaying signals through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which had its own glitch last month. But the good news is that the Lander is fine and digging will commence tomorrow. The Mars Phoenix Lander, after a successful landing and series of tests with its robotic arm, will begin digging for Martian soil samples that it will actually analyze today tomorrow. Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt.

With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago. We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer.\" The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of The University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin, located in Denver.

The spacecraft also has begun to use a microscope that can determine the shape oftiny particles in the dirt. The activities, initiated on Tuesday, allowed mission scientists to test the procedure for using Phoenix's robotic arm to stick the four spikes of the probe into undisturbed dirt on the planet's surface. The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere. The probe has been used to take these atmospheric measurements several times since Phoenix's May 25 landing in the Vastitas Borealis plains offar-northern Mars. Mission scientists planned to tell Phoenix to insert the probe into the ground againand then proceed to take its first measurements on Thursday. As for the atomic force microscope, after making its first touch test Tuesday, Phoenix took its first image from the instrument Wednesday. The atomicforce microscope builds an image of the shape of the surface of a particle by running a sharp tip mounted on the end of a spring up and down across the contours of the surface. It can provide details as small as about 100nanometers, less than one-hundredth the width of a human hair. The first test of the atomic force microscope involved running the tip along one of the substrates on the microscopy station's sample-presentation wheel to test outthe instrument. The substrates will be used to hold soil particles in place infuture tests. \"Thesame day we first touched a target with the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, we first touched another target with a needle about three orders of magnitude smaller one of the tips of our atomic force microscope,\" said Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Hecht isthe lead scientist for the suite of instruments that include both the probe andthe microscopy station. The imagingshowed a grooved substrate that will be used to calibrate future images. \"It'sjust amazing when you think that the entire area in this image fits on aneyelash,\" Hecht said. \"I'm looking forward to exciting things tocome.\" With thesetwo latest developments, Phoenix has now used all the capabilities of itsMicroscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer suite ofinstruments. This week Phoenix also began analyzing the seconddirt sample to go into MECA's wet chemistry laboratory, which can detectsoluble minerals in the dirt.

The ice is too hard for Phoenix's scoop to dig into it, so the craft used a powered rasp on the back of the scoop to drill into the ice, loosen the material and kick it up into the scoop. Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week. This ice collection trial was a test of the rasping method of gathering a sample. The same method will be used in the coming days to collect a sample for Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples in its tiny ovens and analyzes the vapors they give off to determine the composition of the sample. \"This was a trial that went really well,\" said Richard Morris, a Phoenix science team member from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"While the putative ice sublimed out of the shavings over several hours, this shows us there will be a good chance ice will remain in a sample for delivery\" to Phoenix's ovens.

Mission controllers have requested an extension to the spacecraft's work on the planet's surface, SPACE.com has learned. The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. Dig this: Phoenix has been digging up samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard ice layer that lies underneath for testing in its onboard instruments to determine their composition and look for signs that Mars may have been habitable at some point in its past. If the teamgets permission to extend the mission, they'll likely have at least another 30days of digging, Arvidson told SPACE.com, adding that the team will\"try to dig as long as we can and the resources permit.\" Phoenix will also use it stereo camera, lidar instrument and other meteorological instruments to photograph the surfaceand make measurements of the Martian weather. But theseplans are \"all predicated on permission to have an extended mission andfinances, so that's all being negotiated right now with NASAheadquarters,\" Arvidson said. He didn't know when NASA might decidewhether or not to extend the mission. Themissions of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have alsolasted longer than originally anticipated. The primary missions for each roverlasted for 90 days in 2003. The rovers are still trundling around the Martiansurface more than four years later, thanks to dust storms that cleared dust offthe vehicles' solar panels. What about next year? InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels. As the sun sets and winter approaches, the temperatureat Phoenix's landing site will start dropping and carbon dioxide ice willprecipitate out of the atmosphere. \"Asthe seasons move from fall to winter on Mars it's something like 20 to 30centimeters about 8 to 12 inches of CO2 ice forms out of the atmosphere,\"Arvidson said. The colderwinter temperatures and carbon dioxide ice accumulating on the spacecraft willultimately spell its end, because the craft is not built to withstand thesefrigid conditions.

Engineers determined the rasping and scraping activity collected a total of 3 cubic centimeters of icy soil, more than enough to fill the tiny oven cell of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, or TEGA. However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action. The lander conducted these activities overnight Friday to Saturday, Pacific Time, during Martian morning hours of the mission's 60th Martian day, or sol. The Phoenix team planned Saturday to send the spacecraft commands to take images on Sunday, the mission's Sol 61, of areas around and under the TEGA instrument. The images by the Robotic Arm Camera would be a way to check for additional material that might have been released by the scoop on Sol 60. The aim of the $420 million mission, which landed on May 25, is to characterize the dirt and icy layer that lies below it in the north polar regions of Mars to look for signs that the planet might have been habitable at some point in the past.

The team tried two methods over the weekend to pick up and deliver a sample of icy soil to a laboratory oven of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. In both cases, most of the sample stuck inside the lander's inverted scoop. Images returned early Monday showed a small amount of soil reached the screened opening, but other data indicated that not enough had been funneled into the oven for beginning an analysis of the composition. Samples obtained Friday and late Sunday contained material churned up from a hard layer by the motorized rasp on the scoop. That layer is believed to include water ice mixed with the soil. Sunday's attempt to deliver a sample to cell number zero of Phoenix's TEGA instrument used more vibration with a motor inside the scoop and held the scoop upside down over the opened doors for longer than was used on Friday. The team plans to keep gaining experience in handling the icy soil while continuing with other Phoenix studies of the soil and the atmosphere.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens. So far, scientists are unsure what is causing the samples to clump.

A planned maneuver to adjust Phoenix's course was canceled last Saturday because the spacecraft is on track for its May 25 landing, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Another maneuver is set for this coming Saturday. NASA also released enhanced images of Phoenix's landing site, located at 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude in Vastitas Borealis, the northern arctic plains of Mars. This latitude corresponds to northern Canada, just below the Arctic sea, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson. Below the surface layer of dust in these plains lies a layer of water ice mixed with sandand dust. During its three-month mission, Phoenix will use its 7.7-foot (2.3-meter) robotic arm to dig up samples of this dirty ice and analyze it with onboard science instruments to shed light on the history of water in the Martian arctic and see if the icysoil could support life. In these polarregions, \"there's a very large abundance of water,\" Smith said. \"We expect atremendous abundance of ice in the landing site.\" Phoenix ispicking up where its ill-fated brother, the Mars Polar Lander (MPL), left offafter it failed to make a safe landing in at the Martian south pole in 1999.Though it will use nearly the same landing strategy, Phoenix contains differentinstrumentation to explore the planet. \"Phoenix istruly an appropriate name for this lander as it has risen from two Marsfailures,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The $420-million mission launched last August and has traveled about 422 million miles (679 million km) to reach our red-hued neighbor. The lander currently has about 10 million miles(about 16 million km) left to go before setting down in the Martian arctic. Phoenix is slated to touchdown at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) on May 25. Unlike its rovercousins Spirit and Opportunity (currently exploring closer to Mars' equator), Phoenix will not use airbags to land. Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver.

We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson.

The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company.

But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday. Commands to deploy Phoenix's scoop-tipped robotic arm were uploaded to the probe today, even as scientists poredover the newest images of the spacecraft's Martian arctic landing site. The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said.

New images released Saturday reveal what could be a patch of exposedice beneath the Phoenix lander, mission managers said in an announcement today.Phoenix beamed the images back to Earth late Friday from its Vastitas Borealislanding site in the northern polar region of Mars after using a roboticarm-mounted camera to peer beneath its undercarriage. The new views revealed patches of smooth, level surfaces beneath Phoenix's thrusters, boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft's pulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice. \"This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil,\" said Horst Uwe Keller, the lead scientist for Phoenix's roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg-Lindau, Germany. Phoenix, a stationary lander, setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three-month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop-mounted robotic arm,as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab. The probe's $422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life. \"We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of theUniversity of Arizona in a statement. \"The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice. It's notimpossible that it's something else, but our leading interpretation is ice.\" Phoenix pulsed its rocket engines to make a three-point landing on abroad, flat valley in a region similar in latitude northwestern Canada onEarth. The area is in a region where spacecraft orbiting Mars have spottedindications of subsurface water ice in the past, making it a prime digging sitefor Phoenix's robotic arm. NASA's Phoenix spacecraft is one of three now currently operating on thesurface of Mars. The lander joined two twin robots, the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, whichlanded in 2004 and continue to explore different areas of the planet's equatorialregions.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach. The teamhas gone back to their original plan of delivering the first sample to thelander's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which heats up samples andanalyzes the vapors they give off, after a glitch over the weekend has beenworked out. A filament in part of the analyzer shorted out, but missionengineers have found that they can use a second, back-up filament to do theanalysis with the same amount of sensitivity. Missioncontrollers will look at the data from Phoenix's downlink on Monday night andif the TEGA covers have fully retracted, \"then TEGA will be good togo,\" Arvidson said.

The satellite Odyssey, the AP reports, failed to relay a signal to the Lander to start digging after high-energy space particles essentially crashed the craft's OS. NASA scientists will now start relaying signals through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which had its own glitch last month. But the good news is that the Lander is fine and digging will commence tomorrow. The Mars Phoenix Lander, after a successful landing and series of tests with its robotic arm, will begin digging for Martian soil samples that it will actually analyze today tomorrow. Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt.

With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago. We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer.\" The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of The University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin, located in Denver.

The activities, initiated on Tuesday, allowed mission scientists to test the procedure for using Phoenix's robotic arm to stick the four spikes of the probe into undisturbed dirt on the planet's surface. The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere. The probe has been used to take these atmospheric measurements several times since Phoenix's May 25 landing in the Vastitas Borealis plains offar-northern Mars. Mission scientists planned to tell Phoenix to insert the probe into the ground againand then proceed to take its first measurements on Thursday. As for the atomic force microscope, after making its first touch test Tuesday, Phoenix took its first image from the instrument Wednesday. The atomicforce microscope builds an image of the shape of the surface of a particle by running a sharp tip mounted on the end of a spring up and down across the contours of the surface. It can provide details as small as about 100nanometers, less than one-hundredth the width of a human hair. The first test of the atomic force microscope involved running the tip along one of the substrates on the microscopy station's sample-presentation wheel to test outthe instrument. The substrates will be used to hold soil particles in place infuture tests. \"Thesame day we first touched a target with the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, we first touched another target with a needle about three orders of magnitude smaller one of the tips of our atomic force microscope,\" said Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week. This ice collection trial was a test of the rasping method of gathering a sample. The same method will be used in the coming days to collect a sample for Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples in its tiny ovens and analyzes the vapors they give off to determine the composition of the sample. \"This was a trial that went really well,\" said Richard Morris, a Phoenix science team member from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"While the putative ice sublimed out of the shavings over several hours, this shows us there will be a good chance ice will remain in a sample for delivery\" to Phoenix's ovens.

Mission controllers have requested an extension to the spacecraft's work on the planet's surface, SPACE.com has learned. The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. Dig this: Phoenix has been digging up samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard ice layer that lies underneath for testing in its onboard instruments to determine their composition and look for signs that Mars may have been habitable at some point in its past. If the teamgets permission to extend the mission, they'll likely have at least another 30days of digging, Arvidson told SPACE.com, adding that the team will\"try to dig as long as we can and the resources permit.\" Phoenix will also use it stereo camera, lidar instrument and other meteorological instruments to photograph the surfaceand make measurements of the Martian weather. But theseplans are \"all predicated on permission to have an extended mission andfinances, so that's all being negotiated right now with NASAheadquarters,\" Arvidson said. He didn't know when NASA might decidewhether or not to extend the mission. Themissions of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have alsolasted longer than originally anticipated. The primary missions for each roverlasted for 90 days in 2003. The rovers are still trundling around the Martiansurface more than four years later, thanks to dust storms that cleared dust offthe vehicles' solar panels. What about next year? InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels. As the sun sets and winter approaches, the temperatureat Phoenix's landing site will start dropping and carbon dioxide ice willprecipitate out of the atmosphere. \"Asthe seasons move from fall to winter on Mars it's something like 20 to 30centimeters about 8 to 12 inches of CO2 ice forms out of the atmosphere,\"Arvidson said. The colderwinter temperatures and carbon dioxide ice accumulating on the spacecraft willultimately spell its end, because the craft is not built to withstand thesefrigid conditions.

However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL.

The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Phoenix Spacecraft on Track for Mars Landing", "date": "2008-05-14", "content": "With just 12 days to go until its Mars arrival, NASA's Phoenix lander is functioning well and on course to be the first mission to land in the frigid, arcticregions of the red planet, NASA officials said today. A planned maneuver to adjust Phoenix's course was canceled last Saturday because the spacecraft is on track for its May 25 landing, said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Another maneuver is set for this coming Saturday. NASA also released enhanced images of Phoenix's landing site, located at 68 degrees north latitude, 233 degrees east longitude in Vastitas Borealis, the northern arctic plains of Mars. This latitude corresponds to northern Canada, just below the Arctic sea, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson. Below the surface layer of dust in these plains lies a layer of water ice mixed with sandand dust. During its three-month mission, Phoenix will use its 7.7-foot (2.3-meter) robotic arm to dig up samples of this dirty ice and analyze it with onboard science instruments to shed light on the history of water in the Martian arctic and see if the icysoil could support life. In these polarregions, \"there's a very large abundance of water,\" Smith said. \"We expect atremendous abundance of ice in the landing site.\" Phoenix ispicking up where its ill-fated brother, the Mars Polar Lander (MPL), left offafter it failed to make a safe landing in at the Martian south pole in 1999.Though it will use nearly the same landing strategy, Phoenix contains differentinstrumentation to explore the planet. \"Phoenix istruly an appropriate name for this lander as it has risen from two Marsfailures,\" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The $420-million mission launched last August and has traveled about 422 million miles (679 million km) to reach our red-hued neighbor. The lander currently has about 10 million miles(about 16 million km) left to go before setting down in the Martian arctic. Phoenix is slated to touchdown at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) on May 25. Unlike its rovercousins Spirit and Opportunity (currently exploring closer to Mars' equator), Phoenix will not use airbags to land. Instead, it will rely on a set of rocket thrusters that will fire in slow pulses to slow the craft down during itsdescent, similar to the design for the MPL. The last successful use of this landing approach was 32 years ago with NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s. Mission scientists said that the known problems with the MPL have been addressed and fixed, along with several other problems engineers later identified, though they cautioned that that doesn't rule out unforeseen issues. \"Although we've fixed all the known issues from the MPL, remember, there is always theunknown unknown,\" Weiler said. Ray Arvidson,chairman of the Phoenix landing site working group, said that the team at theUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, where the new lander's operations will be based,will be taking the instruments through their paces in the critical first daysafter landing. \"It's all scripted,\" said Arvidson, adding that Phoenix scientists and engineers haveprepared for a number of contingencies after landing. Such issuesmay include problems with instruments, power failures and obstacles such as arock lying in the way of the deployment of the solar arrays that will power thelander throughout its three-month mission, until the sun sets at the end of theMartian summer. \"The risks will certainly be there, but the rewards will absolutely pay off,\" said DougMcCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program. The Phoenix mission's potential wealth of information about Martian soil, the history of weather ofMars, as well as the state of water in the planet's current climate outweigh therisks of another failure, he added.

This afternoon, the Phoenix Mars Lander, built by Lockheed Martin, navigated a dramatic blazing descent through the planet's atmosphere, positioning Phoenix to dig down and touch the planet's subsurface ice. At 4:24 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, onboard software commands fired six separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft while it was 635 miles away from the surface. That started a series of events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations and from a speed of 12,500 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed was received on Earth at 4:53 p.m. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by an amazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flawlessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"The spacecraft stayed in contact with Earth during that critical period and we received a lot of data about its health and performance. I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" Flight operations since launch and through landing were performed by a tight-knit team in Pasadena and Denver. Mission management and navigation were handled by JPL and spacecraft operations were performed by Lockheed Martin. The joint team stayed in daily contact with the spacecraft through the Deep Space Network since its launch on Aug. 4, 2007. \"We are absolutely delighted by the successful landing of the Phoenix spacecraft,\" said Jim Crocker, vice president of Sensing & Exploration Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. \"Years of patience, planning, preparation and teamwork paid off handsomely this afternoon. We're very proud to have played a role in another one of NASA's exciting voyages of exploration.\" After landing, the spacecraft waited 20 minutes for dust to settle before it deployed its stereo camera, meteorology mast, robotic arm bio-barrier bag and, most importantly, its twin solar arrays. The camera took images of each 6' 10\" solar array which confirmed both were fully deployed allowing the spacecraft to generate its own power. It also took other pictures of a lander foot pad and instruments on the lander's deck. Those images were returned to Earth via the Mars Odyssey orbiter at 6:47 p.m. \"We've passed the hardest part and we're breathing again,\" said JPL's Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager. \"Seeing the images that Phoenix sent back after a successful landing reaffirmed the thorough work over the past five years by a great team.\" The University of Arizona leads this first Mars Scout mission for NASA from its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. Most of the scientific study for the mission will be performed out of the university's Science Operations Center. The NASA mission, valued at $420 million, includes the spacecraft development, science instruments, the Delta II launch vehicle, mission operations and science operations. \"I'm truly pleased that we are back at Mars. The journey feels much longer than 422 million miles. We have gone through challenges and trying times, and now we're going through jubilation,\" said Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona, principal investigator for the Phoenix mission. \"I'm very grateful of NASA, JPL and Lockheed Martin for making this mission a reality and for allowing us to advance the scientific study of our neighboring planet.\" Two NASA orbiters, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey, played major roles in getting Phoenix safely to the ground. Odyssey provided the communications data link between Phoenix and Earth throughout the entire entry, descent and landing phase. MRO's powerful HiRISE camera took unprecedented high-resolution images of multiple landing site options. The images gave analysts a preview of the potential landing sites, allowing them to determine which area was the least risky. MRO also received Phoenix data during its journey to the surface, but the orbiter recorded the data and sent it back to Earth at a later time. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the company. Lockheed Martin has been an industry partner with NASA and the JPL for more than three decades on many interplanetary missions that have ushered in a new and exciting era in the scientific study of our universe and, particularly Mars. Beginning in 1971 with the Atlas/Centaur launch of Mariner 9 as well as the Viking missions in 1976, and continuing with aero shell and heat shield development for the Mars Science Laboratory, Lockheed Martin has been at the forefront in the development of spacecraft and systems used to explore Mars.

Phoenix set down on the flat, cracked terrain of Mars' northern polar region aftera harrowing, but successful, plunge through the planet's atmosphere. \"I know it looks like a parking lot, but it's a safe place to land,\"said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, where the mission will be controlled for the majority of its primary 90-day run. \"This is a scientist's dream right here on this landing site.\" Mission scientists received the probe's first call home here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at about 7:53 p.m. EDT on Sunday, though it takes signals about 15 minutes to traverse the 171 million miles between Mars and back on Earth. Phoenix's $420 million mission is designed to test the Martian soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. The instruments include a robotic arm that will scoop up dust and ice, as well as a wet chemistry lab and tiny ovens that will analyze the soil to see what compounds might be in it. But before Phoenix can start digging, mission scientists much make sure everything on the craft is functioning properly. So far, everything looks good,and over the next few days, the craft will be thoroughly checked out and its scoop-tipped robotic arm extended for the first time. \"Phoenix is an amazing machine and it was built and flown by anamazing team. Through the entire entry, descent and landing phase, it performed flaw lessly,\" said Ed Sedivy, Phoenix program manager at Lockheed MartinSpace Systems Company. \"I'm happy to report it's in great shape.\" The lander touched down at the edge of its elliptical target area, drifting slightly most likely because its parachute deployed 6.5 seconds late. Engineers hope to better understand the delay after reviewing more data from the spacecraft. But the spacecraft's success made it the first powered landing on Marsin 32 years, when the two massive Viking probes set down in 1976. NASA's most recent probes to land, the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, used air bags to cushion their own bouncy landings in 2004. \"Today you had a chance to watch a team that had something very difficult to do and they made it look easy,\" said NASA chief Mike Griffin after the landing success. Phoenix sentits first images back shortly after landing, bouncing them off NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to relay them to eager scientists on Earth. The first image the lander took was of its solar arrays, so that mission engineers could make sure they had deployed properly, since they are the craft's source ofenergy during its three-month mission. The spacecraft also photo graphed one of its footpads, to make sure itwas flat on the ground, which it was. Four images of the landing site were also taken and assembled into a mosaic, showing some of the landscape surrounding the lander. These images mark the first time that the Martian arctic has been photo graphed from the surface, showed a flat surface with just a few pebbles strewn about, which is perfect for Phoenix's mission. \"Underneath this surface, I guarantee you, there's ice,\" Smith said.\"There's ice under this surface.\" The cracked, polygonal shapes spotted by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter currently circling the planet were seen out to the horizon in Phoenix's first views. \"This is probably the cutest polygon that I have ever seen,\" an excitedSmith said of one of the features. But the images are just a fraction of the terrain surrounding Phoenix, andthe camera has not yet imaged the soil closest to the lander, \"so we have notyet seen what we're going to be digging into,\" Smith said. The rest of theterrain will be filled in by the lander's stereo camera over the next few days. Now that the solar arrays are known to be working and the craft haspower, control of Phoenix's operations has shifted over the University ofArizona for the duration of the mission. Subsequent images from the spacecraft will show other systems, includingthe bio-barrier protecting the robotic arm and the meteorological mast. Onceall the systems have been checked out and are known to be working properly,Phoenix will turn its attention to the soil and the layers of water iceunderneath it. \"Only five of our planet's 11previous attempts to land on the red planet have succeeded,\" said EdWeiler, NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at theagency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. \"In exploring the universe, we acceptsome risk in exchange for the potential of great scientific rewards.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/5397-nasa-phoenix-spacecraft-good-health-mars-landing.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Mars Lander to Flex Robotic Arm", "date": "2008-05-28", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is set to flex its robotic digging arm for the firsttime after a one-day delay due to a communications glitch, mission scientists said Wednesday. Commands to deploy Phoenix's scoop-tipped robotic arm were uploaded to the probe today, even as scientists poredover the newest images of the spacecraft's Martian arctic landing site. The new images were beamed to Earth Tuesday evening after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter switched off its radio antenna earlier the same day for a still unknown reason. Despite the communication glitch though, Phoenix is doing just fine, mission scientists said at a press briefing. \"The spacecraft is inexcellent health, absolutely excellent health,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The craft landed in Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on Sunday evening to begin its $420-million mission todig into the rock-hard layers of water ice beneath the Martian soil of the planet's arctic region. It is designed to test the soil and ice for signs that the water was once liquid, and to see if it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life at some point in the past. Mission controllers sent Phoenix its first instructions to move its robotic arm this morning. They planto unstow the arm in stages over the next two days. The arm contains four joints: a \"shoulder\" joint that can move the entire arm up and down and from side to side, an \"elbow\" joint that also moves up and down and a \"wrist\" joint that moves the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The first step of unstowing the arm, expected to occur this afternoon, involves moving the scoop towards the arm with the wrist joint, which will release a spring-loaded pinthat kept the arm restrained during Phoenix's August launch and Sunday landing,Goldstein said. While it seems like aminor movement, \"it's actually a very critical activity,\" said Robert Bonitz,the Phoenix robotic arm manger at JPL. Mission scientistshope to receive images of the arm's initial movements during theirdownlink with NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter late tonight. Because of the MRO antennaglitch, mission controllers are now using Odyssey to communicate with thelander indefinitely. Scientists had planned to use both orbiters throughout themission, depending on which had a better communication angle during aparticular orbit. \"This is a contingencythat we've always planned for,\" Goldstein said. \"As it stands, we're in fineshape.\" Goldstein said that diggingwith the robotic arm is unlikely to start before early next week and thatthe team is working slowly to make sure each stage is done correctly. \"If digging doesn't get done in the early part of next week, please be patient with us, we aregoing to do it,\" Goldstein said.

The new views revealed patches of smooth, level surfaces beneath Phoenix's thrusters, boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft's pulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice. \"This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil,\" said Horst Uwe Keller, the lead scientist for Phoenix's roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg-Lindau, Germany. Phoenix, a stationary lander, setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three-month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop-mounted robotic arm,as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab. The probe's $422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life. \"We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of theUniversity of Arizona in a statement. \"The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach. The teamhas gone back to their original plan of delivering the first sample to thelander's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which heats up samples andanalyzes the vapors they give off, after a glitch over the weekend has beenworked out. A filament in part of the analyzer shorted out, but missionengineers have found that they can use a second, back-up filament to do theanalysis with the same amount of sensitivity.

NASA scientists will now start relaying signals through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which had its own glitch last month. But the good news is that the Lander is fine and digging will commence tomorrow. The Mars Phoenix Lander, after a successful landing and series of tests with its robotic arm, will begin digging for Martian soil samples that it will actually analyze today tomorrow. Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt.

With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago.

The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere.

The ice is too hard for Phoenix's scoop to dig into it, so the craft used a powered rasp on the back of the scoop to drill into the ice, loosen the material and kick it up into the scoop. Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week. This ice collection trial was a test of the rasping method of gathering a sample. The same method will be used in the coming days to collect a sample for Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples in its tiny ovens and analyzes the vapors they give off to determine the composition of the sample. \"This was a trial that went really well,\" said Richard Morris, a Phoenix science team member from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"While the putative ice sublimed out of the shavings over several hours, this shows us there will be a good chance ice will remain in a sample for delivery\" to Phoenix's ovens.

Mission controllers have requested an extension to the spacecraft's work on the planet's surface, SPACE.com has learned. The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. Dig this: Phoenix has been digging up samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard ice layer that lies underneath for testing in its onboard instruments to determine their composition and look for signs that Mars may have been habitable at some point in its past. If the teamgets permission to extend the mission, they'll likely have at least another 30days of digging, Arvidson told SPACE.com, adding that the team will\"try to dig as long as we can and the resources permit.\" Phoenix will also use it stereo camera, lidar instrument and other meteorological instruments to photograph the surfaceand make measurements of the Martian weather. But theseplans are \"all predicated on permission to have an extended mission andfinances, so that's all being negotiated right now with NASAheadquarters,\" Arvidson said. He didn't know when NASA might decidewhether or not to extend the mission. Themissions of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have alsolasted longer than originally anticipated. The primary missions for each roverlasted for 90 days in 2003. The rovers are still trundling around the Martiansurface more than four years later, thanks to dust storms that cleared dust offthe vehicles' solar panels. What about next year? InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels. As the sun sets and winter approaches, the temperatureat Phoenix's landing site will start dropping and carbon dioxide ice willprecipitate out of the atmosphere. \"Asthe seasons move from fall to winter on Mars it's something like 20 to 30centimeters about 8 to 12 inches of CO2 ice forms out of the atmosphere,\"Arvidson said. The colderwinter temperatures and carbon dioxide ice accumulating on the spacecraft willultimately spell its end, because the craft is not built to withstand thesefrigid conditions.

Engineers determined the rasping and scraping activity collected a total of 3 cubic centimeters of icy soil, more than enough to fill the tiny oven cell of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, or TEGA. However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action. The lander conducted these activities overnight Friday to Saturday, Pacific Time, during Martian morning hours of the mission's 60th Martian day, or sol. The Phoenix team planned Saturday to send the spacecraft commands to take images on Sunday, the mission's Sol 61, of areas around and under the TEGA instrument. The images by the Robotic Arm Camera would be a way to check for additional material that might have been released by the scoop on Sol 60.

The team tried two methods over the weekend to pick up and deliver a sample of icy soil to a laboratory oven of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. In both cases, most of the sample stuck inside the lander's inverted scoop. Images returned early Monday showed a small amount of soil reached the screened opening, but other data indicated that not enough had been funneled into the oven for beginning an analysis of the composition. Samples obtained Friday and late Sunday contained material churned up from a hard layer by the motorized rasp on the scoop. That layer is believed to include water ice mixed with the soil. Sunday's attempt to deliver a sample to cell number zero of Phoenix's TEGA instrument used more vibration with a motor inside the scoop and held the scoop upside down over the opened doors for longer than was used on Friday. The team plans to keep gaining experience in handling the icy soil while continuing with other Phoenix studies of the soil and the atmosphere.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens. So far, scientists are unsure what is causing the samples to clump.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

Phoenix's camera and meteorological equipment have shown clouds and fog forming during the night as the air gets colder. \"This is now occurring every night,\" said Jim White way of York University in Toronto and lead scientist for Phoenix's Meteorological Station. A laser instrument that is pointed directly up into Mars' atmosphere has also detected snow from clouds about 2.5 miles above the spacecraft's landing site. Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground. There are noconventional photographs of the snowfall. Scientists knew from previous studies that it snowson Mars. But they've never seen it happening from the ground. \"Nothing like this view has ever been seen on Mars,\" White way said. \"We'll be looking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground.\" The crafthas also seen new hints of the planet's watery past. Meanwhile, mission scientists are trying to squeeze in all the science they can before the Martiansun sets for the winter, including a surprise attempt to switch on Phoenix's as-yet unused microphone. Mission scientists announced the plans for Phoenix's remaining weeks of activity at a press conference Monday. They also revealed information that will help them to \"begin rewriting the book ofMartian chemistry,\" said Michael Hecht, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and lead scientist for Phoenix's Microscopy, Electro chemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed in the northern plains ofMars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars' arctic circle. The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL. Scientists working on Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer are planning to attempt to fill the instrument's four remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples. The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com.

The spacecraft's declining health is no surprise to mission managers, who had planned way in advance for this seasonal change. Phoenix's primary missionended in late August. \"This is a precarious time for Phoenix,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're in the bonus round of the extended mission, and we're aware that the end could come at any time.

This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running.

Phoenix performed the test dig Sunday in a spot just above a dent left by the scoop ofits robotic arm when it first touched the soil on May 31. Researchers dubbed the dent \"Yeti\" because of its strong resemblance to a foot print. Touching the soil and performing this so-called \"dig and dump\" are the first practice steps toward digging up soil samples and delivering them to the instruments on the lander. The instruments aboard the $420-million spacecraft are designed to analyze the soil and underlying layers of water ice to see if the ice was at some point liquid and whether it could have created a habitable zone for microbial life. Phoenix not only scooped up and dumped material on the Martian surface, it also snapped a photo of the stuff in its back hoe-like maw. \"Thesoil is crumbly and there's also some light-toned bits,\" said RayArvidson, the robotic arm co-investigator of Washington University in St. Louis. These\"light-toned bits\" were also seen in the trench left by the scoop.\"We got very excited because we see this nice streak of white material,\" said Phoenix senior engineer Pat Woida. What exactly the white material is is uncertain, though Arvidson proposed one of two possibilities. First, the white material could be salts that formed while liquid water was present. Second, and more tantalizing, the stuff could also be part of the underlying ice layer similar to the smooth bright regions spotted under the lander in photographs, which mission scientists also think could be ice exposed by the thrusters as the craft landed. Researchers christened theodd regions \"Snow Queen\" and \"Holy Cow.\" \"We were so excited about it we called it Holy Cow,\" Arvidson said. The successof Sunday's practice dig and dump means that the team can focus on the next stage of Phoenix's mission: sampling and analyzing the soil. \"That was all very, very successful, so I don't think we need to do any moretesting,\" Arvidson said. The team is currently scouting for new dig sites, which will likely be three side-by-side areas, which the teamplans to name \"Baby Bear,\" \"Mama Bear\" and \"PapaBear.\" The dig targets will likely be just to the right of the test dig,where Phoenix's 7.7-foot robotic arm can easily reach.

Given that the so-called \"white layer\" appears to be the long-postulated subterranean Martian ice, the Lander could soon be tasting the first extraterrestrial water ice ever. NASA scientists have selected three spots directly adjacent to the test dig site in which the white layer was first glimpsed. They have termed these three locations, Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, and as @MarsPhoenix tweeted, \"One of them should be just right.\" The Lander will scoop soil and some ice into an thermal and evolved gas analyzer, which will heat the Martian soil and determine the chemical composition of the sample. If and when it detects H20, which, in liquid form is necessary for life as we know it, it will be a major victory for NASA's exploration strategy for Mars of \"following the water.\" In recent years, the Mars Rovers revealed that oceans probably covered the Martian surface about four billion years ago, although whether they could have supported life remains in doubt. One thing is for sure: any analysis of the white layer will help determine whether Mars could support life.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/2008/06/mars-phoenix-wa/"}, {"title": "Phoenix Returns Treasure Trove for Science", "date": "2008-06-26", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander performed its first wet chemistry experiment on Martian soil flawlessly yesterday, returning a wealth of data that for Phoenix scientists was like winning the lottery. \"We are awash in chemistry data,\" said Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, lead scientist for the Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer, or MECA, instrument on Phoenix. \"We're trying to understand what is the chemistry of wet soil on Mars, what's dissolved in it, how acidic or alkaline it is. With the results we received from Phoenix yesterday, we could begin to tell what aspects of the soil might support life.\" \"This is the first wet-chemical analysis ever done on Mars or any planet, other than Earth,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Sam Kounaves of Tufts University, science lead for the wet chemistry investigation. About 80 percent of Phoenix's first, two-day wet chemistry experiment is now complete. Phoenix has three more wet-chemistry cells for use later in the mission. \"This soil appears to be a close analog to surface soils found in the upper dry valleys in Antarctica,\" Kouvanes said. \"The alkalinity of the soil at this location is definitely striking. At this specific location, one-inch into the surface layer, the soil is very basic, with a pH of between eight and nine. We also found a variety of components of salts that we haven't had time to analyze and identify yet, but that include magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.\" \"This is more evidence for water because salts are there. We also found a reasonable number of nutrients, or chemicals needed by life as we know it,\" Kounaves said. \"Over time, I've come to the conclusion that the amazing thing about Mars is not that it's an alien world, but that in many aspects, like mineralogy, it's very much like Earth.\" Another analytical Phoenix instrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, has baked its first soil sample to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Never before has a soil sample from another world been baked to such high heat. TEGA scientists have begun analyzing the gases released at a range of temperatures to identify the chemical make-up of soil and ice. Analysis is a complicated, weeks-long process. But \"the scientific data coming out of the instrument have been just spectacular,\" said Phoenix co-investigator William Boynton of the University of Arizona, lead TEGA scientist. \"At this point, we can say that the soil has clearly interacted with water in the past. We don't know whether that interaction occurred in this particular area in the northern polar region, or whether it might have happened elsewhere and blown up to this area as dust.\" Leslie Tamppari, the Phoenix project scientist from JPL, tallied what Phoenix has accomplished during the first 30 Martian days of its mission, and outlined future plans. The Stereo Surface Imager has by now completed about 55 percent of its three- color, 360-degree panorama of the Phoenix landing site, Tamppari said. Phoenix has analyzed two samples in its optical microscope as well as first samples in both TEGA and the wet chemistry laboratory. Phoenix has been collecting information daily on clouds, dust, winds, temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere, as well as taking first nighttime atmospheric measurements. Lander cameras confirmed that white chunks exposed during trench digging were frozen water ice because they sublimated, or vaporized, over a few days. The Phoenix robotic arm dug and sampled, and will continue to dig and sample, at the 'Snow White' trench in the center of a polygon in the polygonal terrain. \"We believe this is the best place for creating a profile of the surface from the top down to the anticipated icy layer,\" Tamppari said. \"This is the plan we wanted to do when we proposed the mission many years ago. We wanted a place just like this where we could sample the soil down to the possible ice layer.\" The Phoenix mission is led by Peter Smith of The University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin, located in Denver.

The activities, initiated on Tuesday, allowed mission scientists to test the procedure for using Phoenix's robotic arm to stick the four spikes of the probe into undisturbed dirt on the planet's surface. The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere. The probe has been used to take these atmospheric measurements several times since Phoenix's May 25 landing in the Vastitas Borealis plains offar-northern Mars. Mission scientists planned to tell Phoenix to insert the probe into the ground againand then proceed to take its first measurements on Thursday. As for the atomic force microscope, after making its first touch test Tuesday, Phoenix took its first image from the instrument Wednesday. The atomicforce microscope builds an image of the shape of the surface of a particle by running a sharp tip mounted on the end of a spring up and down across the contours of the surface. It can provide details as small as about 100nanometers, less than one-hundredth the width of a human hair. The first test of the atomic force microscope involved running the tip along one of the substrates on the microscopy station's sample-presentation wheel to test outthe instrument. The substrates will be used to hold soil particles in place infuture tests. \"Thesame day we first touched a target with the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, we first touched another target with a needle about three orders of magnitude smaller one of the tips of our atomic force microscope,\" said Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

The ice is too hard for Phoenix's scoop to dig into it, so the craft used a powered rasp on the back of the scoop to drill into the ice, loosen the material and kick it up into the scoop. Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week. This ice collection trial was a test of the rasping method of gathering a sample. The same method will be used in the coming days to collect a sample for Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples in its tiny ovens and analyzes the vapors they give off to determine the composition of the sample. \"This was a trial that went really well,\" said Richard Morris, a Phoenix science team member from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"While the putative ice sublimed out of the shavings over several hours, this shows us there will be a good chance ice will remain in a sample for delivery\" to Phoenix's ovens.

Mission controllers have requested an extension to the spacecraft's work on the planet's surface, SPACE.com has learned. The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. Dig this: Phoenix has been digging up samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard ice layer that lies underneath for testing in its onboard instruments to determine their composition and look for signs that Mars may have been habitable at some point in its past. If the teamgets permission to extend the mission, they'll likely have at least another 30days of digging, Arvidson told SPACE.com, adding that the team will\"try to dig as long as we can and the resources permit.\" Phoenix will also use it stereo camera, lidar instrument and other meteorological instruments to photograph the surfaceand make measurements of the Martian weather. But theseplans are \"all predicated on permission to have an extended mission andfinances, so that's all being negotiated right now with NASAheadquarters,\" Arvidson said. He didn't know when NASA might decidewhether or not to extend the mission. Themissions of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have alsolasted longer than originally anticipated. The primary missions for each roverlasted for 90 days in 2003. The rovers are still trundling around the Martiansurface more than four years later, thanks to dust storms that cleared dust offthe vehicles' solar panels. What about next year? InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels. As the sun sets and winter approaches, the temperatureat Phoenix's landing site will start dropping and carbon dioxide ice willprecipitate out of the atmosphere. \"Asthe seasons move from fall to winter on Mars it's something like 20 to 30centimeters about 8 to 12 inches of CO2 ice forms out of the atmosphere,\"Arvidson said. The colderwinter temperatures and carbon dioxide ice accumulating on the spacecraft willultimately spell its end, because the craft is not built to withstand thesefrigid conditions.

Engineers determined the rasping and scraping activity collected a total of 3 cubic centimeters of icy soil, more than enough to fill the tiny oven cell of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, or TEGA. However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action. The lander conducted these activities overnight Friday to Saturday, Pacific Time, during Martian morning hours of the mission's 60th Martian day, or sol. The Phoenix team planned Saturday to send the spacecraft commands to take images on Sunday, the mission's Sol 61, of areas around and under the TEGA instrument.

The team tried two methods over the weekend to pick up and deliver a sample of icy soil to a laboratory oven of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. In both cases, most of the sample stuck inside the lander's inverted scoop. Images returned early Monday showed a small amount of soil reached the screened opening, but other data indicated that not enough had been funneled into the oven for beginning an analysis of the composition. Samples obtained Friday and late Sunday contained material churned up from a hard layer by the motorized rasp on the scoop. That layer is believed to include water ice mixed with the soil. Sunday's attempt to deliver a sample to cell number zero of Phoenix's TEGA instrument used more vibration with a motor inside the scoop and held the scoop upside down over the opened doors for longer than was used on Friday.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

A laser instrument that is pointed directly up into Mars' atmosphere has also detected snow from clouds about 2.5 miles above the spacecraft's landing site. Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground. There are noconventional photographs of the snowfall. Scientists knew from previous studies that it snowson Mars. But they've never seen it happening from the ground. \"Nothing like this view has ever been seen on Mars,\" White way said. \"We'll be looking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground.\" The crafthas also seen new hints of the planet's watery past. Meanwhile, mission scientists are trying to squeeze in all the science they can before the Martiansun sets for the winter, including a surprise attempt to switch on Phoenix's as-yet unused microphone. Mission scientists announced the plans for Phoenix's remaining weeks of activity at a press conference Monday. They also revealed information that will help them to \"begin rewriting the book ofMartian chemistry,\" said Michael Hecht, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and lead scientist for Phoenix's Microscopy, Electro chemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed in the northern plains ofMars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars' arctic circle. The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL. Scientists working on Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer are planning to attempt to fill the instrument's four remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples. The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com.

The spacecraft also unexpectedly switched toits second set of redundant electronics and shut down one of its batteries. As the Martian northern hemisphere, where Phoenix landed on May 25, transitions from summer to fall, the amount of sunlight available to the lander has dwindled and temperatures at Phoenix's landing site have been steadily dropping. The spacecraft's declining health is no surprise to mission managers, who had planned way in advance for this seasonal change. Phoenix's primary missionended in late August. \"This is a precarious time for Phoenix,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're in the bonus round of the extended mission, and we're aware that the end could come at any time. The engineering team is doing all it can tokeep the spacecraft alive and collecting science, but at this point survivability depends on some factors out of our control, such as the weather and temperatures on Mars.\" In recent days, temperatures have fallen significantly, dipping down overnight to minus 141 degrees Fahrenheit and only reaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, the lowest temperatures so far for the mission. This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running. Theengineering team anticipates that Phoenix will essentially serve as ameteorological station once its power supplies dip enough that most instrumentscan no longer be run and kept within their optimal temperature range. Missionplanners previously predicted that Phoenix would no longer have enough powerfor any operations by the end of November/beginning of December. But just whenthe lander will truly die is uncertain. \"Itcould be a matter of days, or weeks, before the daily power generated by Phoenix is less than needed to operate the spacecraft,\" said JPL mission manager ChrisLewicki. \"We have only a few options left to reduce the energyusage.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/6043-mars-lander-inactive.html"}, {"title": "NASA Hearing Daily From Weak Phoenix Mars Lander", "date": "2008-11-03", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has communicated with controllers daily since Oct. 30 through relays to Mars orbiters.

The ground moved.\" Boynton leads the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer instrument, or TEGA, for Phoenix. The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients, such as water. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday, June 6, which was 12 days after landing. A screen covers each of TEGA's eight ovens. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. Each TEGA chute also has a whirligig mechanism that vibrates the screen to help shake small particles through. Only a few particles got through when the screen on oven number 4 was vibrated on June 6, 8 and 9. Boynton said that the oven might have filled because of the cumulative effects of all the vibrating, or because of changes in the soil's cohesiveness as it sat for days on the top of the screen. \"There's something very unusual about this soil, from a place on Mars we've never been before,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona. \"We're interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together.\" Plans prepared by the Phoenix team for the lander's activities on Thursday, June 12 include sprinkling Martian soil on the delivery port for the spacecraft's Optical Microscope and taking additional portions of a high- resolution color panorama of the lander's surroundings.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080611.html"}, {"title": "NASA loses contact with Mars lander, ends mission", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "The Phoenix Mars Lander, which made history by finding definitive proof of water on the Red Planet, has lost contact with Earth, effectively ending its more than five-month mission, NASA said on Monday. The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express. Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith said his team must now pore over data sent back by the craft and could still find evidence of past or current life on Mars. \"I'm not sure we didn't find organics. We haven't analyzed the data yet. These are subtle signatures and until we actually do the work, I can't say we didn't find it,\" Smith said. \"I'm still holding out hope,\" he said. \"Its really the question of what is the truth on Mars and we're trying to get the right answer here.\" ", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mars-phoenix-idUSTRE4A97FJ20081111"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months. As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science.

Phoenix's confirmation of water ice below the Martian arctic surface and its surprising characterization of the Martian dirt are among the findings researchers will bebusy investigating further in the next few months. The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins.

The interplanetary flatline indicates that fading, seasonal sunlight has starved the craft of the solar energy needed to soldier on through the Martian autumn. Researchers will keep listening to see if Phoenix chirps back to life, but worsening weather means that the lander has likely reached the end of its operational existence. In its extended five-month mission, the craft finally solved the major mystery about the presence of water on Mars. On-board sensors \"tasted\" the agua in August from melted ice in a soil sample.

The activities, initiated on Tuesday, allowed mission scientists to test the procedure for using Phoenix's robotic arm to stick the four spikes of the probe into undisturbed dirt on the planet's surface. The prongs of the instrument, called a thermal and electrical conductivity probe, are about half an inch long. Scientists can use the instrument to assess how easily heat and electricity move through the Martian regolith, providing information about frozen or unfrozen water in the dirt. The probesits on a \"knuckle\" of the 7.7-foot-long robotic arm. The arm can also hold the probe up in the air to take measurements of watervapor in the atmosphere. The probe has been used to take these atmospheric measurements several times since Phoenix's May 25 landing in the Vastitas Borealis plains offar-northern Mars. Mission scientists planned to tell Phoenix to insert the probe into the ground againand then proceed to take its first measurements on Thursday. As for the atomic force microscope, after making its first touch test Tuesday, Phoenix took its first image from the instrument Wednesday. The atomicforce microscope builds an image of the shape of the surface of a particle by running a sharp tip mounted on the end of a spring up and down across the contours of the surface. It can provide details as small as about 100nanometers, less than one-hundredth the width of a human hair. The first test of the atomic force microscope involved running the tip along one of the substrates on the microscopy station's sample-presentation wheel to test outthe instrument. The substrates will be used to hold soil particles in place infuture tests. \"Thesame day we first touched a target with the thermal and electrical conductivity probe, we first touched another target with a needle about three orders of magnitude smaller one of the tips of our atomic force microscope,\" said Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

Images and data sent from Phoenix back to Earth on Wednesday confirmed that the material was in the scoop and showed that it had changed slightly during the hours after it was collected. When ice is exposed to the air on Mars, it starts to sublimate, or convert into water vapor. The rasp made two separate holes in the trench informally named Snow White, which Phoenix enlarged over the weekend and early in the week.

Mission controllers have requested an extension to the spacecraft's work on the planet's surface, SPACE.com has learned. The $420 million mission has been investigating the dirt and ice of the northern reachesof Mars since it landed on May 25. The mission was slated to last for 90 sols, or Martian days, ending at the end of August. Now it could be extended another 30 sols. Because of the landing spot in the north polar region, the mission can't continue forever. Phoenix uses its two-wing solar array to convert sunlight into electricity topower its instruments, storing some power in a pair of rechargeable batteries. However, Phoenix's landing site is above Mars' Arctic Circle, so the sun isn't upduring the whole Martian year and there eventually will be too little sunlightto power the instruments. But withthe success of the mission so far, and indications that Phoenix will be able tokeep going until the arctic region plunges into the long darkness of winter,mission scientists want to keep going. \"Wethink that there's enough energy to continue digging and delivery toinstruments through at least 120 sols, and then after that, our energy startsto go down, but we can still do operations as a weather station,\" said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. Dig this: Phoenix has been digging up samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard ice layer that lies underneath for testing in its onboard instruments to determine their composition and look for signs that Mars may have been habitable at some point in its past. If the teamgets permission to extend the mission, they'll likely have at least another 30days of digging, Arvidson told SPACE.com, adding that the team will\"try to dig as long as we can and the resources permit.\" Phoenix will also use it stereo camera, lidar instrument and other meteorological instruments to photograph the surfaceand make measurements of the Martian weather. But theseplans are \"all predicated on permission to have an extended mission andfinances, so that's all being negotiated right now with NASAheadquarters,\" Arvidson said. He didn't know when NASA might decidewhether or not to extend the mission. Themissions of NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have alsolasted longer than originally anticipated. The primary missions for each roverlasted for 90 days in 2003. The rovers are still trundling around the Martiansurface more than four years later, thanks to dust storms that cleared dust offthe vehicles' solar panels. What about next year? InNovember, Mars dips behind the sun and out of our view, but will eventuallyre-emerge. \"Hopefully we'll still be alive after that,\" Arvidson saidof Phoenix, so that the lander can continue making a few last measurements, ifthe extension plan is approved. The settingMartian sun will gradually diminish the amount of energy available to Phoenixvia its solar panels.

Engineers determined the rasping and scraping activity collected a total of 3 cubic centimeters of icy soil, more than enough to fill the tiny oven cell of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, or TEGA. However, images returned from the lander Saturday morning show that much of the soil remained lodged in the robotic arm's scoop after the attempt to deliver the sample to the TEGA. \"Very little of the icy sample made it into the oven,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We believe that the material that was intended for the targeted cell is the material that adhered to the back of the scoop.\" Once the sample had been collected, the robotic arm tilted its scoop and ran the rasp motor several times in an attempt to sprinkle the sample into the oven. The final step was inverting the scoop directly over the wide-open doors. A screened opening over the oven measures about 4 inches by 1.5 inches. The oven itself is roughly the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. \"The good news here is TEGA is functioning nominally, and we will adjust our sample drop-off strategy to run this again,\" Goldstein said. Prior to the sample delivery, Phoenix's robotic arm made 16 holes in the hard ground with its motorized rasp tool and the scoop collected the rasped material and shavings left on the surface from the rasping action. The lander conducted these activities overnight Friday to Saturday, Pacific Time, during Martian morning hours of the mission's 60th Martian day, or sol. The Phoenix team planned Saturday to send the spacecraft commands to take images on Sunday, the mission's Sol 61, of areas around and under the TEGA instrument. The images by the Robotic Arm Camera would be a way to check for additional material that might have been released by the scoop on Sol 60. The aim of the $420 million mission, which landed on May 25, is to characterize the dirt and icy layer that lies below it in the north polar regions of Mars to look for signs that the planet might have been habitable at some point in the past.

The team tried two methods over the weekend to pick up and deliver a sample of icy soil to a laboratory oven of the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. In both cases, most of the sample stuck inside the lander's inverted scoop. Images returned early Monday showed a small amount of soil reached the screened opening, but other data indicated that not enough had been funneled into the oven for beginning an analysis of the composition. Samples obtained Friday and late Sunday contained material churned up from a hard layer by the motorized rasp on the scoop. That layer is believed to include water ice mixed with the soil. Sunday's attempt to deliver a sample to cell number zero of Phoenix's TEGA instrument used more vibration with a motor inside the scoop and held the scoop upside down over the opened doors for longer than was used on Friday. The team plans to keep gaining experience in handling the icy soil while continuing with other Phoenix studies of the soil and the atmosphere.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens. So far, scientists are unsure what is causing the samples to clump.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

Phoenix's camera and meteorological equipment have shown clouds and fog forming during the night as the air gets colder. \"This is now occurring every night,\" said Jim White way of York University in Toronto and lead scientist for Phoenix's Meteorological Station. A laser instrument that is pointed directly up into Mars' atmosphere has also detected snow from clouds about 2.5 miles above the spacecraft's landing site. Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground. There are noconventional photographs of the snowfall. Scientists knew from previous studies that it snowson Mars. But they've never seen it happening from the ground. \"Nothing like this view has ever been seen on Mars,\" White way said. \"We'll be looking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground.\" The crafthas also seen new hints of the planet's watery past. Meanwhile, mission scientists are trying to squeeze in all the science they can before the Martiansun sets for the winter, including a surprise attempt to switch on Phoenix's as-yet unused microphone. Mission scientists announced the plans for Phoenix's remaining weeks of activity at a press conference Monday. They also revealed information that will help them to \"begin rewriting the book ofMartian chemistry,\" said Michael Hecht, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and lead scientist for Phoenix's Microscopy, Electro chemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed in the northern plains ofMars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars' arctic circle. The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL. Scientists working on Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer are planning to attempt to fill the instrument's four remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples. The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com.

The spacecraft also unexpectedly switched toits second set of redundant electronics and shut down one of its batteries. As the Martian northern hemisphere, where Phoenix landed on May 25, transitions from summer to fall, the amount of sunlight available to the lander has dwindled and temperatures at Phoenix's landing site have been steadily dropping. The spacecraft's declining health is no surprise to mission managers, who had planned way in advance for this seasonal change. Phoenix's primary missionended in late August. \"This is a precarious time for Phoenix,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're in the bonus round of the extended mission, and we're aware that the end could come at any time. The engineering team is doing all it can tokeep the spacecraft alive and collecting science, but at this point survivability depends on some factors out of our control, such as the weather and temperatures on Mars.\" In recent days, temperatures have fallen significantly, dipping down overnight to minus 141 degrees Fahrenheit and only reaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, the lowest temperatures so far for the mission. This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running. Theengineering team anticipates that Phoenix will essentially serve as ameteorological station once its power supplies dip enough that most instrumentscan no longer be run and kept within their optimal temperature range. Missionplanners previously predicted that Phoenix would no longer have enough powerfor any operations by the end of November/beginning of December.

The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express.

We haven't analyzed the data yet. These are subtle signatures and until we actually do the work, I can't say we didn't find it,\" Smith said. \"I'm still holding out hope,\" he said. \"Its really the question of what is the truth on Mars and we're trying to get the right answer here.\" ", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mars-phoenix-idUSTRE4A97FJ20081111"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months. As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science. With the upcoming launch of the Mars Science Laboratory, the Mars Program never sleeps.\" The University of Arizona leads the Phoenix mission with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin Corporation in Denver.

Phoenix's confirmation of water ice below the Martian arctic surface and its surprising characterization of the Martian dirt are among the findings researchers will bebusy investigating further in the next few months. The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins. NASA announced this week that the agency has not received a signal from the Phoenix lander since November 2. The interplanetary flatline indicates that fading, seasonal sunlight has starved the craft of the solar energy needed to soldier on through the Martian autumn. Researchers will keep listening to see if Phoenix chirps back to life, but worsening weather means that the lander has likely reached the end of its operational existence. In its extended five-month mission, the craft finally solved the major mystery about the presence of water on Mars. On-board sensors \"tasted\" the agua in August from melted ice in a soil sample. Phoenix also detected snow flurries in clouds high in the Martian atmosphere, and revealed a mineral-rich, alkaline soil that a researcher described as suitable for growing asparagus. Scientists say they still have reams of data to pour over from Phoenix's successful expedition, though the ultimate prize - extraterrestrial life - has yet to emerge on Earth's little brother of a planet. But don't let Phoenix's demise get you down. When you take a look at the Moon sometime over the next two years, think to yourself: India has a spacecraft orbiting that! Called Chandrayaan-1, the lunar probe is India's first astronomical mission beyond Earth's orbit. Launched back in October by the Indian Space Research Organisation, the spacecraft reached the Moon on Saturday. During its mission, the orbiter will use its bevy of instruments to scan the lunar surface and will fire off the Moon Impact Probe to - you guessed it - smash onto the cratered, barren moonscape and snap some pictures during its descent. India accomplished this feat with help from the European Space Agency, NASA, and Bulgaria. Seeing all these different organizations and nations working together in the common pursuit of knowledge is an auspicious chapter in space exploration.", "url": "https://scienceline.org/2008/11/blog-hadhazy-phoenix-mars-lander-chandrayaan-satellite/comment-page-1/"}, {"title": "Lander Data Sheds Light on Mars Polar Water", "date": "2008-12-15", "content": "Data fromthe now-defunct NASA Phoenix Mars Lander is shedding light on the current watercycle on Mars, particularly how water moves between the surface and the atmosphere in the northern polar region. Phoenix's Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe, a forklike instrument that can be stuck in the air or the dirt, measured how water moves in and out of the surface as well as humidity in the atmosphere. Data from the instrument shows that \"the water in the atmosphere goes away every night, and at the same time, particularly later in the mission\" the amount of water stuck in soil would go up at night and come back down during the day,said TECP lead scientist Aaron Zent of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"Theseare water molecules that are interacting very strongly with the surface of themineral grains,\" Zent said today at a meeting of the American GeophysicalUnion in San Francisco. Changes inhumidity and temperature alter howmuch water is stored in the dirt, or what scientists call regolith. If morewater is added to the atmosphere, \"proportionately more of those watermolecules end up stuck as films of water\" on the grains, Zent said. The filmsof water stuck between the surface and the atmosphere could be an ideal habitatfor potential Martian microbes. Though there is no solid evidence for life pastor present on Mars, it's such clues of habitability that the probe was sent tolook for. \"Thereare microbes that live quite happily in that\" on Earth, Zent said. Clumpysoil: Phoenix, in part a replacement for thefailed Mars Polar Lander, landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25. That arctic site provided afresh perspective on the red planet. In thefive-plus months it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dugup samples of Martian dirt and confirmedthe presence of subsurface water ice. It analyzed surface samples for signsof the planet's past potential habitability. While thebulk of the regolith that rovers and landers have encountered so far on Mars isloose, windblown dust and sand, the dirt at Phoenix's landing site was \"incrediblyblocky, or clotty soil,\" said lead scientists for Phoenix's robotic arm,Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. This clumpiness implies that \"this material has been processed,\" Arvidson said, andthe processing agent appears to be water. Dwindlingsunlight and light- obscuringdust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov.2. The final cost of the mission was estimated at about $475 million, accordingto NASA officials. Phoenix's observations also show that theregion it landed in is a comparatively young environment on Mars. \"We'relooking at current Mars whereas other missions that have landed on Mars arelooking at ancient Mars,\" Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson, said at today's briefing. The nearbyHeimdall crater was dated to about 500 million years ago ancient by Earthstandards, but fairly recent terrain for Mars. Mysteries remain: Phoenix's wet chemistry lab showed thatthere \"are tiny amounts of salts and larger amounts of perchlorate \"in the surface layer around Phoenix, further building the case for the region'spast potential habitability. \"Ifthis were an Earth environment you would say that there are nutrients andenergy sources available\" for microbes to use, Smith said. Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzerfound that five percent of the landing site surface material is calciumcarbonate, a mineral formed in the presence of water. However, scientists don'tyet know whether the calcium carbonate formed at Phoenix's site or was blown infrom elsewhere. The landeralso observed water vapor clouds, ground fogs and snowforming in the late Martian summer. \"It'sa very active weather environment,\" Smith said. Current Mars climatemodels likely would not have predicted such a dynamic atmosphere, \"sowe're at a time now where we're going to have to reset those models\" toget a more accurate idea whether the region was ever a wet environment, he said.

New trenches opened recently include the \"Burn Alive 3\" trench in the \"Wonderland\" digging area in the eastern portion of the ground that Phoenix's robotic arm can reach and the \"Stone Soup\" trench in the \"Cupboard\" excavation area near the western end of the lander's workspace. The informal names given to digging areas and samples come largely from fairy tales and folklore and are intended to aid the team's discussion of the mission. Phoenix landed in the arctic region of Mars on May 25. The $420 million mission is digging up and analyzing samples of Martian dirt and the rock-hard subsurface layer of water ice that underlies the Martian arctic to look for clues to the potential past habitability of the red planet. \"We expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks, delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures,\" said Ray Arvidson, Phoenix's \"dig czar,\" from Washington University in St. Louis. Phoenix is excavating one side of Burn Alive 3 down to the ice layer and plans to leave about 0.4 inches of soil above the ice on the other side of the trench. Leaving that layer, which lies just above the ice-dirt boundary, will give the Phoenix science team the vertical profile of the Martian surface they want to analyze for a sample dubbed \"Burning Coals,\" which is intended to be the next sample delivered to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. TEGA heats up samples in its tiny ovens and then analyzes the vapors given off to determine the composition of the material in the samples. The last sample delivered to TEGA, on Aug. 7, was to be analyzed for signs of perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance that was detected in dirt samples by the lander's wet chemistry laboratory. Perchlorate could be a potential energy source to any microbes that may, if ever, have existed on Mars. A sample from the Cupboard digging area may be delivered to the wet chemistry lab. Where exactly the sample would come from will depend on the results of digging in the \"Upper Cupboard\" area and results from the lander's thermal and electrical conductivity probe, which is located on Phoenix's robotic arm and is inserted into the icy dirt to test for the presence of salts. Mission controllers also plan to dig up an ice-rich sample from Upper Cupboard and observe the material in the robotic arm scoop to see whether or not the sample sublimates. In upcoming sols, or Martian days, the Phoenix team plans to scrape the \"Snow White\" trench and experiment with holding samples of icy dirt in the shade and sun to see if prolonged exposure to sunlight causes the material to stick to the scoop. The stickiness of samples has been a problem in terms of delivering the dirt to TEGA, because the samples tend to stick to the scoop and clump at the screened opening to the instrument's ovens. So far, scientists are unsure what is causing the samples to clump.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

Phoenix's camera and meteorological equipment have shown clouds and fog forming during the night as the air gets colder. \"This is now occurring every night,\" said Jim White way of York University in Toronto and lead scientist for Phoenix's Meteorological Station. A laser instrument that is pointed directly up into Mars' atmosphere has also detected snow from clouds about 2.5 miles above the spacecraft's landing site. Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground. There are noconventional photographs of the snowfall. Scientists knew from previous studies that it snowson Mars. But they've never seen it happening from the ground. \"Nothing like this view has ever been seen on Mars,\" White way said. \"We'll be looking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground.\" The crafthas also seen new hints of the planet's watery past. Meanwhile, mission scientists are trying to squeeze in all the science they can before the Martiansun sets for the winter, including a surprise attempt to switch on Phoenix's as-yet unused microphone. Mission scientists announced the plans for Phoenix's remaining weeks of activity at a press conference Monday. They also revealed information that will help them to \"begin rewriting the book ofMartian chemistry,\" said Michael Hecht, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and lead scientist for Phoenix's Microscopy, Electro chemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed in the northern plains ofMars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars' arctic circle. The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL. Scientists working on Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer are planning to attempt to fill the instrument's four remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples. The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com.

The engineering team is doing all it can tokeep the spacecraft alive and collecting science, but at this point survivability depends on some factors out of our control, such as the weather and temperatures on Mars.\" In recent days, temperatures have fallen significantly, dipping down overnight to minus 141 degrees Fahrenheit and only reaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, the lowest temperatures so far for the mission. This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running. Theengineering team anticipates that Phoenix will essentially serve as ameteorological station once its power supplies dip enough that most instrumentscan no longer be run and kept within their optimal temperature range. Missionplanners previously predicted that Phoenix would no longer have enough powerfor any operations by the end of November/beginning of December. But just whenthe lander will truly die is uncertain. \"Itcould be a matter of days, or weeks, before the daily power generated by Phoenix is less than needed to operate the spacecraft,\" said JPL mission manager ChrisLewicki. \"We have only a few options left to reduce the energyusage.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/6043-mars-lander-inactive.html"}, {"title": "NASA Hearing Daily From Weak Phoenix Mars Lander", "date": "2008-11-03", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has communicated with controllers daily since Oct. 30 through relays to Mars orbiters.

The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients, such as water. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday, June 6, which was 12 days after landing. A screen covers each of TEGA's eight ovens. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. Each TEGA chute also has a whirligig mechanism that vibrates the screen to help shake small particles through. Only a few particles got through when the screen on oven number 4 was vibrated on June 6, 8 and 9.

The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express. Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith said his team must now pore over data sent back by the craft and could still find evidence of past or current life on Mars. \"I'm not sure we didn't find organics. We haven't analyzed the data yet. These are subtle signatures and until we actually do the work, I can't say we didn't find it,\" Smith said. \"I'm still holding out hope,\" he said. \"Its really the question of what is the truth on Mars and we're trying to get the right answer here.\" ", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mars-phoenix-idUSTRE4A97FJ20081111"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months. As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science.

Phoenix's confirmation of water ice below the Martian arctic surface and its surprising characterization of the Martian dirt are among the findings researchers will bebusy investigating further in the next few months. The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins. NASA announced this week that the agency has not received a signal from the Phoenix lander since November 2. The interplanetary flatline indicates that fading, seasonal sunlight has starved the craft of the solar energy needed to soldier on through the Martian autumn. Researchers will keep listening to see if Phoenix chirps back to life, but worsening weather means that the lander has likely reached the end of its operational existence. In its extended five-month mission, the craft finally solved the major mystery about the presence of water on Mars. On-board sensors \"tasted\" the agua in August from melted ice in a soil sample. Phoenix also detected snow flurries in clouds high in the Martian atmosphere, and revealed a mineral-rich, alkaline soil that a researcher described as suitable for growing asparagus. Scientists say they still have reams of data to pour over from Phoenix's successful expedition, though the ultimate prize - extraterrestrial life - has yet to emerge on Earth's little brother of a planet. But don't let Phoenix's demise get you down. When you take a look at the Moon sometime over the next two years, think to yourself: India has a spacecraft orbiting that!

Launched back in October by the Indian Space Research Organisation, the spacecraft reached the Moon on Saturday. During its mission, the orbiter will use its bevy of instruments to scan the lunar surface and will fire off the Moon Impact Probe to - you guessed it - smash onto the cratered, barren moonscape and snap some pictures during its descent. India accomplished this feat with help from the European Space Agency, NASA, and Bulgaria.

Phoenix's Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe, a forklike instrument that can be stuck in the air or the dirt, measured how water moves in and out of the surface as well as humidity in the atmosphere. Data from the instrument shows that \"the water in the atmosphere goes away every night, and at the same time, particularly later in the mission\" the amount of water stuck in soil would go up at night and come back down during the day,said TECP lead scientist Aaron Zent of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"Theseare water molecules that are interacting very strongly with the surface of themineral grains,\" Zent said today at a meeting of the American GeophysicalUnion in San Francisco. Changes inhumidity and temperature alter howmuch water is stored in the dirt, or what scientists call regolith. If morewater is added to the atmosphere, \"proportionately more of those watermolecules end up stuck as films of water\" on the grains, Zent said. The filmsof water stuck between the surface and the atmosphere could be an ideal habitatfor potential Martian microbes. Though there is no solid evidence for life pastor present on Mars, it's such clues of habitability that the probe was sent tolook for. \"Thereare microbes that live quite happily in that\" on Earth, Zent said. Clumpysoil: Phoenix, in part a replacement for thefailed Mars Polar Lander, landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25. That arctic site provided afresh perspective on the red planet. In thefive-plus months it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dugup samples of Martian dirt and confirmedthe presence of subsurface water ice. It analyzed surface samples for signsof the planet's past potential habitability. While thebulk of the regolith that rovers and landers have encountered so far on Mars isloose, windblown dust and sand, the dirt at Phoenix's landing site was \"incrediblyblocky, or clotty soil,\" said lead scientists for Phoenix's robotic arm,Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. This clumpiness implies that \"this material has been processed,\" Arvidson said, andthe processing agent appears to be water. Dwindlingsunlight and light- obscuringdust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov.2. The final cost of the mission was estimated at about $475 million, accordingto NASA officials. Phoenix's observations also show that theregion it landed in is a comparatively young environment on Mars. \"We'relooking at current Mars whereas other missions that have landed on Mars arelooking at ancient Mars,\" Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson, said at today's briefing. The nearbyHeimdall crater was dated to about 500 million years ago ancient by Earthstandards, but fairly recent terrain for Mars. Mysteries remain: Phoenix's wet chemistry lab showed thatthere \"are tiny amounts of salts and larger amounts of perchlorate \"in the surface layer around Phoenix, further building the case for the region'spast potential habitability. \"Ifthis were an Earth environment you would say that there are nutrients andenergy sources available\" for microbes to use, Smith said. Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzerfound that five percent of the landing site surface material is calciumcarbonate, a mineral formed in the presence of water. However, scientists don'tyet know whether the calcium carbonate formed at Phoenix's site or was blown infrom elsewhere. The landeralso observed water vapor clouds, ground fogs and snowforming in the late Martian summer. \"It'sa very active weather environment,\" Smith said. Current Mars climatemodels likely would not have predicted such a dynamic atmosphere, \"sowe're at a time now where we're going to have to reset those models\" toget a more accurate idea whether the region was ever a wet environment, he said.

A series of commands just developed by mission engineers will allow Phoenix's 7.71 foot-long robotic arm to nudge the rock, located on the north side of the lander. The arm wasn't actually designed to make this kind of move. \"We don't know whether we can do this until we try,\" said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu, a robotics engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.\"The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it. You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it doesn't just slip off the scoop.\" The Phoenix mission was extended last week by NASA to run through December. The lander, which has been on the surface of Mars since May 25, has been examining the surface layers in the planet's arctic region to assess the potential past habitability of the area. If the technique the engineers have developed works, enough area will be exposed for Phoenix to dig into the dirt that now lies beneath the rock. The rock is about the side and shape of a VHS cassette and is informally named Headless. \"The appeal of studying what's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try,\" said Michael Mellon, a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Digging into the dirt under the rock could shed light on the processes that affect the hard, icy layer found beneath the Martian surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug around the lander. \"The rocks are darker than the material around them, and they hold heat,\" Mellon said. \"In theory, the ice table should deflect downward under each rock. If we checked and saw this deflection, that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere.\" Alternatively, if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under the rock, it could suggest that rocks collect moisture from the atmosphere, with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer. Commands to move the rock were sent to Phoenix on Sunday evening so that Phoenix could perform the action on Monday. Over the weekend, Phoenix enlarged a trench close to Headless and took a pair of images of Headless with its stereo camera to provide a detailed 3-D map for planning the arms' movements.

Phoenix landed in the northern plains ofMars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars' arctic circle. The mission, extended once by NASA through the end of September, was extended again earlier this month through the end of December. But it's unlikely Phoenix will last that long. What's next: As winter approaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars, the sun dips lower in thehorizon, providing Phoenix' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convert into electricity to run its instruments. Eventually the sun will set above the arctic circle all together. As this happens, the Phoenix team is \"trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days,\" said Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager, also of JPL. Scientists working on Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer are planning to attempt to fill the instrument's four remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples. The team particularly wants to geta pure-ice or ice-rich sample, said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples, with the \"ice almost welding itself to the inside of the scoop\" on the end of Phoenix's robotic arm, Boynton said, though he added: \"We're still optimistic that we can fill all four before we run out of power.\" Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA, by comparing them to a blank brought to rule out any contamination brought from Earth. While they would be athrilling find, organics would not necessarily indicate life they could be deposited by comets and preserved in the ice, said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, also of the University of Arizona. The lander will also look at the different isotopes in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact, Smith said. As a bonus,mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander's descent. Whilethat use was scrapped, the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to \"tryand listen to Mars for the first time,\" Smith said. \"We'renot sure if it's going to work, but we're going to make a try,\" he added. Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock, dubbed \"Headless,\" that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot-long robotic arm last week. Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock. \"We'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock,\" Smith said. New Martian chemistry: So far, the chemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix's landing site has been a bit different that anticipated. TEGA has identified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past. These include silicates similar instructure to mica, only softer, and calcium carbonate. Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets. The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix is approximate 8.3 or slightly basic. \"almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth,\" Hecht said. MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates, which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact onMars' water chemistry. For onething, they could help explain why Phoenix's fork-like probe has found that \"the soil in our little corner of Mars is very,very dry,\" Hecht said. Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer, he explained. Based onmodels of Phoenix's energy decline, mission engineers don't expect Phoenix to last much past late November. Eventually, the sun will set on Phoenix completely, and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it. That combined with the ever-decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy the spacecrafts components. \"Nobody anticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter,\" Goldstein said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/5910-snowfall-mars.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com. The team also intends to go ahead with plans to attempt to turn on the lander's microphone.

The spacecraft also unexpectedly switched toits second set of redundant electronics and shut down one of its batteries. As the Martian northern hemisphere, where Phoenix landed on May 25, transitions from summer to fall, the amount of sunlight available to the lander has dwindled and temperatures at Phoenix's landing site have been steadily dropping. The spacecraft's declining health is no surprise to mission managers, who had planned way in advance for this seasonal change. Phoenix's primary missionended in late August. \"This is a precarious time for Phoenix,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're in the bonus round of the extended mission, and we're aware that the end could come at any time.

This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running. Theengineering team anticipates that Phoenix will essentially serve as ameteorological station once its power supplies dip enough that most instrumentscan no longer be run and kept within their optimal temperature range. Missionplanners previously predicted that Phoenix would no longer have enough powerfor any operations by the end of November/beginning of December. But just whenthe lander will truly die is uncertain. \"Itcould be a matter of days, or weeks, before the daily power generated by Phoenix is less than needed to operate the spacecraft,\" said JPL mission manager ChrisLewicki. \"We have only a few options left to reduce the energyusage.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/6043-mars-lander-inactive.html"}, {"title": "NASA Hearing Daily From Weak Phoenix Mars Lander", "date": "2008-11-03", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has communicated with controllers daily since Oct. 30 through relays to Mars orbiters.

The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients, such as water. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday, June 6, which was 12 days after landing.

The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express.

As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science.

The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins.

Data from the instrument shows that \"the water in the atmosphere goes away every night, and at the same time, particularly later in the mission\" the amount of water stuck in soil would go up at night and come back down during the day,said TECP lead scientist Aaron Zent of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"Theseare water molecules that are interacting very strongly with the surface of themineral grains,\" Zent said today at a meeting of the American GeophysicalUnion in San Francisco. Changes inhumidity and temperature alter howmuch water is stored in the dirt, or what scientists call regolith. If morewater is added to the atmosphere, \"proportionately more of those watermolecules end up stuck as films of water\" on the grains, Zent said. The filmsof water stuck between the surface and the atmosphere could be an ideal habitatfor potential Martian microbes. Though there is no solid evidence for life pastor present on Mars, it's such clues of habitability that the probe was sent tolook for. \"Thereare microbes that live quite happily in that\" on Earth, Zent said. Clumpysoil: Phoenix, in part a replacement for thefailed Mars Polar Lander, landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25. That arctic site provided afresh perspective on the red planet. In thefive-plus months it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dugup samples of Martian dirt and confirmedthe presence of subsurface water ice. It analyzed surface samples for signsof the planet's past potential habitability. While thebulk of the regolith that rovers and landers have encountered so far on Mars isloose, windblown dust and sand, the dirt at Phoenix's landing site was \"incrediblyblocky, or clotty soil,\" said lead scientists for Phoenix's robotic arm,Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. This clumpiness implies that \"this material has been processed,\" Arvidson said, andthe processing agent appears to be water. Dwindlingsunlight and light- obscuringdust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov.2. The final cost of the mission was estimated at about $475 million, accordingto NASA officials. Phoenix's observations also show that theregion it landed in is a comparatively young environment on Mars. \"We'relooking at current Mars whereas other missions that have landed on Mars arelooking at ancient Mars,\" Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith, ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson, said at today's briefing. The nearbyHeimdall crater was dated to about 500 million years ago ancient by Earthstandards, but fairly recent terrain for Mars. Mysteries remain: Phoenix's wet chemistry lab showed thatthere \"are tiny amounts of salts and larger amounts of perchlorate \"in the surface layer around Phoenix, further building the case for the region'spast potential habitability. \"Ifthis were an Earth environment you would say that there are nutrients andenergy sources available\" for microbes to use, Smith said. Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzerfound that five percent of the landing site surface material is calciumcarbonate, a mineral formed in the presence of water. However, scientists don'tyet know whether the calcium carbonate formed at Phoenix's site or was blown infrom elsewhere. The landeralso observed water vapor clouds, ground fogs and snowforming in the late Martian summer. \"It'sa very active weather environment,\" Smith said. Current Mars climatemodels likely would not have predicted such a dynamic atmosphere, \"sowe're at a time now where we're going to have to reset those models\" toget a more accurate idea whether the region was ever a wet environment, he said. Throughoutthe coming months, Smith and his team will be further analyzing the data andworking in their labs to try and recreate the signatures of minerals from Phoenix's instruments.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6228-lander-data-sheds-light-mars-polar-water.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Phoenix Lander Scoops Dirt from Under Martian Rock", "date": "2008-10-09", "content": "As fall creeps up on the arctic plains of Mars, NASA's Phoenix Lander is using the few weeks it has left to gather as many samples of Martian dirt for analysis as it can. Over the past two weeks, Phoenix's nearly 8-foot-long arm moved a rock named \"Headless\" about 16 inches and snapped an image of the rock with its camera. Then the robotic arm scraped up some of the dirt underneath the rock and delivered a few teaspoonfuls of it onto the lander's optical and atomic-force microscopes. These microscopes are part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and is currently in its second mission extension slated to last through December, though the spacecraft will likely lose its energy supplies before then. The lander is scraping up samples of Martian dirt at its landing site in the red planet's arctic regions and analyzing them for signs of Mars' past potential habitability. Scientists are conducting preliminary analysis of the dirt sample delivered to Phoenix's microscopes, which has been nicknamed \"Captain Hessian.\" The dirt under the rock piqued their interest because it may contain a high concentration of salts, said Phoenix mission scientist Diana Blaney of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. As water evaporates in arctic and arid environments on Earth, it leaves behind salt which can be found under or around rocks, Blaney said. \"That's why we wanted to look under Headless, to see if there's a higher concentration of salts there,\" she explained. Phoenix scientists also want to analyze the hard, icy layer beneath the Martian surface underneath the rock to compare it to other areas on the surface they have already excavated and to look for clues on the processes that affect the ice. The robotic arm has dug into a trench called \"La Mancha\" in part to see how deep the Martian ice table is. The Phoenix team also plans to dig a trench laterally across some of the existing trenches to reveal a cross section, or profile, of the ground's icy layer. \"We hope to learn more about how the ice depth is controlled by physical processes,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Mike Mellon of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"By looking at how ice depth varies, we can pin down how it got there.\" As the lander enters its fifth month on Mars, its weather instruments have detected water-ice haze clouds and snowfall in the northern Martian sky as temperatures get colder with the waning daylight. As sunlight at Phoenix's latitude diminishes, its activities will be curtailed and it will eventually transition into a weather station. All activities will likely cease by the end of the year.

Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told reporters about the weekend's events during a lecture discussing the mission at the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Conference in here on Wednesday. The nearly 23,000 square-mile storm moved west to east around the northern arctic plains of Mars, and weakened considerably by the time it reached the lander on Saturday, Oct. 11. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the planet took a snapshot of the storm as it blew over Phoenix. At the height of the storm, all the dust it had kicked up increased the opacity of the atmosphere over the spacecraft, letting less sunlight through to its solar arrays, the lander's sole source of power. Phoenix's power levels \"really dropped drastically,\" Goldstein told SPACE.com. The hit to the lander's already diminishing power supplies limited what the spacecraft could do over the weekend. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 and has spent more than four months studying the planet's arctic plains. Ithas scoopedup samples of dirt and subsurface water ice found at its landing site and analyzed them for signs of the planet's past potential habitability. The Phoenix mission team tracked the dust storm last week through images gleaned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Color Imager. The imager's research team estimated that after the dust storm passed through Phoenix's landing site on Saturday, the dust would gradually decrease this week, which seems to be exactly what has happened. Before the storm hit, Phoenix was generating about 2,100 Watt-hours each sol, or Martian day, but that number dropped by about a couple hundred Watt-hours during the height of the storm. As of Wednesday morning though, power levels had rebounded back to about 2100 Watt-hours, Goldstein said. It \"was a major accomplishment for us\" considering the dip over the weekend, he added. Phoenix is already generating less energy each sol than it was earlier in the mission because the sun is dipping lower and lower in the Martian sky as winter nears. This storm may not be the last that Phoenix experiences because local dust storm tend to pop up more during fall and winter in the Martian arctic. If other storms hit the lander, they'll further limit Phoenix's abilities to finish filling the ovens in its Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, as well as other activities, before it finally loses all power. The team was able to fill one oven yesterday with a surface sample, Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith told SPACE.com. The team also intends to go ahead with plans to attempt to turn on the lander's microphone.

The spacecraft also unexpectedly switched toits second set of redundant electronics and shut down one of its batteries. As the Martian northern hemisphere, where Phoenix landed on May 25, transitions from summer to fall, the amount of sunlight available to the lander has dwindled and temperatures at Phoenix's landing site have been steadily dropping. The spacecraft's declining health is no surprise to mission managers, who had planned way in advance for this seasonal change. Phoenix's primary missionended in late August. \"This is a precarious time for Phoenix,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're in the bonus round of the extended mission, and we're aware that the end could come at any time. The engineering team is doing all it can tokeep the spacecraft alive and collecting science, but at this point survivability depends on some factors out of our control, such as the weather and temperatures on Mars.\" In recent days, temperatures have fallen significantly, dipping down overnight to minus 141 degrees Fahrenheit and only reaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, the lowest temperatures so far for the mission. This weather brought on a \"low-powerfault\" on Phoenix, presumably a failure that the spacecraft detected and responded to by entering its power-saving safe mode. To make matters worse, a mild dust storm blowing through Phoenix's north polar landing site, along with accumulating water-ice clouds in the atmosphere, has reducedthe amount of sunlight reaching the spacecraft, further hindering recent attemptsto keep it up and running for as long as possible. Phoenix has been operating in the Martianarctic for more than five months, diggingup samples of dirt and rock-hard subsurface water ice and analyzing themfor signs of past potential habitability. Phoenix finished gathering itsremaining samples last week. All of the lander's science activities have been put on hold for the next several days toallow the spacecraft to recharge and conserve power. Mission controllers won'ttry to resume normal operations before the weekend. The abilityto communicate with the lander has not been affected, but the team decided tocancel communication sessions on Wednesday morning in order to conserve power. On Tuesday,the mission announcedplans to turn off four of the spacecraft's heaters, one at a time, toconserve power for the remainder of the mission. The low-power faults late onTuesday prompted engineers to shut down two heaters instead of one asoriginally planned. One ofthose heaters warmed the electronics for Phoenix's robotic arm, robotic- armcamera, and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer, which bakes samples andanalyzes the vapors given off to determine the samples' composition. The secondheater served the lander's pyrotechnic initiation unit, which hasn't been usedsince landing. Mission controllers hope that switching offthe two heaters will preserve enough power to keep the lander's camera andmeteorological instruments running. Theengineering team anticipates that Phoenix will essentially serve as ameteorological station once its power supplies dip enough that most instrumentscan no longer be run and kept within their optimal temperature range. Missionplanners previously predicted that Phoenix would no longer have enough powerfor any operations by the end of November/beginning of December. But just whenthe lander will truly die is uncertain. \"Itcould be a matter of days, or weeks, before the daily power generated by Phoenix is less than needed to operate the spacecraft,\" said JPL mission manager ChrisLewicki. \"We have only a few options left to reduce the energyusage.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/6043-mars-lander-inactive.html"}, {"title": "NASA Hearing Daily From Weak Phoenix Mars Lander", "date": "2008-11-03", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has communicated with controllers daily since Oct. 30 through relays to Mars orbiters.

The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients, such as water. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday, June 6, which was 12 days after landing. A screen covers each of TEGA's eight ovens. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. Each TEGA chute also has a whirligig mechanism that vibrates the screen to help shake small particles through. Only a few particles got through when the screen on oven number 4 was vibrated on June 6, 8 and 9.

The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express. Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith said his team must now pore over data sent back by the craft and could still find evidence of past or current life on Mars. \"I'm not sure we didn't find organics. We haven't analyzed the data yet. These are subtle signatures and until we actually do the work, I can't say we didn't find it,\" Smith said. \"I'm still holding out hope,\" he said. \"Its really the question of what is the truth on Mars and we're trying to get the right answer here.\" ", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mars-phoenix-idUSTRE4A97FJ20081111"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months. As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science.

The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins.

The instrument has eight separate tiny ovens to bake and sniff the soil to assess its volatile ingredients, such as water. The lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on TEGA last Friday, June 6, which was 12 days after landing. A screen covers each of TEGA's eight ovens. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. Each TEGA chute also has a whirligig mechanism that vibrates the screen to help shake small particles through. Only a few particles got through when the screen on oven number 4 was vibrated on June 6, 8 and 9.

The robotic probe had been expected to stop communicating with its Earth-bound handlers as it slowly froze to death with the onset of Martian winter, but its sudden end came after a dust storm cut off even more energy-giving sunlight from the spacecraft. Phoenix, which touched down at the north pole of Mars in late May, transmitted its last signal to Earth on November 2 and project scientists said they would try for three more weeks to contact the lander, but considered the $475 million mission essentially over. \"We are actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to operations at this point,\" Barry Goldstein, Phoenix mission project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told reporters at a briefing. \"We'll constantly turn on the radio and try to hail Phoenix and see if it's alive, but at this point nobody on the team has any expectations of that happening,\" he said. Conceived in 2002 and launched in August 2007, the spacecraft touched down on May 25 on a frozen Martian desert to search for water and assess conditions for the possibility of sustaining life. STILL SEARCHING FOR LIFE: Phoenix has since recorded snowfall, scraped up bits of ice and found that Martian dust chemically resembled seawater on Earth -- adding to evidence that liquid water capable perhaps of supporting life once flowed on the planet's surface. In July, NASA scientists announced that Phoenix had \"touched and tasted\" water on the surface of Mars, containing years of speculation about the existence of water on the planet. The probe also returned more than 25,000 pictures. By late October, Phoenix had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by two months. Mission controllers shut down some of the lander's heaters and instruments last month to conserve its energy. Phoenix was only the sixth space probe to land successfully on Mars and the first spacecraft to touch down safely at one of the planet's polar regions. The demise of Phoenix leaves NASA with two other functioning probes on the planet's surface -- the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived weeks apart in January 2004 to begin their own geologic expeditions. They, too, are well past their original three-month life expectancy. Three satellite probes are orbiting the planet -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey and the European Space Agency's Mars Express. Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith said his team must now pore over data sent back by the craft and could still find evidence of past or current life on Mars. \"I'm not sure we didn't find organics. We haven't analyzed the data yet. These are subtle signatures and until we actually do the work, I can't say we didn't find it,\" Smith said. \"I'm still holding out hope,\" he said. \"Its really the question of what is the truth on Mars and we're trying to get the right answer here.\" ", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mars-phoenix-idUSTRE4A97FJ20081111"}, {"title": "Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet", "date": "2008-11-10", "content": "NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months. As anticipated, seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander's instruments. Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2. Phoenix, in addition to shorter daylight, has encountered a dustier sky, more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn. The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data. The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home. However, engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars. While the spacecraft's work has ended, the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages. \"Phoenix has given us some surprises, and I'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come,\" said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Launched Aug. 4, 2007, Phoenix landed May 25, 2008, farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface. The lander dug, scooped, baked, sniffed and tasted the Red Planet's soil. Among early results, it verified the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, which NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002. Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. \"Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely, it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team,\" said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes. Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life; discovering perchlorate salt, which has implications for ice and soil properties; and finding calcium carbonate, a marker of effects of liquid water. Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars. These findings include excavating soil above the ice table, revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits; observing snow descending from clouds; providing a mission-long weather record, with data on temperature, pressure, humidity and wind; observations of haze, clouds, frost and whirlwinds; and coordinating with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather. \"Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science.

Phoenix's confirmation of water ice below the Martian arctic surface and its surprising characterization of the Martian dirt are among the findings researchers will bebusy investigating further in the next few months. The Phoenix mission will also help inform future missions to Mars, including the upcoming MAVEN orbiter mission and the planned Mars Science Laboratory rover. Beginning to end: Phoenix landed in the Vastitas Borealis plains of Mars on May 25 to the jubilant cheers of mission controllers. In the five-plusmonths it spent alive at its landing site, the spacecraft dug up samples of Martian dirt and subsurface water ice and analyzed them for signs of the planet'spast potential habitability. Yesterday NASA announced that themission, whose final cost was about $475 million, was effectively over. Dwindling sunlight and light-obscuring dust in the atmosphere finally pushed Phoenix below its power threshold on Nov. 2. \"It'srather tough living up north above the article circle, so we always knew thatthe end would be coming near for us,\" said Phoenix project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Phoenix's demise, while expected to come with diminishing light and plummeting temperatures, occurred a few weeks sooner than engineers had hoped, largely due to the poor weather at itslanding site. But even with its early death, Phoenix went above and beyond itsprimary mission goals, which were achieved by the end of its original three-month mission in August. \"The vehicle has achieved all of its science goals and then some, and I've thinkwe have had a huge success,\" Goldstein said. Phoenix's findings: The biggest success of the mission was to confirm the presence of water ice under thesurface of the Martian arctic, which had first been detected by the Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002, though that discovery didn't come right away. \"When we landed, we looked around, we saw a field of dirt and rocks that was spreadout to the horizon, and we didn't see ice right away, it wasn't until we looked underthe spacecraft that we found out we were standing on it, and this was quitea thrill for everybody,\" said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith ofthe University of Arizona in Tucson. Over thecourse of the mission, Smith and his team used Phoenix's robotic arm and analysis instruments to scrape, poke, prod and characterize this rock-hard icelayer. \"We've excavated to the ice, we know its depth, we know how it changes over the surface, we've seen different types of ice,\" Smith said, adding that the analysis of the ice isn't over. In digging down to the subsurface ice layer, Phoenix also scooped up samples of the overlying dirt and analyzed them in its microscopes, wet chemistry lab and Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer. These analyses led to some surprising findings. Unlike other landers and rovers that have detected acidic dirt with plenty of sulfates, indicative of volcanic activity. Phoenix found the dirt at its landing site was alkaline with lots of carbonates and clay minerals, the later of whichtypically form when liquid water is around. \"Onthe Earth, we would conclude immediately that there was liquid water in thissoil for Mars we have to be a little more careful, and we're going to developthis story as we can, as we interpret our data,\" Smith said. \"Butdefinitely liquid water has been a part of this soil\" in the past. The dirtsamples also showed evidence of salts and perchlorate .Perchlorate was \"totally unexpected,\" Smith said, and \"hasprofound implications for Mars,\" because it can act as a potential energysource for microbes. Life? \"Andthat leads to the question, is this a habitable zone? Have we found such athing on Mars?\" Smith said. The analysis the team will carry out now willaim to help answer those questions, he said. Such research could set the stagefor future missions that might actually look for biology on the red planet. Phoenix also took roughly 25,000 picturesduring its tenure on Mars, from complete 360-degree panoramas to close-up peeksat the ice in trenches it dug. The landeralso took weather measurements, including pressure, temperature, winds, and humidity. \"We'vegot a complete weather record for the entire time we were there,\" Smithsaid, adding that it was \"one of the major accomplishments of the mission.\" Towards theend of the mission, the team even saw frost forming on the surface and snowfalling from the sky. \"Thisis really unexpected, and I think a first to see it, especially from thesurface,\" Smith said. Thoughmission team members were disappointed by the lander's premature demise, theylooked forward to the information it would bring them on Mars. \"Whilewe're losing a spacecraft, it's really an Irish wake rather than a funeralwe're looking forward to here,\" said Dough McCuistion, director of theMars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"Weshould celebrate what Phoenix has done, what the Phoenix team has done, andwhere it's going to take us in the future.\" Future Mars exploration*: Up next forMars are the planned Mars Science Laboratory mission, currently still slatedfor a 2009 launch, and the next member of the Scout mission the MAVEN orbiter. MAVEN willexamine the upper and middle atmosphere of Mars to understand how materials,especially water, escape from the planet's gravitational pull. Understandingthis link of Mars' water cycle will help scientists \"to understand whatthe history of liquid water on the surface of Mars may have been in the past,\"McCuistion said. Phoenix's success \"has really set astandard for future Scout missions,\" he added. Even withits success, Phoenix ran into its share of snags. \"A lot of lessons were learned in this mission,\" McCuistion said. The unexpectedstickiness of the Martian dirt made it difficult to deliver samples to thelander's instruments, as they would get stuck in openings and to the roboticarm's scoop. \"Welearned a lot about handling of soils, soil consistency and how difficult itcan be,\" McCuistion said. Along thoselines, the team learned \"how difficult it is to handle ice when itsublimes quickly in the atmosphere,\" he added. Butoverall, NASA was pleased with the Phoenix mission and its accomplishments, aswere the members of the team who planned, built, and operated the lander. \"I'mjust thrilled to death with what we've been able to do here,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6091-mars-lander-legacy.html"}, {"title": "Phoenix lander goes quiet as India shoots the Moon", "date": "2008-11-13", "content": "As one space mission ends, another begins.

Mysteries remain: Phoenix's wet chemistry lab showed thatthere \"are tiny amounts of salts and larger amounts of perchlorate \"in the surface layer around Phoenix, further building the case for the region'spast potential habitability. \"Ifthis were an Earth environment you would say that there are nutrients andenergy sources available\" for microbes to use, Smith said. Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzerfound that five percent of the landing site surface material is calciumcarbonate, a mineral formed in the presence of water. However, scientists don'tyet know whether the calcium carbonate formed at Phoenix's site or was blown infrom elsewhere. The landeralso observed water vapor clouds, ground fogs and snowforming in the late Martian summer. \"It'sa very active weather environment,\" Smith said. Current Mars climatemodels likely would not have predicted such a dynamic atmosphere, \"sowe're at a time now where we're going to have to reset those models\" toget a more accurate idea whether the region was ever a wet environment, he said. Throughoutthe coming months, Smith and his team will be further analyzing the data andworking in their labs to try and recreate the signatures of minerals from Phoenix's instruments.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6228-lander-data-sheds-light-mars-polar-water.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "The Dirt on Mars Lander Soil Findings", "date": "2009-07-02", "content": "Gullies, channels and other features on the martian surface have long suggested that water flowed across red planet long ago. But a growing number of observations show frozen water is there now. The findings of NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander, announced throughout the mission, are now detailed in a set offour papers in the July 3 issue of the journal Science. They are thefirst to describe the northern most reaches of the red planet and shed light onthe history of water on Mars, as well as the planet's potential habitability. Among the most significant finding from Phoenix, which landed on the red planet May 25, 2008: a layer of rock-hard water ice just a few inches beneath the surface ofthe dusty arctic plains. Phoenix unearthed other surprises: The Martian dirt at Phoenix's landing site proved to be unexpectedly clumpy andcontained some compounds that set it apart from the sites where the lander'srover cousins have been investigating. Water confirmed: Phoenix was sent to the Vastitas Borealisplains of Mars in part to confirm observations from NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter that showed signatures of water ice beneath thesurface of the region. Using its robotic arm, Phoenix dug into the Martian surface to see if it could reach theice below. In onetrench, dubbed \"Dodo-Goldilocks,\" the lander exposed what missionscientists described as \"bright material\" about 4 to 5 centimetersbelow the surface. Over the next two months, theteam watched as Phoenix's cameras showed that the material was sublimatingaway, which would be expected of water ice exposed to the Martian atmosphere. Thetendency of soil samples scooped up by the lander to clump together made itdifficult to get the samples into Phoenix's onboard instruments, but afterseveral attempts, a sample was coaxed in and the lander's detectors confirmedthat there was indeed water ice hiding under the regolith. The confirmation was originallyannounced on July 31. Interestingly,the ice seems to occur at different depths under the surface depending on theterrain. The plains where Phoenix landed feature polygonal mounds surrounded bytroughs that result from the seasonal expansion and contraction of the iceunderneath the surface, which creates cracks and crevices. The icebelow the center of the mounds was fairly shallow, \"but in the troughs inbetween, we went down as much as eight inches and never did find the iceunderneath,\" said the mission's principal investigator Peter Smith, of the University of Arizona. Just howthe ice got there is still not known, though researchers have a few theories. \"Itcould have been the remnant of a larger polar ice cap that shrank; could havebeen a frozen ocean; could have been a snowfall frozen into the ground,\"Smith said. \"The most likely theory is that water vapor from theatmosphere slowly diffused into the surface and froze at the level where thetemperature matches the frost point.\" Surprising soil: Just asinteresting as the water ice itself are the chemical signs in the soil thatliquid water interacted with the soil in the past. Phoenix's instrument detected a range ofcompounds and elements in the soil, but two were of particular interest becausethey imply reaction of the dirt with water. Calciumcarbonate was detected by Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer ,which heated up samples and then analyzed the gases coming off them. Conditionson early Mars were expected to be ideal for the formation of carbonates, butfew have been detected by orbiters or surface missions to the red planet. Thecalcium carbonate, which makes up only about 3 to 5 percent of the soil byweight at Phoenix's site, likely formed in the past when carbon dioxide in theatmosphere interacted with films of water on soil particles. Thecarbonate also acts as a buffer that gives the soil an alkaline pH ,a marked contrast from the acidic soils seen in other Martian locations. Analkaline soil environment is also interesting because it is similar to that ofmany habitable environments, for example, Earth's oceans. The otherchemical standout was a compoundcalled perchlorate, a highly oxidizing substance. \"Perchloratewas not predicted at this landing site and nobody had it on their list oflikely chemicals,\" Smith said. \"There was a very high concentrationof it, higher than the salts we might have expected like sodium chlorate .\" Perchlorateis an interesting find because it has \"a strong affinity for water,\"Smith said, adding: \"On Earth, microbes use it as a chemical energysource.\" Thesefindings will help inform scientists' understanding of Mars' past and provideevidence of a place where any potential life could have thrived. \"Who knows? Evolution is a powerful force. If life ever started on Mars, there areniches where it could still survive,\" Smith said.", "url": "https://www.space.com/6918-dirt-mars-lander-soil-findings.html"}]}]
