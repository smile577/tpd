LCS is a fast, agile, focused-mission ship designed to defeat asymmetric \"anti-access\" threats such as mines, quiet diesel submarines and fast surface craft. The 378-foot Freedom is being designed and built by a Lockheed Martin-led industry team. \"Getting Freedom underway is a significant step in the ship's steady progress toward entering the fleet,\" said LCS Program Manager Capt. James Murdoch. \"Freedom has overcome many challenges to reach this important milestone. LCS 1 will add tremendous capabilities to the fleet for our Sailors.\" Builder's trials test the vessel's propulsion, communications, navigation and mission systems, as well as all related support systems. Following the completion of builder's trials, Freedom will return to Marinette Marine to prepare for acceptance trials that will be conducted by the U.S. Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey. The LCS 1 Freedom class consists of two different hullforms - a semiplaning monohull and an aluminum trimaran - designed and built by two industry teams, respectively led by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. The seaframes will be outfitted with reconfigurable payloads, called mission packages, which can be changed out quickly. These mission packages focus on three mission areas: mine counter measures, surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. LCS 1 is scheduled to be delivered to the Navy later this year and will be homeported in San Diego.", "url": "https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/07/mil-080729-nns04.htm"}, {"title": "Navy Accepts Delivery of Future USS Freedom", "date": "2008-09-18", "content": "Supervisor of Shipbuilding Gulf Coast officially accepted delivery of Freedom (LCS 1) on behalf of the Navy from the Lockheed Martin/Marinette Marine/Gibbs and Cox team in Marinette, Wis., Sept. 18. \"This is a truly exciting day for the Navy.

With acceptance by the Navy, the LCS crew will move aboard and prepare the ship to depart Marinette Marine for Milwaukee, the location of the ship's commissioning. Upon commissioning, the ship will sail out of the Great Lakes and down the East Coast for Norfolk, Va., making a number of port calls along the way. Prior to delivery, the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) conducted acceptance trials aboard LCS 1 Aug. 17-21. INSURV found the ship to be \"capable, well-built and inspection-ready\" and recommended that the Chief of Naval Operations authorize delivery of the ship. Because the trials were conducted in Lake Michigan, some ship systems, including aviation and combat systems, could not be demonstrated. Systems not demonstrated during recent trials will be presented to INSURV in early 2009 trials in Norfolk and in the open ocean.

Specifically: Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) must be tested at a sufficient distance from land, which was not possible in the Great Lakes; Treaty Limitations prevent ordnance firings in the Great Lakes region, preventing live fire,\" Doss said. \"The zero overboard discharge requirements in the Great Lakes prevented complete demonstration of AFFF, Sewage, Oily Waste, and Gray Water systems; Certain demonstrations cannot be suitably performed in fresh water, such as Cathodic Protection, Degaussing, and Reverse Osmosis Units.\" In addition to these tests, select systems that were not evaluated during the first acceptance trials, such as aviation support, launch handling and recovery, fin stabilizers, extended full power trial, will also be demonstrated, he added. The Navy had hoped to complete this second round of acceptance trials in April. However, an issue with the number three ship service diesel generator delayed the test period to this week, Doss said.

Gary Roughead directed both the his staff and U.S. Fleet Forces Command to look at an early, short-term deployment for Freedom (Defense Daily, June 15). Besides determining the feasibility of deploying Freedom earlier than envisioned, the study also examined distance support and where the mission modules would be swapped out, if the Navy decided to do that.

Cmdr. Philip Rosi, a U.S. Fleet Forces spokesman, told Defense Daily yesterday. In addition to the surface warfare package, Freedom will also carry a prototype maritime security module with visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) capability, Rosi added. That prototype module will have at least one manned rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capability, he said. Before her deployment, Freedom will have to be certified for maritime security surge, Rosi said.

As with every lead ship of a class, the operational testing and validation of the ship's sensors and weapon systems is a complex and time-consuming series of events that are normally conducted sequentially over an extended time period. The Navy expects to learn key operational lessons about Freedom in a deployment setting and to integrate those lessons into the larger LCS fleet integration process. To achieve this goal, the Navy modified the typical workup schedule to accelerate Freedom's deployment by approximately two years. The Fleet Response Training Plan, used to evaluate a ship's operational capabilities as well as maintenance, testing and training, was modified to ensure effective training for this unique and highly capable ship with reduced manning and two crews. In a plan developed by Commander, U.S. 2nd Fleet; Commander, Naval Surface Forces/Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic; Commander, Naval Network Warfare Command; Commander, Strike Force Training (CSFTL) Atlantic; LCS Class Squadron (LCSRON); Afloat Training Group, Pacific; Naval Sea Systems Command; Naval Air Systems Command; and Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force; the Post-Delivery Maintenance and System Testing activities were interwoven with unit and integrated, advanced level training. In the past, test events were rigidly structured and scripted to validate system performance. As much as possible, these were modified to simultaneously fulfill operational training requirements with no compromise to performance standards. \"Because of the LCS multi-crewing concept, two core crews needed to be trained and assessed aboard Freedom, and that added another new dimension to our standard surface ship training and certification plan,\" said Capt. Michael Taylor, commander, LCSRON. \"During testing and much of the unit level training, both the 'on-hull' crew and some members of the 'off-hull' crew were on board, and that gave both crews a chance to gain experience and proficiency on Freedom's systems.\" During most of the Integrated/Advanced Phase Training and Assessment, only a single core crew and embarked detachments could be evaluated at one time across the range of military operations. The primary focus was on the Gold Crew, which will deploy with the ship for the first portion of the deployment. After avoiding heavy weather off the East Coast, Freedom departed Mayport, Fla., Nov. 13 with the Blue Crew and Cmdr. Kristy Doyle, the Blue Crew commanding officer. During the three days that followed, CSFTL assessors put the crew through an intensive series of underway scenarios designed to evaluate their ability to execute maritime security missions both as an independent unit and as part of a larger force. CSFTL presented Freedom with realistic missions in rapid succession to stress planning and decision-making. From self-defense against air and surface threats, to maritime interception operations, electronic warfare, common tactical picture management and datalink operations, the team performed well and met every challenge. Freedom returned to Naval Station Mayport for a \"hot swap\" between the Blue Crew and the Gold Crew. The Gold Crew Commanding Officer Cmdr. Randy Garner and his crew then headed back out to sea, this time for five days of integrated training. Despite not having been on the ship for several months, the Gold Crew quickly settled in and successfully completed its training regimen. LCSs like Freedom are designed to handle mission sets that do not require the full breadth and depth of capabilities of a traditional surface combatant. Instead of the wide spectrum of combat capability inherent to those platforms, LCS embarks tailored mission packages (surface warfare, mine countermeasure, anti-submarine warfare or maritime security) and an aviation detachment to fulfill a specific mission set. The tailored packages allow LCS to fulfill several niche missions with a much smaller crew and at less cost than larger surface combatants.

Earlier this summer, Chief of Naval Operation (CNO) Adm. Gary Roughead directed both the his staff and U.S. Fleet Forces Command to look at an early, short-term deployment for Freedom (Defense Daily, June 15). Besides determining the feasibility of deploying Freedom earlier than envisioned, the study also examined distance support and where the mission modules would be swapped out, if the Navy decided to do that. Earlier this week, Roughead said it is time to deliver this capability to the fleet. \"Deploying LCS now is a big step forward in getting this ship where it needs to be-operating in the increasingly important littoral regions,\" Roughead said. \"We must deliver this critical capability to the warfighter now.\" For her deployment, Freedom will be outfitted with a tailored surface warfare mission package that will consist of an armed MH-60 and two 30mm gun modules, Lt. Cmdr. Philip Rosi, a U.S. Fleet Forces spokesman, told Defense Daily yesterday. In addition to the surface warfare package, Freedom will also carry a prototype maritime security module with visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) capability, Rosi added. That prototype module will have at least one manned rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capability, he said. Before her deployment, Freedom will have to be certified for maritime security surge, Rosi said. He could not provide a date for when that certification will take place. While there are no plans to swap out mission packages during Freedom's maiden voyage, there be an opportunity to swap out crews, as both the blue and gold crews will participate in the initial deployment, Rosi added. Along with the two crews, an aviation detachment and mission package detachment will deploy with Freedom. The sooner the Navy integrates LCS into the fleet, the sooner officials can incorporate the ships in the order of battle, said Adm John Harvey, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces. \"This deployment offers a golden opportunity to learn by doing.

Freedom recently completed Industrial Post Delivery Availability 2, which also supported an early deployment. The decision to deploy LCS-1 in 2010 will make next year a very busy one for the program. The Navy is also expected to award a new contract to a single vendor to build 10 of the ships, under a new acquisition plan proposed earlier this summer (Defense Daily, Sept. 17). Under the new plan, the two prime contractors for LCS-General Dynamics [GD] and Lockheed Martin [LMT]-will compete head- to-head with the winner building 10 ships through fiscal year '14. The winning contractor will build two ships, with options for eight more between FY '11 and FY '14 (Defense Daily, Sept. 18). The Navy could award an LCS contract by the end of the second quarter, or into the third quarter of FY '10. In FY '12, the Navy will hold the second LCS competition to find a second source to build the ship. The winner of the second competition will get a contract to build one ship in FY '12 and options for four additional ships between FY '13 and FY '14, for a total of five LCS. The winner of the FY '10 competition cannot compete for the FY '12 contract. A third and final competition will be held in FY '15 to determine which of the two shipyard will build the majority of LCS.

Gary Roughead, chief of naval operations.  \"We must deliver this critical capability to the warfighter now.\"   The USS Freedom will have an immediate impact on fleet readiness and global reach as an asset with unique combat capabilities and the ability to meet littoral tasking not previously seen in the modern cruiser or destroyer fleet.   \"The Navy plans to build a considerable number of littoral combat ships which will form the backbone of our future fleet,\" said Adm J.

Earlier this summer, Chief of Naval Operation (CNO) Adm. Gary Roughead directed both the his staff and U.S. Fleet Forces Command to look at an early, short-term deployment for Freedom (Defense Daily, June 15). Besides determining the feasibility of deploying Freedom earlier than envisioned, the study also examined distance support and where the mission modules would be swapped out, if the Navy decided to do that. Earlier this week, Roughead said it is time to deliver this capability to the fleet. \"Deploying LCS now is a big step forward in getting this ship where it needs to be-operating in the increasingly important littoral regions,\" Roughead said. \"We must deliver this critical capability to the warfighter now.\" For her deployment, Freedom will be outfitted with a tailored surface warfare mission package that will consist of an armed MH-60 and two 30mm gun modules, Lt. Cmdr. Philip Rosi, a U.S. Fleet Forces spokesman, told Defense Daily yesterday. In addition to the surface warfare package, Freedom will also carry a prototype maritime security module with visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) capability, Rosi added. That prototype module will have at least one manned rigid inflatable boat (RIB) capability, he said. Before her deployment, Freedom will have to be certified for maritime security surge, Rosi said. He could not provide a date for when that certification will take place. While there are no plans to swap out mission packages during Freedom's maiden voyage, there be an opportunity to swap out crews, as both the blue and gold crews will participate in the initial deployment, Rosi added. Along with the two crews, an aviation detachment and mission package detachment will deploy with Freedom. The sooner the Navy integrates LCS into the fleet, the sooner officials can incorporate the ships in the order of battle, said Adm John Harvey, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces. \"This deployment offers a golden opportunity to learn by doing. Employing the USS Freedom in theater two years ahead of a normal timeline allows us to incorporate lessons that can only be learned in a deployment setting more quickly and effectively in the LCS fleet integration process,\" Harvey said. In evaluating options for deploying Freedom earlier than originally scheduled, the Navy took into consideration several key factors including combat systems testing, shakedown of the ship systems, and overseas sustainment with a new concept of operations and crew training. To facilitate the early deployment, the Navy adjusted the USS Freedom (LCS-1) testing schedule, prioritized testing events needed for deployment and deferred others not required for the missions envisioned during this deployment. Freedom recently completed Industrial Post Delivery Availability 2, which also supported an early deployment. The decision to deploy LCS-1 in 2010 will make next year a very busy one for the program. The Navy is also expected to award a new contract to a single vendor to build 10 of the ships, under a new acquisition plan proposed earlier this summer (Defense Daily, Sept. 17). Under the new plan, the two prime contractors for LCS-General Dynamics [GD] and Lockheed Martin [LMT]-will compete head- to-head with the winner building 10 ships through fiscal year '14. The winning contractor will build two ships, with options for eight more between FY '11 and FY '14 (Defense Daily, Sept. 18). The Navy could award an LCS contract by the end of the second quarter, or into the third quarter of FY '10. In FY '12, the Navy will hold the second LCS competition to find a second source to build the ship. The winner of the second competition will get a contract to build one ship in FY '12 and options for four additional ships between FY '13 and FY '14, for a total of five LCS. The winner of the FY '10 competition cannot compete for the FY '12 contract. A third and final competition will be held in FY '15 to determine which of the two shipyard will build the majority of LCS. The Navy recognizes that the second yard will have a higher learning curve as it produces LCS frames. \"That's why in our strategy that second yard, provided they produce consistent to what we select them to, will get five ships. We will allow them the opportunity to drive down their learning curve,\" Rear Adm. William Landay, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Ships, told reporters during a briefing earlier this month. But that learning curve is going to be much further down than it would have started off because it's a design that the Navy knows, Landay said. \"It's a locked-in baseline. There is not a lot of opportunity there to change the baseline. What we are looking for are their production processes and how we can build that ship more efficiently,\" he said. \"Then, when we get to FY '15, those two shipyards will compete against each other.\"", "url": "https://www.defensedaily.com/navy-to-deploy-freedom/navy-usmc/"}, {"title": "USS Freedom Closer to Maiden Deployment", "date": "2009-12-09", "content": "The Navy's first littoral combat ship (LCS), USS Freedom (LCS 1), has successfully completed another major milestone in preparation for her upcoming maiden deployment. Freedom conducted independent ship deployment training and certification at sea from Nov. 13-21, operating with ships from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) Carrier Strike Group during their Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) off the southeastern coast of the United States. Freedom conducted effective complex training as part of the Maritime Security Surge certification for the ship's Gold Crew, which will deploy aboard Freedom in early 2010 to U.S. Southern Command. As with every lead ship of a class, the operational testing and validation of the ship's sensors and weapon systems is a complex and time-consuming series of events that are normally conducted sequentially over an extended time period. The Navy expects to learn key operational lessons about Freedom in a deployment setting and to integrate those lessons into the larger LCS fleet integration process. To achieve this goal, the Navy modified the typical workup schedule to accelerate Freedom's deployment by approximately two years. The Fleet Response Training Plan, used to evaluate a ship's operational capabilities as well as maintenance, testing and training, was modified to ensure effective training for this unique and highly capable ship with reduced manning and two crews. In a plan developed by Commander, U.S. 2nd Fleet; Commander, Naval Surface Forces/Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic; Commander, Naval Network Warfare Command; Commander, Strike Force Training (CSFTL) Atlantic; LCS Class Squadron (LCSRON); Afloat Training Group, Pacific; Naval Sea Systems Command; Naval Air Systems Command; and Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force; the Post-Delivery Maintenance and System Testing activities were interwoven with unit and integrated, advanced level training. In the past, test events were rigidly structured and scripted to validate system performance. As much as possible, these were modified to simultaneously fulfill operational training requirements with no compromise to performance standards. \"Because of the LCS multi-crewing concept, two core crews needed to be trained and assessed aboard Freedom, and that added another new dimension to our standard surface ship training and certification plan,\" said Capt. Michael Taylor, commander, LCSRON. \"During testing and much of the unit level training, both the 'on-hull' crew and some members of the 'off-hull' crew were on board, and that gave both crews a chance to gain experience and proficiency on Freedom's systems.\" During most of the Integrated/Advanced Phase Training and Assessment, only a single core crew and embarked detachments could be evaluated at one time across the range of military operations. The primary focus was on the Gold Crew, which will deploy with the ship for the first portion of the deployment. After avoiding heavy weather off the East Coast, Freedom departed Mayport, Fla., Nov. 13 with the Blue Crew and Cmdr. Kristy Doyle, the Blue Crew commanding officer. During the three days that followed, CSFTL assessors put the crew through an intensive series of underway scenarios designed to evaluate their ability to execute maritime security missions both as an independent unit and as part of a larger force. CSFTL presented Freedom with realistic missions in rapid succession to stress planning and decision-making. From self-defense against air and surface threats, to maritime interception operations, electronic warfare, common tactical picture management and datalink operations, the team performed well and met every challenge. Freedom returned to Naval Station Mayport for a \"hot swap\" between the Blue Crew and the Gold Crew. The Gold Crew Commanding Officer Cmdr. Randy Garner and his crew then headed back out to sea, this time for five days of integrated training. Despite not having been on the ship for several months, the Gold Crew quickly settled in and successfully completed its training regimen. LCSs like Freedom are designed to handle mission sets that do not require the full breadth and depth of capabilities of a traditional surface combatant. Instead of the wide spectrum of combat capability inherent to those platforms, LCS embarks tailored mission packages (surface warfare, mine countermeasure, anti-submarine warfare or maritime security) and an aviation detachment to fulfill a specific mission set. The tailored packages allow LCS to fulfill several niche missions with a much smaller crew and at less cost than larger surface combatants. In addition, the shallower draft of the LCS allows it to operate in many areas where larger, deeper draft combatants cannot venture.", "url": "https://www.marinelink.com/news/deployment-freedom-closer332684"}, {"title": "LCS 1 Arrives In Mayport, Prepares For Maiden Deployment", "date": "2010-02-02", "content": "USS Freedom (LCS 1), the Navy's first littoral combat ship (LCS), arrived at Naval Station Mayport, Fla., Jan. 26 to begin final preparations for her maiden deployment.

Readying for this deployment was a unique process for Freedom's Sailors. Starting in November 2009, Freedom engaged in independent training and certification exercises off the Virginia and Florida coasts, including maritime security surge training for both the Blue and Gold Crews. After completing a Continuous Maintenance Availability at Colonna's Shipyard in Norfolk, Va., in mid-January 2010, Freedom got underway again for sea trials to verify the integration of the Surface Warfare Mission Package and aviation detachment with the core crew.

Additionally, teams led by Austal USA and Lockheed Martin [LMT] competing to build LCS for the Navy both submitted their responses to the service's request for proposals Monday. The Navy is expected to award a contract to develop a single hull form, this summer. \"We are offering the U.S. Navy a low-risk, affordable design that has already proven itself essential to the expanding challenges faced by our sailors,\" Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin chairman and CEO, said yesterday in a statement. \"Lockheed Martin is committed to continuing our strong performance to ensure delivery of an affordable class of LCS ships for our nation.\" Freedom, built by the team of Lockheed Martin and Marinette Marine, met up with the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) Strike Group and conducted several exercises to determine communications capabilities, Cmdr. Randy Garner, commanding officer of the Gold Team, told reporters during a conference call yesterday. \"We met with them and conducted several basic exercises, which would be indicative of CSG operations,\" he said. Besides the communications exercises, Freedom's crew of 40 also conducted refueling at sea and a quick fire event with the USS Bunker Hill (CG-52). The Bunker Hill was escorting the Carl Vinson as the strike group transited to San Diego, Garner noted. Although Freedom's crew has done several refuelings during their first deployment, this was the first between LCS-1 and a carrier, Garner added. On occasions, the Navy will conduct refueling between surface ships and carriers because the CVNs can provide fuel for a conventionally-powered ship once in a while, he explained. \"That went well. That was a big ship for us to pull alongside and it was a fun event to prove we could do that without any major challenges,\" Garner said. \"The ship maneuvered well...the crew handled that well.\" Freedom also conducted exercises with the Bunker Hill to test both ships' medium-caliber weapons, he said. \"It not only gave us an opportunity to do tactical maneuvering with Bunker Hill but also use our weapons systems and make sure we still got all the skill we needed to execute defense of the ship [and] make sure the guns work as well.\" Freedom also conducted a mock visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) exercise with the Bunker Hill. The cruiser and her crew played the role of a merchant vessel. The VBSS detachment, using the ship's 11-meter rigid inflatable boats (RIBs), boarded the Bunker Hill, gained control of the vessel and then brought the VBSS team back, Garner said. \"Freedom showed she is capable of operating with carrier, with carrier strike group assets and conducting events that ships are required to do in that kind of environment,\" he said. \"There wasn't anything extraordinarily unique about what we did. What was unique about it was that this was the first time it was done with Freedom, and the events went well and the crew did very well.\" But what Freedom can do which is unique is that she has some speed that other ships might not have, Garner added. And, during one event, Freedom was able to demonstrate some of its unique capabilities, he added. While Garner acknowledged that Freedom's VBSS event was not that different than what an Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate or Arleigh Burke-class destroyer can do, the ability to carry and deploy 11-meter RIBs gives Freedom more payload capacity and a little more sea keeping ability. \"Also, with our stern launch system, the ability to launch the boats in a little different [fashion] gives us an advantage in safety of boat operations,\" he said. Freedom also had the opportunity to interact with the USS McInerney (FFG-8) in the eastern Pacific. The McInerney's crew was completing a counternarcotics deployment when they joined up with Freedom. On this deployment, the McInerney was equipped with one SH-60M Sea Hawk and two Fire Scout vertical tactical unmanned air vehicles, Garner said \"We had the opportunity to do a days worth of operations with her as we were passing through the same area she was operating in,\" he said. With the McInerney similar in size to Freedom, and with the frigate equipped with Fire Scout, there was an interest in routine operations between the two ships, Garner said. \"We had a day of routine operations where we coordinated patrols between the two ships and coordinated patrols between our aircraft,\" he said. The two ships communicated using both line of sight communications and over the horizon communications, Garner added. The two ships also coordinated for night and counternarcotics operations, he said. \"It went well. It was a full day and full night of operations.\" Although the McInerney was equipped with Fire Scout, the VTUAV never operated from Freedom, nor did Freedom's air detachment ever take control of the aircraft, Garner said. Northrop Grumman's [NOC] Fire Scout will eventually be a key component of the various mission packages that will enable LCS to perform mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare. \"We did not do anything with Fire Scout onboard Freedom, but what we did with Fire Scout was that as she patrolled an assigned area, maintaining the maritime picture for McInerney, we also did the same thing in an adjacent area with our helicopter,\" Garner said. \"We operated jointly with McInerney and their Fire Scout and our helicopter, in order to just surveil the area we were operating in.\"", "url": "https://www.defensedaily.com/navy-shows-freedom-can-successfully-operate-with-carrier-strike-group/uncategorized/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "LCS 1 Arrives In Mayport, Prepares For Maiden Deployment", "date": "2010-02-02", "content": "USS Freedom (LCS 1), the Navy's first littoral combat ship (LCS), arrived at Naval Station Mayport, Fla., Jan. 26 to begin final preparations for her maiden deployment. While in Mayport, Freedom will undergo final counter-illicit trafficking and airborne use of force training and certification in preparation for expected missions in the U.S. Southern Command/Commander, U.S. 4th Fleet Area of Responsibility. Readying for this deployment was a unique process for Freedom's Sailors. Starting in November 2009, Freedom engaged in independent training and certification exercises off the Virginia and Florida coasts, including maritime security surge training for both the Blue and Gold Crews. After completing a Continuous Maintenance Availability at Colonna's Shipyard in Norfolk, Va., in mid-January 2010, Freedom got underway again for sea trials to verify the integration of the Surface Warfare Mission Package and aviation detachment with the core crew. Upon completion of a successful set of trials and onload of deployment ammunition, Freedom sailed south to Mayport to complete the final certification process and prepare for the mid-February 2010 deployment. \"This deployment comes a full two years ahead of schedule,\" said Cmdr. Randy Garner, commanding officer of Freedom's Gold Crew. \"We are ready and eager to get to sea, head south and show what Freedom and her crew are capable of doing.\" Freedom's deployment will be the first for the revolutionary LCS program, whose ships are designed to handle mission sets that do not require the full breadth and depth of capabilities of a traditional surface combatant. Instead of the wide spectrum of combat capability inherent to those platforms, an LCS will embark tailored mission packages (surface warfare, mine countermeasure, anti-submarine warfare or maritime security) and an aviation detachment to fulfill a specific mission set. These tailored packages allow the LCS to fulfill several niche missions with a much smaller crew and at less cost than larger surface combatants. Additionally, the shallower draft of the LCS allows it to operate in many areas where larger, deeper-draft combatants cannot venture. The Sailors of Freedom's Gold Crew, some of whom served aboard the ship before her commissioning, are eagerly anticipating her first operational deployment. \"Absolutely - everyone's looking forward to this deployment,\" said Command Master Chief Anthony Decker, who will be embarking on his last shipboard deployment. \"This is what these men and women get paid to do - not testing, not trials, but actually doing real-world missions.\" Freedom's deployment will conclude later this spring when she arrives in her new homeport of San Diego.", "url": "https://www.defencetalk.com/lcs-1-prepares-for-maiden-deployment-23953/"}, {"title": "US Navy's First LCS Departs on Maiden Deployment", "date": "2010-02-16", "content": "The US Navy's first littoral combat ship, USS Freedom (LCS 1), has begun its maiden deployment from Naval Station Mayport, Florida, two years ahead of schedule.

A U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) is embarked aboard Freedom to facilitate CIT operations. In addition, Freedom is scheduled to make theater security cooperation (TSC) port visits in Colombia, Mexico and Panama. Rear Adm. Vic Guillory, commander, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command and U.S. 4th Fleet, made a point to personally send off the crew of Freedom, commenting that their sacrifice and hard work in preparing the ship to deploy early is in itself worth recognizing. \"We are very excited about what LCS brings to the operational mission - not only its inherent capabilities - its sprint speed, modularity, and tremendous amount of automation ... but its new tailored surface warfare mission package as well as its airborne use of force capabilities and the LEDET, will be key enablers to the CIT and TSC mission with our partner nation navies,\" said Guillory. In addition to the Coast Guard LEDET, embarked aboard Freedom are Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 22, Detachment 2, based in Norfolk, Va., and the first tailored LCS Surface Warfare Mission Package (SUW MP), based in San Diego. Freedom, the first ship of the revolutionary LCS program, is a fast, agile, mission-focused ship that demonstrates the latest in naval warfighting technology. The LCS is specifically designed to defeat \"anti-access\" threats in shallow, coastal water regions, including quiet diesel submarines, fast surface craft and mines.

It was a full day and full night of operations.\" Although the McInerney was equipped with Fire Scout, the VTUAV never operated from Freedom, nor did Freedom's air detachment ever take control of the aircraft, Garner said. Northrop Grumman's [NOC] Fire Scout will eventually be a key component of the various mission packages that will enable LCS to perform mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare. \"We did not do anything with Fire Scout onboard Freedom, but what we did with Fire Scout was that as she patrolled an assigned area, maintaining the maritime picture for McInerney, we also did the same thing in an adjacent area with our helicopter,\" Garner said. \"We operated jointly with McInerney and their Fire Scout and our helicopter, in order to just surveil the area we were operating in.\"", "url": "https://www.defensedaily.com/navy-shows-freedom-can-successfully-operate-with-carrier-strike-group/uncategorized/"}, {"title": "Early Deployment of USS Freedom Provided Valuable Lessons For Navy", "date": "2010-09-06", "content": "Navy officials looked at a number of key factors before sending USS Freedom (LCS-1) off on her first mission, including ship materiel condition, sustainment, and crew training and certification, according to the Navy. \"The decision to deploy Freedom early was based on a thorough review of the required changes to the test plan, overseas sustainment plan, and crew certification requirements,\" Lt.

These words have haunted the Navy ever since Gilmore's office uttered them in December 2011: \"LCS is not expected to be survivable in a hostile combat environment.\" At a Navy expo in April 2012, Secretary Ray Mabus insisted that LCS is \"a warship and it is fully capable of going into combat situations,\" while heralding the LCS' 2013 deployment to Singapore. Gilmore's new report stands by the 2011 assessment, though it sands down the rough edges. \"LCS is not expected to be survivable,\" it finds, \"in that it is not expected to maintain mission capability after taking a significant hit in a hostile combat environment.\" Additionally, Gilmore discloses that the Navy has \"knowledge gaps related to the vulnerability of an aluminum ship structure to weapon-induced blast and fire damage,\" but that it won't conduct tests for those vulnerabilities until later this year or next year.

Problem is, the Pentagon's weapons testers gave the LCS' mine-hunting package a failing grade last year, and this one isn't much better. This time around, Gilmore's office found that the MH-60 Seahawks intended to launch from the LCS minehunters can't \"safely tow\" the sonar suites that scan for underwater mines. So the Navy has scrapped the plan to put the \"underpowered\" helicopters aboard the LCS for minehunting. That's left a \"gap in organic mine sweeping capability\" on the LCS, the report states. The Navy's plan to address that gap depends on the Unmanned Influence Sweep System, a semi-autonomous undersea robot that will spoof the acoustic and magnetic signals of big ships to compel the mines to detonate when Navy ships aren't in range.

When the Freedom, the Navy's prototype littoral combat ship, sailed past Point Loma on Friday morning, it had more than just a new camouflage look to test out as it headed west. The fast, light ship is embarking on its maiden deployment to Singapore, the first real-world trial of its capabilities following years of controversy over price tag and fighting power. The San Diego-based ship will try to deliver on the Navy's plan to \"forward station\" these ships in Singapore, a tiny nation on the tip of Malaysia. The littoral ships are a cornerstone of the Pentagon's new Asia strategy. For all these reasons, all eyes are on the 378-foot ship. \"There's no doubt about it that this is an important deployment for this ship and the crew and for the health of this class of ship,\" said Cmdr. Tim Wilke, commander of one of Freedom's two crews. The U.S. Pacific Fleet commander made a point of saying that the Navy is sticking to the Freedom's deployment schedule, despite sweeping budget cuts known as sequestration that began Friday. The Navy recently canceled the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman's turn in the Persian Gulf because of the same funding shortfall. \"Even in the face of potential budget cuts, there should be no doubt that the U.S. Pacific Fleet remains on watch and that we will continue to deploy our most capable units forward to operate with our allies and partners,\" Adm. Cecil Haney said in a release. So off goes the Freedom, with a few noticeable changes since it first arrived in San Diego Bay in April 2010. Thanks to a bright idea from the crew, the Navy painted the ship a gray camouflage pattern. It's a throwback to World War I and II paint schemes. Before modern radar and other means of targeting, the camo look was used to visually confuse the enemy. \"There is a tactical purpose to it. As we operate close to the land, (it's) trying to mask ourselves,\" Wilke said. \"But there is also, I'll admit, an aesthetic reason. I think the ship looks really neat.\" Navy officials said they were going to paint the hull anyway, and the camo pattern didn't cost extra. World War II veterans are now becoming Facebook fans because of the vintage look, one ship officer said. The Freedom also carries more people in its core crew. Originally, the highly automated littoral ships were supposed to sail with a 40-person core crew. It was an experiment with \"lean manning,\" as compared with a similarly sized frigate with a 150-person crew. But Navy officials decided to add 10 extra sailors to help maintain and repair the ship. It also added three ensigns, the lowest rank among officers, as a pilot project. To accommodate them, workers added beds. Now some of the Freedom's staterooms - swanky by Navy standards - have three-high bunks, like other ships. That's just a recent example of changes in what's been a controversial program.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20141111031400/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/mar/02/freedom-on-the-sea/"}, {"title": "New type of Navy combat ship docks at Pearl Harbor", "date": "2013-03-11", "content": "The Navy's first littoral combat ship, USS Freedom, pulled into Pearl Harbor this morning on its way to history as the first ship in its class to head to Singapore on rotational deployments. Four of the speedy, shallow-draft littoral (shallow water) ships are expected to deploy to Singapore with mission capabilities including theater security, mine countermeasures, surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. \"This ship's deployment lines up well with my priorities - this business of having credible combat capability forward where we can respond in a short period of time given the vastness of my area of operations,\" said Adm. Cecil Haney, the commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet. Haney added that the San Diego-based ship \"will work hand in hand with our allies, partners and friends in the western Pacific as she gets out to that area about a month from now.\" The ships are designed to defeat \"anti-access\" threats such as mines, quiet diesel submarines and fast surface craft. The Navy identified the need for 52 of the littoral combat ships to meet its goal of a 306-ship fleet. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the 378-foot Freedom - at least from a distance - is its paint scheme, a four-color camouflage that harks back to the \"dazzle\" patterns of World War I and II capital ships.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120415/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20130311_New_type_of_Navy_warship_docks_at_Pearl_Harbor.html"}, {"title": "First Littoral Combat Ship Loses, Regains Power", "date": "2013-03-20", "content": "The first-of-class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS-1), the USS Freedom, briefly lost and then regained power March 16 while en route to its first Asian deployment to Singapore, confirms Vice Adm. Richard Hunt, the director of Navy staff and the head of the special LCS Council of service admirals. The power loss may have been due to water getting into the exhaust system of one of the ship's diesel engine generators, possibly creating a pressure difference, Hunt says. \"It is my understanding that within 10-12 minutes it was back,\" he says. Hunt leads the council assembled by the Navy to make the Freedom's deployment - and the overall LCS program - a success. Addressing historical power outages on the Freedom, Navy officials previously have said that such incidents are not that uncommon with naval vessels. However, Hunt says, with time and experience, such incidents should happen less often. \"It will become more reliable,\" he says. However, he adds, \"Diesels are really reliable - they shouldn't go up and down.\" Freedom documents and other Navy sources point to continuing reliability problems with the ship's diesel engines dating back about three years, leading some sources intimately familiar with the ship's operations to wonder if the Navy should consider replacing the engines with another model. Indeed, a starboard diesel engine \"burned out\" earlier this decade, Navy sources say, and had to be replaced with an engine meant for the LCS-3 Forth Worth. The initial diesel engine from Freedom was overhauled, the sources say, and then put into LCS-3, another Freedom-class LCS. But very shortly before Freedom deployed for Singapore March 1, the ship's diesel engine in the same starboard location - the same engine, in fact, that had been initially meant for LCS-3 - \"burned out\" again and was swapped with the engine that originally had been installed in the Freedom and then overhauled and put into the Fort Worth. Hunt says the diesel engine history appears to warrant a review, but he adds there is not enough data to say whether a new engine model is needed. The problems may be rooted in something other than the engines, he says. For example, there could be issues with alignment or fittings between the engines and the ship. \"Generally we work our way through everything,\" Hunt says. \"You need to get it located in the plant configuration within a particular hull and then figure out what the different environmental impacts are on it.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130926213627/http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=%2Farticle-xml%2Fawx_03_20_2013_p0-561393.xml"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Navy's $670 Million Fighting Ship Is 'Not Expected to Be Survivable,' Pentagon Says", "date": "2013-01-15", "content": "In less than two months, the Navy will send the first of its newest class of fighting ships on its first major deployment overseas.

Freedom's crew diagnosed the problems, restarted the engines and continued operating, but was forced to return to Singapore for repairs and further examinations - but not before completing the replenishment operation. The ship is operating from Singapore this year on a highly anticipated - and closely watched - demonstration deployment, the first extended overseas deployment for an LCS. Freedom left its homeport of San Diego on March 1 and arrived at the island nation's Changi naval base on April 18. It was preparing to take part in a series of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercises with the Singaporean Navy when the incident took place on the morning of July 20. (Dates quoted in this story are based on local Singapore time, which is 12 hours ahead of Washington, D.C., time.) According to a statement from Lt. Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the US Navy in Singapore, Freedom was underway in the South China Sea preparing to conduct a helicopter vertical replenishment operation with the support ship Cesar Chavez when the propulsion system shut down. The initial problem was traced to turbocharger exhaust leaks on the No. 2 ship service diesel generator (SSDG), one of four generators that supply the ship with electrical power. Further examination after the power loss found similar problems on the No. 3 generator. After a brief period of single-generator operations, the crew brought more generators online and then brought the engines back online, restoring propulsion. The power loss, Doss said, was \"in minutes rather than in hours.\" The ship experienced similar power-loss issues while crossing the Pacific in the spring. The new problems are \"related to some of the power losses that were reported on the transit in March, but the symptoms are different,\" Doss said. \"Anything beyond that would be speculation.\" It is not yet clear whether Freedom will be underway again to take part in the Singapore portion of the CARAT exercises. \"While it is general policy not to discuss specific maintenance timelines or operational schedules, technicians are working quickly to repair the problem,\" Doss said in the statement. \"If repairs are accomplished soon, Freedom will return to sea ... to participate in the sea phase of CARAT Singapore.\" Freedom is the first of 52 littoral combat ships the Navy plans to buy and is the first ship of the Lockheed Martin variant. The second LCS, Independence, built to an entirely different design from General Dynamics and Austal USA, also lost power briefly in San Diego Bay on June 21, but power was restored and the ship returned to base. It is not clear whether the causes of the power losses on each of the LCS types are related. While both designs are powered by gas turbines and diesels in a combined arrangement, and have diesel ships-service generators, the plants come from different manufacturers and have different plant layouts. The latest incident comes at an awkward time for the much-criticized LCS program. A new report likely to renew long-standing criticisms of the program is expected this week from the Government Accountability Office, and the House Seapower subcommittee has scheduled a July 25 hearing on the program. Freedom is expected to continue operating in the western Pacific until returning to San Diego late in the year. Below is the full statement released Sunday night Washington time, Monday morning Singapore time by the US Navy's Logistics Group Western Pacific command in Singapore: \"Freedom departed Changi Naval Base July 19 to participate in the at-sea phase of CARAT Singapore, which begins July 21 and continues through July 25. The ship lost propulsion briefly July 20 while making preparations for a vertical replenishment in support of CARAT Singapore. Freedom never lost power, the crew restored propulsion, and the ship completed the vertical replenishment. \"Initial assessment on the loss of propulsion is that the NR2 Ship Service Diesel Generator (SSDG) overheated and shut down. The crew determined turbochargers in NR2 and NR3 SSDGs had exhaust leaks and needed to be replaced. Turbochargers increase SSDG efficiency and power by forcing more air into the combustion chamber. Freedom also experienced problems load shedding between online generators that will require further troubleshooting by maintenance technicians in Singapore. \"Freedom's commanding officer [Cmdr. Timothy Wilke of the Gold Crew] decided to return to port to accomplish repairs with available spare parts, and to allow the crew and maintenance technicians to continue troubleshooting the electrical plant as required. \"While it is general policy not to discuss specific maintenance timelines or operational schedules, technicians are working quickly to repair the problem. If repairs are accomplished soon, Freedom will return to sea and join other U.S. Navy units in Combined Task Group 73.1 along with Republic of Singapore Navy ships to participate in the sea phase of CARAT Singapore. \"The Navy deployed Freedom to Southeast Asia to work with regional navies and to put the ship through its paces in littoral waters several thousand miles away from homeport in San Diego. Despite challenges that are not uncommon for any U.S. Navy ship on deployment, let alone a first-of-class ship that has never deployed overseas before, the Freedom crew continues to perform well as they capture valuable lessons learned that will inform follow-on rotational deployments as well as the LCS program. \"Located in Singapore, the Navy's Commander, Logistics Group Western Pacific (CLWP) has extensive experience providing maintenance and logistics support to 7th Fleet units deployed in South and Southeast Asia. As Freedom is a first-of-class ship on a maiden deployment to Southeast Asia, the Navy expected supporting an LCS would require flexible and innovative approaches. We are confident that the right combination of technical assistance and logistics support are in theater now to address this issue.\"", "url": "https://archive.ph/20130722155359/http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130722/DEFREG02/307220014#selection-1113.0-1113.42"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "USS Freedom arrives in Singapore as part of US 'pivot'", "date": "2013-04-17", "content": "A US Navy ship has arrived in Singapore as part of US plans to increase its military presence in the region.

The state-run China Daily described the visit as China's own \"pivot\" to Moscow. \"China's views are very clear and they see the US involvement in the region as not in their interest,\" says Mr Fang. \"But what the USS Freedom is suited for - closer operations with smaller navies in the region - signals that it is not necessarily a force for offensive action or intimidation but it is a force for collaboration and co-operation.\" \"It can also be interpreted as a way to co-operate more with its allies and build a more balancing effect vis-a-vis China,\" he added. While the US cuts military spending, China has become the world's second largest spender. Its defence budget has increased 175% since 2003 according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150308223324/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22156283"}, {"title": "LCS Freedom Suffers Propulsion Loss at Sea", "date": "2013-07-22", "content": "The littoral combat ship Freedom suffered a temporary loss of propulsive power Saturday while operating near Singapore, the US Navy reported, but the ship never lost all power. Freedom's crew diagnosed the problems, restarted the engines and continued operating, but was forced to return to Singapore for repairs and further examinations - but not before completing the replenishment operation. The ship is operating from Singapore this year on a highly anticipated - and closely watched - demonstration deployment, the first extended overseas deployment for an LCS. Freedom left its homeport of San Diego on March 1 and arrived at the island nation's Changi naval base on April 18.

(Dates quoted in this story are based on local Singapore time, which is 12 hours ahead of Washington, D.C., time.) According to a statement from Lt. Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the US Navy in Singapore, Freedom was underway in the South China Sea preparing to conduct a helicopter vertical replenishment operation with the support ship Cesar Chavez when the propulsion system shut down. The initial problem was traced to turbocharger exhaust leaks on the No. 2 ship service diesel generator (SSDG), one of four generators that supply the ship with electrical power. Further examination after the power loss found similar problems on the No. 3 generator. After a brief period of single-generator operations, the crew brought more generators online and then brought the engines back online, restoring propulsion. The power loss, Doss said, was \"in minutes rather than in hours.\" The ship experienced similar power-loss issues while crossing the Pacific in the spring. The new problems are \"related to some of the power losses that were reported on the transit in March, but the symptoms are different,\" Doss said. \"Anything beyond that would be speculation.\" It is not yet clear whether Freedom will be underway again to take part in the Singapore portion of the CARAT exercises. \"While it is general policy not to discuss specific maintenance timelines or operational schedules, technicians are working quickly to repair the problem,\" Doss said in the statement. \"If repairs are accomplished soon, Freedom will return to sea ... to participate in the sea phase of CARAT Singapore.\" Freedom is the first of 52 littoral combat ships the Navy plans to buy and is the first ship of the Lockheed Martin variant. The second LCS, Independence, built to an entirely different design from General Dynamics and Austal USA, also lost power briefly in San Diego Bay on June 21, but power was restored and the ship returned to base. It is not clear whether the causes of the power losses on each of the LCS types are related. While both designs are powered by gas turbines and diesels in a combined arrangement, and have diesel ships-service generators, the plants come from different manufacturers and have different plant layouts. The latest incident comes at an awkward time for the much-criticized LCS program. A new report likely to renew long-standing criticisms of the program is expected this week from the Government Accountability Office, and the House Seapower subcommittee has scheduled a July 25 hearing on the program.

The ship lost propulsion briefly July 20 while making preparations for a vertical replenishment in support of CARAT Singapore. Freedom never lost power, the crew restored propulsion, and the ship completed the vertical replenishment. \"Initial assessment on the loss of propulsion is that the NR2 Ship Service Diesel Generator (SSDG) overheated and shut down. The crew determined turbochargers in NR2 and NR3 SSDGs had exhaust leaks and needed to be replaced. Turbochargers increase SSDG efficiency and power by forcing more air into the combustion chamber.

Now Breaking Defense has obtained an unpublished Government Accountability Office study of Freedom's Singapore deployment that raises more serious questions about a long-standing worry: whether the small and highly automated LCS has enough sailors aboard to do up all the work needed, from routine maintenance to remedial training. By now, the Navy brass have surely gotten tired of GAO taking shots at LCS. But according to GAO, LCS sailors are getting literally tired of the ship: They averaged about six hours of sleep per day, 25 percent below the Navy's eight-hour standard, and key personnel such as engineers got even less. That's in spite of extensive reliance on contractors both aboard and ashore, with a \"rigid\" schedule of monthly returns to Singapore that restricted how far from port the LCS could sail; the decision to increase Freedom's core crew by 25 percent, from 40 to 50 - the maximum the ship can accommodate without a \"significant\" redesign; and the 19-sailor \"mission module\" crew, who are supposed to operate LCS's weapons, helicopters, and small boats, pitching in daily to help the core crew run the ship's basic systems. The core crew's engineering department in particular told GAO they had no idea how they'd keep the ship going without help from the mission module's engineers. But the module the Freedom took to Singapore, the \"anti-surface warfare\" module that includes several small boats, has many more engineers than the forthcoming mine-countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare modules. In fact, while the entire 19-sailor anti-surface module crew has skills useful in running the ship itself, the MCM crew has only four sailors who could help, and the ASW module only one. That means an LCS outfitted to hunt mines or subs would effectively be 15 to 18 sailors short - about 20 to 25 percent. GAO admits at least some of the problems are first-time-out glitches that affect any new ship. The Navy upped the Freedom core crew from 40 to 50 at the last minute, for example, so the 10 new sailors came in unprepared and required as much training time during the deployment as the other 40 put together. The service is also improving the LCS training program, which the entire crew found wanting, though a complete reform will take two to three years. The Navy is also revising the LCS maintenance program for greater flexibility, less reliance on contractors, and more use of diagnostic sensors - already being installed on the USS Fort Worth, which will head to Singapore later this year - to allow \"conditions-based maintenance\" when parts show signs of potential failures, instead of having to manually check (for example) each of the ship's 350 valves once a month. The new maintenance program should also fix simple mistakes like not having enough Internet connectivity for maintenance operations at the pier in Singapore. Finally, Freedom's frequent mechanical failures stem in large part from glitchy equipment that has been replaced with more reliable models on other LCS ships. Not all these fixes can be retrofitted to the troubled Freedom, so the first-born LCS may remain the class's problem child and a maintenance headache throughout its service life, more suited to training and/or hazing new LCS sailors than for overseas operations. But the rest of the Freedom class should function better - though GAO warns the fixes aren't yet proven. Even more worrying is that the Lockheed Martin-built Freedom represents only one of the two LCS designs: General Dynamics' Independence class is entirely different - and that design has never been deployed abroad.

The U.S. Navy must demonstrate the seaworthiness and structural integrity of each new ship class. One of the primary ways the Navy verifies these qualities is through a series of at-sea tests and inspections. These are designed to ensure the hull design is able to navigate through and withstand forces due to inclement weather and high sea state conditions. During the RWT Freedom collected data while operating in sea states 5 and 6 (approximately 8-20 foot waves) off the coast of Oregon for a total of 11 days. The ship was steered in an octagonal route at speeds ranging from dead stop to flank speed to capture data on performance at all speeds and orientations. The test team collected data to measure stress, torsion, and strain on the ship structure. Over the next few months the data will be further analyzed to compare the actual performance of the LCS class Freedom variant to its modeled performance. Initial test results are positive, the machinery plant and auxiliaries all performed well, especially in the context of the sustained operations at sea. Once validated, the results will provide the Navy with the conditions (speed and heading variations) under which it should operate the Freedom variant ships in elevated sea states. The ship's crew members were also equipped with accelerometers and sensors to evaluate human factors such as sleep and potential sea sickness due to ship motions. The ship's crew learned a number of important lessons about operating in elevated sea states, which they will share with other Freedom variant crews. Overall, this trial increased the crew's confidence in operating their ship in rough water. The LCS class consists of the Freedom variant and Independence variant, each designed and built by different industry teams. The Freedom variant team is led by Lockheed Martin (for the odd-numbered hulls, e.g., LCS 1). The Independence variant team was led by General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works (LCS 2 and LCS 4) and Austal USA (for the subsequent even-numbered hulls).

During the drydocking period in the summer and fall of 2015, the combat system was ripped out and replaced with new hardware and more advanced software. Additional communications equipment will be added to the ship and the network was upgraded, creating a more reliable and cost-effective system for the sailors to operate, the LCS Crew 111 officials told USNI News. Operations Officer Lt. Cmdr. Michael Welgan said that \"basically the whole engineering architecture and the whole combat systems electronic architecture has been stripped and redone. So the combat system suite is actually more advanced than (LCSs) 3 and 5 now. It's gotten a lot of good improvements\" on both the hardware and software side, he said. Welgan said redundancies were added to the ship to increase reliability. Dual paths were created so the combat system could bypass any faults that may occur, he said. And a second antenna for satellite communications will be added to the ship soon to both eliminate blind spots and to have a backup in case one goes down. The LCS's reliance on an open architecture design and the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware was key to the technology refresh effort. Combat Systems Officer Lt. Adam Beauchene said the ship has a centralized network called the Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE), which already gave the LCS an advantage over legacy systems in that the COTS servers reduced cost and made it easier to get a replacement if one broke. During the drydocking period, about two and a half racks of servers were taken out and replaced with just a single server - more powerful, and only about three or four inches thick. Beauchene said that server upgrade alone took thousands of pounds off the ship. Joe North, Lockheed Martin Vice President of Littoral Ships and Systems, told USNI News that the tech refresh was originally planned for 2012 but was pushed back due to Freedom's deployment to Singapore. The combat system hardware that was on Freedom was purchased in the 2004 or 2005 timeframe, he said, and needed to be updated with newer, more efficient technology - exemplified by the server replacement. North said Freedom also got an updated version of the COMBATSS-21 software - a derivative of the Aegis Combat System - that puts it in line with the newer LCSs coming out of the Marinette Marine shipyard in Wisconsin. Also during the maintenance and modernization period, the flight deck was repaved with new nonskid, industrial work was done to spruce up the ship, and the mission bay doors were altered to improve operations, Commanding Officer Cmdr. Michael Brasseur said. Previously, the doors would open to launch small boats or unmanned vehicles, but they dragged in the water, both putting stress on the doors and making it harder for the ship to reach top speeds. A new dutch door concept allows the bottom-most part to stay closed instead of dragging in the water. \"What's been really phenomenal for our crew is we came in when the ship was wide open. All the tanks were open, everything was open because there was a lot of work being done,\" Brasseur said, noting that the crew took command of the ship on Sept. 11, 2015, in the middle of the drydocking period.  \"And we got to know the ship on a very kind of organic level, in a very personal way. I've been in every single space on this ship, and then when you put it back together and get it ready to go to sea it's a deeper level of knowledge.\" The crew plans to take Freedom out on Friday for a two-day sea trial with the surface warfare mission package, providing an opportunity for the ship's crew, the surface warfare mission package crew and the aviation detachment to practice together at sea for the first time.

The Independence-variant USS Coronado (LCS-4) will deploy later this year with the Boeing-built Harpoon anti-ship missile, and engineering is underway to outfit USS Freedom (LCS-1) with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a partnership between Kongsberg Defence Systems and Raytheon. Program Executive Officer for Littoral Combat Ships Rear Adm.

The NSM effort is a bit farther behind, with the engineering not yet complete, but the missile system integration will be done in time for Freedom's next deployment. Antonio said the OTH missile effort falls into four categories: demonstrating the capability on Coronado and Freedom in the near term to \"show that LCS is capable of having a long stick;\" building a missile system into new LCSs; backfitting the systems into existing LCSs; and designing a missile into the frigate design. The program office is looking at the last couple LCSs ahead of the transition to the frigate - the planned Fiscal Year 2017 ships - and investigating \"are we able to capture with our FY 17 ships, actually starting it right from scratch and getting the shipbuilders to incorporate the right systems to be able to support OTH?\" Building the systems into the frigate design will be somewhat easier, since there will be more freedom to install the system where it makes the most sense instead of where the LCS design allows for a missile launcher. As for the backfit effort, once the PEO decides on which missile to use going forward, the program will look for opportunities during ships' midlife availabilities, shorter maintenance availabilities and even post-delivery availabilities to insert the OTH missile system. The engineering being done on Freedom today will help inform the backfit effort, Antonio said, though the NSM/Freedom integration this year will not go as far as the full system integration that the formal program of record missile installation might include. Naval Sea Systems Command spokeswoman Christianne Witten told USNI News that \"the Navy plans to procure and install the NSM system on USS Freedom (LCS-1) prior to her next deployment.

The Independence-variant USS Coronado (LCS-4) will deploy later this year with the Boeing-built Harpoon anti-ship missile, and engineering is underway to outfit USS Freedom (LCS-1) with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a partnership between Kongsberg Defence Systems and Raytheon. Program Executive Officer for Littoral Combat Ships Rear Adm. Brian Antonio told USNI News in a May 2 interview that the Harpoon system will be installed on Coronado within the next month, in time for an over-the-horizon missile demonstration at the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2016 exercise in Hawaii this summer. \"It's the beginning of how to incorporate OTH on LCSs,\" he said. The NSM effort is a bit farther behind, with the engineering not yet complete, but the missile system integration will be done in time for Freedom's next deployment. Antonio said the OTH missile effort falls into four categories: demonstrating the capability on Coronado and Freedom in the near term to \"show that LCS is capable of having a long stick;\" building a missile system into new LCSs; backfitting the systems into existing LCSs; and designing a missile into the frigate design. The program office is looking at the last couple LCSs ahead of the transition to the frigate - the planned Fiscal Year 2017 ships - and investigating \"are we able to capture with our FY 17 ships, actually starting it right from scratch and getting the shipbuilders to incorporate the right systems to be able to support OTH?\" Building the systems into the frigate design will be somewhat easier, since there will be more freedom to install the system where it makes the most sense instead of where the LCS design allows for a missile launcher. As for the backfit effort, once the PEO decides on which missile to use going forward, the program will look for opportunities during ships' midlife availabilities, shorter maintenance availabilities and even post-delivery availabilities to insert the OTH missile system. The engineering being done on Freedom today will help inform the backfit effort, Antonio said, though the NSM/Freedom integration this year will not go as far as the full system integration that the formal program of record missile installation might include. Naval Sea Systems Command spokeswoman Christianne Witten told USNI News that \"the Navy plans to procure and install the NSM system on USS Freedom (LCS-1) prior to her next deployment. Due to constrained timelines, the system will not be fully integrated to the ships combat system and will only receive navigational data from the ship. The objective of this installation is to complete Foreign Comparative Testing and demonstrate an Over the Horizon (OTH) capability and deploy for an extended period of time on LCS.\" Still, this year's OTH missile installation efforts will more tightly integrate the missile system with the ship than did a previous test of the NSM on Coronado, Director of Surface Warfare Rear Adm. Pete Fanta previously told USNI News. In addition to the OTH strike capability, the Navy is also adding a short-range missile to the LCS surface warfare mission package to help address the fast inshore attack craft threat. \"Later this year we'll also do some surface-to-surface missile shots of the Longbow Hellfire missile - I think it's four more this year off of a guided test vehicle,\" Antonio said in the interview. The Navy began testing the modified Hellfire missile - altered to fire vertically from the ship instead of horizontally from a helicopter - last year and will continue testing the missile from test platforms rather than from an LCS in the short term.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2016/05/04/navy-to-demo-harpoon-missile-on-lcs-at-rimpac-nsm-on-uss-freedom-by-next-deployment"}, {"title": "USS Freedom Departs for Rim of the Pacific Southern California 2016", "date": "2016-07-12", "content": "The Navy's first Littoral Combat Ship USS Freedom (LCS 1) departed Naval Base San Diego July 9 to participate in the world's largest international maritime exercise Rim of the Pacific 2016.

In his first formal interview since assuming command last summer, Neagley told USNI News that these lessons learned will all come into play next year when the Navy ups the difficulty of its LCS operations - with two Independence-variant ships operating concurrently out of Singapore, and one Freedom-variant ship operating out of Bahrain for the first time in the program's history. \"I think it's going to be really powerful to have two ships operating together, so you kind of get the synergy of two platforms operating together, doing dual operations, and you get the benefits of having those two crews on station doing that work,\" he said.\"And everything we've learned to date, we're certainly going to carry forward for '18.

We have a facility out there we share with FDRMC, which is the Forward Deployed Regional Maintenance Center, those are the guys who do maintenance for our ships out there ... so we share that facility and there's some good synergy between those two groups as we operate out of that part of the world.\" Neagley would not speculate on how the U.S. 5th Fleet commander would choose to operate the ship in theater, but he said having a shallow-draft surface combatant in the Middle East would open up a lot of opportunities to the operational commanders. \"I did a lot of operations in that part of the world, and I'll tell you, having a shallow-draft ship to operate up in the Persian Gulf and some of those areas is a big asset. I had a DDG, and every time I went up north and had to operate around the oil wells up there, you had to be on your toes and watch the draft of that ship,\" Neagley said, referring to commanding guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) when Operation Iraqi Freedom began in 2003.\"But having a 15-foot draft ship, being able to do those kinds of operations I think provides us a lot of flexibility.\" Neagley said the same of LCS operations in the Pacific, adding that \"for that part of the world they're a really good size ship to operate with our partners out there. The ability to kind of engage with Brunei and the other countries in that particular area with that size of ship, and to be able to go into ports that we haven't really been able to go into before because we have a relatively shallow draft, we're talking about a 15-foot draft, has opened up some things for us.\" While he said both variants meet the same requirements from an acquisition perspective, he is pleased with the strengths the Freedom-variant will to the Middle East and the Independence-variant to the Pacific during next year's deployments.\"Some have attributes that give them some comparative advantages - certainly the flight decks on the LCS-2 variant lend themselves to a lot of good helicopters operations and those kinds of things. The stern ramp on the Freedom variant, being able to launch and recover 11-meter [rigid-hull inflatable boats] quickly, there's advantages to that. ... I think you could put either ship either place and it would do great, but I think we'll leverage the capabilities of those ships appropriately for the missions that the fleet commander has out there.\" While lessons learned so far will shape these deployments next year, the Navy is certainly not done learning about these ships. Setting up a new maintenance hub in Bahrain, as well as trying to simultaneously maintain two Independent-variant ships, for which the Navy has less operational data than the Freedom-variant, will stress the Navy's maintenance and logistics communities, which have already had to grapple with forward-stationing essentially two distinct types of ships. The Freedom- and Independence-variants use different combat systems, different propulsion, and so on, which means the Navy has to have the right parts and people stationed at the right place at the right time for ship repairs on both variants, or else the LCS is sidelined for too long during maintenance and misses operational assignments. Neagley said the time it takes to turn around a forward-deployed LCS for maintenance has steadily decreased, from the Freedom deployment to Fort Worth to Coronado, so \"there's some really good trends there.\" He added the Navy has a pretty good idea of what it takes to keep the Freedom-variant running on deployment, with two deployments under its belt, and is learning on the Indy-variant as it collects more data during the ongoing deployment, which began last summer. \"Is there a part where we see a usage rate that's higher while forward-deployed than back here in CONUS that we have to have that piece there? Is there a part that we know would have a particularly long lead time that we should think ahead and put it out there? Those are the kinds of things we're learned,\" the admiral said.\"And we've really cut the response time down on Coronado based on lessons learned. Now we have better coordination with [original equipment manufacturers] that might go out and help with some of that repair, we have better coordination with the types of parts that we might need, and that you just get from operating - that's experience-based learning, and the ship's doing that real time, and it's showing its benefit in our ability to turn a ship around for a maintenance period and continue to do operations.\" Neagley said, \"quick learning\" is the common thread with all that PEO LCS is trying to do right now. While some critics of the program have noted that Freedom and eventually Fort Worth were sidelined during their deployments with major maintenance issues, Neagley said the Navy made a conscious decision to put the ships out on deployment as soon as it could to begin capturing lessons learned that would inform concepts of operations, material fixes to send back to the shipyards' production lines, and training plans for the crews.

US Navy photo. One big win that came from that is the fleet's identification of the need for an over-the-horizon missile. \"That's a significant capability for the ship. When you look at competitors in that part of the world, you have to pay attention to where you have a missile, or a ship with that kind of capability, and it kind of changes that dynamic a little bit. It provides a little bit more stick, offensive stick for that ship. So I think that's certainly something we value over there,\" he said. Other bits of fleet feedback have led to a list of lethality and survivability upgrades that the Navy would like to backfit into LCS ships as early as 2018, in an effort to increase the LCSs' capability to something closer to the future frigate's level of lethality and survivability. The Navy's 2018 unfunded priorities list includes a mention of $84 million for four ship-sets of upgrades, which include four key items: space and weight for the over-the-horizon missile, increased magazine protection, anti-submarine warfare lightweight tow embark, and hardening of chilled water to support the SeaRAM anti-ship missile defense system already installed on the ships. Neagley called these upgrades \"relatively easy to do, doesn't require major design changes to the ship, but based on those lessons learned from the first four ships we said, hey, these are the kinds of things that came out of the work we had done on the frigate program\" and could be backfitted onto LCSs. Neagley said he's ready to do the upgrades as soon as the funding becomes available. \"For us it's driven by funding at this point. They're on the unfunded list. But the good news is we have the drawings, the plans, we know how to do it, so this is not a hard thing for us to go do,\" he said.\"We've identified those as things that we think would be important to improve the ships in the near-term. And we'll continue to look at those kinds of things, and I think operating forward does help us identify that kind of stuff.\"", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2017/06/07/interview-plans-for-2-littoral-combat-ships-in-singapore-1-in-bahrain-in-2018-shaped-by-lessons-learned"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "USS Freedom Gets Underway After Two Years of Repairs", "date": "2018-12-18", "content": "Littoral Combat Ship USS Freedom (LCS-1) left a pier in San Diego, Calif., for the first time in more than two years, after an extensive repair period to fix the ship's propulsion system. The underway was part of contractor trials to test repairs after a Colt-Pielstick diesel engine was damaged in 2016, a Navy spokesperson told USNI News on Monday. \"The Freedom-variant littoral combat ship USS Freedom (LCS-1) achieved a major milestone this week as the ship began contractor sea trials, Dec. 10,\" LCS Squadron 1 spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Miranda Williams told USNI News. \"This important step is the culmination of nearly two years' worth of work across multiple organizations. This milestone allows the first ship of its class to return to sea and fulfill its new role as a testing ship.\" In 2016, the crew of the ship discovered one of its two Colt-Pielstick diesels had failed due to contamination of the ship's lube oil system by seawater. After participating in the Rim of the Pacific 2016 exercise operating on its gas turbines, the ship returned to its homeport in San Diego. Once pier-side, a Southwest Regional Maintenance Center's Diesel Engine Inspector found \"significant damage to the engine caused by rust and seawater,\" USNI News reported at the time. Since then, the ship has been undergoing repairs in San Diego. The first word on the successful repairs came from the ship's Facebook page last week. With the repairs to the ship completed, Freedom is now on its way to rejoin the four-ship LCS test force. The other Freedom-class ship in the test division, USS Fort Worth (LCS-3), was also sidelined after operator error damaged the combining gear that linked the ship's main propulsion diesels with the Rolls Royce MT30 gas turbines in Singapore in 2016. Questions on the status of both Freedom and Fort Worth left with a Naval Sea Systems Command spokesperson on Monday were not immediately returned. In contrast to the two-years NAVSEA took to repair the two ships, the command was able to replace a damaged MT30 gas turbine on Zumwalt-class Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) in a matter of months. The inclusion of Freedom and Fort Worth back into the testing regime will free up operational assets that were waylaid to complete testing of the emerging mission package capabilities. Due in part to the demands of mission package testing, the Navy did not deploy any Littoral Combat Ships in 2018. For example, USS Milwaukee (LCS-5) was used as a platform for Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) developmental testing that will integrate the AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire onto the LCS.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2018/12/18/uss-freedom-gets-underway-two-years-repairs"}, {"title": "Two Years After Breakdown, This Littoral Combat Ship is Back in the Fleet", "date": "2018-12-18", "content": "The USS Freedom is rejoining the fleet more than two years after an engine breakdown sidelined the vessel.

The deployment to Central and South American waters is something of a surprise - the fate of the entire 16-ship Freedom class fleet may depend upon just how well this balky, 12-year-old \"prototype\" and \"testing\" platform performs in the Eastern Pacific.  Beset by long-standing and systemic mechanical problems, the entire Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship fleet is in real trouble. As the Pentagon's maritime focus shifts towards China, the Navy is questioning the strategic rationale for these low-endurance, fuel-hungry littoral combat ships. And after tolerating years of poor performance, the Navy is now refusing to accept new Freedom class ships until a class-wide drivetrain flaw is fixed. And with patience running short, the Freedom class is likely a single engineering casualty away from a programmatic catastrophe.  With such high stakes, the pier-bound USS Freedom is a strange choice for a high-risk deployment. The ship has gone un-deployed since 2014, and sports long record of leaks, engine failures and major breakdowns. But the ship may surprise observers. An audacious \"cruise by a ship with nothing left to lose\" offers as good an opportunity as any to see if the platform's presumed strengths can overcome the Freedom's known weaknesses.  Survival is the Mission: If the USS Freedom has a trouble-free and low-key deployment, Freedom class advocates will declare victory. To that end, the deployment is treating the ship with kid gloves. After slipping out of San Diego on January 11, the USS Freedom has enjoyed a leisurely cruise towards Eastern Pacific drug transit zones, making friendly port calls in one Central American deep-sea port after another. The ship engaged other navies along the way, making headlines after completing a set of passing exercises with surface units from the diminutive Salvadoran and Guatemalan navies. When not in port to refuel and replenish, the USS Freedom is contributing to a major Southern Command priority-suppressing the maritime transport of illegal drugs off South and Central America. By February 25, the Freedom had \"interdicted 740 kilograms of cocaine and 2,200 pounds of marijuana, keeping an estimated $32 million in profits from reaching transnational criminal organizations.\" Even though that sounds good, it is only the equivalent of one-or potentially two-successful interdictions. But drug interdiction is not the goal for this ship. Survival is the USS Freedom's primary mission, and, so far, things are going relatively well. Nonetheless, a single successful mission through the Eastern Pacific is just not enough to redeem this imperfect platform. Not Suitable For The Job: It is time to recognize that the Freedom class ships are low-endurance, short-range platforms. High fuel, food and maintenance demands keep the ships from heading to sea for long periods of time, and the USS Freedom's current deployment is only emphasizing the unsuitability of the Freedom class in any mission beyond short-range coastal defense. The ship is rarely spending more than a week at sea. After leaving the United States on January 11, the USS Freedom refueled in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on January 16. Then, on January 21, the ship stopped for supplies in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala. On January 28, the vessel pulled into Punta Arenas, Costa Rica for \"fuel and provisions\" and then on February 7 and 14th, the ship was in Balboa, Panama. It moved to Vasco Nunez de Balboa Naval Base on February 16, where Freedom was, as of February 22, undergoing a planned maintenance availability. The ship reportedly departed Panama on February 27.  Refueling and maintenance demands add up. If the USS Freedom was lashed to a Panamanian pier between the 14th of February and the 27th of February, then the USS Freedom's refueling, replenishing and refitting requirements have kept the vessel in port or unavailable for missions over a period of about eighteen days, or, put another way, it has been unavailable for approximately 40% of the 49 days the ship has been \"deployed\" between January 11 and March 1.  In contrast, the longer-legged Independence class Littoral Combat Ship, USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10), on the tail end of a long, 17-month deployment to Asia, arrived in Southern Command waters in October 2020. In the space of four busy months, the ship participated in nine days of UNITAS LXI exercises off Ecuador, refueled off a partner-nation oiler, sunk a derelict hazards-to-navigation vessel with the deck gun, conducted a passing exercise with a five-ship Salvadoran Navy task group, de-conflicted a complex small boat launch-and-recovery system, and worked through joint support concepts with the wide array of agencies interdicting maritime drug traffic. And, according to a Navy statement to USNI News, by the time the vessel's brief stint in Eastern Pacific waters was over, USS Gabrielle Giffords had made one of the biggest low-profile smuggling vessel seizures of the year, ultimately keeping about 7,622 kilograms of cocaine and 4,144 pounds of marijuana worth over a hundred million dollars off U.S. streets.  That's a heck of a difference. But the Navy should have seen it coming. For more than a decade, the Navy has known the Freedom class failed to meet the Navy's desired range and reliability requirements. However, naval stakeholders have passively accepted these failures and done little to fix things beyond increasing fuel capacity in follow-on Freedom class ships by a modest-and still inadequate-twenty percent. Consider the Consequences: The Navy's strange refusal to promptly confront the Freedom class's dizzying array of performance problems inflict real operational consequences. While port calls do offer unmatched opportunities for engaging with partner nations, even brief ones for a quick refueling and replenishing are pricy, risky and time-consuming affairs. The advance planning that goes into the simplest of port calls is immense. And for the small and often-overtasked Southern Command, organizing weekly port calls in the midst of a global pandemic poses a tremendous administrative burden that distracts from other, more critical work.  The Freedom's long list of logistical and support requirements completely offset any operational gains the new ships can offer via \"presence.\" In anti-drug tasking, Freedom class vessels have enough fuel to reach operational areas, but then, sources say that, without a floating refueling source, the fuel-hungry Freedoms must immediately head back into port for fuel and provisions. In the Eastern Pacific, longer-legged Independence class Littoral Combat Ships don't have those problems as often and can do more work that matters in the maritime.  To get the Freedom class operable, the Navy needs to take another look at the humble U.S. Coast Guard. After decades of experience with small, low-endurance patrol boats and fuel-hungry Navy cast-offs ranging from \"experimental\" surface-effect vessels to Cyclone class patrol craft, the Coast Guard has learned the hard way to cost-effectively manage distributed operations with sub-optimal ships. The Coast Guard has a long history of fielding niche support craft and coordinating ad-hoc resupply opportunities, relying upon a distributed logistical web. That web is supporting the Coast Guard's now-ubiquitous, globe-deploying 64-ship Sentinel class Fast Response Cutter fleet, and it is something the Navy will need if the Freedoms are to ever get into the fight.   The Navy also needs to either make tougher calls or move faster in resolving mistakes. Again, the Coast Guard offers an example. In the late sixties, the Coast Guard fielded a new 210-foot cutter, powered by similar Combined Diesel and Gas (CODAG) propulsion system used aboard the Freedom class. The propulsion system was less efficient than expected, but the Coast Guard refused to dither. Four years after the first Reliance class mid-endurance cutters hit the fleet, the Coast Guard had already stopped fielding the CODAG powerplant and was welcoming the first of ten re-designed diesel-powered Reliance class variants. They are still in service today.   After more than twelve years of procuring the fragile Freedoms and tolerating one design defect and performance deficiency after another, the Navy's new \"innovative\" littoral combat ship \"support\" idea is to lash Spearhead Expeditionary Fast Transports to littoral combat ships as a sort of tender. That's a great idea for the Independence class, and it would be a fine solution if the Freedom only needed maintenance support. But, to make a difference in field operations, Freedom class ships also need consumables like fuel and food. That makes the load-sensitive Spearhead class catamaran the completely wrong platform for the fuel-hungry Freedom class.  If the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship is to stay in the Navy, the Navy must adjust. The ship needs strategic backing, guiding the vessel towards short-range coastal defense missions in the confined waters of the Caribbean, the Aegean, the Persian Gulf and a few other strategic archipelagoes. The Navy needs to recognize the ships need far more logistical support at sea than is available today. Something as simple as a few tugs, converted to carry modest amounts of fuel and supplies, can help keep the Freedom class ships in the field longer. The Navy also needs to be brutally honest. Had the Navy been more forthright about Freedom's problems or shown more vigor in confronting the immediately obvious and widely known Freedom class shortcomings, the service could have either stopped building Freedom class ships ten years ago to fix problems or moved with dispatch to convert a few surplus oilfield support vessels to support the fuel-hungry Freedoms.   Instead, the Navy is refusing to do anything more than hope for a replacement frigate, leaving the nation with 16 broken Freedom class ships that are unsuited for the Navy's current mission priorities. In the face of a near-completed 16-ship program of record, naval stakeholders claim that they are unable to stop this slow-moving boondoggle. But it all comes down to a simple choice. Do Freedom class crews want to focus on the critical maritime security challenges of the day, or do these littoral combat ship sailors prefer to spend all their time in a command backwater, consumed by the job of keeping their unwanted ships alive and unbroken?

The deployment to Central and South American waters is something of a surprise - the fate of the entire 16-ship Freedom class fleet may depend upon just how well this balky, 12-year-old \"prototype\" and \"testing\" platform performs in the Eastern Pacific.  Beset by long-standing and systemic mechanical problems, the entire Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship fleet is in real trouble. As the Pentagon's maritime focus shifts towards China, the Navy is questioning the strategic rationale for these low-endurance, fuel-hungry littoral combat ships. And after tolerating years of poor performance, the Navy is now refusing to accept new Freedom class ships until a class-wide drivetrain flaw is fixed. And with patience running short, the Freedom class is likely a single engineering casualty away from a programmatic catastrophe.  With such high stakes, the pier-bound USS Freedom is a strange choice for a high-risk deployment. The ship has gone un-deployed since 2014, and sports long record of leaks, engine failures and major breakdowns. But the ship may surprise observers. An audacious \"cruise by a ship with nothing left to lose\" offers as good an opportunity as any to see if the platform's presumed strengths can overcome the Freedom's known weaknesses.  Survival is the Mission: If the USS Freedom has a trouble-free and low-key deployment, Freedom class advocates will declare victory. To that end, the deployment is treating the ship with kid gloves. After slipping out of San Diego on January 11, the USS Freedom has enjoyed a leisurely cruise towards Eastern Pacific drug transit zones, making friendly port calls in one Central American deep-sea port after another. The ship engaged other navies along the way, making headlines after completing a set of passing exercises with surface units from the diminutive Salvadoran and Guatemalan navies. When not in port to refuel and replenish, the USS Freedom is contributing to a major Southern Command priority-suppressing the maritime transport of illegal drugs off South and Central America. By February 25, the Freedom had \"interdicted 740 kilograms of cocaine and 2,200 pounds of marijuana, keeping an estimated $32 million in profits from reaching transnational criminal organizations.\" Even though that sounds good, it is only the equivalent of one-or potentially two-successful interdictions. But drug interdiction is not the goal for this ship. Survival is the USS Freedom's primary mission, and, so far, things are going relatively well. Nonetheless, a single successful mission through the Eastern Pacific is just not enough to redeem this imperfect platform. Not Suitable For The Job: It is time to recognize that the Freedom class ships are low-endurance, short-range platforms. High fuel, food and maintenance demands keep the ships from heading to sea for long periods of time, and the USS Freedom's current deployment is only emphasizing the unsuitability of the Freedom class in any mission beyond short-range coastal defense. The ship is rarely spending more than a week at sea. After leaving the United States on January 11, the USS Freedom refueled in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on January 16. Then, on January 21, the ship stopped for supplies in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala. On January 28, the vessel pulled into Punta Arenas, Costa Rica for \"fuel and provisions\" and then on February 7 and 14th, the ship was in Balboa, Panama. It moved to Vasco Nunez de Balboa Naval Base on February 16, where Freedom was, as of February 22, undergoing a planned maintenance availability. The ship reportedly departed Panama on February 27.  Refueling and maintenance demands add up. If the USS Freedom was lashed to a Panamanian pier between the 14th of February and the 27th of February, then the USS Freedom's refueling, replenishing and refitting requirements have kept the vessel in port or unavailable for missions over a period of about eighteen days, or, put another way, it has been unavailable for approximately 40% of the 49 days the ship has been \"deployed\" between January 11 and March 1.  In contrast, the longer-legged Independence class Littoral Combat Ship, USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10), on the tail end of a long, 17-month deployment to Asia, arrived in Southern Command waters in October 2020. In the space of four busy months, the ship participated in nine days of UNITAS LXI exercises off Ecuador, refueled off a partner-nation oiler, sunk a derelict hazards-to-navigation vessel with the deck gun, conducted a passing exercise with a five-ship Salvadoran Navy task group, de-conflicted a complex small boat launch-and-recovery system, and worked through joint support concepts with the wide array of agencies interdicting maritime drug traffic. And, according to a Navy statement to USNI News, by the time the vessel's brief stint in Eastern Pacific waters was over, USS Gabrielle Giffords had made one of the biggest low-profile smuggling vessel seizures of the year, ultimately keeping about 7,622 kilograms of cocaine and 4,144 pounds of marijuana worth over a hundred million dollars off U.S. streets.  That's a heck of a difference. But the Navy should have seen it coming. For more than a decade, the Navy has known the Freedom class failed to meet the Navy's desired range and reliability requirements. However, naval stakeholders have passively accepted these failures and done little to fix things beyond increasing fuel capacity in follow-on Freedom class ships by a modest-and still inadequate-twenty percent. Consider the Consequences: The Navy's strange refusal to promptly confront the Freedom class's dizzying array of performance problems inflict real operational consequences. While port calls do offer unmatched opportunities for engaging with partner nations, even brief ones for a quick refueling and replenishing are pricy, risky and time-consuming affairs. The advance planning that goes into the simplest of port calls is immense. And for the small and often-overtasked Southern Command, organizing weekly port calls in the midst of a global pandemic poses a tremendous administrative burden that distracts from other, more critical work.  The Freedom's long list of logistical and support requirements completely offset any operational gains the new ships can offer via \"presence.\" In anti-drug tasking, Freedom class vessels have enough fuel to reach operational areas, but then, sources say that, without a floating refueling source, the fuel-hungry Freedoms must immediately head back into port for fuel and provisions. In the Eastern Pacific, longer-legged Independence class Littoral Combat Ships don't have those problems as often and can do more work that matters in the maritime.  To get the Freedom class operable, the Navy needs to take another look at the humble U.S. Coast Guard. After decades of experience with small, low-endurance patrol boats and fuel-hungry Navy cast-offs ranging from \"experimental\" surface-effect vessels to Cyclone class patrol craft, the Coast Guard has learned the hard way to cost-effectively manage distributed operations with sub-optimal ships. The Coast Guard has a long history of fielding niche support craft and coordinating ad-hoc resupply opportunities, relying upon a distributed logistical web. That web is supporting the Coast Guard's now-ubiquitous, globe-deploying 64-ship Sentinel class Fast Response Cutter fleet, and it is something the Navy will need if the Freedoms are to ever get into the fight.

The ship retired after completing its final deployment in April this year and just 13 years after it entered service in 2008. Freedom's decommissioning is part of a navy plan to mothball the first four ships in the class, with the youngest having just 9 years of service. USS Freedom is the second ship in the class to retire after the service bid farewell to USS Independence (LCS 2) earlier this year. During the ceremony guest speaker, retired Rear Adm. Donald Gabrielson, former commander of US Naval Forces, Southern Command/Commander, US Fourth Fleet and commanding officer of Freedom's commissioning crew, wished the current crew fair winds and following seas as they bid farewell to their ship. \"I have never in my life seen or served alongside a more capable, dedicated, devoted, talented, and inspiring group of people than the sailors I served alongside with LCS and what I have watched in every day since.\" said Gabrielson. \"As we acknowledge this bittersweet moment, I hope well all remember that this ship was a vehicle to learn and innovate by doing and to make real progress in a short amount of time, and that doesn't happen with other ship concepts.\" Freedom maintained a crew of nine officers and 41 enlisted sailors. The ship was built in Marinette, Wisconsin, by Fincantieri Marinette Marine and commissioned Nov. 8, 2008, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. LCS 1 is the second ship in the US Navy to be commissioned as Freedom. The first USS Freedom (ID 3024) was a 5,640-ton troop transport built in 1894 at Hamburg, Germany. Seized by the United States government in 1917, she was renamed Iroquois and operated under charter to the US Army during the rest of World War I. The ship was renamed Freedom in mid-1918 and, in January 1919, was commissioned into the Navy and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force. For the next seven months she engaged in returning American servicemen from France, making three round-trip Atlantic voyages. USS Freedom (ID 3024) was decommissioned in September 1919. Freedom (IX-43), an auxiliary schooner, was acquired by the Navy in 1940, and assigned to the Naval Academy where she served in a noncommissioned status as a training ship through 1962. Freedom has been a test and training ship and was key in developing the operational concepts foundational to the current configuration and deployment of LCS today. The navy says the decommissioning of LCS 1 \"supports department-wide business process reform initiatives to free up time, resources, and manpower in support of increased lethality.\" Navy Rear Admiral Randy Crites said earlier this year that the first four LCS were not configured like the other LCS in the fleet, and would need significant upgrades.

The ship retired after completing its final deployment in April this year and just 13 years after it entered service in 2008. Freedom's decommissioning is part of a navy plan to mothball the first four ships in the class, with the youngest having just 9 years of service. USS Freedom is the second ship in the class to retire after the service bid farewell to USS Independence (LCS 2) earlier this year. During the ceremony guest speaker, retired Rear Adm. Donald Gabrielson, former commander of US Naval Forces, Southern Command/Commander, US Fourth Fleet and commanding officer of Freedom's commissioning crew, wished the current crew fair winds and following seas as they bid farewell to their ship. \"I have never in my life seen or served alongside a more capable, dedicated, devoted, talented, and inspiring group of people than the sailors I served alongside with LCS and what I have watched in every day since.\" said Gabrielson. \"As we acknowledge this bittersweet moment, I hope well all remember that this ship was a vehicle to learn and innovate by doing and to make real progress in a short amount of time, and that doesn't happen with other ship concepts.\" Freedom maintained a crew of nine officers and 41 enlisted sailors.
