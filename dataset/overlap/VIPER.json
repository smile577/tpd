[{"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Moon VIPER: NASA Wants to Send a Water-Sniffing Rover to the Lunar South Pole in 2022", "date": "2019-10-16", "content": "NASA is already pulling together plans for what could become its first long- lived robotic rover on the moon's surface, designed to sniff out water and targeting a landing date of 2022. Right now, that rover, called Volatiles Investigation Polar Exploration Rover, is still a mission concept. If all goes well, the project could develop a long-lived, mobile robot that can hunt for water and other volatiles near the south pole of the moon. And VIPER has a head start, since the would- be mission builds on previous NASA development conducted as part of a project called Resource Prospector, which was axed in 2018. This time around, the rover would reflect the Artemis program, NASA's initiative to land humans on the moon in 2024. \"We are heavily ensconced in the intersection between science and exploration,\" Brad Bailey, program scientist with NASA's Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program, said about NASA's lunar program during a Planetary Science Advisory Committee meeting held in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 23. Volatiles are an area of particular overlap between the two programs, hence VIPER's relevance to both. On the science side, understanding how water arrived at our closest neighbor would explain how Earth got its own water, even though plate tectonics has destroyed the geologic record of that era. Would-be explorers are on the hunt for fuel or even drinking water they could generate from stores of ice. But in both cases, the first step is figuring out where the water is - and that's what VIPER is designed to do, not only at the south pole, where it would land, but over the entire lunar surface. \"The idea is that that mission is a very important part of looking for volatiles, looking for these potential resources on the lunar surface,\" Debra Needham, a planetary scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, told Space.com. \"It's a highly desired mission under formulation.\" Scientists have confirmed the existence of sizable chunks of frozen water on the moon only over the past decade. But as it stands right now, NASA's last soft-landed mission to the moon was Apollo 17 in 1972, when humans last set foot on the moon. The agency has also only flown lunar rovers designed to work with humans, during the latter three Apollo missions. These rovers carried some instruments but primarily served as transportation devices for astronauts. That means that although VIPER won't necessarily be the first mission to land in NASA's new, moon-focused Artemis era, it could be NASA's first lunar rover in decades and the agency's first independent rover ever. The combination means that there are plenty of new capabilities NASA wants to build into such a mission. A particularly high priority for the agency is to design a rover that can power through the dramatic temperature swings between night and day. A couple of long-duration lunar rovers - the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 and the Chinese Yutu rovers - have slept through the night, woken up and resumed work. But NASA wants to do something more: The agency wants VIPER and other future missions to keep gathering data through the night, without shutting down for safety. \"One of the biggest technologies that needs to be developed is being able to survive and operate through the lunar night,\" Needham said. Working through the night would double the amount of observations a rover could make in the same mission duration, which is of course appealing. But full-time observing would also offer crucial science data about phenomena that aren't observable during the lunar day. In particular, Needham said, scientists think that at dawn and dusk, dust may levitate and electrical currents could form in the lunar surface. VIPER would let engineers test technologies designed to let lunar rovers work through the night, but it wouldn't tackle those specific science measurements. Instead, according to Bailey's presentation last month, there are four primary instruments that NASA is eyeing for VIPER. Two of those instruments were under development for Resource Prospector; NASA also included both in a list of a dozen instruments selected in February to land on the moon as early as this year. Those projects are the Neutron Spectrometer System, which measures hydrogen in the lunar surface; and the Near-Infrared Volatile Spectrometer System, or NIRVSS, which can study volatile composition, mineralogy and surface temperature. A third instrument NASA is eyeing for VIPER is a drill designed to reach about 3 feet into the lunar regolith. Scientists have glimpsed below the moon's surface before: Astronauts on the later Apollo missions also carried a drill, and they returned subsurface samples to Earth. But volatiles literally get their name from their ability to easily evaporate away, so scientists can't be sure what volatiles disappeared from the subsurface moon rocks they have examined up close with modern technology. VIPER would change that, as both NIRVSS and a second instrument, called Mass Spectrometer observing lunar operations, which can analyze isotopes, will conduct their analyses not only while the rover is moving but also on material that the drill pulls to the surface. NASA also wants to make sure that the findings of a mission like VIPER could stretch far beyond the small patch of lunar surface that the rover itself would explore. In particular, the agency wants to work with the U.S. Geological Survey to establish how to apply the rover's local findings to orbital data about the rest of the lunar surface, Jay Jenkins, program executive for exploration at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during a panel about NASA's commercial partnerships for lunar science at a symposium held by NASA in Huntsville, Alabama, on Sept. 12. After all, although the south pole's apparent ice cache is particularly intriguing to scientists and would-be explorers, it isn't the only water on the moon. \"Ultimately, we really are trying to ground-truth all of the orbital data that we have, in terms of volatile, extent, composition, forms, etcetera,\" Bailey said during the advisory committee meeting. Both Bailey and Jenkins said that NASA is hoping to launch VIPER in late 2022. \"It's a very aggressive schedule,\" Jenkins said. But that sort of timeline wouldn't be completely unprecedented, he added, pointing to NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, which he said was designed, built and executed within two years., LCROSS was selected in April 2006; the flight concluded in October 2009. That would make for a slightly more generous timeline than VIPER would have if it hits its launch target. LCROSS is nothing if not a success story when it comes to understanding moon water. The mission, which launched with NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, watched a rocket stage crash into the moon and studied the debris - until its own equally violent demise. The LCROSS data showed that its impact location is twice as wet as the Sahara Desert.", "url": "https://www.space.com/viper-nasa-moon-rover.html"}, {"title": "NASA developing new lunar rover to the moon to drill for water ice", "date": "2019-10-25", "content": "A new rover could roam the south pole of the lunar surface in 2022, searching for ice that NASA hopes could be used to develop rocket fuel for a voyage to Mars. The project, Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, was announced Friday by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine during a presentation at a conference in Washington. VIPER will be a key component of the space agency's Artemis program, which plans to return humans to the moon in 2024. VIPER's voyage, scheduled for December 2022, is contingent on NASA identifying a private sector partner to build a commercial rocket and a commercial lander to get it there. VIPER is, in a sense, an updated version of NASA's Resource Prospector, a lunar rover that the agency scuttled a year ago after sinking more than four years and $100 million into the project. The failure of that project led NASA to rely on commercial companies for future robotic missions to the lunar surface. To that end, Bridenstine highlighted NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services agreement with nine commercial companies - meting out $2.6 billion in delivery contracts over the next 10 years - that he hopes will yield a partner to deliver VIPER to the moon. If VIPER is successful, it could greatly impact NASA's plans to send humans to the Moon by 2024 and Mars by 2035, lofty goals Bridenstine set to recapture the agency's aspirational glory of the Apollo era. VIPER's primary directive will be to find water, a precious resource in space, that could be extracted to use for rocket fuel or oxygen for breathing. \"We're going to utilize the resources of the moon to learn how to live and work for long periods of time, and then ultimately we're going to take what we build, what we understand, the technologies, the capabilities and the architecture, and, as much as possible, we are building the architecture to be replicable at Mars,\" Bridenstine said. VIPER, roughly the size of a golf cart, will roam several miles on the lunar surface, sampling various soil environments. VIPER will use a spectrometer to detect \"wet\" areas below the surface, then stop and deploy a 1-meter ice drill to dig up soil cuttings as much as a meter beneath the surface. It will collect data over 100 days that will be used to develop the first global water resource maps of the moon. \"Since the confirmation of lunar water-ice 10 years ago, the question now is if the moon could really contain the amount of resources we need to live off-world,\" said Daniel Andrews, the project manager of the VIPER mission and director of engineering at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. \"This rover will help us answer the many questions we have about where the water is and how much there is for us to use.\" The moon was once thought to be an arid, barren surface, but previous NASA missions have radically changed that perception. In 2009, NASA crashed a rocket into a large crater near the south pole of the moon. Data from this mission and other satellites have confirmed that the moon has reservoirs of potentially millions of tons of water ice. The data showed that the lunar soil is also rich in useful materials, such as hydrogen gas, ammonia and methane. Bridenstine said the water maps could be invaluable, noting that two of the key elements found in the lunar soil - hydrogen and oxygen - could be used to produce rocket fuel. The $250 million VIPER project is a collaboration of several divisions of NASA. The agency's Ames Research Center is leading the mission's science, systems engineering, real-time rover surface operations and software development, while the Johnson Space Center near Houston is designing VIPER's hardware. The scientific instruments are provided by Ames, the Kennedy Space Center and commercial partner Honebee Robotics, which develops spacecraft technology. There are, of course, hurdles to clear before VIPER rumbles along the lunar surface. Despite NASA's commitment to working with commercial partners, it has yet to identify a company that will build the rocket to launch the rover to the moon by 2022. And while the agency races to meet the Trump administration's mandated timeline of a 2024 date for humans returning to the moon, it remains to be seen whether federal funding will materialize. Just last week, U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., and chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee for commerce, justice and science, dismissed NASA's accelerated timeline for putting humans on the lunar surface. Bridenstine acknowledged these challenges Friday. \"Everything has to go according to plan to achieve a 2024 moon landing,\" he said. \"If we make it a longer program, it is subject to political risk.\"", "url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/NASA-developing-new-lunar-rover-to-the-moon-to-14562854.php"}, {"title": "NASA is sending a rover to the moon to look for water ice", "date": "2019-10-28", "content": "NASA announced on Friday it would launch a robotic rover to the moon in December 2022 to look for water ice reserves stored on or below the surface. The mission: NASA is calling it the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER. After landing, VIPER will roam around the south pole of the moon for 100 days, using a neutron spectrometer to find signs of ice deposits below the surface. A neutron spectrometer could look for the telltale signature of neutrons that could come from hydrogen atoms in water molecules. The rover will use a one-meter drill called the Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrain, or TRIDENT, to collect underground samples and study them with other onboard instruments. Why water? Water ice could be a vital resource for the future spaceflight industry. Not only could these reserves be harvested to help run and maintain life support system for future lunar colonies, but the water could also be split into hydrogen and oxygen and used as rocket propellant for new kinds of spacecraft. However, no one is sure how much water ice is stored on the moon. (NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine himself has been known to say the moon has \"hundreds of millions of tons of water\" at times, and \"hundreds of billions\" at others.) Before it crashed, India's Vikram lander for its Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission was going to study the south pole reserves in greater detail. Private partnership: The TRIDENT drill will be built by Honeybee Robotics. VIPER will launch aboard a commercial rocket, under the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which includes more than a dozen other scientific investigations to the moon, spearheaded by American companies.

With the mission requirements now established, the VIPER team is gearing up for a preliminary design review next year, in preparation for  launch and delivery to the lunar surface in December 2022. \"This ambitious timeline was made possible because of the previous extensive technical work done for Resource Prospector,\" team members said in response to questions from Spaceflight Now. Resource Prospector, which consisted of a NASA-developed lander and rover, was canceled last year as the agency emphasized a new commercial approach to lunar exploration. NASA selected nine companies last November to compete for contracts to deliver scientific payloads to the moon using new commercially-developed robotic landers. The VIPER rover will ride to the moon on a privately-owned lander procured through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program, NASA said.

VIPER was preceded by the Resource Prospector mission concept. That was scrapped in 2018, but its instruments are being repurposed for other missions.

Data collected by the rover will help to construct global water resource maps of the lunar south pole. VIPER is expected to last about 100 days, so the rover will forego nuclear power and operate strictly via solar panels and battery power. As such, it will eventually succumb to the cold lunar night. As part of NASA's new Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program, VIPER will involve partners across and outside of the agency.

Prior to the launch of VIPER, the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, versions of these instruments will have flown as payloads on two earlier deliveries to the Moon by commercial providers under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative. The goal of these CLPS deliveries is to perform science experiments, test technologies and demonstrate capabilities to help NASA explore the Moon and prepare for human missions beginning in 2024. \"These payload deliveries under CLPS give us a 'sneak peek' of the instruments' performance in the very challenging environment of the Moon. We will study the instrument's performance carefully in order to best prepare for our own use of them on the VIPER mission, greatly reducing our own mission risk,\" said Dan Andrews, VIPER's project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. Recently, VIPER's three water-hunting instruments have been undergoing assembly and rigorous testing in preparation for upcoming CLPS launches in 2021 and 2022. At Ames, the Neutron Spectrometer System, or NSS, designed to sniff out water below the surface of the Moon, successfully sailed through a \"shake\" test to simulate the turbulent conditions of launch. Meanwhile, the Near Infrared Volatiles Spectrometer System, or NIRVSS, designed to determine the concentration of water ice, was assembled in a clean room by NASA engineers after they carefully inspected the components for cleanliness. At NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Mass Spectrometer observing lunar operations instrument, or MSolo, another water-detecting instrument, also completed a successful shake test. There are still some steps to go before the instruments are ready to send off to the delivery companies, and once they're delivered the instruments will need to be further tested on the lander systems. In 2021, Astrobotic Technology, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will deliver the first set of VIPER instruments, setting down in the Lacus Mortis crater on the near side of the Moon. The landing itself and the resulting plume of water exhaust from the lander will allow the instruments on this eight-day mission to measure how the water dissipates as the Sun climbs higher in the lunar sky and heats the ground beneath. In 2022, a second set of VIPER instruments will fly aboard the XL-1 lunar lander from Masten Space Systems, of Mojave, California.

In the extremes of light and dark found on the Moon, shadowed and lit areas are in such high contrast that any contours in the landscape are effectively invisible in the darkness. To navigate this world, VIPER's rover drivers will rely on a system of rover-mounted lights and cameras to steer clear of boulders, descend steep declines into craters and avoid other potentially mission-fatal dangers. To make sure the first-ever lighting system on a rover will reveal obstacles hiding in the shadows, the VIPER team recently tested prototypes in a high-fidelity recreation of a lunar landscape at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, where the mission is led. Tests like these are helping the VIPER mission - which in August passed the important preliminary design review milestone with NASA's Planetary Science Division and the independent VIPER review team - solve for the many unique challenges of operating on the Moon. \"We face similar challenges as any car designer,\" said Uland Wong, VIPER's navigation hardware lead and a computer scientist at Ames. \"Whether it's on a rover or the next model of sedan, a bad lighting design means a driver can't see details in the landscape. We have to pay extra attention to these challenges on the Moon because once VIPER gets there, there's no coming back.\" Other lights do exist in space, such as single LEDs inside microscopes on Mars rovers and lights that help spacecraft dock to the International Space Station. But the harsh environment of the Moon combined with VIPER's specific goals to find water in deep, dark places make this the first rover to require car-like floodlights. While Mars science objectives typically allow those rovers to operate in sunlit areas, VIPER's solar-powered mission will venture into spots that never receive direct sunlight, due to the Moon's tilt and the very low angle of the Sun at the South Pole. VIPER's lights will be arrays of LEDs and will offer the same flexibility as your car's high beams and parking lights. Mounted on a mast, two of these arrays will cast a narrow, long-distance beam. Around the base of the rover, as many as six lights will illuminate a broad area less intensely and can be turned on and off individually, as needed. During the recent testing at Ames, the team tried out several robust LED candidates to see which offered the best optical performance and how best to position them to handle backscattering, or reflection of light back in the direction from which it came. This is a dramatic problem on the Moon, because the surface is covered in powdery dust that reflects a lot of light, blinding VIPER's cameras. \"We are developing the lights in an iterative manner,\" said Wong. \"We start with some candidates and get to understand their performance though testing, then whittle them down for the best optical performance.\" Several candidate light designs were set up on tripods around the lunar test bed. A realistic lunar landscape had been sculpted out of the simulated lunar soil. The team lit this terrain as it would appear in different areas at the Moon's poles, with either very low-angle illumination simulating the Sun, or in total darkness. They turned on the candidate lights, took photos like VIPER will do one day, and are now comparing the quality of the images obtained. The Ames-based team will pass their findings on to VIPER teammates at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston where the lights will eventually be built. Together, they'll choose the top two candidates, and the one that can most easily and quickly pass the rigorous testing to qualify for spaceflight will earn the heavyweight title of first headlight on a NASA rover.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/viper-rover-will-get-driving-headlights"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA awards Pittsburgh startup Astrobotic with $200 million to send water-hunting rover to the moon", "date": "2020-06-11", "content": "NASA awarded Pittsburgh-based space robotics startup Astrobotic with nearly $200 million on Thursday for a key lunar mission, which will hunt for deposits of frozen water the moon.

The agency plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. \"The VIPER rover and the commercial partnership that will deliver it to the Moon are a prime example of how the scientific community and U.S. industry are making NASA's lunar exploration vision a reality,\" Bridenstine said in a statement on Thursday. The VIPER mission falls under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which Astrobotic has previously won funding under. Astrobotic won a nearly $80 million CLPS award last year, which will use the company's Peregrine lunar lander to put 14 research payloads on the moon's surface in July 2021. Astrobotic will use a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to launch the 2021 mission. Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said during a press conference that the choice on which rocket will launch the VIPER mission will likely be announced later this year.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/11/nasa-picks-astrobotic-to-send-water-hunting-rover-viper-to-the-moon.html"}, {"title": "NASA Viper lunar rover books a ride to the moon with Astrobotic", "date": "2020-06-12", "content": " NASA's Viper lunar rover has a ticket to the moon for 2023. The space agency announced Thursday it's selected Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic for a $199.5 million contract to deliver the rover to the south pole of our lunar neighbor. The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover is a four-wheeled vehicle designed to seek out water ice and sample the lunar soil. NASA is planning to send early versions of some of Viper's instruments to the moon before the actual rover launches in late 2023. \"We're doing something that's never been done before -- testing the instruments on the moon as the rover is being developed. Viper and the many payloads we will send to the lunar surface in the next few years are going to help us realize the moon's vast scientific potential,\" NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen said in a statement. Viper is one facet of NASA's big plans for the south pole of the moon, a place where the agency expects to find water resources that could be used by future missions. Viper will be an early robotic emissary prior to NASA's planned 2024 launch of astronauts to the moon's south pole as part of the ambitious Artemis program. Astrobotic will use its Griffin lunar lander to deliver Viper. The company has already contracted with NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services Program to send its Peregrine lander to the moon in 2021. Astrobotic was a participant in the Lunar XPrize competition to put landers on the moon and had tested a prototype lunar rover back in 2014, so it's had its eye on the pie in the sky for a long time.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/nasa-viper-lunar-rover-books-ride-to-moon-with-astrobotic/"}, {"title": "THALES ALENIA SPACE TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE VIPER, THE ROVER THAT NASA WILL SEND TO THE MOON IN THE SEARCH FOR WATER, TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY TO EARTH", "date": "2020-07-28", "content": "Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) for the delivery of the X-Band Transceiver and X-Band Diplexer, which will ensure communications for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER). A critical step to human space exploration: NASA's lunar rover will explore the South Pole of the Moon in search for water ice and other potential resources by means of its three instruments and a 1-meter (3.28-foot) drill.

In the extremes of light and dark found on the Moon, shadowed and lit areas are in such high contrast that any contours in the landscape are effectively invisible in the darkness. To navigate this world, VIPER's rover drivers will rely on a system of rover-mounted lights and cameras to steer clear of boulders, descend steep declines into craters and avoid other potentially mission-fatal dangers. To make sure the first-ever lighting system on a rover will reveal obstacles hiding in the shadows, the VIPER team recently tested prototypes in a high-fidelity recreation of a lunar landscape at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, where the mission is led. Tests like these are helping the VIPER mission - which in August passed the important preliminary design review milestone with NASA's Planetary Science Division and the independent VIPER review team - solve for the many unique challenges of operating on the Moon. \"We face similar challenges as any car designer,\" said Uland Wong, VIPER's navigation hardware lead and a computer scientist at Ames. \"Whether it's on a rover or the next model of sedan, a bad lighting design means a driver can't see details in the landscape.

But the harsh environment of the Moon combined with VIPER's specific goals to find water in deep, dark places make this the first rover to require car-like floodlights. While Mars science objectives typically allow those rovers to operate in sunlit areas, VIPER's solar-powered mission will venture into spots that never receive direct sunlight, due to the Moon's tilt and the very low angle of the Sun at the South Pole. VIPER's lights will be arrays of LEDs and will offer the same flexibility as your car's high beams and parking lights. Mounted on a mast, two of these arrays will cast a narrow, long-distance beam. Around the base of the rover, as many as six lights will illuminate a broad area less intensely and can be turned on and off individually, as needed. During the recent testing at Ames, the team tried out several robust LED candidates to see which offered the best optical performance and how best to position them to handle backscattering, or reflection of light back in the direction from which it came. This is a dramatic problem on the Moon, because the surface is covered in powdery dust that reflects a lot of light, blinding VIPER's cameras. \"We are developing the lights in an iterative manner,\" said Wong. \"We start with some candidates and get to understand their performance though testing, then whittle them down for the best optical performance.\" Several candidate light designs were set up on tripods around the lunar test bed.

As it drives across the Moon, VIPER will effectively do its thinking from both its on-board flight software as well as from ground software running from mission control on Earth. Using an engineering prototype of the rover, the VIPER team recently began putting the software through its paces on a simulated lunar terrain at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. \"We use distributed computing all the time when we use our smart phones to run mapping apps that connect to faraway servers and data centers to run the calculations,\" said Terry Fong, chief roboticist and VIPER rover deputy at Ames. \"Similarly, VIPER will perform much of its data crunching on faster computers on Earth, since we have a relatively fast connection to mission control during all rover operations.\" In November, the team began testing the software's ability to successfully execute commands with the prototype rover. Using an outdoor robotics research and development facility featuring slopes, boulders, and craters, called the Roverscape, the team had the software take the rover for a test drive. The rover performed a variety of activities, like turning in place, driving in a straight line, recording its position, adjusting the suspension, and keeping its antenna stable while moving to ensure the rover can stay in touch with Earth. The Moon-Gravity Representative Unit prototype is a stripped-down, engineering test unit that focuses on VIPER's mechanical system, which is specially designed to allow engineers to test how the rover will drive in lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of Earth's. Because of the Moon's proximity to Earth, communications delays are only a matter of seconds. VIPER's engineers are taking advantage of this to download images and other data from the rover for fast processing, rather than having to rely only on the rover's slower on-board computing, which also reduces the cost to develop the rover. Faster data processing means the mission operations and science teams can make quick-thinking decisions about the rover's path and science activities. This will speed up operations, expedite science findings and maximize what they can accomplish during VIPER's 100-day mission on the Moon's South Pole. \"In addition to the science and operations benefits, keeping a portion of VIPER's software running on Earth means engineers can take advantage of the latest and greatest in computer processing, data storage, and networking,\" said Hans Utz, VIPER rover software lead engineer with KBR at Ames.

NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission passed its confirmation review Feb. 24, the agency said in a statement. That allows the mission to move into implementation ahead of a launch scheduled for late 2023. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, project manager for VIPER at NASA's Ames Research Center, the lead center for the mission, in an agency statement. The cost of the mission has gone up significantly. At the time NASA announced VIPER in October 2019, it projected a cost of about $250 million. As part of the confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C, NASA set a formal cost commitment for the mission. NASA spokesperson Alison Hawkes said March 3 that the new lifecycle cost for the mission is $433.5 million. NASA didn't initially disclose the reason for the cost increase, but NASA officials said in June 2020 that they were postponing VIPER's launch by about a year to late 2023 to change the rover's design so it can meet the goal of operating for 100 days on the lunar surface. At the time, the agency declined to comment on VIPER's cost. In a March 5 statement, NASA said the original $250 million cost was based on the original design for the mission. \"Since 2019, the VIPER mission has evolved to support an enhanced science investigation, and additional funds have been allocated to VIPER to reflect these changes,\" such as the 100-day mission duration, an agency spokesperson said. That extended duration will allow VIPER \"to measure and map both the vertical and lateral distributions of water and other volatiles, developing a global map of resources for potential future in-situ utilization.\" VIPER is designed to land near the south pole of the Moon and investigate permanently shadowed regions that may have deposits of water ice. Any ice on or near the surface could be valuable resources, for life support and as propellant, for future human missions. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles,\" Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said in the agency statement. VIPER is based on the Resource Prospector mission that had been under development for years at Ames but canceled in 2018. Resource Prospector had a design lifetime of 14 days on the surface, versus the 100 days for VIPER. VIPER will be delivered to the moon on a commercial lander through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million CLPS task order in June 2020 to launch VIPER in late 2023. VIPER is one of six CLPS missions NASA has awarded to date, including two each to Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines and individual missions to Firefly Aerospace and Masten Space Systems. At a March 1 meeting of NASA's Planetary Science Advisory Committee, Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the Science Mission Directorate, said the first two CLPS missions are still scheduled for launch late this year. An Intuitive Machines lander will reach the moon in November, launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9, while Astrobotic's first lander, launching on United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, will arrive in December.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/viper-lunar-rover-mission-cost-increases/"}, {"title": "Moon Lander Mockup Arrives for Testing with VIPER Rover", "date": "2021-03-16", "content": "A mockup analog of the Griffin lander that will bring NASA's water-hunting Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the surface of the Moon recently arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, has a new 1,000+ sqft cleanroom, called the Surface Segment Integration and Test Facility, where engineers will assemble and outfit the rover. Located in a corner of the centre's Space Vehicle Mock Up Facility, the VIPER team recently launched the assembly of a full-scale replica of the rover. The \"assembly pathfinder\" activity will last roughly three months and serve as a dress rehearsal for the flight version. Faced with a pile of mock components and a heap of requirements for cleanliness and safety, documentation and protocols, the team is blazing a trail toward a rover that's ready for launch. This way, NASA will be as efficient as possible when the real flight equipment arrives - and avoid any unwanted surprises. \"We need to work out the bugs now,\" said David Petri, VIPER's system integration and test lead at Johnson. \"That could mean a lot of things, from discovering there isn't enough clearance in one corner of the rover to turn a wrench, to realising team members need additional training to get the job done. These are the kind of unforeseen challenges that could slow development down.\" NASA's VIPER will be built in the summer of 2022, bound for the lunar South Pole in 2023, where it will search for ice in deep, dark craters and other places to create the first water resource maps of the Moon for future space exploration. This work will help advance the Artemis program to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. All about assembly: Since this work is focused on assembly, not a functioning rover, there are no moving parts. Instead, the parts are precision-made from VIPER's designs - mostly 3D-printed, and some made out of sheet metal. The real test comes when determining the order in which the parts are put together. Should they screw part A to part B, then bolt that to part C - or join B and C, first? That's the kind of detail to know before getting too far into assembling a bookshelf, much less a spacecraft. If there's no easy solution for the assembly team, they may ask the rover's designers for small but essential changes. The current test will make that kind of adjustment possible. VIPER's new cleanroom: The year leading up to this dry run of VIPER's assembly was spent turning an ordinary workspace into a controlled workspace, or cleanroom. New air filtration units and particle counters help keep the space extremely clean. This was necessary to prevent any debris or contamination from getting into the spacecraft, where it could potentially interfere with the scientific instruments' measurements or make the solar arrays or radiator work less efficiently, for instance. A highly sensitive video fire-detection system keeps the hardware safe from flames. And everything inside the room has mitigations against creating sparks, which could damage circuit boards in the rover's sensitive electronics. There are so many things to think of when building something to meet NASA's rigorous requirements for spaceflight. How will you keep the parts super clean on their way to the workspace? Are the wrenches calibrated? Do you have every necessary nut and bolt? Has someone scheduled the quality inspectors? And so on. The assembly team works long hours to make sure all the bases are covered, but it's worth it. \"You get to work on something that's going to the Moon, and you're doing it with people who will do whatever it takes to be successful,\" said Petri. \"You don't want to let them or the mission down. And it's mutual. So, that makes it exciting!\" VIPER? VIPER is a collaboration within and beyond the agency.

The space agency's in-development four-wheeled lunar vehicle has already booked a ride to space for 2023, but it's in need of some serious candlepower to light up its destination on the moon's south pole. NASA shared a behind-the-scenes look last week at how it's developing \"the first-ever lighting system on a rover.\" The Viper team put some car-like prototype headlights through their paces at a testing site designed to simulate the lunar landscape at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, aka Viper, will be looking for water ice and taking soil samples, but it'll need to avoid what NASA describes as \"potentially mission-fatal dangers\" such as boulders. It'll also need an assist with navigating steep, dark craters. The Viper's lighting gear goals mesh nicely with NASA's definitive evidence of water on the moon and how it can be found tucked into shadowy areas. \"Whether it's on a rover or the next model of sedan, a bad lighting design means a driver can't see details in the landscape. We have to pay extra attention to these challenges on the moon because once Viper gets there, there's no coming back,\" said Viper team member Uland Wong in a NASA statement. The team is working with LED arrays mounted on a mast, some of which will be able to throw focused beams of light, and some that will light up bigger areas. NASA tested the prototype lighting systems on the simulated lunar landscape under different types of conditions expected on the moon. The team snapped pictures to compare the images and help narrow down the design for the future rover.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/nasas-moon-exploring-viper-will-be-the-first-rover-to-rock-headlights/"}, {"title": "VIPER's Many Brains are Better than One", "date": "2020-12-02", "content": "If you opened up a robot vacuum, a self-driving car, or even one of NASA's Mars rovers (which we're definitely not recommending you do!) you'd find a bunch of processors programmed with software that serve as the robot's \"brains.\" All robots have these computerized brains directing their movement and activity, but NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, will be the first off-world rover to have its brains split in two as it explores the Moon's surface in search of water ice. As it drives across the Moon, VIPER will effectively do its thinking from both its on-board flight software as well as from ground software running from mission control on Earth. Using an engineering prototype of the rover, the VIPER team recently began putting the software through its paces on a simulated lunar terrain at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. \"We use distributed computing all the time when we use our smart phones to run mapping apps that connect to faraway servers and data centers to run the calculations,\" said Terry Fong, chief roboticist and VIPER rover deputy at Ames. \"Similarly, VIPER will perform much of its data crunching on faster computers on Earth, since we have a relatively fast connection to mission control during all rover operations.\" In November, the team began testing the software's ability to successfully execute commands with the prototype rover. Using an outdoor robotics research and development facility featuring slopes, boulders, and craters, called the Roverscape, the team had the software take the rover for a test drive. The rover performed a variety of activities, like turning in place, driving in a straight line, recording its position, adjusting the suspension, and keeping its antenna stable while moving to ensure the rover can stay in touch with Earth. The Moon-Gravity Representative Unit prototype is a stripped-down, engineering test unit that focuses on VIPER's mechanical system, which is specially designed to allow engineers to test how the rover will drive in lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of Earth's. Because of the Moon's proximity to Earth, communications delays are only a matter of seconds. VIPER's engineers are taking advantage of this to download images and other data from the rover for fast processing, rather than having to rely only on the rover's slower on-board computing, which also reduces the cost to develop the rover. Faster data processing means the mission operations and science teams can make quick-thinking decisions about the rover's path and science activities. This will speed up operations, expedite science findings and maximize what they can accomplish during VIPER's 100-day mission on the Moon's South Pole. \"In addition to the science and operations benefits, keeping a portion of VIPER's software running on Earth means engineers can take advantage of the latest and greatest in computer processing, data storage, and networking,\" said Hans Utz, VIPER rover software lead engineer with KBR at Ames. Besides the use of distributed computing, VIPER also will break ground by being NASA's first planetary rover mission to make extensive use of open-source software, including key components adapted from the Robot Operating System 2, or ROS 2, considered the industry-standard in robotics development. Once the mission is over, the VIPER team intends to release the rover's software for general use. This approach allows for a rapid, agile, and cost-effective way of developing the rover's software systems that can also benefit future rovers on the Moon and beyond.", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/vipers-many-brains-are-better-than-one"}, {"title": "NASA's Next Lunar Rover Progresses Toward 2023 Launch", "date": "2021-02-24", "content": "NASA's new water-hunting mission to the Moon, the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, has received agency-level approval to move from formulation into implementation of the final design of the rover. This puts the mission one step closer to launching to the Moon's South Pole in late 2023. The decision follows VIPER passing the important preliminary design review milestone in August, in which the mission successfully demonstrated to NASA's Planetary Science Division and the independent VIPER review team that it can meet all the requirements with an acceptable level of risk within cost and schedule restraints. The mission will provide the first surface-level mapping of ice and other resources on the lunar surface to further NASA's goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon under the Artemis program. \"We're extremely pleased to see VIPER pass this important milestone,\" said Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the Moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles.\" Measuring 8 feet (2.5 meters) tall and 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length and width, this mid-sized rover is built for crawling around craters. By pioneering a new kind of wheel motion, NASA is engineering the rover to be agile enough to move through a variety of inclines and soil types - from compacted to fluffy - without getting stuck. Outfitted with sensitive instruments and a drill that can detect water molecules on and below the lunar surface, these components will allow the rover to study many characteristics of the Moon's polar water over the course of its mission, lasting up to 100 Earth days. From extreme temperatures to near-real-time rover driving, the VIPER team faces some brand-new challenges operating on the Moon - different from those tackled by previous rover missions to Mars. VIPER will be NASA's first rover with headlights, capable of exploring permanently shadowed regions of the Moon that haven't seen sunlight in billions of years. The extreme swings in light and dark at the poles of the Moon are nothing like those on Earth or Mars and produce extremely long and fast-moving shadows. The solar-powered VIPER must retreat from these advancing shadows as it seeks out the right zones to sample while maintaining communications with Earth. Periods of darkness in this lunar region can last multiple Earth days, so VIPER will periodically park in identified safe havens, where the periods of darkness are shorter. Combining all these constraints makes for complicated route planning. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, VIPER's project manager. \"This team has worked incredibly hard, through a pandemic and many other challenges natural disasters to get us to this point - we're determined now to see it on the Moon.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-next-lunar-rover-progresses-toward-2023-launch"}, {"title": "VIPER lunar rover mission cost increases", "date": "2021-03-03", "content": "A NASA rover mission to look for ice at the south pole of the moon has passed a key review, but now costs significantly more than previously advertised.

That allows the mission to move into implementation ahead of a launch scheduled for late 2023. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, project manager for VIPER at NASA's Ames Research Center, the lead center for the mission, in an agency statement. The cost of the mission has gone up significantly. At the time NASA announced VIPER in October 2019, it projected a cost of about $250 million. As part of the confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C, NASA set a formal cost commitment for the mission. NASA spokesperson Alison Hawkes said March 3 that the new lifecycle cost for the mission is $433.5 million. NASA didn't initially disclose the reason for the cost increase, but NASA officials said in June 2020 that they were postponing VIPER's launch by about a year to late 2023 to change the rover's design so it can meet the goal of operating for 100 days on the lunar surface. At the time, the agency declined to comment on VIPER's cost. In a March 5 statement, NASA said the original $250 million cost was based on the original design for the mission. \"Since 2019, the VIPER mission has evolved to support an enhanced science investigation, and additional funds have been allocated to VIPER to reflect these changes,\" such as the 100-day mission duration, an agency spokesperson said. That extended duration will allow VIPER \"to measure and map both the vertical and lateral distributions of water and other volatiles, developing a global map of resources for potential future in-situ utilization.\" VIPER is designed to land near the south pole of the Moon and investigate permanently shadowed regions that may have deposits of water ice. Any ice on or near the surface could be valuable resources, for life support and as propellant, for future human missions. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles,\" Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said in the agency statement. VIPER is based on the Resource Prospector mission that had been under development for years at Ames but canceled in 2018. Resource Prospector had a design lifetime of 14 days on the surface, versus the 100 days for VIPER. VIPER will be delivered to the moon on a commercial lander through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million CLPS task order in June 2020 to launch VIPER in late 2023. VIPER is one of six CLPS missions NASA has awarded to date, including two each to Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines and individual missions to Firefly Aerospace and Masten Space Systems. At a March 1 meeting of NASA's Planetary Science Advisory Committee, Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the Science Mission Directorate, said the first two CLPS missions are still scheduled for launch late this year. An Intuitive Machines lander will reach the moon in November, launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9, while Astrobotic's first lander, launching on United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, will arrive in December.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/viper-lunar-rover-mission-cost-increases/"}, {"title": "Moon Lander Mockup Arrives for Testing with VIPER Rover", "date": "2021-03-16", "content": "A mockup analog of the Griffin lander that will bring NASA's water-hunting Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the surface of the Moon recently arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The NASA team will use a VIPER test unit with the lander mockup to practice departing off the lander. Additionally, a full-scale VIPER model will be used to demonstrate the physical integration of VIPER to the lander. The Griffin lander mockup is housed in Johnson's Space Vehicle Mockup Facility, near the clean room where the VIPER flight vehicle is scheduled to be built in 2022 and launch to the Moon in 2023.

The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, has a new 1,000+ sqft cleanroom, called the Surface Segment Integration and Test Facility, where engineers will assemble and outfit the rover. Located in a corner of the centre's Space Vehicle Mock Up Facility, the VIPER team recently launched the assembly of a full-scale replica of the rover. The \"assembly pathfinder\" activity will last roughly three months and serve as a dress rehearsal for the flight version. Faced with a pile of mock components and a heap of requirements for cleanliness and safety, documentation and protocols, the team is blazing a trail toward a rover that's ready for launch. This way, NASA will be as efficient as possible when the real flight equipment arrives - and avoid any unwanted surprises. \"We need to work out the bugs now,\" said David Petri, VIPER's system integration and test lead at Johnson. \"That could mean a lot of things, from discovering there isn't enough clearance in one corner of the rover to turn a wrench, to realising team members need additional training to get the job done. These are the kind of unforeseen challenges that could slow development down.\" NASA's VIPER will be built in the summer of 2022, bound for the lunar South Pole in 2023, where it will search for ice in deep, dark craters and other places to create the first water resource maps of the Moon for future space exploration. This work will help advance the Artemis program to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. All about assembly: Since this work is focused on assembly, not a functioning rover, there are no moving parts. Instead, the parts are precision-made from VIPER's designs - mostly 3D-printed, and some made out of sheet metal. The real test comes when determining the order in which the parts are put together. Should they screw part A to part B, then bolt that to part C - or join B and C, first? That's the kind of detail to know before getting too far into assembling a bookshelf, much less a spacecraft. If there's no easy solution for the assembly team, they may ask the rover's designers for small but essential changes. The current test will make that kind of adjustment possible. VIPER's new cleanroom: The year leading up to this dry run of VIPER's assembly was spent turning an ordinary workspace into a controlled workspace, or cleanroom. New air filtration units and particle counters help keep the space extremely clean. This was necessary to prevent any debris or contamination from getting into the spacecraft, where it could potentially interfere with the scientific instruments' measurements or make the solar arrays or radiator work less efficiently, for instance. A highly sensitive video fire-detection system keeps the hardware safe from flames. And everything inside the room has mitigations against creating sparks, which could damage circuit boards in the rover's sensitive electronics. There are so many things to think of when building something to meet NASA's rigorous requirements for spaceflight. How will you keep the parts super clean on their way to the workspace? Are the wrenches calibrated? Do you have every necessary nut and bolt? Has someone scheduled the quality inspectors? And so on. The assembly team works long hours to make sure all the bases are covered, but it's worth it. \"You get to work on something that's going to the Moon, and you're doing it with people who will do whatever it takes to be successful,\" said Petri. \"You don't want to let them or the mission down. And it's mutual. So, that makes it exciting!\" VIPER? VIPER is a collaboration within and beyond the agency.

Astrobotic announced April 13 that it selected SpaceX's Falcon Heavy for its Griffin Mission 1 lunar lander mission, which will deliver the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover spacecraft to the south pole of the moon in late 2023. Astrobotic won a NASA competition through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program last year to transport VIPER on its Griffin lunar lander. \"Getting to the moon isn't just about building a spacecraft, but having a complete mission solution. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy completes our Griffin Mission 1 solution by providing a proven launch vehicle to carry us on our trajectory to the moon,\" Daniel Gillies, director of Griffin Mission 1 at Astrobotic, said in a statement. Astrobotic declined to disclose the terms of the deal. SpaceX publishes a list price of $90 million on its website for Falcon Heavy, although some government contracts for Falcon Heavy missions have been significantly more expensive. Astrobotic also declined to identify what other launch options it considered for the mission. VIPER is a NASA mission to investigate permanently shadowed regions of craters at the lunar south pole that may contain deposits of water ice that could serve as resources for future crewed missions. It is designed to operate for 100 days after landing. NASA originally planned to launch VIPER in 2022, with a mission cost of $250 million. However, NASA postponed the launch to late 2023 to provde more time for work to increase VIPER's mission life from 14 to 100 days. That, in turn, drove up the cost of VIPER to $433.5 million, NASA disclosed in March. VIPER is the biggest mission that is part of CLPS, a NASA initiative to purchase payload accommodations on commercial lunar landers. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million task order in June 2020 to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface on its Griffin lander. Most of the landers flying CLPS missions selected to date will launch on SpaceX. Intuitive Machines, which won CLPS task orders for two lander missions, will launch each on Falcon 9 vehicles late this year and in 2022. Masten Space Systems selected SpaceX to provide launch services for its XL-1 lander mission, which won a CLPS award for a late 2022 mission. Astrobotic will launch its first CLPS mission, a smaller lunar lander called Peregrine, on the inaugural launch of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur currently scheduled for late this year. Firefly Aerospace, which won the most recent CLPS award in January, has not selected a launch provider yet for its Blue Ghost lander, but noted the lander is too large to launch on the company's own Alpha rocket. The Astrobotic contract adds to a growing backlog for the Falcon Heavy, which has not flown since the Space Test Program 2 mission in June 2019. The next Falcon Heavy launch is expected no earlier than July, carrying a classified payload for the U.S. Space Force. Another Falcon Heavy launch for the Space Force is scheduled for late this year. SpaceX has won NASA contracts for Falcon Heavy, including the launch of the Psyche mission the metallic asteroid of the same name in 2022 and, in February, the first two elements of the lunar Gateway in 2024. Falcon Heavy is also the front-runner for the ongoing competition to launch the Europa Clipper mission after NASA concluded that mission could not launch on the Space Launch System as originally planned. Gillies, the Astrobotic manager for Griffin Mission 1, previously worked at SpaceX, where he was a mission integrator for the STP-2 Falcon Heavy launch. \"Having previously sat on the other side of the table as a former SpaceX mission manager, I am fully aware of SpaceX's capabilities and processes and am excited to be working with SpaceX on a mission once again,\" he said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/astrobotic-selects-falcon-heavy-to-launch-nasas-viper-lunar-rover/"}, {"title": "NASA's next lunar rover will run open-source software", "date": "2021-04-12", "content": "In 2023, NASA will launch VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover), which will trek across the surface of the moon and hunt for water ice that could one day be used to make rocket fuel.

But while much of VIPER is one of a kind, custom-made for the mission, much of the software that it's running is open-source, meaning it's available for use, modification, and distribution by anyone for any purpose. If it's successful, the mission may be about more than just laying the groundwork for a future lunar colony\u2014it may also be an inflection point that causes the space industry to think differently about how it develops and operates robots. Open-source tech rarely comes to mind when we talk about space missions. It takes a tremendous amount of money to build something that can be launched into space, make its way to its proper destination, and then fulfill a specific set of tasks hundreds or thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of miles away. Keeping the know-how to pull those things off close to one's chest is a natural inclination. Open-source software, meanwhile, is more usually associated with scrappy programming for smaller projects, like hackathons or student demos. The code that fills online repositories like GitHub is often an inexpensive solution for groups running low on cash and resources needed to build code from scratch.

All about assembly: Since this work is focused on assembly, not a functioning rover, there are no moving parts. Instead, the parts are precision-made from VIPER's designs - mostly 3D-printed, and some made out of sheet metal. The real test comes when determining the order in which the parts are put together. Should they screw part A to part B, then bolt that to part C - or join B and C, first? That's the kind of detail to know before getting too far into assembling a bookshelf, much less a spacecraft. If there's no easy solution for the assembly team, they may ask the rover's designers for small but essential changes. The current test will make that kind of adjustment possible. VIPER's new cleanroom: The year leading up to this dry run of VIPER's assembly was spent turning an ordinary workspace into a controlled workspace, or cleanroom. New air filtration units and particle counters help keep the space extremely clean. This was necessary to prevent any debris or contamination from getting into the spacecraft, where it could potentially interfere with the scientific instruments' measurements or make the solar arrays or radiator work less efficiently, for instance. A highly sensitive video fire-detection system keeps the hardware safe from flames. And everything inside the room has mitigations against creating sparks, which could damage circuit boards in the rover's sensitive electronics. There are so many things to think of when building something to meet NASA's rigorous requirements for spaceflight. How will you keep the parts super clean on their way to the workspace? Are the wrenches calibrated? Do you have every necessary nut and bolt? Has someone scheduled the quality inspectors? And so on. The assembly team works long hours to make sure all the bases are covered, but it's worth it. \"You get to work on something that's going to the Moon, and you're doing it with people who will do whatever it takes to be successful,\" said Petri. \"You don't want to let them or the mission down.

VIPER is a NASA mission to investigate permanently shadowed regions of craters at the lunar south pole that may contain deposits of water ice that could serve as resources for future crewed missions. It is designed to operate for 100 days after landing. NASA originally planned to launch VIPER in 2022, with a mission cost of $250 million. However, NASA postponed the launch to late 2023 to provde more time for work to increase VIPER's mission life from 14 to 100 days.

VIPER is the biggest mission that is part of CLPS, a NASA initiative to purchase payload accommodations on commercial lunar landers. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million task order in June 2020 to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface on its Griffin lander. Most of the landers flying CLPS missions selected to date will launch on SpaceX.

This puts the mission one step closer to launching to the Moon's South Pole in late 2023. The decision follows VIPER passing the important preliminary design review milestone in August, in which the mission successfully demonstrated to NASA's Planetary Science Division and the independent VIPER review team that it can meet all the requirements with an acceptable level of risk within cost and schedule restraints. The mission will provide the first surface-level mapping of ice and other resources on the lunar surface to further NASA's goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon under the Artemis program. \"We're extremely pleased to see VIPER pass this important milestone,\" said Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the Moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles.\" Measuring 8 feet (2.5 meters) tall and 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length and width, this mid-sized rover is built for crawling around craters. By pioneering a new kind of wheel motion, NASA is engineering the rover to be agile enough to move through a variety of inclines and soil types - from compacted to fluffy - without getting stuck. Outfitted with sensitive instruments and a drill that can detect water molecules on and below the lunar surface, these components will allow the rover to study many characteristics of the Moon's polar water over the course of its mission, lasting up to 100 Earth days. From extreme temperatures to near-real-time rover driving, the VIPER team faces some brand-new challenges operating on the Moon - different from those tackled by previous rover missions to Mars. VIPER will be NASA's first rover with headlights, capable of exploring permanently shadowed regions of the Moon that haven't seen sunlight in billions of years. The extreme swings in light and dark at the poles of the Moon are nothing like those on Earth or Mars and produce extremely long and fast-moving shadows. The solar-powered VIPER must retreat from these advancing shadows as it seeks out the right zones to sample while maintaining communications with Earth. Periods of darkness in this lunar region can last multiple Earth days, so VIPER will periodically park in identified safe havens, where the periods of darkness are shorter. Combining all these constraints makes for complicated route planning. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, VIPER's project manager. \"This team has worked incredibly hard, through a pandemic and many other challenges natural disasters to get us to this point - we're determined now to see it on the Moon.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-next-lunar-rover-progresses-toward-2023-launch"}, {"title": "VIPER lunar rover mission cost increases", "date": "2021-03-03", "content": "A NASA rover mission to look for ice at the south pole of the moon has passed a key review, but now costs significantly more than previously advertised. NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission passed its confirmation review Feb. 24, the agency said in a statement. That allows the mission to move into implementation ahead of a launch scheduled for late 2023. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, project manager for VIPER at NASA's Ames Research Center, the lead center for the mission, in an agency statement. The cost of the mission has gone up significantly. At the time NASA announced VIPER in October 2019, it projected a cost of about $250 million. As part of the confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C, NASA set a formal cost commitment for the mission. NASA spokesperson Alison Hawkes said March 3 that the new lifecycle cost for the mission is $433.5 million. NASA didn't initially disclose the reason for the cost increase, but NASA officials said in June 2020 that they were postponing VIPER's launch by about a year to late 2023 to change the rover's design so it can meet the goal of operating for 100 days on the lunar surface. At the time, the agency declined to comment on VIPER's cost. In a March 5 statement, NASA said the original $250 million cost was based on the original design for the mission. \"Since 2019, the VIPER mission has evolved to support an enhanced science investigation, and additional funds have been allocated to VIPER to reflect these changes,\" such as the 100-day mission duration, an agency spokesperson said. That extended duration will allow VIPER \"to measure and map both the vertical and lateral distributions of water and other volatiles, developing a global map of resources for potential future in-situ utilization.\" VIPER is designed to land near the south pole of the Moon and investigate permanently shadowed regions that may have deposits of water ice. Any ice on or near the surface could be valuable resources, for life support and as propellant, for future human missions. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles,\" Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said in the agency statement. VIPER is based on the Resource Prospector mission that had been under development for years at Ames but canceled in 2018. Resource Prospector had a design lifetime of 14 days on the surface, versus the 100 days for VIPER.

By pioneering a new kind of wheel motion, NASA is engineering the rover to be agile enough to move through a variety of inclines and soil types - from compacted to fluffy - without getting stuck. Outfitted with sensitive instruments and a drill that can detect water molecules on and below the lunar surface, these components will allow the rover to study many characteristics of the Moon's polar water over the course of its mission, lasting up to 100 Earth days. From extreme temperatures to near-real-time rover driving, the VIPER team faces some brand-new challenges operating on the Moon - different from those tackled by previous rover missions to Mars. VIPER will be NASA's first rover with headlights, capable of exploring permanently shadowed regions of the Moon that haven't seen sunlight in billions of years. The extreme swings in light and dark at the poles of the Moon are nothing like those on Earth or Mars and produce extremely long and fast-moving shadows. The solar-powered VIPER must retreat from these advancing shadows as it seeks out the right zones to sample while maintaining communications with Earth. Periods of darkness in this lunar region can last multiple Earth days, so VIPER will periodically park in identified safe havens, where the periods of darkness are shorter. Combining all these constraints makes for complicated route planning. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, VIPER's project manager. \"This team has worked incredibly hard, through a pandemic and many other challenges natural disasters to get us to this point - we're determined now to see it on the Moon.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-next-lunar-rover-progresses-toward-2023-launch"}, {"title": "VIPER lunar rover mission cost increases", "date": "2021-03-03", "content": "A NASA rover mission to look for ice at the south pole of the moon has passed a key review, but now costs significantly more than previously advertised. NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission passed its confirmation review Feb. 24, the agency said in a statement. That allows the mission to move into implementation ahead of a launch scheduled for late 2023. \"We're now ready to finish the design and operational planning for this rover, and then start building it,\" said Daniel Andrews, project manager for VIPER at NASA's Ames Research Center, the lead center for the mission, in an agency statement. The cost of the mission has gone up significantly. At the time NASA announced VIPER in October 2019, it projected a cost of about $250 million. As part of the confirmation review, known as Key Decision Point C, NASA set a formal cost commitment for the mission. NASA spokesperson Alison Hawkes said March 3 that the new lifecycle cost for the mission is $433.5 million. NASA didn't initially disclose the reason for the cost increase, but NASA officials said in June 2020 that they were postponing VIPER's launch by about a year to late 2023 to change the rover's design so it can meet the goal of operating for 100 days on the lunar surface. At the time, the agency declined to comment on VIPER's cost. In a March 5 statement, NASA said the original $250 million cost was based on the original design for the mission. \"Since 2019, the VIPER mission has evolved to support an enhanced science investigation, and additional funds have been allocated to VIPER to reflect these changes,\" such as the 100-day mission duration, an agency spokesperson said. That extended duration will allow VIPER \"to measure and map both the vertical and lateral distributions of water and other volatiles, developing a global map of resources for potential future in-situ utilization.\" VIPER is designed to land near the south pole of the Moon and investigate permanently shadowed regions that may have deposits of water ice. Any ice on or near the surface could be valuable resources, for life support and as propellant, for future human missions. \"Scientific data gathered by VIPER will provide insight into the origin and distribution of water on the moon, and help us prepare for human exploration by providing important information on the traversability, environment, and resources at the lunar poles,\" Sarah Noble, VIPER program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said in the agency statement. VIPER is based on the Resource Prospector mission that had been under development for years at Ames but canceled in 2018. Resource Prospector had a design lifetime of 14 days on the surface, versus the 100 days for VIPER. VIPER will be delivered to the moon on a commercial lander through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million CLPS task order in June 2020 to launch VIPER in late 2023. VIPER is one of six CLPS missions NASA has awarded to date, including two each to Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines and individual missions to Firefly Aerospace and Masten Space Systems. At a March 1 meeting of NASA's Planetary Science Advisory Committee, Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the Science Mission Directorate, said the first two CLPS missions are still scheduled for launch late this year. An Intuitive Machines lander will reach the moon in November, launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9, while Astrobotic's first lander, launching on United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, will arrive in December.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/viper-lunar-rover-mission-cost-increases/"}, {"title": "Moon Lander Mockup Arrives for Testing with VIPER Rover", "date": "2021-03-16", "content": "A mockup analog of the Griffin lander that will bring NASA's water-hunting Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the surface of the Moon recently arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, has a new 1,000+ sqft cleanroom, called the Surface Segment Integration and Test Facility, where engineers will assemble and outfit the rover. Located in a corner of the centre's Space Vehicle Mock Up Facility, the VIPER team recently launched the assembly of a full-scale replica of the rover. The \"assembly pathfinder\" activity will last roughly three months and serve as a dress rehearsal for the flight version. Faced with a pile of mock components and a heap of requirements for cleanliness and safety, documentation and protocols, the team is blazing a trail toward a rover that's ready for launch. This way, NASA will be as efficient as possible when the real flight equipment arrives - and avoid any unwanted surprises. \"We need to work out the bugs now,\" said David Petri, VIPER's system integration and test lead at Johnson. \"That could mean a lot of things, from discovering there isn't enough clearance in one corner of the rover to turn a wrench, to realising team members need additional training to get the job done. These are the kind of unforeseen challenges that could slow development down.\" NASA's VIPER will be built in the summer of 2022, bound for the lunar South Pole in 2023, where it will search for ice in deep, dark craters and other places to create the first water resource maps of the Moon for future space exploration. This work will help advance the Artemis program to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. All about assembly: Since this work is focused on assembly, not a functioning rover, there are no moving parts. Instead, the parts are precision-made from VIPER's designs - mostly 3D-printed, and some made out of sheet metal. The real test comes when determining the order in which the parts are put together. Should they screw part A to part B, then bolt that to part C - or join B and C, first? That's the kind of detail to know before getting too far into assembling a bookshelf, much less a spacecraft. If there's no easy solution for the assembly team, they may ask the rover's designers for small but essential changes. The current test will make that kind of adjustment possible. VIPER's new cleanroom: The year leading up to this dry run of VIPER's assembly was spent turning an ordinary workspace into a controlled workspace, or cleanroom. New air filtration units and particle counters help keep the space extremely clean. This was necessary to prevent any debris or contamination from getting into the spacecraft, where it could potentially interfere with the scientific instruments' measurements or make the solar arrays or radiator work less efficiently, for instance. A highly sensitive video fire-detection system keeps the hardware safe from flames. And everything inside the room has mitigations against creating sparks, which could damage circuit boards in the rover's sensitive electronics. There are so many things to think of when building something to meet NASA's rigorous requirements for spaceflight. How will you keep the parts super clean on their way to the workspace? Are the wrenches calibrated? Do you have every necessary nut and bolt? Has someone scheduled the quality inspectors? And so on. The assembly team works long hours to make sure all the bases are covered, but it's worth it. \"You get to work on something that's going to the Moon, and you're doing it with people who will do whatever it takes to be successful,\" said Petri. \"You don't want to let them or the mission down. And it's mutual. So, that makes it exciting!\" VIPER? VIPER is a collaboration within and beyond the agency. VIPER is part of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program and is managed by the Planetary Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley is managing the project, leading the mission's science, systems engineering, real-time rover surface operations and flight software.

Astrobotic declined to disclose the terms of the deal. SpaceX publishes a list price of $90 million on its website for Falcon Heavy, although some government contracts for Falcon Heavy missions have been significantly more expensive. Astrobotic also declined to identify what other launch options it considered for the mission. VIPER is a NASA mission to investigate permanently shadowed regions of craters at the lunar south pole that may contain deposits of water ice that could serve as resources for future crewed missions. It is designed to operate for 100 days after landing. NASA originally planned to launch VIPER in 2022, with a mission cost of $250 million. However, NASA postponed the launch to late 2023 to provde more time for work to increase VIPER's mission life from 14 to 100 days. That, in turn, drove up the cost of VIPER to $433.5 million, NASA disclosed in March. VIPER is the biggest mission that is part of CLPS, a NASA initiative to purchase payload accommodations on commercial lunar landers. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million task order in June 2020 to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface on its Griffin lander. Most of the landers flying CLPS missions selected to date will launch on SpaceX. Intuitive Machines, which won CLPS task orders for two lander missions, will launch each on Falcon 9 vehicles late this year and in 2022. Masten Space Systems selected SpaceX to provide launch services for its XL-1 lander mission, which won a CLPS award for a late 2022 mission. Astrobotic will launch its first CLPS mission, a smaller lunar lander called Peregrine, on the inaugural launch of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur currently scheduled for late this year. Firefly Aerospace, which won the most recent CLPS award in January, has not selected a launch provider yet for its Blue Ghost lander, but noted the lander is too large to launch on the company's own Alpha rocket. The Astrobotic contract adds to a growing backlog for the Falcon Heavy, which has not flown since the Space Test Program 2 mission in June 2019. The next Falcon Heavy launch is expected no earlier than July, carrying a classified payload for the U.S. Space Force. Another Falcon Heavy launch for the Space Force is scheduled for late this year. SpaceX has won NASA contracts for Falcon Heavy, including the launch of the Psyche mission the metallic asteroid of the same name in 2022 and, in February, the first two elements of the lunar Gateway in 2024. Falcon Heavy is also the front-runner for the ongoing competition to launch the Europa Clipper mission after NASA concluded that mission could not launch on the Space Launch System as originally planned. Gillies, the Astrobotic manager for Griffin Mission 1, previously worked at SpaceX, where he was a mission integrator for the STP-2 Falcon Heavy launch. \"Having previously sat on the other side of the table as a former SpaceX mission manager, I am fully aware of SpaceX's capabilities and processes and am excited to be working with SpaceX on a mission once again,\" he said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/astrobotic-selects-falcon-heavy-to-launch-nasas-viper-lunar-rover/"}, {"title": "NASA's next lunar rover will run open-source software", "date": "2021-04-12", "content": "In 2023, NASA will launch VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover), which will trek across the surface of the moon and hunt for water ice that could one day be used to make rocket fuel.

But while much of VIPER is one of a kind, custom-made for the mission, much of the software that it's running is open-source, meaning it's available for use, modification, and distribution by anyone for any purpose. If it's successful, the mission may be about more than just laying the groundwork for a future lunar colony\u2014it may also be an inflection point that causes the space industry to think differently about how it develops and operates robots. Open-source tech rarely comes to mind when we talk about space missions. It takes a tremendous amount of money to build something that can be launched into space, make its way to its proper destination, and then fulfill a specific set of tasks hundreds or thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of miles away. Keeping the know-how to pull those things off close to one's chest is a natural inclination. Open-source software, meanwhile, is more usually associated with scrappy programming for smaller projects, like hackathons or student demos. The code that fills online repositories like GitHub is often an inexpensive solution for groups running low on cash and resources needed to build code from scratch.

Using a full-scale model of the Griffin lander that will deliver VIPER to the Moon, the team evaluated how well a rover test unit was able to move on the ramps. The results showed ways NASA's partner, Astrobotic of Pittsburgh, can modify the ramp designs. This will ensure the rover can maneuver on them - keeping its wheels within the guardrails, for example - and make a flawless exit onto the Moon. Different materials were also tested on the surface of the ramps. These tests will help inform the designers about what qualities help the rover's wheels move smoothly and securely. VIPER successfully descended the ramps on a textured aluminum surface, high-friction sandpaper, and a high-friction elastomer - a polymer with elastic properties.

The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, is NASA's first mobile robotic rover mission to the Moon. VIPER will rely on Moog's radiation-hardened avionics technology to control the rover during its 100-day mission. The Integrated Avionics Unit (IAU) and Spacecraft Energization and Power Interfacing Assembly (SEPIA) will be the main computer and power management source for VIPER, essentially the \"brains\" of the rover. Moog's IAU combines traditional command and data handling and electric power subsystem functions. The IAU controls VIPER's instruments for command, telemetry, heaters, and temperature/voltage/current sensors. In addition, the Moog equipment provides radiation-tolerant image processing and storage that will guide VIPER's maneuvers across the lunar surface. The IAU and SEPIA will also manage the solar array, battery charging, and power distribution that support the large power requirements needed for wheel motor control and drilling capabilities. A particularly unique capability of the Moog equipment is the very low-power hibernation mode that will allow VIPER to survive the challenging prolonged lunar nights throughout the mission. VIPER represents the first resource mapping mission on another celestial body. It will determine the concentration of water and ice that could eventually be harvested to sustain human exploration. This data will be instrumental in determining possible future landing sites for the NASA Artemis program, which will return Americans to the moon. VIPER is set to land on the lunar surface in late 2023 under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.

Astrobotic announced April 13 that it selected SpaceX's Falcon Heavy for its Griffin Mission 1 lunar lander mission, which will deliver the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover spacecraft to the south pole of the moon in late 2023. Astrobotic won a NASA competition through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program last year to transport VIPER on its Griffin lunar lander. \"Getting to the moon isn't just about building a spacecraft, but having a complete mission solution. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy completes our Griffin Mission 1 solution by providing a proven launch vehicle to carry us on our trajectory to the moon,\" Daniel Gillies, director of Griffin Mission 1 at Astrobotic, said in a statement. Astrobotic declined to disclose the terms of the deal. SpaceX publishes a list price of $90 million on its website for Falcon Heavy, although some government contracts for Falcon Heavy missions have been significantly more expensive. Astrobotic also declined to identify what other launch options it considered for the mission. VIPER is a NASA mission to investigate permanently shadowed regions of craters at the lunar south pole that may contain deposits of water ice that could serve as resources for future crewed missions. It is designed to operate for 100 days after landing. NASA originally planned to launch VIPER in 2022, with a mission cost of $250 million. However, NASA postponed the launch to late 2023 to provde more time for work to increase VIPER's mission life from 14 to 100 days. That, in turn, drove up the cost of VIPER to $433.5 million, NASA disclosed in March. VIPER is the biggest mission that is part of CLPS, a NASA initiative to purchase payload accommodations on commercial lunar landers. Astrobotic won a $199.5 million task order in June 2020 to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface on its Griffin lander. Most of the landers flying CLPS missions selected to date will launch on SpaceX. Intuitive Machines, which won CLPS task orders for two lander missions, will launch each on Falcon 9 vehicles late this year and in 2022.

VIPER, an important part of the Artemis program, is a golf cart-sized rover that will roam several miles across the South Pole of the Moon to get a close- up view of the location and concentration of ice during its approximately 100-day mission. The Artemis program will accomplish many \"firsts\" for NASA and the global space community. VIPER is NASA's first lunar robotic rover, and is the first resource-mapping mission on the surface of another celestial body. Additionally, the thermal control system developed jointly by ACT and NASA will be the first to maintain operation for a 100-day mission while in shadowed conditions. \"It's exciting to demonstrate some of the best passive thermal management solutions on such an important mission,\" said Bill Anderson, Chief Engineer at ACT. For this contract, Advanced Cooling Technologies will deliver a combination of high-performance, passive thermal technologies specifically designed to meet the challenges associated with a long-term lunar mission. In addition to the flight articles, ACT will be providing system and sub- system level thermal analysis, verification, and thermal testing in coordination with the teams at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. All flight articles will be delivered by June 2022, meeting NASA's critical launch schedule. The image below shows a mock-up of VIPER and various aspects of the thermal control hardware developed during the Engineering Demonstration Phase. As referenced above, one of the most challenging aspects of VIPER's mission is operating in shadowed conditions. Due to the slow rotation of the lunar surface relative to the sun, the environmental temperature drops to below 100K for approximately 14 earth days. This condition has been avoided in the past, including the Apollo mission which landed in the lunar morning. To enable long-duration science missions on the lunar surface it is necessary to maintain the electronics above survival temperature while in shadows. The hardware ACT is developing reduces the amount of survival heat needed by an order of magnitude - from 100s of Watts to 10s. This significantly reduces the amount of solar power generation and mass required on the rover; ultimately extending life and functionality. This program is a follow-on effort to an Engineering Demonstration program that concluded earlier this year. During that phase, ACT validated the performance of the thermal hardware and provided Engineering Demonstration Units to NASA for further testing. The collaboration between NASA and ACT dates back over a decade, nearly to ACT's inception as a company in 2003. Many of the mission-critical technologies controlling the temperature on VIPER were developed through the Small Business Innovation Research program and stemmed from original development programs over a decade ago. \"NASA and ACT have been working for many years developing these technologies and the team is thrilled to get the chance to build the products that will actually fly to the Moon\", stated Ryan Spangler, ACT's Lead Aerospace Engineer. This program was also made possible by ACT's continued investment in its space system capabilities. ACT is a global leader in space heat pipe capabilities having expertise in system-level design and high quality, reliable hardware manufacturing. Over the past 5 years, ACT has dramatically increased CCHP production- achieving over 50 million Flight Hours without failure, gained space flight heritage with Space Copper-Water Heat Pipes, and progressed technology aimed for future extreme environment missions including Venus, Mars, and Jupiter .", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-awards-advanced-cooling-technologies-inc-3-7m-contract-for-viper-mission-301371728.html"}, {"title": "NASA unveils landing site on the moon for ice-hunting VIPER rover", "date": "2021-09-20", "content": "We now know where NASA's first-ever robotic moon rover will touch down. The ice-hunting Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover will land just west of Nobile Crater, which sits near the moon's south pole, NASA officials announced today. In late 2023, VIPER will fly to the moon aboard Griffin, a lander built by Pittsburgh-based company Astrobotic that will launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. \"Selecting a landing site for VIPER is an exciting and important decision for all of us,\" Daniel Andrews, VIPER project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, said in a statement. \"Years of study have gone into evaluating the polar region VIPER will explore,\" Andrews said. \"VIPER is going into uncharted territory - informed by science - to test hypotheses and reveal critical information for future human space exploration.\" VIPER is an important part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the 2020s. Achieving this goal will require the extensive use of lunar resources, especially water ice, NASA officials have said. Observations by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and other spacecraft suggest that the moon harbors lots of water ice, especially in permanently shadowed regions near its poles. VIPER is designed to ground-truth such work, telling scientists how much ice is really there and how accessible it is to humanity. The Nobile site covers 36 square miles. The 950-pound, solar-powered VIPER will measure and characterize the water ice beneath its wheels at a variety of locations throughout Nobile, including PSRs, which are among the coldest spots in the entire solar system. VIPER will do this work over the course of at least 100 Earth days using three spectrometers and a drill, which will obtain samples from up to 3.3 feet underground. \"The data VIPER returns will provide lunar scientists around the world with further insight into our moon's cosmic origin, evolution, and history, and it will also help inform future Artemis missions to the moon and beyond by enabling us to better understand the lunar environment in these previously unexplored areas hundreds of thousands of miles away,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in the same statement. The VIPER team had been considering four finalist landing sites near the lunar south pole for the four-wheeled robot. The other three were an area outside Haworth Crater; a ridgeline running from Shackleton Crater; and a spot near Shoemaker Crater, VIPER project scientist Tony Colaprete of NASA Ames said during a news conference today. All four finalist sites are intriguing, and all appear to be suitable both scientifically and logistically, Colaprete said. \"Ultimately, it came down to total number of working days,\" he said during today's news conference, explaining that a \"working day\" is one in which the rover has enough sunlight to operate and can also communicate with Earth. \"We need at least about 10 or so days to fulfill our mission requirements,\" Colaprete said. \"We get 40-plus at Nobile, and that was much greater than any of these other places.\" The total cost of VIPER's mission is expected to be approximately $660 million - $433.5 million for mission development and operations plus about $226.5 million for the delivery contract with Astrobotic, which includes the cost of launch, NASA officials have said. That delivery contract was signed via NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. While VIPER will be NASA's first uncrewed rover to hit the gray dirt, it won't be the agency's first wheeled lunar vehicle of any kind: NASA launched astronaut-driven moon buggies on the final three Apollo missions, in 1971 and 1972.

Many of the mission-critical technologies controlling the temperature on VIPER were developed through the Small Business Innovation Research program and stemmed from original development programs over a decade ago. \"NASA and ACT have been working for many years developing these technologies and the team is thrilled to get the chance to build the products that will actually fly to the Moon\", stated Ryan Spangler, ACT's Lead Aerospace Engineer. This program was also made possible by ACT's continued investment in its space system capabilities. ACT is a global leader in space heat pipe capabilities having expertise in system-level design and high quality, reliable hardware manufacturing. Over the past 5 years, ACT has dramatically increased CCHP production- achieving over 50 million Flight Hours without failure, gained space flight heritage with Space Copper-Water Heat Pipes, and progressed technology aimed for future extreme environment missions including Venus, Mars, and Jupiter .", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-awards-advanced-cooling-technologies-inc-3-7m-contract-for-viper-mission-301371728.html"}, {"title": "NASA unveils landing site on the moon for ice-hunting VIPER rover", "date": "2021-09-20", "content": "We now know where NASA's first-ever robotic moon rover will touch down. The ice-hunting Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover will land just west of Nobile Crater, which sits near the moon's south pole, NASA officials announced today. In late 2023, VIPER will fly to the moon aboard Griffin, a lander built by Pittsburgh-based company Astrobotic that will launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. \"Selecting a landing site for VIPER is an exciting and important decision for all of us,\" Daniel Andrews, VIPER project manager at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, said in a statement. \"Years of study have gone into evaluating the polar region VIPER will explore,\" Andrews said. \"VIPER is going into uncharted territory - informed by science - to test hypotheses and reveal critical information for future human space exploration.\" VIPER is an important part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the 2020s. Achieving this goal will require the extensive use of lunar resources, especially water ice, NASA officials have said. Observations by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and other spacecraft suggest that the moon harbors lots of water ice, especially in permanently shadowed regions near its poles. VIPER is designed to ground-truth such work, telling scientists how much ice is really there and how accessible it is to humanity. The Nobile site covers 36 square miles. The 950-pound, solar-powered VIPER will measure and characterize the water ice beneath its wheels at a variety of locations throughout Nobile, including PSRs, which are among the coldest spots in the entire solar system. VIPER will do this work over the course of at least 100 Earth days using three spectrometers and a drill, which will obtain samples from up to 3.3 feet underground. \"The data VIPER returns will provide lunar scientists around the world with further insight into our moon's cosmic origin, evolution, and history, and it will also help inform future Artemis missions to the moon and beyond by enabling us to better understand the lunar environment in these previously unexplored areas hundreds of thousands of miles away,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in the same statement. The VIPER team had been considering four finalist landing sites near the lunar south pole for the four-wheeled robot. The other three were an area outside Haworth Crater; a ridgeline running from Shackleton Crater; and a spot near Shoemaker Crater, VIPER project scientist Tony Colaprete of NASA Ames said during a news conference today. All four finalist sites are intriguing, and all appear to be suitable both scientifically and logistically, Colaprete said. \"Ultimately, it came down to total number of working days,\" he said during today's news conference, explaining that a \"working day\" is one in which the rover has enough sunlight to operate and can also communicate with Earth. \"We need at least about 10 or so days to fulfill our mission requirements,\" Colaprete said. \"We get 40-plus at Nobile, and that was much greater than any of these other places.\" The total cost of VIPER's mission is expected to be approximately $660 million - $433.5 million for mission development and operations plus about $226.5 million for the delivery contract with Astrobotic, which includes the cost of launch, NASA officials have said. That delivery contract was signed via NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. While VIPER will be NASA's first uncrewed rover to hit the gray dirt, it won't be the agency's first wheeled lunar vehicle of any kind: NASA launched astronaut-driven moon buggies on the final three Apollo missions, in 1971 and 1972.

The mission can now turn its attention to the construction of the rover itself, which will launch on a SpaceX Falcon-Heavy rocket for delivery to the Moon by Astrobotic's Griffin lander under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative. As part of the Artemis program, the VIPER mission is managed out of NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, and its primary objective is to get a close-up view of the location and concentration of ice as well as other resources at the Moon's South Pole. By using an onboard suite of instruments developed across the agency and with commercial partners, the mission will be able to identify and eventually map where ice and other resources exist across and below the lunar surface. This resource mapping mission will bring NASA a significant step closer to its goal of the first long-term presence on the Moon and add to our understanding of the origin of lunar water. \"The VIPER team has been focused on completing the design of this clever little mission, bringing us to this culminating review,\" said Daniel Andrews, VIPER project manager. \"With an approved design, the team now looks toward turning that design into real hardware, bringing VIPER to life in 2022.\" Construction of the rover will begin in late 2022 at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, while the rover flight software and navigation system design will take place at Ames. Astrobotic will receive the complete rover with its scientific instruments in mid-2023 in preparation for launch later that year. VIPER's Design Passed its Final Test: The CDR is the final review that focuses on the system's design. Ensuring that the rover's systems and the instruments are able to work together is no easy task. Passing the mission's CDR builds upon a series of previous Critical Design Assessments (CDA), where independent reviewers evaluated VIPER's systems individually. The earlier CDA's focused on functions such as flight navigation systems and software, thermal and mechanical systems, and more. The CDR ensured these components are all capable of working together in a fully functional robotic system ready to explore the lunar surface. Since VIPER passed its earlier milestone called the Preliminary Design Review, or PDR, the system design has evolved considerably, focusing on how to safely conduct maximum science on the lunar surface. The selection of the region west of Nobile Crater as the rover's landing site was specifically chosen to be a good match for the capabilities of the overall VIPER system while also meeting all science goals. A Design Ready to Reveal the Moon's Secrets: This final, approved rover design weighs 992 pounds in total and can travel at a speed of 0.45 miles per hour. It uses a solar-charged battery with a peak power of 450 watts and features mounted headlights - the first NASA rover to do so. Using its cameras and headlights, VIPER will navigate around hazards and traverse into craters while staying connected to Earth using the Deep Space Network. The rover and its components have been tested to endure the extreme lunar environment and answer key questions about the composition of the Moon. Using a hammer drill and three science instruments, VIPER will analyze drill cuttings for ice and other resources. VIPER will also study the soil and gasses in the lunar environment. \"Science will influence the VIPER mission in real-time unlike any mission that has come before this,\" said Anthony Colaprete, VIPER lead project scientist. \"It's exciting to have the design approved and our collective ideas realized with this mission.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/ames/nasa-s-artemis-rover-passes-critical-design-review"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA's VIPER rover to use ramps to drive off Moon Lander", "date": "2021-06-21", "content": "When NASA's water-hunting robot - the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER - arrives on the lunar surface, it will use two folding ramps to drive off the lander in style and begin exploring the Moon.

Using a full-scale model of the Griffin lander that will deliver VIPER to the Moon, the team evaluated how well a rover test unit was able to move on the ramps. The results showed ways NASA's partner, Astrobotic of Pittsburgh, can modify the ramp designs. This will ensure the rover can maneuver on them - keeping its wheels within the guardrails, for example - and make a flawless exit onto the Moon. Different materials were also tested on the surface of the ramps. These tests will help inform the designers about what qualities help the rover's wheels move smoothly and securely. VIPER successfully descended the ramps on a textured aluminum surface, high-friction sandpaper, and a high-friction elastomer - a polymer with elastic properties.

All flight articles will be delivered by June 2022, meeting NASA's critical launch schedule. The image below shows a mock-up of VIPER and various aspects of the thermal control hardware developed during the Engineering Demonstration Phase. As referenced above, one of the most challenging aspects of VIPER's mission is operating in shadowed conditions. Due to the slow rotation of the lunar surface relative to the sun, the environmental temperature drops to below 100K for approximately 14 earth days. This condition has been avoided in the past, including the Apollo mission which landed in the lunar morning. To enable long-duration science missions on the lunar surface it is necessary to maintain the electronics above survival temperature while in shadows. The hardware ACT is developing reduces the amount of survival heat needed by an order of magnitude - from 100s of Watts to 10s. This significantly reduces the amount of solar power generation and mass required on the rover; ultimately extending life and functionality.

If one fails or gets stuck somewhere, the others could carry on without it. As part of the Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) project, NASA engineers are designing compact, mobile robots the size of a shoebox (for comparison, Perseverance is the size of a small SUV) to autonomously explore the moon and other planets. These rovers will operate as a group to collect data in hard-to-reach places like craters and caves. In a demonstration mission expected in the next few years, CADRE's mini-rovers will explore the moon's massive lava tubes-areas where the top layer of soil has solidified, but lava still flows beneath. CADRE will make the trip out on a lander before being ejected onto the moon's surface. \"The idea there is that [if] we have two or three rovers that we could send, one of them could potentially go down into a lava tube,\" says Alex Schepelmann, a robotics and computational modeling engineer at NASA's Glenn Research Center. \"And we would basically know that that rover would have a hard time getting back out.\" Though the rover wouldn't be expected to come back to the surface, Schepelmann says, it could still relay information to the other members of its group. As long as the rovers could communicate with each other, the mission could continue. Onboard, each rover will carry a small computer, a wireless radio, and a stereo camera to capture 3D imagery. While none of them alone will be able to collect as much data as a larger one would, deploying several at once could reduce the risk of a catastrophic mission failure. CADRE was developed inside NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and tested by researchers at the Simulated Lunar Operations Laboratory at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. SLOPE is the same lab that tested VIPER, a mobile robot that will launch in November 2023 and scout for frozen water on the moon. One goal of the project is to prevent a recurrence of what happened to NASA's Mars rover, Spirit, back in 2009-the stuff of nightmares for space exploration enthusiasts. One of two twin rovers sent to opposite sides of Mars in 2004, Spirit delivered some of the most detailed views of the Red Planet humanity had ever seen. But five years into its mission, Spirit's wheels got stuck in soft Martian sand. NASA engineers worked for eight months to get it to move, but after multiple failed attempts, Spirit was eventually relegated to service as a stationary science platform. To make sure the new rovers don't get stuck, SLOPE simulates the unique terrains they must navigate, from the powdery soil of the moon to the rocky Martian surface. Researchers use motion capture technology involving a pair of stereo cameras to create thousands of 3D pictures used to measure each rover's speed and the movement of its tires, helping them predict how soil could react.

As referenced above, one of the most challenging aspects of VIPER's mission is operating in shadowed conditions. Due to the slow rotation of the lunar surface relative to the sun, the environmental temperature drops to below 100K for approximately 14 earth days. This condition has been avoided in the past, including the Apollo mission which landed in the lunar morning. To enable long-duration science missions on the lunar surface it is necessary to maintain the electronics above survival temperature while in shadows. The hardware ACT is developing reduces the amount of survival heat needed by an order of magnitude - from 100s of Watts to 10s. This significantly reduces the amount of solar power generation and mass required on the rover; ultimately extending life and functionality. This program is a follow-on effort to an Engineering Demonstration program that concluded earlier this year. During that phase, ACT validated the performance of the thermal hardware and provided Engineering Demonstration Units to NASA for further testing. The collaboration between NASA and ACT dates back over a decade, nearly to ACT's inception as a company in 2003. Many of the mission-critical technologies controlling the temperature on VIPER were developed through the Small Business Innovation Research program and stemmed from original development programs over a decade ago. \"NASA and ACT have been working for many years developing these technologies and the team is thrilled to get the chance to build the products that will actually fly to the Moon\", stated Ryan Spangler, ACT's Lead Aerospace Engineer. This program was also made possible by ACT's continued investment in its space system capabilities. ACT is a global leader in space heat pipe capabilities having expertise in system-level design and high quality, reliable hardware manufacturing.

Achieving this goal will require the extensive use of lunar resources, especially water ice, NASA officials have said. Observations by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and other spacecraft suggest that the moon harbors lots of water ice, especially in permanently shadowed regions near its poles. VIPER is designed to ground-truth such work, telling scientists how much ice is really there and how accessible it is to humanity. The Nobile site covers 36 square miles. The 950-pound, solar-powered VIPER will measure and characterize the water ice beneath its wheels at a variety of locations throughout Nobile, including PSRs, which are among the coldest spots in the entire solar system. VIPER will do this work over the course of at least 100 Earth days using three spectrometers and a drill, which will obtain samples from up to 3.3 feet underground. \"The data VIPER returns will provide lunar scientists around the world with further insight into our moon's cosmic origin, evolution, and history, and it will also help inform future Artemis missions to the moon and beyond by enabling us to better understand the lunar environment in these previously unexplored areas hundreds of thousands of miles away,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in the same statement. The VIPER team had been considering four finalist landing sites near the lunar south pole for the four-wheeled robot. The other three were an area outside Haworth Crater; a ridgeline running from Shackleton Crater; and a spot near Shoemaker Crater, VIPER project scientist Tony Colaprete of NASA Ames said during a news conference today. All four finalist sites are intriguing, and all appear to be suitable both scientifically and logistically, Colaprete said. \"Ultimately, it came down to total number of working days,\" he said during today's news conference, explaining that a \"working day\" is one in which the rover has enough sunlight to operate and can also communicate with Earth. \"We need at least about 10 or so days to fulfill our mission requirements,\" Colaprete said. \"We get 40-plus at Nobile, and that was much greater than any of these other places.\" The total cost of VIPER's mission is expected to be approximately $660 million - $433.5 million for mission development and operations plus about $226.5 million for the delivery contract with Astrobotic, which includes the cost of launch, NASA officials have said. That delivery contract was signed via NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. While VIPER will be NASA's first uncrewed rover to hit the gray dirt, it won't be the agency's first wheeled lunar vehicle of any kind: NASA launched astronaut-driven moon buggies on the final three Apollo missions, in 1971 and 1972.

The selection of the region west of Nobile Crater as the rover's landing site was specifically chosen to be a good match for the capabilities of the overall VIPER system while also meeting all science goals. A Design Ready to Reveal the Moon's Secrets: This final, approved rover design weighs 992 pounds in total and can travel at a speed of 0.45 miles per hour. It uses a solar-charged battery with a peak power of 450 watts and features mounted headlights - the first NASA rover to do so. Using its cameras and headlights, VIPER will navigate around hazards and traverse into craters while staying connected to Earth using the Deep Space Network. The rover and its components have been tested to endure the extreme lunar environment and answer key questions about the composition of the Moon. Using a hammer drill and three science instruments, VIPER will analyze drill cuttings for ice and other resources. VIPER will also study the soil and gasses in the lunar environment. \"Science will influence the VIPER mission in real-time unlike any mission that has come before this,\" said Anthony Colaprete, VIPER lead project scientist. \"It's exciting to have the design approved and our collective ideas realized with this mission.\"", "url": "https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/ames/nasa-s-artemis-rover-passes-critical-design-review"}, {"title": "NASA's new rovers will be a fleet of mobile robots that work together", "date": "2021-11-02", "content": "NASA is exploring a concept for a new fleet of mini-rovers that can work together to solve problems and make decisions as a unit. If one fails or gets stuck somewhere, the others could carry on without it. As part of the Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) project, NASA engineers are designing compact, mobile robots the size of a shoebox (for comparison, Perseverance is the size of a small SUV) to autonomously explore the moon and other planets. These rovers will operate as a group to collect data in hard-to-reach places like craters and caves. In a demonstration mission expected in the next few years, CADRE's mini-rovers will explore the moon's massive lava tubes-areas where the top layer of soil has solidified, but lava still flows beneath. CADRE will make the trip out on a lander before being ejected onto the moon's surface. \"The idea there is that [if] we have two or three rovers that we could send, one of them could potentially go down into a lava tube,\" says Alex Schepelmann, a robotics and computational modeling engineer at NASA's Glenn Research Center. \"And we would basically know that that rover would have a hard time getting back out.\" Though the rover wouldn't be expected to come back to the surface, Schepelmann says, it could still relay information to the other members of its group. As long as the rovers could communicate with each other, the mission could continue. Onboard, each rover will carry a small computer, a wireless radio, and a stereo camera to capture 3D imagery.

NASA said it is delaying the launch of its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover mission from November 2023 to November 2024. The rover is designed to land near Nobile Crater in the south polar regions of the moon to look for water ice, of interest to both lunar scientists and as a resource for future human missions. The one-year delay is to conduct additional ground testing of the Griffin lunar lander that Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is building to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface. NASA awarded Astrobotic a task order in June 2020, originally valued at $199.5 million, to transport VIPER as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA said that the additional tests are intended to reduce the risk of landing VIPER. To conduct the work, NASA is adding $67.8 million to the Astrobotic order that, with previous increases, brings the value of the award to $320.4 million. VIPER is by far the largest and most expensive payload assigned to a CLPS mission to date, with an official cost estimate of $433.5 million. That has clashed with NASA's \"shots on goal\" approach to CLPS where the agency has emphasized a higher tolerance of risk, and of mission failures, to keep costs down. \"VIPER is NASA's largest and most sophisticated science payload to be delivered to the Moon through CLPS, and we've implemented enhanced lander testing for this particular CLPS surface delivery,\" Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's science mission directorate, said in the agency statement. An audit of the VIPER mission by NASA's Office of Inspector General, published in April, noted that NASA instituted \"augmented oversight\" of the CLPS task order to Astrobotic given the higher cost and importance of VIPER compared to other CLPS missions. That oversight includes meetings three times a week among NASA and Astrobotic personnel to discuss issues with both VIPER and the Griffin lander. That audit also noted that NASA's decision to select a lander before finalizing the design of VIPER led to cost increases. VIPER did not complete its critical design review until October 2021, more than a year after the CLPS award, and the audit found several issues, such as an increase in mass of the rover and concerns about excess vibration, that led to changes in the Astrobotic CLPS task order that increased its value. \"Additional modifications remain a possibility, as the rover and Griffin Lander have yet to complete their designs and finalize their requirements,\" the audit stated. \"Also, because CLPS is a new acquisition model for NASA, additional revisions may become necessary as the project matures and lessons are learned.\" Another risk is that Astrobotic has yet to launch its first lunar lander mission, Peregrine. The company unveiled the lander, still in final assembly, in April, and plans to launch it as soon as late this year on the inaugural flight of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur. While Griffin is a different, larger lander, the audit noted that the landers share subsystems and any problems with them found on Peregrine's mission could affect development of Griffin.

By the time the agency awarded the CLPS task order for VIPER to Astrobotic, the agency had delayed its launch to late 2023 to enhance the rover and allow it to operate for 100 days, versus the 14 originally planned.

NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) prototype recently endured the most realistic tests to-date of its ability to drive through the most difficult terrain during its mission to the Moon's South Pole. Engineers tested the latest VIPER mobility engineering test unit, known as Moon Gravitation Representative Unit 3 (MGRU3) in the Simulated Lunar Operations (SLOPE) Laboratory at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. This MGRU3 features motor controllers specially designed for the Moon rover - a critical piece of hardware in the rover's mobility system that controls the motors that send power the rover's four wheels. \"Unlike most car engines, which uses a throttle and brake to speed up and slow down all four wheels, VIPER's motor controllers make the rover wheels turn at the force and rate the drivers want, with extreme precision to allow for better performance,\" said Arno Rogg, test director and rover systems engineer at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. \"These tests allowed us to verify the performance of the rover mobility system and know it will work well on the Moon.\" The tests also helped engineers determine how well the rover will handle challenging conditions on the lunar surface. \"We wanted to see if the rover is capable of moving forward in an extreme sinkage environment, and how much slower VIPER might drive or how much additional power the rover would use because of tricky soil conditions,\" said Mercedes Herreras-Martinez VIPER risk manager and mission systems engineering technical interchange lead at Ames. Using the latest build of the rover software, engineers also tested out the prototype's ability to \"inch-worm\" - or move its wheels in a special, caterpillar-like coordinated way that helps the rover get itself unstuck. The rover prototype also demonstrated it will autonomously stop moving if it approaches a slope that is too steep for it to climb or if it were to ever lose track of where it is on the Moon. \"We've captured a lot of data with these tests about what happens when the rover wheels grind over a rock or slip on loose terrain, and any sensor drifts - when the rover gets slightly off-course,\" said Rogg. All the Moon-like terrain and other hazards the rover prototype encountered were methodically and deliberately placed in the SLOPE lab following recommendations of the VIPER science team. The engineering test team then carefully selected the soil simulants, hand-picked rocks, and even carefully crafted the shape and size of the craters to realistically mimic actual features at the surface of the Moon's South Pole. Along with testing the rover's ability to drive over difficult terrain features, another goal was to test the rover's performance over lunar terrain the team expects the rover to encounter most of the time. \"Using data and imagery from previous lunar missions, we created various randomized scenes to mimic the surface terrain of the Moon, with craters and rocks of different sizes and shapes scattered over the SLOPE tilt bed,\" said Kevin May, rover and mission systems engineering intern at Ames who led the terrain preparation for the test. \"With help from the VIPER science team, which generated cut-out templates of crater profiles, we were able to form features out of the terrain and shape more accurate craters than ever before.

Jasper Wolfe serves as a mission systems engineer for the VIPER project, a mission to locate water and ice on the moon. \"It's a pretty big deal,\" he said. \"It's an exciting path forward for space exploration and it opens a lot of doors for sustained human presence on the Moon and to venture further out into the solar system.\" Water molecules were first discovered on the Moon in 2020, and this mission is expected to help map out where water exists, how much of it is on the Moon, and help uncover how it got there. The mission works in tandem with the upcoming Artemis mission, NASA's program to return to the moon, which is slated to launch its uncrewed mission in August. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center Thursday focused on how well VIPER can begin its journey after leaving the lunar lander. \"We're looking at how we progress down the ramp and is there any slipping,\" Wolfe said. \"We hope to have mostly very flat terrain, not many rocks, and be able to drive very fast without too many problems but we have to be prepared to go inside deep craters, big rocks, and steep terrain,\" rover systems engineer Arno Rogg said.

NASA said it is delaying the launch of its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover mission from November 2023 to November 2024. The rover is designed to land near Nobile Crater in the south polar regions of the moon to look for water ice, of interest to both lunar scientists and as a resource for future human missions. The one-year delay is to conduct additional ground testing of the Griffin lunar lander that Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is building to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface. NASA awarded Astrobotic a task order in June 2020, originally valued at $199.5 million, to transport VIPER as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA said that the additional tests are intended to reduce the risk of landing VIPER. To conduct the work, NASA is adding $67.8 million to the Astrobotic order that, with previous increases, brings the value of the award to $320.4 million. VIPER is by far the largest and most expensive payload assigned to a CLPS mission to date, with an official cost estimate of $433.5 million. That has clashed with NASA's \"shots on goal\" approach to CLPS where the agency has emphasized a higher tolerance of risk, and of mission failures, to keep costs down. \"VIPER is NASA's largest and most sophisticated science payload to be delivered to the Moon through CLPS, and we've implemented enhanced lander testing for this particular CLPS surface delivery,\" Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's science mission directorate, said in the agency statement. An audit of the VIPER mission by NASA's Office of Inspector General, published in April, noted that NASA instituted \"augmented oversight\" of the CLPS task order to Astrobotic given the higher cost and importance of VIPER compared to other CLPS missions. That oversight includes meetings three times a week among NASA and Astrobotic personnel to discuss issues with both VIPER and the Griffin lander. That audit also noted that NASA's decision to select a lander before finalizing the design of VIPER led to cost increases. VIPER did not complete its critical design review until October 2021, more than a year after the CLPS award, and the audit found several issues, such as an increase in mass of the rover and concerns about excess vibration, that led to changes in the Astrobotic CLPS task order that increased its value. \"Additional modifications remain a possibility, as the rover and Griffin Lander have yet to complete their designs and finalize their requirements,\" the audit stated. \"Also, because CLPS is a new acquisition model for NASA, additional revisions may become necessary as the project matures and lessons are learned.\" Another risk is that Astrobotic has yet to launch its first lunar lander mission, Peregrine. The company unveiled the lander, still in final assembly, in April, and plans to launch it as soon as late this year on the inaugural flight of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur. While Griffin is a different, larger lander, the audit noted that the landers share subsystems and any problems with them found on Peregrine's mission could affect development of Griffin.

That also contributed to the cost increase for the rover. ### Related ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-delays-viper-lunar-rover-launch-by-a-year/"}, {"title": "Nasa delays lunar rover mission until 2024 to allow lander development", "date": "2022-07-20", "content": "Nasa will delay the launch of its water hunting Viper Moon rover by a year in order to allow more time to develop a landing vehicle for the mission, the space agency announced on Monday. The Viper - Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover - was scheduled to launch in November 2023, but that launch date will now slip to November 2024. That will allow more time for ground testing the Griffin lander that will deliver Viper to the lunar South pole, according to the Nasa statement. Both Viper and the Griffin lander are made by Astrobiotic, a Pittsburg company Nasa contracted to build the pair through the space agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS program, which is designed to foster innovation in lunar exploration technology among private space contractors. \"VIPER is NASA's largest and most sophisticated science payload to be delivered to the Moon through CLPS, and we've implemented enhanced lander testing for this particular CLPS surface delivery,\" Nasa deputy associate administrator for exploration Joel Kearns said in a statement. About the size of a golf cart and weighing just less than 1,000 pounds, the Viper rover will use its 3.28 foot long drill to sample lunar regolith and search for water across various types of lunar terrain, including craters where deep shadows could have preserved water ice for billions of years. Better understanding where water might persist on the Moon, and in what quantities, will help support Nasa's future Artemis missions. Beginning with Artemis III, scheduled to launch in 2025, Nasa astronauts will explore the Moon's southern polar region, and may run experiments harvesting lunar water for drinking, washing and creating fuel. \"The Viper rover will teach us about the origin and distribution of water on the Moon and prepare us to harvest resources 240,000 miles from Earth that could be used to safely send astronauts even farther into space, including Mars,\" Nasa Viper program scientist Sarah Noble said in a statement.

NASA said it is delaying the launch of its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover mission from November 2023 to November 2024. The rover is designed to land near Nobile Crater in the south polar regions of the moon to look for water ice, of interest to both lunar scientists and as a resource for future human missions. The one-year delay is to conduct additional ground testing of the Griffin lunar lander that Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is building to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface. NASA awarded Astrobotic a task order in June 2020, originally valued at $199.5 million, to transport VIPER as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA said that the additional tests are intended to reduce the risk of landing VIPER. To conduct the work, NASA is adding $67.8 million to the Astrobotic order that, with previous increases, brings the value of the award to $320.4 million. VIPER is by far the largest and most expensive payload assigned to a CLPS mission to date, with an official cost estimate of $433.5 million. That has clashed with NASA's \"shots on goal\" approach to CLPS where the agency has emphasized a higher tolerance of risk, and of mission failures, to keep costs down. \"VIPER is NASA's largest and most sophisticated science payload to be delivered to the Moon through CLPS, and we've implemented enhanced lander testing for this particular CLPS surface delivery,\" Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's science mission directorate, said in the agency statement. An audit of the VIPER mission by NASA's Office of Inspector General, published in April, noted that NASA instituted \"augmented oversight\" of the CLPS task order to Astrobotic given the higher cost and importance of VIPER compared to other CLPS missions. That oversight includes meetings three times a week among NASA and Astrobotic personnel to discuss issues with both VIPER and the Griffin lander. That audit also noted that NASA's decision to select a lander before finalizing the design of VIPER led to cost increases. VIPER did not complete its critical design review until October 2021, more than a year after the CLPS award, and the audit found several issues, such as an increase in mass of the rover and concerns about excess vibration, that led to changes in the Astrobotic CLPS task order that increased its value. \"Additional modifications remain a possibility, as the rover and Griffin Lander have yet to complete their designs and finalize their requirements,\" the audit stated. \"Also, because CLPS is a new acquisition model for NASA, additional revisions may become necessary as the project matures and lessons are learned.\" Another risk is that Astrobotic has yet to launch its first lunar lander mission, Peregrine. The company unveiled the lander, still in final assembly, in April, and plans to launch it as soon as late this year on the inaugural flight of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur. While Griffin is a different, larger lander, the audit noted that the landers share subsystems and any problems with them found on Peregrine's mission could affect development of Griffin. This is not the first delay for VIPER. When the agency announced the rover mission in 2019, it was projecting a launch in late 2022 with a cost of $250 million. By the time the agency awarded the CLPS task order for VIPER to Astrobotic, the agency had delayed its launch to late 2023 to enhance the rover and allow it to operate for 100 days, versus the 14 originally planned.
