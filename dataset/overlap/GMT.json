When completed, its seven 8.4-metre mirrors will more than quadruple the power of today's best observatories. Like other multiple-dish instruments, such as the four 8-metre dishes of the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the planned Giant Magellan Telescope will take advantage of its expansive surface area to boost its sensitivity to light. But unlike the VLT, the GMT will arrange its multiple mirrors into a single \"super dish\" - with one mirror at the centre and the other six curved around it like petals. Such \"off-axis\" mirrors have never been made as large as this. The design makes the telescope's vision keener than it would be if all seven mirrors remained separate. It will have 10 times the resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope. \"The double advantage is that by making them into a single surface, you get a sharper image as well as collecting more light,\" says Roger Angel, director of the mirror lab at Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona, US. Grind and polish: Steward Observatory is home to the world's only spinning glassmaking furnace, which is now going through final warm-up before casting the first of the GMT's seven mirrors. The spinning oven uses centrifugal force to give the mirror its initial concave shape, saving greatly on the cost of glass and the time and work needed to grind and polish the mirror into its final form. Construction of the mirror's mould has just been completed, and the oven is now undergoing a pre-firing before technicians carefully load it with 18,000 kilograms of borosilicate glass made from sand gathered on Florida's Gulf coast. The glass will be heated for about a week, starting around 18 July. When it reaches 1200\u00b0C, the glass will flow like honey into the intricate mould as the 90-tonne apparatus slowly spins. Then it will gradually cool down for about 12 weeks, spinning all the while. The huge lab, built beneath a part of the university's football stadium, has previously cast two 8.4-metre mirrors for the Large Binocular Telescope now being commissioned on Arizona's Mount Graham. Angel says the GMT used the same size because a larger mirror could not be transported on ordinary roads.

The Giant Magellan Telescope, which began its design phase for the mirrors in 2005, will have 10 times the resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope, and, once operational, will equate to 100 billion people looking at the sky at one time. Once components of the telescope are constructed, they will be transported to Chile, and the entire unit will be assembled and situated atop Las Campanas peak in the Andes Mountains as part of the Las Campanas Observatory. From here, astronomers will be able to view the southern hemisphere free from light pollution and other disturbances. The 27-foot mirror was the second of seven primary mirrors to be cast since the project's inception in 2005. The remaining primary mirrors will also be cast at the mirror lab, which, according to Pat McCarthy, the project's director, is the only place this project can be done. \"The UA has just a fantastic astronomy department that has such a long history both in building telescopes and using them to do great science that they're a natural partner,\" McCarthy said. \"Under Professor (Roger) Angel, they've really developed this unique, one-of-a-kind capability to make large, astronomical optics that have just superb performance. We wanted to build a really big telescope like this and do it in a university environment; the U of A is the only place to do it.\" The casting process for one mirror takes 12 to 13 weeks. While about 20 tons of glass are used to produce each mirror, the final product is much lighter, as it is molded using a honeycomb pattern which provides a stable, yet lightweight structure. The glass is then heated to about 2,156 degrees and spun in a rotating oven where it flows as a liquid into the mold. While spinning, the mirror takes the desired concave shape, then finally becomes rigid during the 11 to 12-week cooling process. After being ground and polished, it is transported to the site by truck where it is mounted and tested. According to Peter Strittmatter, the Steward Observatory director and member of the Giant Magellan Telescope Organization board of directors, it is theoretically possible to make the mirrors larger, but mirrors with a larger diameter wouldn't fit through the mirror lab's bay door, and would be nearly impossible to transport. Funding for the $700 million project is split between partners, who usually pay 10 percent of the construction and operation costs and receive a 10 percent share for usage of the telescope, according to McCarthy. Different partners get their funding from various sources, McCarthy said. The U.S. receives its funding from gifts or financial resources within universities. Recently, a contribution of $25 million was made by George P. Mitchell, founder of the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation. Mitchell's contribution paid for the majority of the first mirror, which has been named after him. According to scientists working in the mirror lab, constructing the mirrors at the UA adds to the university's reputation and prestige as an institution known for making groundbreaking advancements and discoveries. \"We are making one of the single-most challenging and expensive parts of the telescope,\" Strittmatter said. \"It clearly continues to send a loud message to the world as to what a great place the University of Arizona is ... Like any other research field, you always have to be moving forward with more powerful instrumentation; otherwise, you get left behind with the others.

It will be able to compete with space-based telescopes like Hubble and Hershel thanks to adaptive optics, which have allowed ground-based telescopes to compensate for atmospheric distortions, thanks to the lasers and measuring the backscattering of the light. The 28-foot mirrors have just started being constructed this week. The resulting surface of the seven mirrors will emulate the capacity of a single mirror over 70 feet in diameter. In order to make each segment, 21 tons of borosilicate glass is dumped into a mold and heated up to 2,000 degrees. Once the glass starts to melt, the mold begins to spin, which causes the molten glass to flow up on the sides, forming a shallow parabola. Once the basic shape is established, the glass will be allowed to cool over 12 weeks. It will take seven more years of polishing to refine the optical surface to the required accuracy, which is about one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair. Adaptive optics use lasers or prominent light from nearby stars to measure the light's backscattering. This in turn allows the mirror to be flexed so that it cancels out the distortion.

To put that in perspective: If one of these mirrors were spread out to cover the entire continental United States, GMT officials said, there could be no bump on it more than 0.5 inches high.

To put that in perspective: If one of these mirrors were spread out to cover the entire continental United States, GMT officials said, there could be no bump on it more than 0.5 inches high. Reaching this level of near-perfection requires many months of grinding, polishing, measuring and inspecting. \"Big mirrors like this can take four or five years from start to finish,\" the Mirror Lab's Dean Ketelsen told SPACE.com. The GMT's first primary mirror is done; the object sits under a tarp here at the Mirror Lab, its reflective surface protected by a special blue film. Meanwhile, processing of the back side of mirror number two is under way, with front-side polishing scheduled to begin in 2015. The Steward Observatory Mirror Lab makes the biggest single-piece telescope mirrors in the world. With Saturday's casting, the facility has now made six 27.6-foot mirrors, officials said, including the two in operation at Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope and the primary mirror for the future Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, slated for first light in Chile in the early 2020s. The GMT is one of three giant ground-based optical telescopes scheduled to come online in the 2020s. The Thirty Meter Telescope, which will be built on Hawaii's Mauna Kea, will have a primary mirror about 98 feet across, while the European Extremely Large Telescope in Chile will be the biggest telescope ever constructed at 128 feet. \"I hope all three get built,\" said cosmologist Rocky Kolb of the University of Chicago. \"They'll all do different things, and they'll all do great science.\" The GMT project is an international collaboration involving Astronomy Australia Ltd., The Australian National University, the Carnegie Institution for Science, Harvard University, the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the Smithsonian Institution, Texas A&M University, the University of Arizona, the University of Chicago and the University of Texas at Austin.

If all goes according to plan, the megascope should begin observing the heavens early in the next decade. \"The group here on the project is basically anticipating that we will begin construction activities late this year,\" GMT director Patrick McCarthy told Space.com. \"We're going ahead full steam, aiming for that 2021 first light when the first few mirrors get up on the mountain, along with all the rest of the hardware.\" Scientists will use the enormous telescope to probe the nature of mysterious dark energy and dark matter, find and characterize exoplanets and study how the universe's first stars and galaxies came together, GMT representatives have said. Building a megascope: The Giant Magellan Telescope will be built on Chile's Las Campanas Peak, at an altitude of about 8,500 feet. The site was leveled by an excavation blast in March 2012. GMT will arrange seven 27.6-foot-wide primary mirrors - the biggest single-piece astronomical mirrors ever made - into one light-collecting surface 80 feet across. The completed scope will have 10 times the resolving power of NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope, project representatives say. The GMT design also incorporates seven smaller secondary mirrors, which will change shape to counter the blurring effects of Earth's thick atmosphere. Each of GMT's 20-ton primary mirrors must be shaped and smoothed to near perfection. Their surfaces cannot be off by more than 20 nanometers - about the width of a single glass molecule. Adding to the difficulty is the fact that six of the mirrors must be steeply curved, since they surround a central mirror. Manufacturing and polishing the primary mirrors - activities that are done at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab - have proved to be enormously challenging, McCarthy said. But one of the big mirrors is finished, while two others have already been cast. Casting of the fourth one is scheduled for next March. \"So we've dealt with that as our principal technical risk, and we've retired that,\" McCarthy said. Fundraising is another challenge. The project's total cost is pegged at $860 million, though perhaps another $100 million will eventually be needed to cover contingencies and the cost of inflation, McCarthy said.

Money is now coming in \"at a rate that makes us pretty confident that we'll manage to raise enough funds to keep the project on schedule, and that the schedule will be set by the engineering rather than by how fast we can raise money,\" McCarthy said. Big scope, big science: GMT should begin science operations in 2021 with four or five of its primary mirrors installed, then get up to full strength the next year, McCarthy said. The telescope's unprecedented light-collecting ability will likely lead to important discoveries in many different areas, he added. For example, GMT will directly image a wide range of exoplanet systems, yielding insights about faraway and exotic worlds. The telescope should allow researchers to probe exoplanet atmospheres, looking for chemical signatures that may have been produced by alien life. \"I'm not saying we'll actually see life on other planets, but we may well see the tracers that are indications of conditions that would support life on other planets,\" McCarthy said. Astronomers will also use GMT to peer at distant and ancient objects, getting a look at the universe as it existed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang - the time when the first stars, galaxies and black holes were forming. \"We want to watch that whole transition, the whole birth of the modern universe,\" McCarthy said. \"GMT will have the collecting area to allow us to do that.\" A new generation of telescopes: GMT isn't the only huge ground-based telescope that will begin operations in the next decade.

The scientists using them could make transformative discoveries, much as Galileo did when he first pointed his telescope skyward more than 400 years ago, McCarthy said.

It will reveal the first objects to emit light in the universe, explore the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter, and identify potentially habitable planets in the Earth's galactic neighborhood,\" said Wendy Freedman, chair of the Giant Magellan Telescope Organization Board of Directors and University Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. \"The decision by the GMTO partner institutions to start construction is a crucial milestone on our journey to making these amazing discoveries using state-of- the-art science, technology and engineering.\" The GMT is a global scientific collaboration, with institutional partners in Australia, Brazil, Korea, the United States, and in host nation Chile, said GMTO President Edward Moses. \"The construction approval means work will begin on the telescope's core structure and the scientific instruments that lie at the heart of this U.S. $1 billion project,\" Moses said. \"Early preparation for construction has included groundwork at the mountaintop site at Las Campanas in northern Chile, and initial fabrication of the telescope's seven enormous primary mirror segments.\" The University of Chicago became a founding partner of the Giant Magellan Telescope five years ago. Last year Freedman joined the faculty as University Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics, an appointment that reflects the University's commitment to advancing the frontiers of astronomy. \"The scale of the intellectual challenges in modern astronomy requires a truly global collaboration for this project, and we are proud to be a founding partner in that work,\" said University of Chicago President Robert J. Zimmer. \"With construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope soon to begin, our scientists and their colleagues around the world are prepared for an ambitious period of discovery.\" The construction approval was an exciting moment for astronomy, said Professor Matthew Colless, vice chair of the Board of Directors and director of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. \"Plans that have existed only in two dimensions or as computer models are about to become a three-dimensional reality in glass, steel, and high-tech semiconductor and composite materials,\" said Colless. \"The Giant Magellan Telescope will provide astronomers and astrophysicists with the opportunity to truly transform our view of the universe and our place within it.\" The Giant Magellan Telescope will provide an adventure into the unknown, said Angela Olinto, the Homer J.

The Giant Magellan Telescope's seven mirrors span 25 meters and will focus more than six times the amount of light of the current largest optical telescopes into images up to 10 times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope. The GMT will enable astronomers to look deeper into space and further back in time than ever before. The telescope is expected to see first light in 2021 and be fully operational by 2024. \"The GMT will herald the beginning of a new era in astronomy. It will reveal the first objects to emit light in the universe, explore the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter, and identify potentially habitable planets in the Earth's galactic neighborhood,\" said Wendy Freedman, chair of the Giant Magellan Telescope Organization Board of Directors and University Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. \"The decision by the GMTO partner institutions to start construction is a crucial milestone on our journey to making these amazing discoveries using state-of- the-art science, technology and engineering.\" The GMT is a global scientific collaboration, with institutional partners in Australia, Brazil, Korea, the United States, and in host nation Chile, said GMTO President Edward Moses. \"The construction approval means work will begin on the telescope's core structure and the scientific instruments that lie at the heart of this U.S. $1 billion project,\" Moses said. \"Early preparation for construction has included groundwork at the mountaintop site at Las Campanas in northern Chile, and initial fabrication of the telescope's seven enormous primary mirror segments.\" The University of Chicago became a founding partner of the Giant Magellan Telescope five years ago. Last year Freedman joined the faculty as University Professor of Astronomy & Astrophysics, an appointment that reflects the University's commitment to advancing the frontiers of astronomy. \"The scale of the intellectual challenges in modern astronomy requires a truly global collaboration for this project, and we are proud to be a founding partner in that work,\" said University of Chicago President Robert J. Zimmer. \"With construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope soon to begin, our scientists and their colleagues around the world are prepared for an ambitious period of discovery.\" The construction approval was an exciting moment for astronomy, said Professor Matthew Colless, vice chair of the Board of Directors and director of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. \"Plans that have existed only in two dimensions or as computer models are about to become a three-dimensional reality in glass, steel, and high-tech semiconductor and composite materials,\" said Colless. \"The Giant Magellan Telescope will provide astronomers and astrophysicists with the opportunity to truly transform our view of the universe and our place within it.\" The Giant Magellan Telescope will provide an adventure into the unknown, said Angela Olinto, the Homer J.

The GMT will serve as a complement to orbiting telescopes like the Kepler space observatory, which finds exoplanets by looking for dimming star light. \"It's relatively limited information,\" Patrick McCarthy, vice president of the Giant Magellan Telescope Corporation, told NBC News. \"It can't tell you how massive a planet is or what it's made of. A large telescope on the ground can tell you all of that information.\" As astronomers hunt for life on other worlds, space telescopes will look for promising planets, and the GMT will follow up with a more detailed analysis. The GMT will also take some impressive pictures, with a resolution 10 times higher in some wavelengths than those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Building a giant in the desert: Over the next decade, parts will be shipped to the construction site in Chile's Atacama Desert, which gets only 0.2 inches of rain a year in some places.

To focus images for the Giant Magellan Telescope, which is under construction in Chile, the 27.6-foot-wide concave mirrors must be curved precisely, to within 20 nanometers - the width of a single glass molecule. When completed, the telescope will return images 10 times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope. At the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in early January, Space.com caught up with the GMT's director, Pat McCarthy, as well as Buell Jannuzi, head of astronomy at the University of Arizona and director of its Steward Observatory, whose mirror lab is turning out the 20-ton glass mirrors. The duo discussed the progress of construction on the immense optical telescope and the demanding mirror-crafting process, plus the science they're most looking forward to from the telescope's start of operation, which could happen as early as 2023. Two comparable ground megatelescopes with slightly larger fields of view - the Thirty Meter Telescope, which is under construction in Hawaii, and the European Extremely Large Telescope, which is being built in Chile - will use hundreds of tiny mirrors to focus the light of the cosmos. The GMT, on the other hand, will use just seven huge ones to create the equivalent of an 80-foot focusing surface, according to the researchers. Four of the mirrors have been cast already, and only one is completely polished. Even before all of the mirrors are added, the GMT will become the biggest telescope in the world. By the time it starts to return results, several of the mirrors are expected to be in place. \"If I look at the current schedule, I suspect we'll have four, possibly five, mirrors in the telescope by then,\" McCarthy told Space.com. \"Even with four mirrors, it will be the largest telescope in the world by a factor of two. That's kind of a big deal. And when we fill it out, it'll be a factor of six or so. Even with four mirrors, we'll get pretty close to the full angular resolution.\" Even at an early stage, researchers will be able to use the telescope to peer deep into the universe's past, investigate the atmospheres of planets around other stars and search for signs of dark matter's effect on other galaxies. Back to the grind: Each mirror is produced at the Steward Observatory's mirror lab through a process called spin casting, which uses a mold so the final mirror is hollow, which keeps it lightweight and closer to the air's temperature, to avoid distortion. The molten glass and mold are spun, creating a curved surface, and then cooled very slowly before the mold material is removed from the middle. That process creates lightweight but sturdy mirrors that you can run or walk or jump on: \"You just don't drop a hammer on them,\" McCarthy said. Jannuzi and McCarthy described a detailed timeline for the mirror creation. The spin-casting process takes 12 to 14 months, and is applied to one mirror at a time. Each comes out symmetrically curved around the center, and it takes a complicated polishing process to curve the surface differently - symmetrical around the center of the full mirror array, which means an off-center curvature for all but one of them. The mirrors will beam light to a small, curved mirror suspended above them, which will redirect the light back down, through a hole in the central mirror, to be measured and recorded. \"While the segments each look like a simple round mirror, they were more difficult to make than any large optic that's ever been made,\" Jannuzi told Space.com. \"One way to think about it is, if we had a single big 25-meter 82 feet mirror - think of it as a circle - and then you have a circular cookie cutter, and you cut seven discs out of that mirror - that's what our telescope is. But each one of those circles is part of a curved surface centered at the middle.\" To get that curvature to the 20-nanometer precision required, the mirror lab uses a very slow polishing process, Jannuzi and McCarthy said. The mirror is rotated as it's polished down, but the surface must be measured over and over throughout the process to ensure the right curve at each spot. The whole process has taken seven to eight years for one mirror because polishing isn't continuous, but they're working on cutting down that time by fitting more actual polishing time into less calendar time. \"We're trying to speed up the process as fast as we can, but currently, we'll finish the fourth segment just in time to meet what I think Pat McCarthy calls 'first engineering light,'\" Jannuzi said. Researchers will be able to fine-tune the telescope's pointing and tracking, and the first major instruments likely will be installed in 2023 as well, so science can start very early on, Jannuzi and McCarthy said. \"The way we learn really how the telescope works is when people try to use it for its intended purpose,\" McCarthy said. \"I think sometime in 20 23, 20 24, we'll start doing some science, but still be spending a fair amount of time engineering.\" After that, mirrors will arrive one by one, likely yearly, until it's at full capacity, he added. Look at the sky! If the telescope is installed in time, the earliest GMT science will likely make use of a spectrograph, a device that measures the wavelengths of light returned by objects in space to figure out what they're made of. \"I think we're the only one of the giant telescopes that currently has a high- resolution optical spectrograph in its first light, first-generation set of instruments,\" Jannuzi said. He's particularly excited to see what the high- resolution spectrograph can do, and to image the newly discovered planet Proxima b. Whereas highly segmented giant telescopes with a large number of smaller mirrors can work well, they have to constantly monitor and adjust those mirrors during use to maintain focus. GMT's design, by contrast, puts the difficult work of engineering the telescope's focus earlier in the process, McCarthy and Jannuzi said. \"I like the idea of solving it in the lab, a controlled environment,\" McCarthy said. \"If you make this large surface to the right shape, that's all you have to do - whereas if you've got to control a thousand pieces of glass over 14,000 feet 4,300 m all the time, that's a different control problem in a much more hostile environment.\" But the researchers stressed that GMT isn't competing with other telescopes; in fact, it will be able to pool observations with other large observatories in the Southern Hemisphere to probe the early universe. \"There's a huge, rich world of unknown things out there to be discovered,\" McCarthy said. \"It's things like GMT, its cutting-edge new facilities, that bring out these great discoveries. We hope, once GMT is built, some clever young person comes along and does something completely unexpected with it that changes everything. That would be success.\" \"And while we're waiting for that, we'll have a lot of fun characterizing exoplanets,\" Jannuzi added.", "url": "https://www.space.com/35329-making-giant-magellan-telescope-massive-mirrors.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Here's How Giant Telescope Mirrors Are Shipped Cross-Country", "date": "2017-09-27", "content": "In 2025, the Giant Magellan Telescope will finish construction in Chile.

Born of a collaboration between Brazil, Korea and the US, and outfitted with massive mirrors and adaptive optics, this billion-dollar telescope will deliver images 10 times clearer than the Hubble when it sees first light in 2023, enabling researchers to peer further back in time than ever before. \"We build big telescopes to discover new things,\" Dr. Patrick McCarthy, vice president of operations and external relations at the GMT Organization, told Engadget. \"Astronomy is different from other sciences.\" Physicists, he points out, generally know what subatomic particle they're looking for when they construct their accelerators. However, that is not always the case when searching the skies. \"It's about looking up to the heavens and letting the heavens reveal their mysteries to us.\" Once the GMT comes online, researchers will be able to search for stuff that's \"just beyond the grasp of what we can do now,\" McCarthy continued, such as the nature of planets that orbit other stars, whether they're earthlike in their composition with water and continents, weather and biochemistry. These observations could answer questions like \"Are we alone in the universe?\" shifting the age-old quandary from the philosophy to science. The GMT will be able to deliver such high-quality data because of its enormous stature. When it opens six years from now, it will be the largest such observatory on the face of the planet. Its segmented collection area will consist of six 27-foot-wide monolith mirrors anchored around a central on-axis segment. The entire assembly will measure 80 feet across and cover 368 square meters. But for as humongous as each segment is, it is crafted with nanoscale precision and polished to within a wavelength of light. Each mirror requires nearly seven years of work to complete, Dr. Robert Shelton, president of the GMTO, told Engadget. It takes a year just to make the borosilicate glass because it's sourced from a single supplier, Japan's Ohara Corporation, which uses a method involving clay pots and proprietary chemistry. \"It takes them one year to make a mirror's worth of glass,\" Shelton explained. Once the GMT has collected enough material for a mirror, it is spin-casted on a rotating oven platform to give it its parabolic shape. After a six-month cooling period comes the meticulous multi-year process of grinding and polishing the glass into its final shape. \"When we started with the first mirror,\" McCarthy said, \"there was a lot of learning going on, and it was a time when the industry was moving away from optical polishing as an art and more of a predictive science using computer- controlled polishing.\" That's right, robots took our glass polishing jobs. And the world is a better place for it. \"Computer-controlled polishing is now at the state of the art for small optics but less so for these very large mirrors,\" McCarthy continued. \"Because there isn't as much of a large industrial throughput.\" Through trial and error, the GMT team developed a sophisticated model for the material removal rate as a function of time, and the testing equipment needed to ensure it was accurate. Of course the team still independently measures the mirror's shape. Once the polishing run has been programmed, McCarthy said, the team typically scales it back by 30 percent \"Because as the director of the mirror lab likes to remind us, 'It's easy to take the glass off, it's harder to put it back on.'\" The polishing tools themselves are computer controlled as well, changing shape several times per second. This is so \"it always has the shape that we want while we're rubbing the glass,\" McCarthy explained. \"These off-axis mirrors they have a different shape on every part of the glass, there is no symmetry.\" Hence the need for automation. \"We plan for this telescope to be revealing new discoveries of the universe for the next 50 years,\" Shelton exclaimed. \"But with advances in computing and advances in electronics, there will be regular upgrades with new instrumentation. We've got a couple of generations of workhorse expectations out of the GMT.\" The GMT is designed to observe light in the optical and near-infrared range. For older telescopes operating on that part of the spectrum, atmospheric distortion -- aka the phenomenon that makes stars twinkle -- would be a problem. But thanks to the GMT's built-in adaptive optics, that won't be an issue. \"The resolving power of your telescope, once you get above about a half meter in size, due to atmospheric distortion effects they're kind of all the same,\" McCarthy explained. \"You're not realizing the full potential of the telescope.\" Adaptive optics, however, use lasers to sense the distortion and counter it in much the same way as noise-cancelling headphones block external sounds. But the GMT won't be staring into the sky on its own; the observatory will collaborate with other telescopes both on the ground and in space. Take the Hubble's existing work with ground-based observatories, for example. \"The Hubble can look at parts of the light spectrum that are difficult to observe from the ground, like the ultraviolet,\" Shelton explained. \"The Hubble has unparalleled imaging quality but can't take spectra that are particularly interesting.\" However, by augmenting its abilities with facilities on the ground, astronomers have managed to make huge advancements in the cosmological field. Once it gets up and running, the GMT may also turn its eye toward closer targets, potentially supplementing the observations of spacecraft orbiting the planets and moons of our solar system. \"The interesting thing for solar system targets is how you connect the in situ measurements from spacecraft,\" McCarthy said. \"With ground-based measurements with big apertures where we can take spectra and look for polarization.\" The GMT team is also looking forward to working with the The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which is currently being constructed a few hundred miles away on the El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n peak of Cerro Pach\u00f3n. The LSST will survey the entire sky every few days looking for things that move or change brightness, then the GMT will go back and study those objects in greater detail. \"We think there's a great synergy between us and the SST,\" Shelton said. \"After that, the question is whether you can make something bigger,\" McCarthy interjected. \"And never say never, only 15, maybe 20 years ago the Europeans were going to make a 100-meter telescope. They eventually scaled it back but that doesn't mean it isn't going to happen.\" He expects that humans will eventually build 100-meter-plus telescopes, \"Whenever people build the biggest telescope of their generation, they say 'this will never be outdone, this is as big as it can get.'\" Indeed, just two years after it begins operations, the GMT will lose its title of world's largest observatory to the European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope, when it and its 978-square-meter collection area, come online in 2024. But even though it won't be the biggest for very long, the GMT will continue to upgrade its systems throughout its operational lifespan. McCarthy foresees further growth in aperture size as well as advances in adaptive optics. \"We've got one adaptive mirror on the telescope, but you could put in multiple adaptive mirrors to push the adaptive optics to shorter wavelengths.\" \"There's also the emerging field of photonics, which are miniaturized self- contained optical systems that effective use every photon,\" Shelton said. \"They work at the quantum level and have people thinking about photonic spectrographs, telescopes that work in the aperture plane rather than the focal plane. There's a whole interesting frontier of photonic applications, we just don't know which of those will bear fruit and which of those will be great ideas that are just not practical.\"", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-03-gmt-worlds-largest-telescope.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "The world's largest telescope will unlock the universe's oldest secrets", "date": "2017-11-03", "content": "In the predawn hours of September 20th, 2017, the cavernous hangar doors of the Richard F.

Engineers expect to haul away 5,000 cubic metres of rock from the site, the equivalent of 330 dump truck loads of debris. \"With the start of construction of the permanent buildings on the site, the GMT is showing tangible progress towards completion,\" said James Fanson, the Giant Magellan Telescope Organisation - GMTO - project manager. The Giant Magellan Telescope will use seven 8.4-metre mirrors mounted in a steel telescope structure seated on a concrete pier, tipping the scales at some 1,600 metric tons. The telescope will be housed in a rotating enclosure 65 metres tall and 56 metres wide. Mineria y Montajes Conpax, an engineering firm that has carried out site work at other observatories in the region, is responsible for digging out the foundation using jack hammers, not explosives, to make sure the rock below the foundation remains intact. Along with work on the telescope enclosure, pier and foundation, Conpax also will excavate a recess for the lower portion of a mirror coating chamber and the foundation for a nearby utility building. Once in operation, the Giant Magellan Telescope will join a new wave of giant observatories that promise to revolutionise ground-based astronomy, producing infrared images 10 times sharper than those from the Hubble Space Telescope. Five of the Magellan's huge mirrors already have been cast at the Richard F.

So it goes with the Giant Magellan Telescope, which will the world's largest and most powerful when it sees \"first light\" in 2024. Astronomers hope to use the huge observatory to study the ancient universe and look for signs of alien life. Construction crews atop a Chilean mountain range broke ground for the $1 billion project on Tuesday. The final device will weigh more than 2 million lbs, so workers are now punching a 23-feet-deep hole in bedrock that they'll eventually fill with concrete to support GMT's enormous weight. \"It will be supported by a 1,000 ton steel telescope structure that will be housed inside a rotating enclosure that will measure 22 stories tall and 56 meters wide,\" a representative for GMT told Business Insider in an email. The GMT is being built at Las Campanas Observatory in the Atacama Desert, one of the highest and driest regions on Earth. The site provides astronomers with clear views of the night sky almost year-round. To help probe the universe, GMT will eventually have seven 27-feet-wide mirrors, each weighing close to 20 tons. Together their light-collecting area will be about the size of a basketball court. The telescope will also use laser-based \"adaptive optics\" to measure distortion caused by Earth's atmosphere, correct for that interference, and produce crisper and clearer pictures. \"The GMT mirrors will collect more light than any telescope ever built and the resolution will be the best ever achieved,\" the project claims on its website. One estimate suggests the images will be up to 10 times more resolute than those of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. What the Giant Magellan Telescope may discover: The Giant Magellan Telescope is geared toward studying galaxies in the deep universe, but it could play a pivotal role in answering whether or not life on Earth is alone in the universe - or at least refine the likelihood of that possibility. GMT will follow in the footsteps of NASA's Kepler space mission, launched in 2009, which discovered thousands of new worlds. About 50 of those are Earth- size and may be cozy enough to support alien life. But Kepler probed deep and narrow sections of the night sky. NASA's follow-on space mission, called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is now scanning 85% of the entire sky for worlds within about 200 light-years of our own. TESS is only equipped to detect possible exoplanets, though, not study them in detail. Another upcoming NASA space mission, called the James Webb Space Telescope, may be powerful enough to sample light from an exoplanet's atmosphere after it launches, perhaps in 2021. Such measurements could help verify if an Earth-size planet has signs of biology and perhaps even breathable air. However, JWST may not be big enough to take detailed measurements of an Earth- size planet. This is where GMT - expected to be about 14 times as large - could excel. With its full resolving power, GMT might be able to \"sniff\" alien atmospheres. \"As a planet passes in front of its star, a large telescope on the ground, like the GMT, can use spectra to search for the fingerprints of molecules in the planetary atmosphere,\" Patrick McCarthy, a leader of the project, previously told Business Insider. Spectra refers to the blend of colors in starlight. When that light passes through a planet's atmosphere, chemicals absorb and remit certain parts - leaving a smoking-gun pattern of their presence. A mix of oxygen and methane gases similar to that of Earth's atmosphere, for example, could be a \"fingerprint\" of life's presence on an exoplanet. McCarthy also said large and powerful new telescopes like GMT might be able to deduce weather systems and surface features of planets located trillions of miles away. If Russian billionaire Yuri Milner has his way, we might even send tiny, high-speed spacecraft past the most promising planets in the next few decades.

Hard-rock excavation at the Giant Magellan Telescope site - a patch of rocky desert 8,200 feet above sea level, about a 2-hour drive from the coastal town of La Serena - wrapped up in March. And the project team recently selected a contractor to build the mount, a steel structure that will house the huge telescope's mirrors and scientific instruments. \"This is the core of the observatory,\" said Robert Shelton, president of the GMTO Corp. Mount construction \"is the single largest procurement we will be involved with - anywhere from $120 million to $140 million,\" Shelton told Space.com. Total costs for the project are expected to exceed $1 billion, he added. The GMT will integrate seven primary mirrors to form a light-collecting surface 80 feet wide, giving the scope a resolving power 10 times greater than that of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The GMT will therefore be able to make groundbreaking observations in a number of fields, project team members have said. For example, the megascope will scan the atmospheres of nearby alien planets for possible signs of life, help astronomers understand how the first galaxies formed, and gather data that could shed light on mysterious dark matter and dark energy. Five of the primary mirrors have already been cast, at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory. One of those five is completely done, and the other four are in various stages of processing. Each primary mirror, by the way, is about 27 feet wide - so big that these key pieces will have to travel to Chile by boat. Shelton said he expects the GMT to start observing the heavens in 2026, with just four or five of the primary mirrors installed. \"As soon as we have the mount, the enclosure, the utilities and the first couple of instruments, there's no reason to wait for mirrors six and seven,\" Shelton said. \"We'll go for that, start the engineering studies.

The Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT, will be in a class of its own. Massive in size the telescope holds the promise of changing the way we look at the Universe. Understanding the Giant Magellan Telescope: You should definitely have this telescope on your radar. To be constructed in the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, the commissioning of the telescope is scheduled to begin in 2025. The Giant Magellan Telescope will have a series of features that will distinguish it from its peers, making it a powerful tool. The GMT is a segmented mirror telescop e that utilizes the world's largest monolith mirrors as segments. **27-foot** segments surround the central on- axis of the telescope creating a single optical surface **80 feet** in diameter. With a total collecting area of **368 square meters**, the resolving power of the telescope is 10 times greater than the Hubble Space Telescope. Starting 2019 Off Right: Progress on the GMT has begun creating a lot of buzz and excitement in the scientific community around the world. Recently, a significant milestone was just reached with the completion of the excavation of the foundations for GMT's massive pier and enclosure. After this major step, the team has begun the next step of the project which entails what is known as the water package, with the expected time of completion estimated to be about 8 months. This includes the installation of water pipes and electrical conduits across the GMT facilities on the Chilean Mountain as well as the construction of a water equipment building to store, treat and distribute water from the existing Las Campanas Observatory water storage tank. When this stage is completed the Giant Magellan Telescope construction team will move on to the construction of a temporary concrete plant on the summit, and construction of the concrete foundations for the telescope pier, enclosure, and summit utility building. On top of this milestone, the GMT team was excited to announce that the project secured additional funding. We are excited to see how this project will continue to unfold.

GMTO Corp., the organization managing the development of the Giant Magellan Telescope on behalf of its U.S. and international founders, has signed a contract with MT Mechatronics and Ingersoll Machine Tools, to design, build and install the telescope's precision steel structure. The GMTO telescope's primary mirror is specified to combine seven 8.4m-diameter circular segments to form an effective aperture 24.5m in diameter. To be located at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert, the planned optical-infrared observatory is designed to explore the frontiers of astronomy, including seeking to answer one of humanity's most pressing questions: \"Are we alone?\" MT Mechatronics and Ingersoll Machine Tools, part of the Italian Camozzi Group, will design and manufacture the 1,800-ton precision mechanism, known as the telescope structure, which will hold the GMT's optics and smoothly track celestial targets. The structure will be designed by MT Mechatronics and manufactured by Ingersoll before being installed at the observatory site in the Chilean Andes. Mirrors installed in 2028: The total value of the telescope structure contract is $135 million. The agreement between GMTO, MT Mechatronics and Ingersoll Machine Tools will involve nine years of work and 1,300 tons of structural steel, and the structure is expected to be delivered to Chile at the end of 2025 and be ready to accept mirrors in 2028. \"Manufacturing the telescope structure is one of the biggest steps we will take on our journey to building the Giant Magellan Telescope,\" said Dr. Shelton, GMTO President. \"We selected MT Mechatronics and Ingersoll Machine Tools for their commitment to quality, extensive experience with astronomical telescopes and abilities to manufacture complex precision structures, following a two-year global competition,\" added Dr. James Fanson, GMTO Project Manager. The telescope structure will hold the GMT's seven giant mirrors in place as they bring light from distant stars and galaxies to a focus so it can be analyzed by scientific instruments mounted deep inside the telescope. The mirrors, the largest in the world, are to be made at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab. Friction-free: When in operation, the telescope structure, complete with mirrors and instruments, will weigh 2,100 tons but will float on a film of oil just 50\u00b5m thick - allowing it to move essentially without friction as it compensates for Earth's rotation, tracking celestial bodies in their arc across the sky. The GMT will produce images that are 10 times sharper than those from the Hubble Space Telescope in the infrared region of the spectrum. \"Being a part of an endeavor with objectives as distinguished as the Giant Magellan Telescope's is compelling for MT Mechatronics and we're eager to support the GMT on its quest to answer the deepest questions in astronomy,\" said Thomas Zimmerer, Senior VP, Business Development Sales & Marketing, Product Development, MT Mechatronics. \"We are happy to work with GMTO and MTM to create this unique tool for the study of new worlds. The project honors and motivates all of us at Ingersoll,\" said Lodovico Camozzi, CEO of Camozzi Group. \"It will be a special day when the GMT's telescope structure is completed and placed in service in Chile,\" said Chip Storie, CEO of Ingersoll Machine Tools. MT Mechatronics has over 50 years' experience with telescopes, beginning with the Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia. It was part of a European consortium constructing the European Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope antennas and was the mount designer for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii. Since its inception in 1891, Ingersoll Machine Tools Inc. has been an iconic name in the milling machines sector, successfully serving the defense sector and then the newborn aeronautics and aerospace industry.

The U.S. National Science Foundation has awarded a $17.5 million grant to the GMTO Corporation, which is developing the GMT and will operate the big scope once it gets up and running in the Chilean Andes in the late 2020s. The money, the first awarded to the GMT project by the NSF, \"signifies that the observatory will be important for the entire U.S. astronomy community,\" GMTO president Robert Shelton told Space.com. \"This award really enables us to accelerate our progress on critical components,\" Shelton said. \"And I think that it allows us to kind of strut our stuff, to display a little bit the technical skills of the project team, which are manifest.\" The GMT will integrate seven 27.6-foot-wide primary mirrors into a single light-collecting surface 80 feet across - three times wider than any optical telescope operating today. The big scope will also feature seven \"adaptive secondary mirrors\", each of which will be 3.3 feet wide and just 2 millimeters thick, with hundreds of actuators affixed to its back. \"With those actuators, we're able to bend this thin glass surface at about 1,000 times every second,\" GMTO project manager James Fanson told Space.com. \"That is what we use to compensate for the distortion that's introduced by Earth's atmosphere. Millisecond by millisecond, we measure the distortion and correct it, so that we can essentially remove the atmosphere above the telescope and get very sharp images.\" These extreme optics will give the GMT 10 times the resolving power of NASA's famous Hubble Space Telescope, GMT team members have said. Astronomers will use the GMT for a variety of high-impact projects, from hunting for signs of life in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets to probing the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which dominate the universe but remain largely mysterious. Making all this happen will be no walk in the park, however. For example, no other single-piece telescope mirror is larger than a GMT primary segment. And the surface of all seven GMT primaries must be shaped nearly to perfection: The margin of error is just 25 nanometers, about the width of a single glass molecule. The seven segments must also be \"phased\" so that they align precisely and perform as a single piece of hardware. The newly awarded NSF money will help the GMT team demonstrate and practice doing just that at two custom-built phasing testbeds, one at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The grant will also allow the team to partially build and test an ASM. The grant-funded work will take place over three years and keep the GMT on track for \"first light\" in 2029, team members said.

In October 2019, the GMTO announced that it had signed a $135 million contract with MT Mechatronics and Ingersoll Machine Tools to build and install the telescope's mount, the 1,800-ton precision steel structure that will be the bones of the GMT. The mount is going through its preliminary design review now, Shelton said. \"That is the one that now we really have to focus on, making sure that the design is going to satisfy our needs, because literally everything interfaces with the mount - the instruments, the mirrors, everything,\" he said. \"So that really is the key right now.\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/giant-magellan-telescope-nsf-grant.html"}, {"title": "NSF Grant Accelerates Development for One of World's Most Powerful Telescopes; Test Bed Being Built at UArizona", "date": "2020-09-17", "content": "The GMTO Corporation has received a $17.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation to accelerate the prototyping and testing of some of the most powerful optical and infrared technologies ever engineered. The grant will, in part, support the development of a test bed at the University of Arizona. These crucial advancements for the Giant Magellan Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile will allow astronomers to see farther into space with more detail than any other optical telescope before. The NSF grant positions the GMT to be one of the first in a new generation of large telescopes, approximately three times the size of any ground-based optical telescope built to date. The University of Arizona is heavily involved in making GMT a reality. Not only are the telescope's primary mirrors all manufactured and tested at the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, which is part of UArizona Steward Observatory, but various research groups across campus are tackling key challenges in creating a \"discovery machine\" of unprecedented design and capability. One of the great challenges of engineering revolutionary technologies is constructing them to operate at optimal performance. The Giant Magellan Telescope is designed to have a resolving power 10 times greater than the Hubble Space Telescope - one of the most productive scientific achievements in the history of astronomy. This advancement in image quality is a prerequisite for the GMT to fully realize its scientific potential and expand our knowledge of the universe. \"Image quality on any telescope starts with the primary mirror,\" said James Fanson, project manager of GMTO. \"The Giant Magellan Telescope's primary mirror comprises seven 8.4-meter mirror segments. To achieve diffraction- limited imaging, we have to be able to phase these primary mirror segments so that they behave as one monolithic 25-meter diameter mirror. Once phased, the team must then correct for Earth's turbulent atmospheric distortion.\" Phasing involves precisely aligning a telescope's segmented mirrors and other optical components so that they work in unison to produce crisp images of deep space. Achieving this with seven of the world's largest mirrors ever built is no easy task. The immense size of the GMT's primary mirror requires a powerful adaptive optics system to correct for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmospheric turbulence at kiloHertz speeds. In other words, astronomers need to take the subtle \"twinkle\" out of the stars in order to capture high- resolution data from celestial objects thousands of light-years from our planet. The NSF grant will allow the GMT to build two phasing test beds where astro- engineers demonstrate, in a controlled laboratory setting, that its core designs will work to align and phase the telescope's seven mirror segments with the required precision to achieve diffraction-limited imaging at first light in 2029. This includes a full-scale prototype of the primary mirror support and control system that delivers active optical control. The test beds will be developed at the UArizona Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics, or CAAO, and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, while actuator testing and integration of the primary mirror support will be developed at Texas A&M University. UArizona researchers have been busy building a test bed that essentially consists of a miniature-sized stand-in for the GMT's seven-piece primary mirror and a special optical sensor that can detect whether or not all mirror segments are perfectly aligned. This test bed specializes in a narrow field of view that will allow the GMT to directly image faint alien planets far outside our own solar system. \"We have to make sure that phasing and adaptive optics will work together seamlessly,\" said **Alex Hedglen**, a doctoral student in UArizona's James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences who is involved in the project. \"To accomplish this, our team has been tasked with building a complex test bed mimicking the seven primary mirror segments, to trick our existing MagAO-X Adaptive Optics system into thinking it is working at the actual GMT telescope,\" said **Laird Close**, astronomy professor at Steward Observatory. \"We are confident that we can meet this phasing and adaptive optics challenge; there are few different engineering paths to achieve this, and our CAAO test bed will allow us to pick the best one for use at the real GMT.\" The UArizona test bed will inform astronomers how to use the GMT's high- fidelity adaptive mirrors and other revolutionary adaptive optics technologies to detect faint biosignatures from distant exoplanets - one of the GMT's primary scientific goals. \"Based on our computer simulations, we are optimistic that our approach will work,\" said **Jared Males**, assistant astronomer at Steward Observatory, \"but we need to demonstrate phasing control on actual hardware.\" The GMT and the Thirty Meter Telescope are a part of the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope Program, a joint initiative with NSF's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory to provide superior observing access to the entire sky as never before. Upon completion of each telescope, U.S. scientists and international partners will be able to take advantage of the program's two pioneering telescopes to carry out transformational research that answers some of humanity's most pressing questions, such as are we alone in the universe and where did we come from. \"We are honored to receive our first NSF grant,\" said Robert Shelton, president of GMTO and former president of the University of Arizona. \"It is a giant step toward realizing the GMT's scientific goals and the profound impact the GMT will have on the future of human knowledge.\" This work is part of a larger $23 million joint award to the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy and the GMT over the next three years.

Developers of the critical optical systems that will feature inside the Giant Magellan Telescope have received a boost, after the US National Science Foundation awarded the project a $17.5 million grant. Intended to accelerate prototyping and testing of some of the most powerful optical and infrared technologies ever engineered, the grant represents the first financial support for the project from the NSF. Now slated for \"first light\" in 2029, the GMT's optical design is based around seven 8.4 meter-diameter mirrors shaped like petals, yielding a primary optic with an effective diameter of 25 meters. Along with the under-construction European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope, it is one of three projects that will set a new standard for ground-based astronomy once completed. Phasing test-beds for adaptive optics: According to the GMTO Corporation, which is responsible for managing the GMT project and operations, the grant will allow construction of two phasing test- beds for engineers to demonstrate that their core designs will align and phase the seven huge mirror segments with the requisite precision needed to achieve diffraction-limited imaging. Those test-beds will be developed at the University of Arizona Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, while actuator testing and integration of the primary mirror support will be developed at Texas A&M University. A full-scale prototype of the primary mirror support and control system to deliver active optical control is also part of the planned work. The NSF support will also enable the partial build and testing of a next- generation adaptive secondary mirror, which will be used to perform the primary mirror phasing and atmospheric distortion correction. This work will be developed under a contract with AdOptica, an Italian consortium specializing in large deformable mirrors. Unprecedented optical resolution: GMTO Corporation project manager James Fanson explained: \"To achieve diffraction-limited imaging, we have to be able to phase these primary mirror segments so that they behave as a monolithic mirror. Once phased, we must then correct for Earth's turbulent atmospheric distortion.\" \"Our seven ASMs take this technology to the next step,\" added Fanson, pointing out that up until the GMT's design nobody has ever attempted to use seven such components. \"They are probably the most advanced tech we have on the telescope, and their success is a top priority. We need to test and validate their performance early on in the project.\" Once GMT is built, astronomers using the high-fidelity adaptive mirrors expect to be able to probe the universe in far more detail than is possible with today's terrestrial and space telescopes. For example, GMT's resolution is expected to be ten times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Among its primary scientific goals is to detect faint biosignatures from distant exoplanets - something that would indicate the likely presence of life throughout the universe. The seven large mirrors that will eventually make up the primary reflector element are all at various stages of manufacture by experts at the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, part of the University of Arizona. Cleaning TMT with carbon dioxide \"snow\": Technical experts at the TMT, which represents the second giant observatory within the US Extremely Large Telescope Program, say that they have passed a major milestone with the cleaning system for the project's primary mirror. In contrast to the GMT, the TMT's optical system is based around nearly 500 smaller mirror segments. According to a recent TMT announcement the cleaning system for the segmented primary mirror, as well as the secondary and tertiary elements, successfully passed its preliminary design review following a remote conference meeting last month. The system uses liquid carbon dioxide gas, which will be pressurized and delivered to cleaning arms before expanding to generate carbon dioxide \"snow\" to drive dust from each optical surface. A similar system is already in use at the Subaru Telescope, at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. TMT's backers are planning to build the new telescope at the same Mauna Kea location. However, the project has been delayed by arguments and legal action over the use of the site, which is regarded by some local people as sacred, and to have already been overdeveloped for astronomical purposes.

The immense size of the GMT's primary mirror requires a powerful adaptive optics system to correct for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmospheric turbulence at kiloHertz speeds. In other words, astronomers need to take the subtle \"twinkle\" out of the stars in order to capture high- resolution data from celestial objects thousands of light-years from our planet. The NSF grant will allow the GMT to build two phasing test beds where astro- engineers demonstrate, in a controlled laboratory setting, that its core designs will work to align and phase the telescope's seven mirror segments with the required precision to achieve diffraction-limited imaging at first light in 2029. This includes a full-scale prototype of the primary mirror support and control system that delivers active optical control. The test beds will be developed at the UArizona Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics, or CAAO, and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, while actuator testing and integration of the primary mirror support will be developed at Texas A&M University. UArizona researchers have been busy building a test bed that essentially consists of a miniature-sized stand-in for the GMT's seven-piece primary mirror and a special optical sensor that can detect whether or not all mirror segments are perfectly aligned. This test bed specializes in a narrow field of view that will allow the GMT to directly image faint alien planets far outside our own solar system. \"We have to make sure that phasing and adaptive optics will work together seamlessly,\" said **Alex Hedglen**, a doctoral student in UArizona's James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences who is involved in the project. \"To accomplish this, our team has been tasked with building a complex test bed mimicking the seven primary mirror segments, to trick our existing MagAO-X Adaptive Optics system into thinking it is working at the actual GMT telescope,\" said **Laird Close**, astronomy professor at Steward Observatory. \"We are confident that we can meet this phasing and adaptive optics challenge; there are few different engineering paths to achieve this, and our CAAO test bed will allow us to pick the best one for use at the real GMT.\" The UArizona test bed will inform astronomers how to use the GMT's high- fidelity adaptive mirrors and other revolutionary adaptive optics technologies to detect faint biosignatures from distant exoplanets - one of the GMT's primary scientific goals. \"Based on our computer simulations, we are optimistic that our approach will work,\" said **Jared Males**, assistant astronomer at Steward Observatory, \"but we need to demonstrate phasing control on actual hardware.\" The GMT and the Thirty Meter Telescope are a part of the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope Program, a joint initiative with NSF's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory to provide superior observing access to the entire sky as never before. Upon completion of each telescope, U.S. scientists and international partners will be able to take advantage of the program's two pioneering telescopes to carry out transformational research that answers some of humanity's most pressing questions, such as are we alone in the universe and where did we come from. \"We are honored to receive our first NSF grant,\" said Robert Shelton, president of GMTO and former president of the University of Arizona. \"It is a giant step toward realizing the GMT's scientific goals and the profound impact the GMT will have on the future of human knowledge.\" This work is part of a larger $23 million joint award to the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy and the GMT over the next three years. The GMT project is the work of a distinguished international consortium of leading universities and science institutions.", "url": "https://news.arizona.edu/story/nsf-grant-accelerates-development-one-worlds-most-powerful-telescopes-test-bed-being-built"}, {"title": "US National Science Foundation backs Giant Magellan Telescope", "date": "2020-09-21", "content": "$17.5M grant from the funding agency supports phasing test-beds for precision alignment of seven huge mirror segments. Developers of the critical optical systems that will feature inside the Giant Magellan Telescope have received a boost, after the US National Science Foundation awarded the project a $17.5 million grant. Intended to accelerate prototyping and testing of some of the most powerful optical and infrared technologies ever engineered, the grant represents the first financial support for the project from the NSF. Now slated for \"first light\" in 2029, the GMT's optical design is based around seven 8.4 meter-diameter mirrors shaped like petals, yielding a primary optic with an effective diameter of 25 meters. Along with the under-construction European Southern Observatory's Extremely Large Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope, it is one of three projects that will set a new standard for ground-based astronomy once completed. Phasing test-beds for adaptive optics: According to the GMTO Corporation, which is responsible for managing the GMT project and operations, the grant will allow construction of two phasing test- beds for engineers to demonstrate that their core designs will align and phase the seven huge mirror segments with the requisite precision needed to achieve diffraction-limited imaging. Those test-beds will be developed at the University of Arizona Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, while actuator testing and integration of the primary mirror support will be developed at Texas A&M University. A full-scale prototype of the primary mirror support and control system to deliver active optical control is also part of the planned work. The NSF support will also enable the partial build and testing of a next- generation adaptive secondary mirror, which will be used to perform the primary mirror phasing and atmospheric distortion correction. This work will be developed under a contract with AdOptica, an Italian consortium specializing in large deformable mirrors. Unprecedented optical resolution: GMTO Corporation project manager James Fanson explained: \"To achieve diffraction-limited imaging, we have to be able to phase these primary mirror segments so that they behave as a monolithic mirror. Once phased, we must then correct for Earth's turbulent atmospheric distortion.\" \"Our seven ASMs take this technology to the next step,\" added Fanson, pointing out that up until the GMT's design nobody has ever attempted to use seven such components. \"They are probably the most advanced tech we have on the telescope, and their success is a top priority. We need to test and validate their performance early on in the project.\" Once GMT is built, astronomers using the high-fidelity adaptive mirrors expect to be able to probe the universe in far more detail than is possible with today's terrestrial and space telescopes. For example, GMT's resolution is expected to be ten times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Among its primary scientific goals is to detect faint biosignatures from distant exoplanets - something that would indicate the likely presence of life throughout the universe. The seven large mirrors that will eventually make up the primary reflector element are all at various stages of manufacture by experts at the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, part of the University of Arizona. Cleaning TMT with carbon dioxide \"snow\": Technical experts at the TMT, which represents the second giant observatory within the US Extremely Large Telescope Program, say that they have passed a major milestone with the cleaning system for the project's primary mirror. In contrast to the GMT, the TMT's optical system is based around nearly 500 smaller mirror segments. According to a recent TMT announcement the cleaning system for the segmented primary mirror, as well as the secondary and tertiary elements, successfully passed its preliminary design review following a remote conference meeting last month. The system uses liquid carbon dioxide gas, which will be pressurized and delivered to cleaning arms before expanding to generate carbon dioxide \"snow\" to drive dust from each optical surface. A similar system is already in use at the Subaru Telescope, at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. TMT's backers are planning to build the new telescope at the same Mauna Kea location. However, the project has been delayed by arguments and legal action over the use of the site, which is regarded by some local people as sacred, and to have already been overdeveloped for astronomical purposes.

The Giant Magellan Telescope announces fabrication of the sixth of seven of the world's largest monolithic mirrors. These mirrors will allow astronomers to see farther into the universe with more detail than any other optical telescope before. The sixth 8.4-meter mirror - about two stories high when standing on edge - is being fabricated at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab and will take nearly four years to complete. The mirror casting is considered a marvel of modern engineering and is usually celebrated with a large in-person event with attendees from all over the world. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, work on the sixth mirror began behind closed doors to protect the health of the 10-person mirror casting team at the lab. \"The most important part of a telescope is its light-collecting mirror,\" said James Fanson, Project Manager of the Giant Magellan Telescope. \"The larger the mirror, the deeper we can see into the universe and the more detail we can observe. The Giant Magellan Telescope's unique primary mirror design consists of seven of the world's largest mirrors. Casting the sixth mirror is a major step toward completion. Once operational, the Giant Magellan Telescope will produce images ten times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope. The discoveries these mirrors will make will transform our understanding of the universe.\" The process of casting the giant mirror at Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab involves melting nearly 20 tons of high-purity, low- expansion, borosilicate glass into the world's only spinning furnace designed to cast giant mirrors for telescopes. At the peak of the melting process, the furnace spins at five revolutions per minute, heating the glass to 1,165 degrees Celsius for approximately five hours until it liquefies into the mold. The peak temperature event is called \"high fire\" and will occur on March 6, 2021. The mirror then enters a one month annealing process where the glass is cooled while the furnace spins at a slower rate in order to remove internal stresses and toughen the glass. It takes another 1.5 months to cool to room temperature. This \"spin cast\" process gives the mirror surface its special parabolic shape. Once cooled, the mirror will be polished for two years before reaching an optical surface precision of less than one thousandth of the width of a human hair or five times smaller than a single coronavirus particle. \"I am tremendously proud of how the operations of the mirror lab have adapted to the pandemic, allowing our talented and dedicated members of the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab to safely continue to produce the mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope,\" said Buell Jannuzi, Director of Steward Observatory and Head of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Arizona. With the first two giant mirrors completed and in storage in Tucson, Arizona, the sixth mirror joins three others in various stages of production at the mirror lab. The third mirror's front surface polishing has achieved 70 nanometer accuracy and is less than one year from completion. The fourth mirror has completed rear surface polishing, and load spreaders are being attached to allow the mirror to be manipulated during operation. The fifth mirror was cast in November 2017, and the seventh mirror is expected to be cast in 2023. In addition, an eighth spare mirror is planned to be made that can be swapped in when another mirror requires maintenance. In the late 2020s, the giant mirrors will be transported more than 8,100 kilometers to the Giant Magellan Telescope's future home in the Chilean Atacama Desert at Las Campanas Observatory more than 2,500 meters above sea level. The site is known for being one of the best astronomical sites on the planet, with its clear skies, low light pollution, and stable airflow producing exceptionally sharp images. Additionally, the site's southern hemisphere location gives the extremely large telescope access to the center of the Milky Way, which is of interest for many reasons, including the fact that it is the home to the nearest supermassive black hole, as well as many of the most interesting nearby galaxies. The southern hemisphere is also home to some of the most powerful observatories working at other wavelengths, making it the ideal location for synergistic scientific observations. Once the Giant Magellan Telescope becomes fully operational, its seven mirror- array will have a total light collecting area of 368 square meters - enough to see the torch engraved on a dime from nearly 160 kilometers away. Such viewing power is ten times greater than the famed Hubble Space Telescope and four times greater than the highly anticipated James Webb Space Telescope, expected to launch in late 2021. The mirrors are also a crucial part of the optical design that allows the Giant Magellan Telescope to have the widest field of view of any extremely large telescope in the 30-meter class. The unique optical design will make the Giant Magellan Telescope the most optically efficient ELT when it comes to making use of every photon of light that the mirrors collect - only two reflections are required to direct light to the wide field instruments and only three reflections to provide light to the instruments that use small fields of view and the highest possible spatial resolutions. \"This unprecedented combination of light gathering power, efficiency, and image resolution will enable us to make new discoveries across all fields of astronomy, particularly fields that require the highest spatial and spectral resolutions, like the search for other Earths,\" said Rebecca Bernstein, Chief Scientist of the Giant Magellan Telescope. \"We will have unique capabilities for studying planets at high resolution, which is the key to understanding if a planet has a rocky composition like our Earth, if it contains liquid water, and if its atmosphere contains the right combination of molecules to signal the presence of life.\" The Giant Magellan Telescope project is the work of a distinguished international consortium of leading universities and science institutions.

A big furnace containing 20 tons of pure borosilicate glass began rotating on Friday at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, kicking off the spin-casting process for the sixth of seven elements that will make up the GMT's 82-foot-wide primary mirror. \"The spin-casting is undeniably the most spectacular part of the manufacturing process,\" Buddy Martin, polishing scientist at the mirror lab, said in a statement. The furnace began heating the glass on Monday and reached a peak temperature of 2,129 degrees Fahrenheit on Saturday afternoon. At such high temperatures, the melted glass flows like honey, pushed outward by centrifugal force to create a curved shape that would take months to achieve by grinding, Martin explained during a call with reporters on Friday. Up next is a lengthy \"annealing\" process, which will cool the glass in stages over the next few months. Around June 1, the team will take apart the furnace \"and finally get a look at this mirror,\" Martin said in Friday's call. But the 27.6-foot-wide mirror won't be done at that point. Far from it; technicians will still need to grind and polish it with mind-boggling precision, ensuring that its surface is perfect to within one millionth of an inch. \"If the mirror were expanded to the size of North America, 3,500 miles 5,630 kilometers in diameter, then the average hill would be two-thirds of an inch 1.7 centimeters tall and the average valley two-thirds of an inch deep,\" Martin said. \"That's how smooth this mirror has to be for it to make the sharpest images that nature will allow.\" As you can imagine, shaping the mirror so skillfully is a time-consuming process: It currently takes the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab about four years to finish each GMT segment. The first two mirrors are done and have been placed in storage in Tucson, and the third is less than a year from completion, project team members said. Segments four and five were cast in September 2015 and November 2017, respectively, and number seven is expected to be cast in 2023. An eighth element will also be cast, for use as a replacement when maintenance work is performed on one of the seven originals. All of this equipment and more will eventually head to the Chilean Andes, where construction of GMT infrastructure is well underway. If all goes according to plan, the big telescope will start studying the heavens in the late 2020s, team members said. These \"first light\" observations will likely be made with just four of the seven segments installed. That bare-bones GMT will be bigger than any telescope operating today, Giant Magellan Telescope Organization project manager James Fanson said during Friday's call. The final telescope will be even more powerful, of course, and not just because of its raw light-collecting area. The seven primary mirrors will be complemented by seven smaller \" adaptive secondary mirrors ,\" each of which will bend about 1,000 times every second to counteract the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere. In the end, the GMT's vision will be about 10 times sharper than that of the famous Hubble Space Telescope, project team members said. \"The leap in sensitivity and resolution that we're going to make with GMT will revolutionize our understanding of all areas of astronomy, from the formation and evolution of objects we can see, like planets, stars, black holes and galaxies, to cosmology and the things we can't directly see, like the nature of dark matter and dark energy,\" GMTO chief scientist Rebecca Bernstein said during the call. For example, GMT will be able to directly image a number of nearby exoplanets and also analyze the composition of their atmospheres, Bernstein said. \"GMT is the latest in a long quest of humanity to understand our place in the universe - where we come from, what our cosmic destiny is and whether we are alone or not in the universe,\" Fanson told Space.com. \"It strikes very profoundly at who we are as human beings.\" Two other ground-based megascopes could join that quest relatively soon as well.

In the late 2020s, the giant mirrors will be transported more than 8,100 kilometers to the Giant Magellan Telescope's future home in the Chilean Atacama Desert at Las Campanas Observatory more than 2,500 meters above sea level. The site is known for being one of the best astronomical sites on the planet, with its clear skies, low light pollution, and stable airflow producing exceptionally sharp images. Additionally, the site's southern hemisphere location gives the extremely large telescope access to the center of the Milky Way, which is of interest for many reasons, including the fact that it is the home to the nearest supermassive black hole, as well as many of the most interesting nearby galaxies. The southern hemisphere is also home to some of the most powerful observatories working at other wavelengths, making it the ideal location for synergistic scientific observations. Once the Giant Magellan Telescope becomes fully operational, its seven mirror- array will have a total light collecting area of 368 square meters - enough to see the torch engraved on a dime from nearly 160 kilometers away. Such viewing power is ten times greater than the famed Hubble Space Telescope and four times greater than the highly anticipated James Webb Space Telescope, expected to launch in late 2021. The mirrors are also a crucial part of the optical design that allows the Giant Magellan Telescope to have the widest field of view of any extremely large telescope in the 30-meter class. The unique optical design will make the Giant Magellan Telescope the most optically efficient ELT when it comes to making use of every photon of light that the mirrors collect - only two reflections are required to direct light to the wide field instruments and only three reflections to provide light to the instruments that use small fields of view and the highest possible spatial resolutions. \"This unprecedented combination of light gathering power, efficiency, and image resolution will enable us to make new discoveries across all fields of astronomy, particularly fields that require the highest spatial and spectral resolutions, like the search for other Earths,\" said Rebecca Bernstein, Chief Scientist of the Giant Magellan Telescope. \"We will have unique capabilities for studying planets at high resolution, which is the key to understanding if a planet has a rocky composition like our Earth, if it contains liquid water, and if its atmosphere contains the right combination of molecules to signal the presence of life.\" The Giant Magellan Telescope project is the work of a distinguished international consortium of leading universities and science institutions.

These mirrors will allow astronomers to see farther into the universe with more detail than any other optical telescope before. The sixth 8.4-meter mirror - about two stories high when standing on edge - is being fabricated at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab and will take nearly four years to complete. The mirror casting is considered a marvel of modern engineering and is usually celebrated with a large in-person event with attendees from all over the world. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, work on the sixth mirror began behind closed doors to protect the health of the 10-person mirror-casting team at the lab. \"This is a major milestone towards completing some of the most critical parts of GMT - the giant mirror casting,\" said Rogier Windhorst, Regents and Foundation Professor and co-director of the ASU Cosmology Initiative. \"We will now have only one more mirror to go, and then we can focus on completing the construction of this state-of-the-art observatory that will play a leading role in ground-based astronomy this century. ASU is very proud to be part of GMT. '' When the Giant Magellan Telescope is fully completed, it will be one of the next generation of giant ground-based telescopes promising to revolutionize our view and understanding of the universe. It will produce images 10 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope and give us a closer look at the first stars and galaxies to ever exist. It will also help us understand planets outside of our own solar system - including ones that could support life. The GMT project is the work of a distinguished international consortium of 12 leading universities and science institutions, including ASU. \"The fabrication of this giant mirror means we are one step closer to the exciting discoveries that will be forthcoming from the GMT,\" said Meenakshi Wadhwa, director of ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration. \"Astronomers in the School of Earth and Space Exploration here at ASU are particularly keen to study light from the first stars and galaxies, and to explore exoplanets and their characteristics.\" Mirror production process: The process of casting the giant mirror involves melting nearly 20 tons of high-purity, low-expansion, borosilicate glass into the world's only spinning furnace designed to cast giant mirrors for telescopes. At the peak of the melting process, the furnace spins at five revolutions per minute, heating the glass to 1,165 degrees Celsius for approximately five hours until it liquefies into the mold. The peak temperature event is called \"high fire\" and will occur on March 6, 2021. The mirror then enters a one-month annealing process where the glass is cooled while the furnace spins at a slower rate in order to remove internal stresses and toughen the glass. It takes another 1.5 months to cool to room temperature. This \"spin cast\" process gives the mirror surface its special parabolic shape. Once cooled, the mirror will be polished for two years before reaching an optical surface precision of less than one-thousandth of the width of a human hair or five times smaller than a single coronavirus particle. With the first two giant mirrors completed and in storage in Tucson, Arizona, the sixth mirror joins three others in various stages of production at the mirror lab. The third mirror's front surface polishing has achieved 70-nanometer accuracy and is less than one year from completion. The fourth mirror has completed rear surface polishing, and load spreaders are being attached to allow the mirror to be manipulated during operation. The fifth mirror was cast in November 2017, and the seventh mirror is expected to be cast in 2023. In addition, an eighth spare mirror is planned to be made that can be swapped in when another mirror requires maintenance.

A big furnace containing 20 tons of pure borosilicate glass began rotating on Friday at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, kicking off the spin-casting process for the sixth of seven elements that will make up the GMT's 82-foot-wide primary mirror. \"The spin-casting is undeniably the most spectacular part of the manufacturing process,\" Buddy Martin, polishing scientist at the mirror lab, said in a statement. The furnace began heating the glass on Monday and reached a peak temperature of 2,129 degrees Fahrenheit on Saturday afternoon. At such high temperatures, the melted glass flows like honey, pushed outward by centrifugal force to create a curved shape that would take months to achieve by grinding, Martin explained during a call with reporters on Friday. Up next is a lengthy \"annealing\" process, which will cool the glass in stages over the next few months. Around June 1, the team will take apart the furnace \"and finally get a look at this mirror,\" Martin said in Friday's call. But the 27.6-foot-wide mirror won't be done at that point. Far from it; technicians will still need to grind and polish it with mind-boggling precision, ensuring that its surface is perfect to within one millionth of an inch. \"If the mirror were expanded to the size of North America, 3,500 miles 5,630 kilometers in diameter, then the average hill would be two-thirds of an inch 1.7 centimeters tall and the average valley two-thirds of an inch deep,\" Martin said. \"That's how smooth this mirror has to be for it to make the sharpest images that nature will allow.\" As you can imagine, shaping the mirror so skillfully is a time-consuming process: It currently takes the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab about four years to finish each GMT segment. The first two mirrors are done and have been placed in storage in Tucson, and the third is less than a year from completion, project team members said. Segments four and five were cast in September 2015 and November 2017, respectively, and number seven is expected to be cast in 2023. An eighth element will also be cast, for use as a replacement when maintenance work is performed on one of the seven originals. All of this equipment and more will eventually head to the Chilean Andes, where construction of GMT infrastructure is well underway. If all goes according to plan, the big telescope will start studying the heavens in the late 2020s, team members said. These \"first light\" observations will likely be made with just four of the seven segments installed. That bare-bones GMT will be bigger than any telescope operating today, Giant Magellan Telescope Organization project manager James Fanson said during Friday's call. The final telescope will be even more powerful, of course, and not just because of its raw light-collecting area. The seven primary mirrors will be complemented by seven smaller \" adaptive secondary mirrors ,\" each of which will bend about 1,000 times every second to counteract the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere. In the end, the GMT's vision will be about 10 times sharper than that of the famous Hubble Space Telescope, project team members said. \"The leap in sensitivity and resolution that we're going to make with GMT will revolutionize our understanding of all areas of astronomy, from the formation and evolution of objects we can see, like planets, stars, black holes and galaxies, to cosmology and the things we can't directly see, like the nature of dark matter and dark energy,\" GMTO chief scientist Rebecca Bernstein said during the call. For example, GMT will be able to directly image a number of nearby exoplanets and also analyze the composition of their atmospheres, Bernstein said. \"GMT is the latest in a long quest of humanity to understand our place in the universe - where we come from, what our cosmic destiny is and whether we are alone or not in the universe,\" Fanson told Space.com. \"It strikes very profoundly at who we are as human beings.\" Two other ground-based megascopes could join that quest relatively soon as well.

But the recent castings of the 15-metric ton, off-axis mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope forced engineers to push the design and manufacturing process beyond all previous limits. Building the GMT is not a task of years, but of decades. The Giant Magellan Telescope Organization and a team at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory cast the first of seven mirrors back in 2005; they expect to complete construction of the telescope in 2025. Once complete, it's expected to be the largest telescope in the world. The seven 8.4-meter-wide mirrors will combine to serve as a 24.5-meter mirror telescope with 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. This will allow astronomers to gaze back in time to, they hope, the materialization of galaxies. Each mirror costs US $20 million dollars and takes more than two years to build. Every stage of the manufacturing process calls for careful thought and meticulous planning. To begin, more than 17,000 kilograms of special glass are ordered and inspected for flaws. Next, a crew must build a 15-metric ton ceramic structure to serve as a mold for the glass, which they carefully place one chunk at a time. The glass is slowly melted and continuously spun in a furnace to create a parabolic shape, then cooled by fractions of degrees over the course of three months. And that's only the beginning. Once cooled, massive machinery lifts the mirror and tilts it to a vertical position. Engineers purge the ceramic mold from the mirror, wait for it to dry, and then rotate it again. They grind and refine the back of the mirror with exacting precision. Then they reposition the mirror in order to shape and polish the front face to within 20 nanometers of perfection-a process that takes about 18 months. Along the way, it undergoes four optical tests, some of which were engineered specifically for this project. Any mammoth mirror requires much of the same engineering, but six of the seven GMT mirrors have an off-axis, parabolic shape. Producing an off-axis mirror at this scale is a new achievement for the Caris Mirror Laboratory and for the field in general. Once four of the mirrors are complete, they must be transported to the Chilean Andes, where the giant telescope will be constructed on the peak of a mountain range. Even the transport to Chile will be a challenge-so much so that the teams have yet to decide exactly how they'll pull it off. Still, GMTO says it is on course for the four-mirror installation and \"First Light\" in 2023, when the telescope will be turned to the night skies for the first time.

The Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) is part of an international consortium contributing key instrumentation technology and philanthropic support for the GMT. The highly anticipated report ranked the US-ELTP as the top frontier project for ground-based observatories and detailed that building an extremely large telescope \"is absolutely essential if the United States is to maintain a position as a leader in ground-based astronomy.\" \"This endorsement from the decadal survey is tremendous and validates the years of hard work our scientists have spent developing GMT technologies,\" said Charles Alcock, director of the CfA and GMTO board member. \"We are incredibly honored to be ranked as a top priority in the decadal survey and are grateful for the many scientists who engaged in the process,\" said Robert Shelton, president of the GMT. \"This endorsement solidifies the scientific momentum that our founding consortium of international universities and research institutions pioneered years ago. After all, we designed the Giant Magellan Telescope to discover the unknown, and it's the unimaginable discoveries that could change humanity forever.\" The GMT was evaluated in Astro2020 as a core partner of the US-ELTP. The goal of the program is for the NSF's NOIRLab to provide U.S.-based astronomers with full-sky observing access to the GMT in the Southern Hemisphere and the Thirty Meter Telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. Astro2020 viewed the US-ELTP as a visionary program that will enable collaborative, inclusive and transformational research in nearly all areas of astrophysics-from understanding the fundamental nature of the universe to the search for life on distant exoplanets. \"We are proud to be part of the US Extremely Large Telescope Program and its bold vision to provide full-sky access to the astronomical community,\" said Walter Massey, board chair of the GMT and former director of the National Science Foundation. \"A heartfelt congratulations to both the Thirty Meter Telescope and NOIRLab. This strong recommendation is the result of many years of hard work. It is a great time to support and join our inspirational project and help secure access to these amazing telescopes for decades to come.\" The 24.5-meter-aperture GMT is positioned to put a federal investment to good use. Construction is well underway on Las Campanas Peak at the southern edge of Chile's Atacama Desert, one of the best locations on Earth to explore the heavens. The project has completed hard-rock excavation for the foundation and support infrastructure, cast six of seven primary mirrors, begun fabricating its first adaptive secondary mirror and has already secured a subaward from the National Science Foundation to accelerate the prototyping and testing of some of the most powerful optical and infrared technologies ever engineered. Astro2020 highlights the GMT's 368-square-meter light-collecting power, unmatched 25-arcminute field of view, advanced adaptive optics system and high-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction-limited imaging capabilities.

International and the GMTO Corporation, the nonprofit organization building the Giant Magellan Telescope, a contract to manufacture the world's first off-axis segment thin shell for the telescope's revolutionary Adaptive Secondary Mirrors (ASM). Safran Reosc has been selected to manufacture first one of the off-axis shell that will be delivered in summer 2023. Indeed, as part of the risk reduction program launched by the National Science Foundation, GMTO Corporation needs to manufacture first one adaptive segment before launching the full system. For Safran Reosc, the challenge is of importance as the aspherical deformation of these shells is ten times greater than any shell manufactured so far. The Giant Magellan Telescope is a 25-meter optical/infrared extremely large telescope and is under construction at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Its conception includes a sophisticated adaptive system made of seven deformable mirrors. Each mirror is composed of a thin shell of glass that is bonded to 4,725 independently controlled voice coil actuators. The seven thin glass shells are precisely aspherical, one-meter diameter, in Zerodur, with a thickness of 2 millimeters (six are off-axis segments and is on-axis). The actuators will push and pull on the mirror's surface over 2,000 times a second to correct wavefront distortions introduced by optical turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Such a system will allow astronomers to see farther into the universe with a lot of details. It will transform twinkling stars into clear steady points of light.

This strong recommendation is the result of many years of hard work. It is a great time to support and join our inspirational project and help secure access to these amazing telescopes for decades to come.\" The 24.5-meter aperture GMT is positioned to put a federal investment to good use. Construction is well underway on Las Campanas Peak at the southern edge of Chile's Atacama Desert, one of the best locations on Earth to explore the heavens. The project has completed hard rock excavation for the foundation and support infrastructure, cast six of seven primary mirrors, begun fabricating its first adaptive secondary mirror, and has already secured a sub-award from the National Science Foundation to accelerate the prototyping and testing of some of the most powerful optical and infrared technologies ever engineered. Astro2020 highlights the GMT's 368-square-meter light collecting power, unmatched 25-arcminute field of view, advanced adaptive optics system and high-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction-limited imaging capabilities. The report emphasizes that the \"capabilities can be brought to bear on nearly all of the important science questions laid out by this decadal survey, across all three of our key science themes.\" These inspiring scientific priorities include pathways to habitable worlds, new windows on the dynamic universe, and drivers of galaxy growth. The recommendation also stated that the US-ELTP \"provides observational capabilities unmatched in space or the ground and opens an enormous discovery space for new observations and discoveries not yet anticipated.\" \"The GMT will bring us a wealth of knowledge about the universe, studying everything from exoplanets to the faintest galaxies to black holes,\" says Daniel Eisenstein, GMTO board member and astronomer at the CfA. \"This is indeed an incredible time for the field of astrophysics.\" The GMT's international consortium is deeply gratified by the enormous global support received from the scientific and philanthropic communities. The consortium would also like to recognize the ngVLA and CMB-S4 teams on their strong Astro2020 endorsements. Together, the recommendations will help build vibrant opportunities in astronomy and contribute to significant science discoveries for the 2030s and beyond. The GMT is the work of an international consortium of leading universities and research institutions representing five countries.

The site in Chile, which sits 8,255 feet above sea level, is being primed for the next stage of construction and for pouring of the foundation.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11091913/Enormous-12-story-Magellan-telescope-powerful-gets-205M-funding-boost.html"}, {"title": "The Giant Magellan Telescope Is Another Step Closer To Reality - And It Will Have 4 Times The Resolution Of The JWST", "date": "2022-08-21", "content": "Scientists have finally stepped up to begin the construction of an incredibly amazing and state-of-the-art telescope, known as the Giant Magellan Telescope, to harness the hope of exploring space science and cosmic specifics in more detail. The telescope would be an incredible scientific feat of its own and would come with even more specifications and features than the James Webb Telescope. Yes, you heard it right! However, to foster the concept of building this unusual marvel, GMT has just received a whopping sum of $205 million dollars that will be spent on its construction. On that count, this giant telescope is currently under construction, and the aim behind its development is to allow scientists to reveal those facts about space that are still not explored. However, the company is signaling the possible arrival of this 12-story Giant Magellan Telescope in 2029, and most interestingly, it will come with a light collecting area that will be ten times more precise than that of the James Webb Telescope and will also have a spatial resolution of as much as four times that of the JWST. According to Dr. Walter Massey, Board Chair of the Giant Magellan Telescope and former Director of the National Science Foundation, \"We are working with some of the brightest engineers and scientists at leading research institutions around the globe.\" He further said, \"The recent contributions from our investing partners in the Giant Magellan Telescope are collectively pushing the boundaries of astronomy, making the future a reality and allowing us to answer some key science goals, including 'Are we alone in the Universe.\" On the other hand, Lisa Kewley, director of the Centre for Astrophysics at Harvard and Smithsonian, stated, \"The GMT will revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos through innovative new technology combined with a world-class site in Chile. The telescope will answer some of humankind's biggest questions about the first stars, the first galaxies, the secrets of dark matter and dark energy, and extrasolar planets suitable for life.\" However, it must be noted that several countries, like South Korea, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, and Chile, are collaborating with the Giant Magellan Telescope organization. One of the most interesting details is that the seven mirror segments of the telescope will have a diameter of 82 feet, and they are currently being prepared in Tucson, Arizona. As per Eric Isaacs, president of the Carnegie Institution for Science, \"Six like-minded founders of the Giant Magellan Telescope worked together to close the financial gap between the resources we have attracted to build the telescope and what is required to complete it. This investment will bring the telescope closer to first light and provide the world with transformational knowledge of our universe. Carnegie is proud to have kickstarted the funding effort and to have worked closely with our peers.\" Coupled with this, a 40,000-square-foot area has also been constructed in Rockford, Illinois with the aim of developing this giant telescope structure. Chile is also preparing its construction site, which is 8255 feet, for the manufacturing of the next stage of construction for this telescope. Moreover, its adaptive secondary mirror has also been in progress in France and Italy. GMT President Robert Shelton stated, \"We are honored to receive this investment in our future. The funding is truly a collaborative effort from our founders. It will result in the fabrication of the world's largest mirrors, the giant telescope mount that holds and aligns them, and a science instrument that will allow us to study the chemical evolution of stars and planets like never before. \"", "url": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/the-giant-magellan-telescope-is-another-step-closer-to-reality-and-it-will-have-4-times-the-resolution-of-the-jwst/"}]}]
