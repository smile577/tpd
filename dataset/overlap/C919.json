CFM, a 50/50 joint company between Snecma (SAFRAN Group) and General Electric Company, is the world's largest commercial aircraft engine manufacturer. In 2008, the two companies renewed the partnership to the year 2040. COMAC has forecasted a global market for more than 2,000 C919 aircraft over the 20 years following entry into service in 2016. LEAP-X is a totally new centerline engine formally announced in mid-2008, and the development program has been progressing steadily ever since. CFM will continue engine development work, including the second phase of testing for eCore 1, as well as running full-scale endurance tests on the Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) composite fan. This development work will culminate in the first full engine, provisionally called the LEAP-X1C, going to test in early 2013. COMAC has opted for a complete Integrated Propulsion System (IPS) for the C919. CFM will provide the engine and, in partnership with Nexcelle, the nacelle and thrust reverser to deliver a complete IPS solution to COMAC. Nexcelle is a 50/50 joint venture between GE's Middle River Aircraft Systems and SAFRAN Group's Aircelle the two companies launched in 2008. \"We are very pleased to work with CFM on our new C919,\" said Zhang Qingwei, chairman of COMAC. \"The leading-edge technology incorporated in the engine, coupled with all of the benefits of a completely integrated propulsion system, will enable us to build a very competitive airplane for the global market.\" \"The relationship between CFM and China goes back more than 25 years,\" said Eric Bachelet, president and CEO of CFM International. \"This agreement is the next logical step in what has been a tremendously successful collaboration between CFM, the Chinese aviation industry, and our Chinese airline customers. Today, we are embarking on an exciting new chapter with COMAC and we are honored to be a part of it.\"", "url": "https://www.airframer.com/news_story.html?release=7342"}, {"title": "Honeywell Chosen To Provide Braking System For The C919 Airliner", "date": "2010-07-11", "content": "Honeywell has been selected by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd.

Its designed standard range is 4,075 km and extended range 5,555 km, which enables it to operate on diversified air routes. Comac plans to launch the first flight of C919 in 2014, and get airworthiness certification and enter into service by 2016. The Paris Air Show kicked off Monday at Le Bourget, northeast of Paris. The event, held every odd-year in the summer, has been the leading air show for over a century. This year's show attracts a record of 2,100 exhibitors, with 59 of the world's top 100 companies in the industry. Aero-giant Boeing debuted its new 747-8 intercontinental passenger jet and 747-8 freighter, and its 787 dreamliner for the first time outside the United States; while the Europe-based Airbus displayed its A380 passenger jet and A400M military aircraft with daily flight performances during the show, taking full advantage of its home turf.

The partnership between the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co Ltd, a subsidiary of COMAC, and the United States-based Eaton Corp, a company specializing in systems used to control and distribute energy, is among 17 strategic agreements COMAC has reached with various aviation companies. The Eaton SAMC Aircraft Conveyance System Co Ltd will be situated in the Shanghai Pudong Lujiazui Software Park and will concentrate on the design, development and manufacture of the fuel and hydraulic conveyance systems needed for COMAC's production of the C919, said Lu Xiao'an, the director of the new venture. The conveyance system will transport fuel through a network of pipes running throughout the plane. The design of the system will thus have a direct effect on an aircraft's performance. Craig Arnold, vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Eaton, said the official opening of the joint venture is an important addition to the international cooperation taking place on the C919 project. \"We are greatly honored to be a part of this important project and to be a part of the growing aviation industry in China,\" Arnold said. \"Together we will utilize the best civil aviation technology, world-class manufacturing capabilities, and proven management practices to create a globally competitive company.\" Eaton has a long history of supplying fuel and hydraulic conveyance systems and currently collaborates with Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft manufacturers. SAMC will be the controlling party of the new venture, holding 51 percent of the shares. The remaining 49 percent will go to Eaton, and the amount of registered capital in the venture will total $18 million. According to Jin Zhuanglong, general manager of COMAC, the venture was granted a business license in March and is dedicated to developing techniques required for designing and building conveyance systems for the global civil aviation market. The design stage of the C919, which will be the first Chinese-made trunk-line passenger aircraft, will be completed by the end of next year and the aircraft will make its maiden flight in late 2014 before being delivered to buyers in 2016. So far, COMAC has received more than 100 orders for the C919, said Jin. Once in service, the C919, the equivalent of the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320, is expected to lessen the country's dependence on foreign aircraft manufacturers.

Some experts say that the C919 will not be unbeatable aircraft in terms of technologically or commercially when it starts fliying One of the reasons is that its dependence on foreign suppliers, such as General Electric, Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, Goodrich, and Eaton, all of which are part of the Boeing 787 supply chain. Chad Ohlandt, an associate engineer at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution, stated that \"The large commercial aircraft market currently amounts to fewer than 1,000 deliveries a year globally. This makes it difficult for more than one or two manufacturers to achieve economies of scale. There's also competition from Brazil and Canada, where Embraer and Bombardier are seeking to expand into the large commercial aircraft market. In Japan and Russia, the aerospace industries have designs on the regional jet market as a steppingstone towards large commercial aircraft production\" and adding \" Lastly, as an airplane's total operating costs over their 30-year life span well exceed their purchase price, it is difficult to convince airlines to buy less efficient airplanes, even at a discount. Even a government mandate for all four major Chinese carriers to buy the C919 exclusively (about 100 to 150 planes per year, combined) would not produce a large enough market share to be competitive with Boeing or Airbus without significant foreign sales.

Some of companies which are the purchasing airlines or lessors were China Eastern Airlines, Air China, Hainan Airlines, China Southern Airlines, CDB Leasing Company, GECAS, BOC. Wu Guanghui, deputy general manager of the (COMAC), indicates the orders are mostly from domestic customers, but there are some from the United States and southeast Asian countries. Wu said C919, China's first single-aisle passenger jet, will be powered in the initial stage by advanced LEAP-X1C engines that will be installed in Boeing 737Max and Airbus A320 aircraft.

The manufacturers agreed to cooperate on human-machine cockpit interfaces, the electrical system, the development of aluminum-lithium alloy standards and customer services, including technical publications. The companies expect to complete the four projects over the next year in conjunction with the C919 development schedule, they said. Comac chairman Jin Zhuanglong and Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier president and CEO, signed the agreement in Shanghai. Jin said the agreement \"will certainly contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of not only the C919 and C Series aircraft programs, but also of Comac and Bombardier's overall businesses.\" The agreement marks another step in Bombardier's effort to raise its profile in Asia, which represents a growth outlet for the 110- to 130-seat C Series as well as the company's CRJ regional jets and Q400 turboprops. In February, Bombardier and Avic International Leasing of China signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in the financing of commercial aircraft sales in China and elsewhere. China's Shenyang Aircraft supplies fuselage sections for the Q400 and the C Series. Bombardier and Comac signed a framework agreement in March 2011 for long- term, strategic cooperation. The definitive agreement represents the first phase of that strategic cooperation. The parties said they will continue exploring other possibilities for cooperation on program commonalities such as joint procurement, development \"synergies\" and customer services. Bombardier's competition also is engaged in China.

Since then, however, Shenyang's failure to meet Bombardier's schedules forced the Canadian manufacturer to reassign many of the work packages, perhaps most notably the center fuselage section, to Short Brothers.

While plans call for the earliest Leap production engines to enter service in 2016, CFM plans to spread the switch to the new models over 2017 and 2018. Snecma has already begun manufacturing large numbers of the new 3D-woven composite fan blades, meant to serve simply as test components. In an effort to avoid producing a high proportion of scrapped or reworked fan blades, the company plans to accelerate its \"lean lab\" production from 50 to 100 blades per month. Snecma has set a \"scrap rate\" target of less than 10 percent during serial production. Snecma and GE expect to invest a total $750 million to build or upgrade facilities. GE, for example, has enhanced its before-shipment test facility in Peebles, Ohio. Snecma has upgraded its Snecma Xinyi Airfoils Casting factory in China. In Rochester, New Hampshire, and Commercy, France, two new factories will produce a combined 32,000 fan blades per year by 2019, according to CFM. Plans call for both to devote space to Albany Engineering Composites, Snecma's \"preferred supplier\" for carbon-fiber weaving and one of the few new providers for the Leap. Some 90 percent of the Leap's 300-plus suppliers already provide parts for the CFM56 program. GE and Snecma want to \"de-risk\" their supply chain, down to those small family businesses that might encounter difficulty accessing credit. The strategy includes offering such small enterprises CFM-backed bank guarantees, explained CFM executive v-p C\u00e9dric Goubet. \"We also support suppliers for them to have access to raw material,\" Harant added. For each part number, CFM plans to find multiple sources. \"We'll complete first source selection no later than early next year,\" Harant promised. Wanting to avoid the burden of managing a double supply chain from the beginning, CFM plans to introduce second sources later, in a progressive fashion.

The turbofan features the integrated propulsion system developed for the new Chinese airliner by Nexcelle, which is a joint venture between GE's Middle River Aircraft Systems division and Safran's Aircelle. Leap flight testing began on October 9 at GE's Victorville, Calif. facility. Overall, the Leap engine has now completed more than 1,500 hours of ground and flight tests as it heads for initial certification in 2015. The Leap 1A turbofan will power Airbus's new A320neo and the Leap 1B variant will be used for Boeing's 737 Max. On November 11, China's Zhejiang Loong Airlines signed an agreement with CFM--a joint venture between Snecma and GE--to buy Leap 1A engines for nine A320neos. At C919 quarterly program review meeting held in late October, Comac told its partners that the first full prototype will be completely assembled by the end of December 2014. The airframer, which has had several delays with the program, now wants to roll out the C919 by mid-2015 and achieve a first flight by the end of the year. \"They have had some challenges with the program, but they are now very close to being on track and are progressing quite well,\" Nexcelle president Michel Abella told AIN just ahead of this week's Airshow China in Zhuhai. Nexcelle's primary goal for Leap's new IPS is to lower operators' direct operating costs by contributing to improved performance of the engines and delivering improved reliability. For instance, overall installed weight has been reduced through using new pylon designs. Nexcelle's new Panache thrust reverser for the Leap-1C IPS nacelle system features the company's new O-Duct design, which replaces two D-shaped doors in a traditional reverser. The O-Duct design is more efficient due to the removal of the links that cut the reverser's flow path in two with the D-shaped doors. In the new unit, the thrust-blocking doors are located around the full inner circumference of the composite O-Duct structure. They are deployed by new mechanisms attached to the forward frame and are fully contained inside the O-Duct structure when stowed, avoiding any interference with fan flow. Aircelle's SAVI joint venture with China's Xi'an Aircraft International Corporation is now building some 2,000 blocker doors each year for the thrust reversers used on the CFM56-5A and CFM56-5B engines that power Airbus A320 airliners. The Shanghai-based operation was established in 2011 to produce and assemble nacelle components and may yet become involved in manufacturing of the IPS units for the Leap 1C engine. Meanwhile, Nexcelle is also developing an IPS for GE's new Passport engine for business aircraft. The powerplant has been selected by Bombardier for its new Global 7000 and 8000 business jets. The Passport is due to make its first flight later this year.

The single-aisle twin-engine jetliner has been designed to go head-to-head with Boeing's 737 and Airbus A320 in the lucrative aviation market. Assembly of the first prototype airframe is almost complete, says People's Daily, with the main landing gear and forward landing gear also now installed. Some major works - such as the installation of the avionics, flight control and hydraulics systems - are still to be completed. The various systems will then have to be fully integrated and rigorously tested before the test flight, which is scheduled to happen before the end of this year. The various parts of the aircraft - including the nose, front and middle fuselage, wings and tail sections - were designed by the corporation and manufactured in Chengdu, Shenyang and Harbin. COMAC are reported to have already secured more than 450 orders from 18 different customers, most of which are believed to be local airlines and leasing firms. The manufacturer is targeting 2017 for C919 certification, with first deliveries also scheduled for that year. China is keen to develop a successful commercial aircraft to prove it can match the developed industries of the United States and Europe. Airbus has forecast that China's domestic aviation market will become the world's biggest within the next decade.

A veteran of many Western aerospace programs, Scott joined Comac in 2011 to advise senior leadership on Western development methodologies and organization. The wing-to-fuselage join for the prototype C919 took place in December, and the static and fatigue test articles now follow the prototype down the production line, Scott reported. Comac completed structural tests to validate the design a year ago; like Comac's ARJ21 regional airliner, nearly all of the structure consists of domestically produced parts. Avionics and system integration for the C919 has started, and Honeywell has begun translating the approved control laws into fly-by-wire software. The cockpit layout and sidestick controllers \"follow the Airbus philosophy,\" Scott noted. A second assembly line for the C919 is being built on reclaimed land at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, where plans call for construction of a fifth runway dedicated to flight test for Comac. Construction has started on another huge facility south of Shanghai for Avic's Commercial Engine Company. Scott briefly mentioned the three indigenous commercial engines that the Chinese conglomerate plans to develop. It plans to launch the CJ-500 as an alternative to the GE Aviation CF34 powerplants on the ARJ21; it intends the CJ-1000 to power narrowbody airliners, and it could serve as an alternative to the CFM Leap-1C powerplants on the C919.

The C919, built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, will be the country's most ambitious effort to date to break into the global aircraft market. The latest pictures have shown the final assembly work on the nation's first single-aisle airliner, which is currently under construction in Shanghai, is well underway. The single-aisle twin-engine jetliner has been designed to go head-to-head with Boeing's 737 and Airbus A320 in the lucrative aviation market. Assembly of the first prototype airframe is almost complete, says People's Daily, with the main landing gear and forward landing gear also now installed. Some major works - such as the installation of the avionics, flight control and hydraulics systems - are still to be completed. The various systems will then have to be fully integrated and rigorously tested before the test flight, which is scheduled to happen before the end of this year. The various parts of the aircraft - including the nose, front and middle fuselage, wings and tail sections - were designed by the corporation and manufactured in Chengdu, Shenyang and Harbin. COMAC are reported to have already secured more than 450 orders from 18 different customers, most of which are believed to be local airlines and leasing firms. The manufacturer is targeting 2017 for C919 certification, with first deliveries also scheduled for that year. China is keen to develop a successful commercial aircraft to prove it can match the developed industries of the United States and Europe. Airbus has forecast that China's domestic aviation market will become the world's biggest within the next decade. China's air-passenger traffic will increase 8% annually from 2013 to 2032 - compared with an expected global annual growth rate of 4.8% - as many more affluent Chinese passengers take to the skies. It is hoped that an official date for the first test flight will be announced in the near future.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2978940/Look-Boeing-China-s-new-C919-plane-aims-famous-737-Airbus-A320-begin-test-flights-year.html"}, {"title": "Doors of first C919 aircraft transported to COMAC Pudong base", "date": "2015-04-20", "content": "The fwd cargo door, aft cargo door and emergency exit door of the first C919 aircraft, manufactured by AVIC Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation Industry Group Corporation Limited (AVIC Hongdu), arrived at Pudong base of COMAC Manufacturing and Final Assembly Center on April 18th, 2015.

The C919, a narrow-body jet which can seat 168 passengers, has been under production at a facility in commercial hub Shanghai for over a year, as workers assembled components under the guidance of Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China. For China, the plane represents years of efforts in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and Boeing of the United States, and even compete against them. \"The roll out of the first C919 aircraft marks a significant milestone in the development of China's first indigenous aircraft,\" COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong told an audience of government and industry officials. A small truck towed the 39-metre long plane ? Bottom of Form painted white with a green tail ? Bottom of Form out of a cavernous building decorated with an enormous Chinese flag into the sunlight as project workers marched alongside, an AFP journalist saw. But the aircraft, which has a range of up to 5,555 kilometres, will not make its first test flight this year as originally scheduled, Jin said, with the maiden voyage planned for 2016. The China Daily has reported it could even be put back to 2017. 500 orders: China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong's wife and a member of the notorious \"Gang of Four\", personally backed an attempt to do so. The result was the Y-10. Only three were ever made. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE of the US and France's Safran. Spending on the C919 has not been revealed. Last month, the Export-Import Bank of China said it would provide state-owned COMAC with $7.9 billion in financing for its aircraft projects. The company already has orders for 517 of its C919 planes, according to a COMAC statement, almost all of them from domestic buyers. Among foreign customers, Thailand's City Airways has ordered 10, according to an announcement last month. COMAC has already developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ, in a project which is years behind schedule. The 78-90 seat ARJ is still undergoing test flights and lacks the crucial certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration, enabling it to fly in US skies. The Chinese company also plans a wide body plane, the C929, in cooperation with Russia's United Aircraft Corp., and speculation is mounting China will create a new aero-engine entity to try to produce the powerful jets needed for large civil aircraft. The single-aisle C919 targets the lucrative segment dominated by Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320. Fierce competition: Airbus which has an assembly facility in the northern Chinese port of Tianjin is engaged in a fierce struggle with the US' Boeing for dominance in the crucial Chinese market. China is expected to add 6,330 new aircraft worth $950 billion to its commercial fleet by 2034, Boeing said in August in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping sealed a deal for Chinese firms to buy 300 Boeing planes worth $38 billion as he visited the company's Seattle plant. Under an agreement announced on Xi's trip COMAC and Boeing will also set up a \"completion centre\" in China for work such as painting planes. Last week, during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, China agreed to buy 100 A320 aircraft from Airbus in a deal worth $9.7 billion and confirmed options for another 30 twin-aisle A330s. China is the European Union's largest trading partner and several major EU countries including Germany, Britain and France are wooing the country in the hope of winning business and becoming hubs for the growing overseas trade of China's yuan currency. Many EU firms complain Beijing restricts market access to sectors where Chinese firms in Europe are free to operate and tensions remain over market access and alleged Chinese \"dumping\" of products such as steel.", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/china-debuts-first-domestically-produced-passenger-aircraft/"}, {"title": "China's Comac rolls out C919 jet, ground tests to start soon", "date": "2015-11-02", "content": "The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) said on Monday it had rolled out its C919 narrow body jet, which is meant to rival similar models from Airbus Group and Boeing Co.

The company also develops passenger planes like the short-range jet ARJ21. C919 made its debut at an exhibition in 2011 in Paris and its first deliveries are scheduled for late 2018. COMAC has secured orders for 517 C919 planes from 21 customers from around the world, according to National Business Daily. In the next 20 years, Airbus forecasts that China will need more than 5,300 new passenger aircraft and freighters worth $820 billion - 17 percent of total global demand. That demand, it said, will make China the world's largest domestic aviation market in the next decade. The maximum flying range of the C919 is 5,555 kilometers (about 3,450 miles), which equals the distance of a non-stop flight from Beijing to Singapore. Designed to join the family of 158-174 passenger seat narrow-body twin-engine jet airliners, experts say the C919 will compete with Boeing and Airbus in the medium-range aircraft sector. The launch of the C919 is not only good news for COMAC, but also for the more than 200 Chinese companies from 22 provinces and cities that supply parts for the aircraft.

CFM and Comac held a delivery ceremony to mark the occasion in Shanghai, where Comac vice president Wu Guanghui confirmed plans to finish assembly and roll out the first C919 test article by the end of the year. \"It is a great day for the Leap engine and CFM,\" said CFM executive vice president Allen Paxson. \"This engine is the culmination of more than six years of hard work between the CFM and Comac teams and represents the launch of the next exciting phase of the C919 aircraft development.\" Launched in December 2009, when Comac picked the Leap-1C as the sole Western powerplant for the 150-passenger C919, the Leap family of engines has logged a total of more than 4,730 certification ground- and flight-test hours and 7,900 cycles. The program, which includes the Leap-1A for the Airbus A320neo and the Leap-1B for the Boeing 737 Max, now consists of 28 CFM ground- and flight-test engines, along with a total of 32 flight-test engines for aircraft manufacturers. The first Leap-1C engine completed a flight-test program in late 2014 on a modified 747 flying testbed at GE facilities in Victorville, California. Along with gauging engine operability, stall margin, performance, emissions and acoustics, the flight-test program also validated technologies including the woven carbon fiber composite fan, the Twin-Annular, Pre-Mixing Swirler combustor, ceramic matrix composite shrouds in the high-pressure turbine and titanium aluminide blades in the low-pressure turbine. Meanwhile, C919 development has entered a critical phase and Comac has nearly finished final assembly of the first airframe structure.

The timing will allow engineers at the state-owned aerospace company to complete ground tests beforehand without undue haste, said the people, who were not authorized to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified. Comac's C919 represents China's attempt to challenge Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co in the market for narrow-body aircraft. It is scheduled to reach its first buyers in 2018 after a series of production delays pushed deliveries back four years, though industry observers expect delays into the 2020s. The company unveiled the airplane in November and said it had received 517 orders, mainly from Chinese lessors. However, the plane will not be airborne until around a year after its unveiling while Comac conducts ground tests. \"This will allow them to go through the tests gradually, and iron out as many kinks as possible in the aircraft's structure and design,\" said one of the people who is in regular contact with Comac officials. \"Their executives keep emphasizing that they would rather the aircraft be late than unsafe.\" Officials at Shanghai-based Comac, which oversees the plane's development and production, declined to comment.

Single-aisle planes account for over half of all aircraft in service. They also make up 62 percent of all planes on order in the 20 years from 2015, with orders reaching 25,354 units, said consultancy Flightglobal Ascend. The C919 is built with parts from such global suppliers as Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp unit Parker Aerospace. Its engines are by CFM International, a joint venture of the aviation unit of General Electric Co and Safran SA subsidiary Snecma. Production delays, however, mean the C919 is likely to be only as good as current A320s and 737s at best, and that it will be technologically behind upgraded versions of those rival planes, industry analysts said. Airbus has started delivering A320neo planes to customers, while Boeing will begin deliveries of the 737 Max next year.

The C919, a narrow-body jet which can seat 168 passengers, has been under production at a facility in commercial hub Shanghai for over a year, as workers assembled components under the guidance of Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China. For China, the plane represents years of efforts in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and Boeing of the United States, and even compete against them. \"The roll out of the first C919 aircraft marks a significant milestone in the development of China's first indigenous aircraft,\" COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong told an audience of government and industry officials. A small truck towed the 39-metre long plane ? Bottom of Form painted white with a green tail ? Bottom of Form out of a cavernous building decorated with an enormous Chinese flag into the sunlight as project workers marched alongside, an AFP journalist saw. But the aircraft, which has a range of up to 5,555 kilometres, will not make its first test flight this year as originally scheduled, Jin said, with the maiden voyage planned for 2016. The China Daily has reported it could even be put back to 2017. 500 orders: China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong's wife and a member of the notorious \"Gang of Four\", personally backed an attempt to do so. The result was the Y-10. Only three were ever made. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE of the US and France's Safran. Spending on the C919 has not been revealed. Last month, the Export-Import Bank of China said it would provide state-owned COMAC with $7.9 billion in financing for its aircraft projects. The company already has orders for 517 of its C919 planes, according to a COMAC statement, almost all of them from domestic buyers. Among foreign customers, Thailand's City Airways has ordered 10, according to an announcement last month. COMAC has already developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ, in a project which is years behind schedule. The 78-90 seat ARJ is still undergoing test flights and lacks the crucial certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration, enabling it to fly in US skies. The Chinese company also plans a wide body plane, the C929, in cooperation with Russia's United Aircraft Corp., and speculation is mounting China will create a new aero-engine entity to try to produce the powerful jets needed for large civil aircraft. The single-aisle C919 targets the lucrative segment dominated by Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320. Fierce competition: Airbus which has an assembly facility in the northern Chinese port of Tianjin is engaged in a fierce struggle with the US' Boeing for dominance in the crucial Chinese market. China is expected to add 6,330 new aircraft worth $950 billion to its commercial fleet by 2034, Boeing said in August in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping sealed a deal for Chinese firms to buy 300 Boeing planes worth $38 billion as he visited the company's Seattle plant. Under an agreement announced on Xi's trip COMAC and Boeing will also set up a \"completion centre\" in China for work such as painting planes. Last week, during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, China agreed to buy 100 A320 aircraft from Airbus in a deal worth $9.7 billion and confirmed options for another 30 twin-aisle A330s. China is the European Union's largest trading partner and several major EU countries including Germany, Britain and France are wooing the country in the hope of winning business and becoming hubs for the growing overseas trade of China's yuan currency. Many EU firms complain Beijing restricts market access to sectors where Chinese firms in Europe are free to operate and tensions remain over market access and alleged Chinese \"dumping\" of products such as steel.", "url": "https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/china-debuts-first-domestically-produced-passenger-aircraft/"}, {"title": "China's Comac rolls out C919 jet, ground tests to start soon", "date": "2015-11-02", "content": "The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) said on Monday it had rolled out its C919 narrow body jet, which is meant to rival similar models from Airbus Group and Boeing Co.

In a statement, the company said it had already received 517 orders for the aircraft mainly from domestic firms. The much-delayed passenger jet is the Chinese answer to Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 models which make up more than half of the aircraft in service.

The C919 aircraft, which took seven years of design and manufacturing work, is the product of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). The company also develops passenger planes like the short-range jet ARJ21. C919 made its debut at an exhibition in 2011 in Paris and its first deliveries are scheduled for late 2018. COMAC has secured orders for 517 C919 planes from 21 customers from around the world, according to National Business Daily. In the next 20 years, Airbus forecasts that China will need more than 5,300 new passenger aircraft and freighters worth $820 billion - 17 percent of total global demand. That demand, it said, will make China the world's largest domestic aviation market in the next decade. The maximum flying range of the C919 is 5,555 kilometers (about 3,450 miles), which equals the distance of a non-stop flight from Beijing to Singapore. Designed to join the family of 158-174 passenger seat narrow-body twin-engine jet airliners, experts say the C919 will compete with Boeing and Airbus in the medium-range aircraft sector. The launch of the C919 is not only good news for COMAC, but also for the more than 200 Chinese companies from 22 provinces and cities that supply parts for the aircraft. Xizi Holdings, an aircraft spare part producer, has been working with major aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus since 2007.

The aircraft took off at 2:01 pm local time, and remained aloft for more than an hour before returning at 3:19 pm. The successful flight of the C919 gives the Chinese aviation industry a boost of credibility, after initial plans called for the airplane to fly by the end of 2015. By the time of its rollout, schedules called for first flight in the second quarter of 2016 but various delays in final systems installation and ground testing forced a further one-year wait. High-speed taxi tests started on April 16, 2017 at Pudong International Airport. On April 23, the C919 lifted its front nose gear at rotation speed before coming to a full stop. That marked the forth and last ground test before first flight. Although the C919 is largely a Chinese indigenous design, a host of Western suppliers have contributed major components, including CFM International Leap-1C engines, Liebherr landing gear and Honeywell flight control and navigation systems. Despite two slipped first delivery dates, Comac has managed to secure firm orders and options for 570 C919s from 23 companies. China Eastern Airlines will serve as the type's launch customer, and lessor GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways remain the only export customers so far. The C919 can seat 168 passengers in a single-class, economy configuration, 158 across two classes or 174 in a high-density configuration. The standard range covers 2,200 nautical miles, while an extended range version will allow for 3,000 nautical miles. The aircraft's list price amounts to some $50 million, about half the price Airbus quotes for the A320. Certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency looms after a panel discussion with their Chinese counterparts in late April. Comac has yet to start talks with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for its endorsement. Failing to win FAA certification would restrict the sale of the aircraft to only domestic market and certain regional clients.

According to a source working closely with Comac who spoke with AIN on condition of anonymity, engineers have begun re-evaluating the C919's flight- deck design to satisfy Part 25.1302 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. \"Section 1302 is quite strict on human factors and necessary for FAA certification, but it's not required by the CAAC,\" he told AIN. \"So now there is a conflict between whether they have to meet 1302 requirements or not. If Comac wants to sell aircraft outside of China...there is always the constant debate of how much of the requirements they need to comply with coupled with how many design changes are necessary and how much money needs to be spent.\" Comac's challenges in meeting the certification procedures required to enable sale in the U.S. reflect a larger problem plaguing the aerospace manufacturer, namely technical know-how. While foreign experts in China transfer manufacturing knowledge and R&D capabilities, communication problems, misinterpretation of FAA requirements, and limited local skills have significantly delayed progress. The challenges have become evident as the C919 continues to undergo further envelope expansion testing at its Shanghai facility and the team there encounters repeated setbacks due to disruptions in design changes and a shortage of local expertise. \"As always, they're learning, which means it's going to take longer,\" said the source. \"It's not like you are working with Airbus or Boeing who can go through this process within an 18-month time span. You need to account for the learning curve.''

More than a decade later, the C919 program continues to be hampered by weak oversight and manufacturing delays, sparking concerns about its ability to gain certification in Western markets. According to a source working closely with Comac who spoke with AIN on condition of anonymity, one of the long-standing impediments constraining progress is the integration of avionics components and its subsystems in the flight deck. This challenge reflects a larger concern about the company's ability to achieve effective coordination across component teams. \"The C919 is still fixing its design problems, so it's not flying a lot. They haven't really come to grips with some of the issues because everybody is working in a vacuum. They can't integrate the plane because no one is talking to each other,\" he told AIN. \"Everyone wants to act as a soloist and get all the glory, but you can't have a bunch of soloists and build an airplane.\" Concerns about avionics integration were initially raised when China began developing its first indigenously developed regional jetliner, the ARJ21. Today, engineers continue to make incremental improvements to the flight deck's design. A new layout on the regional jet now features a better- organized grouping of switches, buttons, instruments, and displays to simplify workload and increase situational awareness. Designers expect the new layout, successfully tested on the ARJ21's flight simulator, to significantly reduce the amount of pilot training required on the type. Unlike the ARJ-21, which uses commercial-off-the-shelf products in the cockpit, the C919 is working with a complete avionics system design with key components sourced from western suppliers. Aviage Systems, a 50-50 joint venture between GE Aviation and Aviation Industry Corporation of China, supplies an integrated modular avionics system, while Honeywell Aerospace supplies the aircraft's fly-by-wire system with HonFei flight controls as well as the braking system under a joint venture with Boyun Aviation Systems. Collins Aerospace, under joint ventures established with China Electronics Technology Avionics Company and AVIC, supplies the C919's communication, navigation, and integrated surveillance systems. For foreign suppliers, the cost of doing business in China means entering into a joint venture with local firms to participate in tenders for major aerospace components and systems. Indeed, since the government's launch of its industry- building \"Made in China 2025\" policy program, joint ventures with foreign firms can serve as effective vehicles for knowledge transfer and R&D capabilities. However, simply throwing more money at the C919 will not make it globally competitive. While foreign firms have contributed major components to the program, Chinese teams on the factory floor are tasked with system-wide integration. Not only does this require highly coordinated teams-a concept that Comac allegedly struggles with-it also requires a fair degree of technical know-how to bring its ambitious C919 project in line with FAA and EASA requirements. \"If they are going to sell this aircraft outside of China, they will need FAA and EASA approval, and both are difficult to get; the teams don't get this ... both the FAA and EASA said they are going to help but they're also shaking their heads. There are so many problems with integration, they don't know where to start,\" said the source. Meanwhile, the ARJ-21 is also facing its own set of issues as it moves towards market competitiveness. While production has remained relatively unchanged, with one aircraft rolling off the line once every four to six weeks, the new jets are destined for Chinese operators. If there is going to be a place for the ARJ-21 on the international stage, the aircraft needs to be \"Western- ready.\" At least one year is required to make the jet marketable to operators outside of China. \"You need to have the systems in English ready to go. Operating manuals need to be in English and up to international standards; mechanics, pilots, and other personnel supporting the aircraft delivery and operations also need to be taught in English,\" he told AIN. It is imperative to have a global support system that inspires confidence.\" The challenge of producing English language manuals has also spilled over into the development of the C919, where manuals are supposed to be written in English first; however, according to the source, this plan is not widely implemented. Concerns about a lack of an aviation safety management system were also recently raised after the tail of an ARJ-21 struck the factory's hangar door. Despite the internal challenges, both aircraft serves as a testament to China's ambitions to advance its standing in the aerospace manufacturing value chain. It may be a steep climb up but its commitment is unwavering when it comes to playing the long game.

According to a source working closely with Comac who spoke with AIN on condition of anonymity, one of the long-standing impediments constraining progress is the integration of avionics components and its subsystems in the flight deck. This challenge reflects a larger concern about the company's ability to achieve effective coordination across component teams. \"The C919 is still fixing its design problems, so it's not flying a lot. They haven't really come to grips with some of the issues because everybody is working in a vacuum. They can't integrate the plane because no one is talking to each other,\" he told AIN. \"Everyone wants to act as a soloist and get all the glory, but you can't have a bunch of soloists and build an airplane.\" Concerns about avionics integration were initially raised when China began developing its first indigenously developed regional jetliner, the ARJ21. Today, engineers continue to make incremental improvements to the flight deck's design. A new layout on the regional jet now features a better- organized grouping of switches, buttons, instruments, and displays to simplify workload and increase situational awareness. Designers expect the new layout, successfully tested on the ARJ21's flight simulator, to significantly reduce the amount of pilot training required on the type. Unlike the ARJ-21, which uses commercial-off-the-shelf products in the cockpit, the C919 is working with a complete avionics system design with key components sourced from western suppliers. Aviage Systems, a 50-50 joint venture between GE Aviation and Aviation Industry Corporation of China, supplies an integrated modular avionics system, while Honeywell Aerospace supplies the aircraft's fly-by-wire system with HonFei flight controls as well as the braking system under a joint venture with Boyun Aviation Systems. Collins Aerospace, under joint ventures established with China Electronics Technology Avionics Company and AVIC, supplies the C919's communication, navigation, and integrated surveillance systems. For foreign suppliers, the cost of doing business in China means entering into a joint venture with local firms to participate in tenders for major aerospace components and systems. Indeed, since the government's launch of its industry- building \"Made in China 2025\" policy program, joint ventures with foreign firms can serve as effective vehicles for knowledge transfer and R&D capabilities. However, simply throwing more money at the C919 will not make it globally competitive. While foreign firms have contributed major components to the program, Chinese teams on the factory floor are tasked with system-wide integration. Not only does this require highly coordinated teams-a concept that Comac allegedly struggles with-it also requires a fair degree of technical know-how to bring its ambitious C919 project in line with FAA and EASA requirements. \"If they are going to sell this aircraft outside of China, they will need FAA and EASA approval, and both are difficult to get; the teams don't get this ... both the FAA and EASA said they are going to help but they're also shaking their heads. There are so many problems with integration, they don't know where to start,\" said the source. Meanwhile, the ARJ-21 is also facing its own set of issues as it moves towards market competitiveness. While production has remained relatively unchanged, with one aircraft rolling off the line once every four to six weeks, the new jets are destined for Chinese operators. If there is going to be a place for the ARJ-21 on the international stage, the aircraft needs to be \"Western- ready.\" At least one year is required to make the jet marketable to operators outside of China. \"You need to have the systems in English ready to go. Operating manuals need to be in English and up to international standards; mechanics, pilots, and other personnel supporting the aircraft delivery and operations also need to be taught in English,\" he told AIN. It is imperative to have a global support system that inspires confidence.\" The challenge of producing English language manuals has also spilled over into the development of the C919, where manuals are supposed to be written in English first; however, according to the source, this plan is not widely implemented. Concerns about a lack of an aviation safety management system were also recently raised after the tail of an ARJ-21 struck the factory's hangar door. Despite the internal challenges, both aircraft serves as a testament to China's ambitions to advance its standing in the aerospace manufacturing value chain. It may be a steep climb up but its commitment is unwavering when it comes to playing the long game.

According to a company statement, all of its prototypes will undergo more than 1,000 flight-test items over the next two years, which could potentially push its earlier target of 2020-2021 into 2022. Chinese media outlets say manufacturing will commence later this year while plans call for airworthiness certification and aircraft deliveries to China Eastern Airlines in two to three years. Comac said \"scientific research and production work\" continues to progress in an \"orderly manner.\" Coded 105 and 106, the two jets have entered final assembly at the company's Shanghai production facility. Once complete, the prototypes will join the flight-test program, bringing the total number of C919s to six. The first prototype, 101, completed its long-delayed first flight in May 2017 followed by a long-distance test flight six months later. Aircraft 102 conducted a successful two-hour first flight in December of that year and both prototypes flew again in June 2018 as part of a control-stability test and systems check. Prototype 103 completed its inaugural flight last December. Meanwhile, aircraft 104 performed a one-hour and 25-minute first flight in August before later transferring to Dongying Shengli Airport in east China's Shandong Province. All four prototypes are undergoing flight, static, and other ground verifications tests in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Shandong's Dongying. Comac took the opportunity to debut its C919 flight simulator along with a 1:15 ratio mockup of its ambitious Chinese-Russian CR929 widebody at the 18th Aviation Expo/China, held from September 18-20. The Chinese airframer confirmed that while it had drawn a conceptual design draft, program managers remained in the process of selecting and concluding agreements with system and equipment vendors. The general director of Russian CR929 partner United Aircraft Corporation, Yury Slyusar, met with Rolls-Royce and GE executives in late August at the MAKS 2019 airshow outside Moscow to talk over Western powerplant alternatives for the joint Russian-Chinese widebody project known as the Craic CR929. The CR929 chief designer from the Russian side of the program, Maxim Litvinov, told AIN at the show that a Western engine choice could come as soon as the second half of next year, when Craic expects to begin naming the various systems suppliers. A second engine alternative-to involve a Sino-Russian partnership-will take somewhat longer to define, he added. Meanwhile, Comac has moved to accelerate production to complete an additional 30 ARJ21-700 regional jets by year-end following the opening of its second assembly line for the regional jet in Shanghai. According to Comac's deputy director of marketing and sales, Yang Yang, capacity at its facility could increase to 50 to 60 aircraft a year, pending market demand. To date, Comac has delivered a total of 15 ARJ21-700s to launch customer Chengdu Airlines and newly established Genghis Khan Airlines. Last month, China's big three carriers-Air China, China Southern Airlines, and China Eastern Airlines-placed individual orders of 35 aircraft each, with deliveries scheduled from 2020 to 2040.

The landmark deals-a bilateral civil aviation safety agreement and a so-called horizontal air services agreement-are the first of their kind between the two countries. \"The main objective of the bilateral civil aviation safety agreement is to support worldwide trade in aircraft and related products,'' the European Commission said in a statement. \"This agreement will remove the unnecessary duplication of evaluation and certification activities for aeronautical products by the civil aviation authorities, and therefore reduce costs for the aviation sector.\" Regulators expect the BASA will provide a higher level of civil aviation safety and environmental compatibility. The second deal-the horizontal aviation agreement-seeks to replace existing bilateral air services agreements that have previously placed restrictions on EU carriers flying to China. Currently, EU operators may fly to China only from EU states with bilateral agreements. The new agreement will allow European operators to fly to China from each of the EU's 28 member states. \"The conclusion of a horizontal agreement will thereby bring bilateral air services agreements between China and EU member states into conformity with EU law-a renewed legal certainty which will be beneficial to airlines on both sides,\" the EC said. With the expansion in passenger and freight operations, European officials estimate that both agreements generate economic benefits of about $3.9 billion for the EU and China by 2025 and create 11,000 jobs over the period. Currently, more than 30 airlines connect the EU with China, offering a choice of 84 city pairs, 475 weekly return flights, and more than 270,000 weekly seats. Another 110 weekly round-trip freighter flights operate between the two sides. The agreements come as Comac continues to face significant challenges in meeting the certification standards required to enable the sale of its C919 and ARJ21 aircraft in markets outside of China. While the manufacturer has made some headway with the C919, evident in test flights, teams working on the project have encountered repeated setbacks varying from disruptions in avionics integrations and a shortage of local expertise to misinterpretations of regulatory requirements. As a result, Comac will need virtually no interruptions to its schedule timelines to meet its first delivery date target of 2021.

According to a company statement, all of its prototypes will undergo more than 1,000 flight-test items over the next two years, which could potentially push its earlier target of 2020-2021 into 2022. Chinese media outlets say manufacturing will commence later this year while plans call for airworthiness certification and aircraft deliveries to China Eastern Airlines in two to three years. Comac said \"scientific research and production work\" continues to progress in an \"orderly manner.\" Coded 105 and 106, the two jets have entered final assembly at the company's Shanghai production facility. Once complete, the prototypes will join the flight-test program, bringing the total number of C919s to six. The first prototype, 101, completed its long-delayed first flight in May 2017 followed by a long-distance test flight six months later. Aircraft 102 conducted a successful two-hour first flight in December of that year and both prototypes flew again in June 2018 as part of a control-stability test and systems check. Prototype 103 completed its inaugural flight last December. Meanwhile, aircraft 104 performed a one-hour and 25-minute first flight in August before later transferring to Dongying Shengli Airport in east China's Shandong Province. All four prototypes are undergoing flight, static, and other ground verifications tests in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Shandong's Dongying. Comac took the opportunity to debut its C919 flight simulator along with a 1:15 ratio mockup of its ambitious Chinese-Russian CR929 widebody at the 18th Aviation Expo/China, held from September 18-20. The Chinese airframer confirmed that while it had drawn a conceptual design draft, program managers remained in the process of selecting and concluding agreements with system and equipment vendors. The general director of Russian CR929 partner United Aircraft Corporation, Yury Slyusar, met with Rolls-Royce and GE executives in late August at the MAKS 2019 airshow outside Moscow to talk over Western powerplant alternatives for the joint Russian-Chinese widebody project known as the Craic CR929. The CR929 chief designer from the Russian side of the program, Maxim Litvinov, told AIN at the show that a Western engine choice could come as soon as the second half of next year, when Craic expects to begin naming the various systems suppliers. A second engine alternative-to involve a Sino-Russian partnership-will take somewhat longer to define, he added. Meanwhile, Comac has moved to accelerate production to complete an additional 30 ARJ21-700 regional jets by year-end following the opening of its second assembly line for the regional jet in Shanghai. According to Comac's deputy director of marketing and sales, Yang Yang, capacity at its facility could increase to 50 to 60 aircraft a year, pending market demand. To date, Comac has delivered a total of 15 ARJ21-700s to launch customer Chengdu Airlines and newly established Genghis Khan Airlines.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, which issues such licenses, declined to comment, saying it cannot discuss individual license applications. The White House also declined to comment. But in February, President Donald Trump intervened, blasting U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China's budding aviation industry. \"I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,\" Trump tweeted on Feb. 18. \"I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult.

Whether or not the delay will affect the overall schedule remains in question, however, as Clementi declined to comment on reports that Comac hopes to finish Chinese certification by the end of this year.

That doesn't mean the program doesn't carry some unknowns, however. Asked about the duration of the testing, Clementi referenced the ARJ21's eight-day campaign but could not pinpoint the expected length of the C919's icing trials. \"It depends on the number of encounters that you have and the quality of the icing that you encounter,\" said Clementi. \"You basically have to demonstrate a sufficient number of encounters with sufficient ice accretion on critical areas within the appendix C envelope of FAR 25.\" That regulation essentially defines the combination of liquid water content and mean droplet diameter, he explained. \"So you will have a number of icing encounters and you'll see where you are within the envelope,\" noted Clementi. \"And so if you've got a bunch of encounters which have got low liquid water content and small droplet diameters, you'll be looking for something bigger. You want to populate as much of the envelope as possible. You obviously can't do it all because it depends on the weather.\" Each day of testing, a meteorologist advises the flight team of the forecast and recommends where the airplane should fly to encounter icing. \"It's completely counterintuitive-you'll be in the air talking to Toronto center and asking them to give you vectors toward an area of icing,\" said Clementi. \"So it's interesting work and a potentially hazardous flight test.\" Along with the pilot in command, an ITPS pilot likely will serve as a communications facilitator, working the radio and talking with air traffic control.

The team measures the anti-icing system's effectiveness on thermally protected surfaces, which include the leading edge of airfoils. For unprotected surfaces such as the airplane's belly, the crew must gauge the airplane's flying characteristics during a holding pattern, typically for 45 minutes.

And that comes as no surprise to Tobias Grosche, a professor at the University of Worms and an expert in flight planning and passenger demand forecasts. \"The fact that the first 'COMAC' aircraft is about to receive national approval is only the logical step in the efforts of the Chinese government, also in the aviation sector, towards the wester to unlock countries, \" Grosche told the Business Insider in a special report. COMAC is the abbreviation for an amalgamation of Chinese companies that is likely to be viewed critically in Hamburg, Toulouse and Seattle. It stands for Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and brings together design and research centers, universities, and aluminum and steel manufacturers. The C919 will offer space for 158 to 168 passengers, depending on how many business class and how many economy class seats the airlines want to install. For comparison: the Airbus A320 flies for Lufthansa with space for up to 168 passengers, the Boeing 737 has space for around 150 passengers, i.e. similar sizes. The two types of aircraft are also similar in terms of range, the report said. Depending on the version, the Airbus A320 can travel up to 5,700 kilometers, the Chinese counterpart C919 promises a range of up to 5,555 kilometers. This means that the Chinese aircraft could, for example, reach all national destinations from Shanghai in eastern China - and get even further. Beijing has made no secret of its desire to break the western giants' duopoly, helping smooth the C919's development with up to US$72 billion in state- related support, according to estimates from US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies. According to Simple Flying, the Shanghai Aircraft Airworthiness Certification Center of CAAC signed and issued the first Type Inspection Authorization for the C919 program. This means that the plane has officially entered into \"authority certification\" flight testing. However, natural icing trials, which were set to take place in March 2021, have had to be postponed until fall. While the aircraft is expected to be approved and will start scheduled service with OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of the largest airline in Asia, China Eastern Airlines, it is doubtful that this first-generation C919 will challenge the world's aircraft manufacturers, Business Insider reported. Not yet, anyway. Says Grosche: \"A second or third generation could be dangerous for Airbus and Boeing. \"Ultimately, it's an economic question. If a Chinese model is efficient and safe, I see no reason why western airlines should not also operate these aircraft.\" After all, Lufthansa, for example, not only has Airbus and Boeing aircraft in its fleet, but also models from its subsidiary Cityline the former Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and the Brazilian Embraer. Furthermore, Grosche is certain that COMAC will one day be able to offer the C919 for sale at comparatively cheap prices. Even Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, has acknowledged COMAC's rise, telling an industry event \"we will probably go from a duopoly to a triopoly, at least on the single aisle, by the end of the decade.\" Overall, a total of 815 orders have been placed by 28 customers. China Eastern's Big Three counterparts - China Southern and Air China will also deploy the C919, along with other powerhouses such as Joy Air and Hainan Airlines. There has also been some international interest. The head of the low-cost airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, announced ten years ago that he wanted to support alternatives to Boeing and Airbus and signed a non-binding letter of intent with COMAC, the report said. And while Boeing and Airbus have the advantage of having been on the road around the world for decades, China, which historically plays the long game, is looking much further into the future. The type CR929 is supposed to compete with long-haul airliners like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787. And the type CR929-600 could have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers and space for up to 280 passengers. What are Boeing and and Airbus up against? The C919 will be state-of-the-art, both inside and out, along with some refreshing updates. While the major elements of the airplane such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC, the company has enlisted Western expertise, notably that of French high-tech industrial group and aero-engine manufacturer Safran, which is producing the aircraft's cabin and nacelles, CNN Travel reported. The C919's LEAP-1C engines are being produced by CFM, a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran. Subsidiary Safran Cabin says it will supply the lavatories, galleys and cockpit doors for the C919. The company told CNN that \"the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft.\" That will be welcome news for passengers forced to do contortions in modern airplane toilet compartments. More spacious lavatories would mean it would be possible to move around with less contact with surfaces, and it could also make cleaning and maintenance a less onerous task for the crew that scramble on board between flights to disinfect the toilets - a boon in the Covid era. The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized galley with ample space for the flight crew to work. Safran says it \"recognizes that many of its airline partners based in China will fly these aircraft on short routes within China, which makes meal service a challenge.\" To address the compressed flight times on domestic routes, Safran says its cabin designers have come up with an \"ergonomic galley design, with large work surfaces, equipped with easy-to-maneuver \"Hybrite S trolleys,\" which help the crew get meals, snacks and drinks out to passengers quickly. Spacious galleys are also likely to be a selling point worldwide as airlines work towards complying with new inflight catering guidelines set out by the Airline Catering Association. As for environmental concerns, Safran says it \"has made advancements in its composite structures which enable interiors to be both lightweight and durable, helping to reduce carbon footprint while withstanding the rigors of short-haul service.\" The aircraft's engines are also claimed to be more efficient. The CFM LEAP-1C engine, which was selected by COMAC as the sole Western engine option for the C919, offers \"a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines, and up to a 50% margin on NOx emissions,\" says Safran. The engines will also mitigate noise in and around the airports where the C919 operates.

COMAC said the domestically manufactured C919 model is on the fast track to receiving airworthiness certification before its commercial debut. The C919 production certification board, which is responsible for granting the production and type certificates to the aircraft model, held a meeting on Sept 10 in Shanghai and reviewed COMAC's reports on batch producing the jet. During the meeting, the board members visited the production line of the C919 and learnt more details about composite materials applied in the aircraft, the East China Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China said on its official WeChat account. \"Entering the final assembly stage stands as an important milestone for an aircraft before its delivery. This indicates that home-built large-scale passenger jet is about to officially enter the commercial market,\" said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and a columnist at Carnoc, one of the largest civil aviation websites in China. COMAC started manufacturing the first C919 aircraft in late 2019, and now the manufacturing work has achieved phased progress. Since its maiden test flight conducted in May 2017, six C919 prototypes have been undergoing a series of rigorous tests. In March, the launch customer China Eastern inked a deal with COMAC for the purchase of five C919 planes, which is also the first official order that COMAC received globally. So far, 815 intended and confirmed orders have been placed for the C919 from home and abroad. The manufacture of the C919 will involve the Chinese aviation industry in the world's aircraft supply chain system. Its competitors include aircraft models such as the single-aisle B737 of Boeing Co and the A320 of Airbus. Meanwhile, Boeing has further raised its forecast for aircraft demand in China. Over the next 20 years, Chinese carriers are expected to buy 8,700 new airplanes, the US aircraft manufacturer said in its latest Commercial Market Outlook released on Tuesday. \"According to the new forecast by Boeing, the market potential for commercial aircraft is huge. Currently, Boeing and Airbus form a duopoly in the trunk airliner market. The upcoming delivery of the C919 indicates that COMAC will provide new transportation solutions and more choices for airlines in the global market,\" Lin said. China's domestic air travel market is steadily picking up, with the COVID-19 pandemic brought under better control by and large across the country, sporadic outbreaks notwithstanding.

Naysayers have spent almost a decade writing off the chances of the country's first-ever full-narrowbody-class commercial aircraft, but as 2022 dawns-and despite the disappointment of China Eastern Airlines over delays to the first-ever delivery of the aircraft, expected before the end of 2021-the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China appears on the verge of making the C919 a reality later this year. Still, progress remains slow, and deliveries of the aircraft, which has yet to receive certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, appear likely to start no sooner than late in 2022. Playing a long game, though, has become a strong suit of the People's Republic of China. As the seminal Rand Corporation 2014 report, \"The Effectiveness of China's Industrial Policies in Commercial Aviation Manufacturing,\" conveyed, China has adopted a three-stage approach to the development of commercial aircraft designed to disrupt the global Airbus- Boeing duopoly. \"To achieve the goal of creating a globally competitive commercial aviation manufacturing industry, the Chinese government has adopted a strategy of first engaging in domestic production and assembly using foreign designs, then developing its own designs with foreign assistance, culminating in completely independent local development of a commercial aircraft without foreign assistance,\" it said. At face value, it would seem that the PRC by now has progressed to a point somewhere between Phases One and Two. Comac came into existence in 2008, after its spinoff from AVIC, and production of the C919 prototype began in 2011. It completed the assembly of the first prototype in 2015, and the first flight took place in 2017. Several international concerns have entered into joint ventures on the ground in China to develop elements of the C919 program, including GE and Safran, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Liebherr Aerospace. In 2015, the Department of Justice indicted a number of Chinese officials on charges of stealing engine technology from a number of U.S.-based and European OEMs. The PRC is advancing its domestic aviation industry through two major state- owned aircraft corporations, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, which primarily concentrates on defense, and Comac, said a report titled \"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2021,\" published by the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense. \"The PRC's aviation industry is unable to produce reliable high-performance aircraft engines and relies on Western and Russian engines, such as the Franco-American CFM Leap 1C that powers the Comac C919 and the Russian D-30 that powers the Y-20 and H-6K and H6-N variants,\" the report said. \"The PRC is developing the CJ-1000, AEF3500, and WS-20 high-bypass turbofan engines to power the C919, CR929, and Y-20, respectively.\" The amount of time and money China has proved willing to invest in the project reflects its determination to press ahead. Last July, the Financial Times said Beijing had spent up to $72 billion in state-related support for the C919's development, citing estimates from U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. The bulk of just over 1,000 orders-300 firm, plus 700 commitments-for the C919 today came almost exclusively from Chinese airlines and lessors. In 2010, over a decade before it completed its merger with AerCap last year, GE Capital Aviation Services announced orders for 10, apparently making it the Western actor to make good on its interest in the C919. In 2015 Thailand's City Airways signed a preliminary agreement with ICBC Leasing to take 10 of the narrowbodies, but the airline went out of business the following year. In one of the last acts of the Trump administration in January 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense, in a list that included Comac, released the names of additional \"Communist Chinese military companies\" operating directly or indirectly in the United States, forcing U.S. suppliers to halt dealings with them. \"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People's Republic of China's Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities,\" it said. However, the Biden administration has since appended a note to the announcement saying that as of June 3, 2021, the Secretary of Defense had removed the entities listed there from the CCMC list. The same month, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a unit of the U.S. Treasury Department, published a new list prohibiting investment in Chinese defense and surveillance technology firms, including more than a dozen aviation and aerospace companies, as well as telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei, the South China Morning Post said in December. While Comac's name was not on the list, the implication was that the administration would continue to watch the company closely. Whether or not the C919 will be technologically current when it finally enters service, one thing is sure: if China sets its mind to putting the plane in the air, then it will make that happen.

In one of the last acts of the Trump administration in January 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense, in a list that included Comac, released the names of additional \"Communist Chinese military companies\" operating directly or indirectly in the United States, forcing U.S. suppliers to halt dealings with them. \"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People's Republic of China's Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities,\" it said. However, the Biden administration has since appended a note to the announcement saying that as of June 3, 2021, the Secretary of Defense had removed the entities listed there from the CCMC list.

Naysayers have spent almost a decade writing off the chances of the country's first-ever full-narrowbody-class commercial aircraft, but as 2022 dawns-and despite the disappointment of China Eastern Airlines over delays to the first-ever delivery of the aircraft, expected before the end of 2021-the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China appears on the verge of making the C919 a reality later this year. Still, progress remains slow, and deliveries of the aircraft, which has yet to receive certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, appear likely to start no sooner than late in 2022. Playing a long game, though, has become a strong suit of the People's Republic of China. As the seminal Rand Corporation 2014 report, \"The Effectiveness of China's Industrial Policies in Commercial Aviation Manufacturing,\" conveyed, China has adopted a three-stage approach to the development of commercial aircraft designed to disrupt the global Airbus- Boeing duopoly. \"To achieve the goal of creating a globally competitive commercial aviation manufacturing industry, the Chinese government has adopted a strategy of first engaging in domestic production and assembly using foreign designs, then developing its own designs with foreign assistance, culminating in completely independent local development of a commercial aircraft without foreign assistance,\" it said. At face value, it would seem that the PRC by now has progressed to a point somewhere between Phases One and Two. Comac came into existence in 2008, after its spinoff from AVIC, and production of the C919 prototype began in 2011. It completed the assembly of the first prototype in 2015, and the first flight took place in 2017. Several international concerns have entered into joint ventures on the ground in China to develop elements of the C919 program, including GE and Safran, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Liebherr Aerospace. In 2015, the Department of Justice indicted a number of Chinese officials on charges of stealing engine technology from a number of U.S.-based and European OEMs. The PRC is advancing its domestic aviation industry through two major state- owned aircraft corporations, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, which primarily concentrates on defense, and Comac, said a report titled \"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2021,\" published by the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense. \"The PRC's aviation industry is unable to produce reliable high-performance aircraft engines and relies on Western and Russian engines, such as the Franco-American CFM Leap 1C that powers the Comac C919 and the Russian D-30 that powers the Y-20 and H-6K and H6-N variants,\" the report said. \"The PRC is developing the CJ-1000, AEF3500, and WS-20 high-bypass turbofan engines to power the C919, CR929, and Y-20, respectively.\" The amount of time and money China has proved willing to invest in the project reflects its determination to press ahead. Last July, the Financial Times said Beijing had spent up to $72 billion in state-related support for the C919's development, citing estimates from U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. The bulk of just over 1,000 orders-300 firm, plus 700 commitments-for the C919 today came almost exclusively from Chinese airlines and lessors. In 2010, over a decade before it completed its merger with AerCap last year, GE Capital Aviation Services announced orders for 10, apparently making it the Western actor to make good on its interest in the C919. In 2015 Thailand's City Airways signed a preliminary agreement with ICBC Leasing to take 10 of the narrowbodies, but the airline went out of business the following year.

There are three certificates required for the delivery of an aircraft in China. One is a type certificate, which indicates that the model design of the aircraft meets requirements; the second is a production certification, which indicates that the manufacturing of the aircraft meets national standards; the third is an individual aircraft certificate, indicating that each plane delivered to airlines complies with requirements, according to market watchers. These are all given by the CAAC. The announcement confirms that COMAC has submitted the test results to CAAC and is waiting for approval of a CAAC type certificate, according to Lin Zhijie, an independent market watcher. After COMAC gets the type certificate, the C919 plane is likely to receive the other two certificates in a short time, Lin said on Monday. Market watchers said that obtaining the three certificates means that the plane is certified to fly, a prerequisite for entering commercial flight. Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times in an earlier interview that after obtaining the airworthiness certificate, COMAC is expected to conduct demonstration flights on commercial routes and provide technical training for pilots and relevant personnel, which may take six to 12 months. \"Ideally, the C919 is expected to be put into commercial operation in 2023 if everything goes smoothly,\" Wang said.

Airbus told the Global Times earlier that China is the largest single-country market for Airbus' commercial aircraft. Deliveries to the Chinese market last year represented over 20 percent of Airbus' total deliveries worldwide.

The Chinese-built aircraft, which is designed to challenge the dual monopoly by Airbus and Boeing, has completed all flight test missions with the test aircraft. COMAC explained on its official accounts on social media that the six experimental aircrafts completed the testing tasks of the program, entering the final stage to obtain certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to start working on a commercial scale, a milestone in China's ambitions to climb the manufacturing supply chain. The C919 program is known to be designed to directly compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo, both narrow-body commercial planes, Chinese program faced a series of technical problems and tighter US export restrictions after it was introduced in 2008. China Eastern receives the first batch of COMAC C919s this month: The Changjiang Daily newspaper, owned by the local government in Wuhan, said in a report published on July 8 that China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to receive the first batch of C919 aircraft this month. The state-owned airlines company placed an order for five COMAC C919s in March last year. The narrow-body aircraft is assembled in China and relies heavily on Western components including engines and avionics. Since the beginning of July 2022, the three largest state-owned airlines in China have concluded the largest order for airlines in the country since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, by announcing the purchase of about 300 Airbus aircraft. Air China and China Southern Airlines, in separate disclosures filed to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, announced that they would each buy 96 A320neo aircrafts worth of $12.2 billion at list prices. China Eastern Airlines also stated that it will buy 100 aircraft of the same type, worth of $12.8 billion. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2023 and continue until 2027, with the bulk delivered in 2024. The aviation sector in China has recorded a recovery in recent months, from the blow it suffered after the authorities closed the huge city of Shanghai last April due to the new wave of the pandemic. artnership with Russia: China has worked for years to produce efficient aircraft engines, however, the most reliable estimates of the country's main scientific research institution, indicate that China is still stumbling in achieving its goal, and that its reliance on Russian systems has not achieved its promises. In 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to expand their technological cooperation, the two leaders stressed that China-Russia relations have entered a new era of comprehensive and strategic partnership, through a number of initiatives to establish research centers and promote academic exchange. Certainly, one of the most prominent aspects of cooperation between the two countries revolved around the development of a wide-body passenger aircraft, the success of which was likely to lead to qualitative changes in the international aviation industry, with the emergence of a real and serious competitor to Boeing and Airbus. However, the two countries found that the plane would need to rely on foreign suppliers for its engine, because neither Russia nor China was able to build this engine. Long term vs. short term: With Russia's War in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies, the Russian-Chinese attempt to build a giant passenger plane has often failed or will be delayed for years to see the light. This deals a painful blow to the idea of China's autonomy in one of the most prominent technical fields - aviation. Despite this, China cannot be knocked out of international competition in this field in the long run. Once the COMAC C919 enters service, although it cannot compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo in international markets, it is an essential part of Beijing's plans to increase the country's advanced manufacturing in the next five years, all major Chinese government-owned airlines will fly. Although the C919 will not change international scales in the aviation industry soon, the joint coordination between the United States and Europe in the aviation industry reveals concern that COMAC may break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in the aviation industry in the long term. Especially as the past two decades have proven China's ability to join many Western high-tech industries such as automobiles, trains and digital technology. In the middle of last year, the United States and the European Union agreed to end their 17-year trade dispute over aircrafts, and the two sides agreed to stop providing development incentives, which could harm the other side. The background of this agreement is the desire of the two sides to present a united front against China, because the agreement calls for joint action against third-party anti-market practices, which includes China calling on foreign investors to benefit from its low-cost aviation technology that harms Boeing and Airbus. But there are those who believe there is a lot of exaggeration about the strength of the Chinese aviation industry, that this industry still depends in essence on Western technologies, and that the US and the EU can eliminate the Chinese aviation industry, but they do not want to, at least for the time being, because doing so means colliding with China. Both Boeing and Airbus salivate for Chinese markets, as the demand for aviation in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to expand at twice the rate in the West, therefore, American and European companies have a lot to lose from direct confrontation with China. This is especially so now, as the US and Europe are concentrating their efforts to break the Russian economy. This is evident from the fact that the US Department of Defense has blacklisted Chinese COMAC partners for its military activities. But they have completely avoided dealing a blow to China's commercial aviation industry, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have dealt a severe blow to China's aircraft ambitions and its proud COMAC C919 aircraft which is essentially a Western plane. The role of the Chinese company is actually limited to assembling the plane's fuselage and wings, which is a minor role representing only 25 percent of the costs. The avionics used are manufactured by American companies such as Honeywell, Collins Aerospace, and other European companies, and the aircraft's engine, which is the most difficult part, is the product of a joint venture between the American General Electric and the French company Safran, which manufactures aviation and missile engines. Moreover, China's commercial aviation industry may need more time to compete with its Western counterparts Boeing and Airbus. The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX, has more fuel consumption, has less range, and has no international support network. Make it marketable outside of China. However, the weaknesses in the Chinese plane do not negate the fact that Beijing is trying to pressure Boeing and Airbus indirectly. China's orders for planes from Boeing and Airbus is very low, compared to the number it will need in the coming years. This means that it sends a message to the US and the EU, that it will rely on its domestic production even if it is more expensive. Some experts point out that it is only a matter of time until competition intensifies between Boeing and Airbus on the one hand and COMAC on the other hand in the field of civil aviation, even if it is US and European sanctions against Russia have hindered China from accelerating the development of its aviation industry.", "url": "https://aviationsourcenews.com/analysis/will-the-comac-c919-break-the-boeing-airbus-duopoly/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "COMAC completes first test flight of first home-made C919 aircraft to be delivered", "date": "2022-05-14", "content": "The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China on Saturday morning completed the first test flight of the first domestically produced C919 aircraft that is set to be delivered.

This is evident from the fact that the US Department of Defense has blacklisted Chinese COMAC partners for its military activities.

The role of the Chinese company is actually limited to assembling the plane's fuselage and wings, which is a minor role representing only 25 percent of the costs. The avionics used are manufactured by American companies such as Honeywell, Collins Aerospace, and other European companies, and the aircraft's engine, which is the most difficult part, is the product of a joint venture between the American General Electric and the French company Safran, which manufactures aviation and missile engines.

The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX, has more fuel consumption, has less range, and has no international support network. Make it marketable outside of China. However, the weaknesses in the Chinese plane do not negate the fact that Beijing is trying to pressure Boeing and Airbus indirectly. China's orders for planes from Boeing and Airbus is very low, compared to the number it will need in the coming years.

The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service, and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. It is hoped that the first aircraft will be delivered to launch customer China Eastern Airline this year. It was hoped that the certification would go ahead on September 19th, but it seems China's own quarantine policies interfered with this plan. President Xi Jinping wanted to attend the C919 certification ceremony, but due to a visit to Uzbekistan on September 14 - 16th, would have needed to quarantine for ten days on his return before the event could go ahead. Hopes for the COMAC C919: The airplane is China's hopes of breaking the Airbus - Boeing duopoly, and the nation has high hopes for sales to pick up to the global market. However, to date, mainly Chinese buyers have firmed up orders for the type, with major investors including Hainan Airlines, China Construction Bank and Air China. However, GECAS has ordered 10 with 10 further options, which could, theoretically, end up anywhere. Nevertheless, it is a momentous occasion for Chinese aviation, and has been a long time in the making. Originally started as a project in 2008, COMAC targeted a maiden flight of the type in 2014. Production of the first prototype began in 2011, with annual production targeted to reach 150 aircraft by 2020. But huge budgetary overruns and teething troubles with the technical side of airplane production saw the timeline slip further and further into the future. Eventually, a completed prototype began high-speed taxi tests in 2017, with the first aircraft taking to the skies in May 2017. In December that year, a second prototype took flight, but things were moving very slowly. Prototypes three, four, and five had all begun flying by October 2019, and the very last of the test campaign aircraft, prototype six, took flight in December that year. Since then, the test aircraft have been put through their paces, testing for everything from extreme weather conditions to avionics and electrical system conformity. The first pre-delivery flight took place in May this year, with aircraft B-001J completing a three-hour flight. The aircraft bears the livery of Chinese airline OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of China Eastern, and should arrive with the airline later this year. However, it may well be the only C919 to be delivered to a customer in 2022. Some challenges to overcome: When the C919 was first floated, some airlines in the west showed interest. Indeed, European low-cost giant Ryanair had agreed to cooperate on the development of the aircraft, including the signing of an MoU for a 200-seat variant. While Michael O'Leary has expressed ongoing support for the plane in recent years, it might look less attractive now. The issue is that, after its first pre-delivery flight, the list sales price of the C919 was revealed to be 653 million yuan, which is getting very close to the list prices of Boeing and Airbus alternatives. It's around double the initially projected purchase price of $50 million. As well as the higher purchase price, there is the issue of operational challenges to consider. The availability of spare parts, technical support and qualified pilots to fly the plane is going to be hugely challenging outside of China for many years to come.

The C919 features seating for up to 168 passengers and has a range of 2,200 nautical miles, placing it in direct competition with two of the world's most delivered passengers jets, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. COMAC's original planned first delivery and entry into service timing for the C919 was 2016, although technical difficulties delayed the program's commercial service launch multiple times since then. The majority of the C919 program's key components, such as the engines and avionics systems, are supplied by western companies such as Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace - which all have joint ventures and partnerships with Chinese companies supplying COMAC. The corporation requires foreign suppliers to manufacture parts made for the C919 in China. An update on the certification published by CGTN, a Chinese state media publication, notes that the first delivery of China's first domestically produced jet could occur by the end of the year to launch customer China Eastern Airlines.

Preparations for the test flight and delivery of the C919 large aircraft are progressing in an orderly manner, the company said. The plane is to be delivered to China Eastern Airlines. Wu Yongliang, vice general manager of COMAC, said earlier this year that the plane was to be delivered to the customer in 2022. The C919, China's first self-developed trunk jetliner, has 158-168 seats and a range of 4,075-5,555 km. The plane conducted a successful maiden flight in 2017.

The producer made the announcement on its official WeChat account, which also contained an image of the plane and Chinese characters that read \"congratulating C919 for completing all test flights before obtaining a certificate.\" On July 23, COMAC said that its C919 jet was nearing certification as its test planes had completed all required trial flights. There are three certificates required for the delivery of an aircraft in China. One is a type certificate, which indicates that the model design of the aircraft meets requirements; the second is a production certification, which indicates that the manufacturing of the aircraft meets national standards; the third is an individual aircraft certificate, indicating that each plane delivered to airlines complies with requirements, according to market watchers. These are all given by the CAAC. The announcement confirms that COMAC has submitted the test results to CAAC and is waiting for approval of a CAAC type certificate, according to Lin Zhijie, an independent market watcher. After COMAC gets the type certificate, the C919 plane is likely to receive the other two certificates in a short time, Lin said on Monday. Market watchers said that obtaining the three certificates means that the plane is certified to fly, a prerequisite for entering commercial flight. Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times in an earlier interview that after obtaining the airworthiness certificate, COMAC is expected to conduct demonstration flights on commercial routes and provide technical training for pilots and relevant personnel, which may take six to 12 months. \"Ideally, the C919 is expected to be put into commercial operation in 2023 if everything goes smoothly,\" Wang said. Since it was first approved in 2006, the C919 is widely believed to aim to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in certain segment of the massive civil aviation industry. However, market watchers said that it's too early to say if a new plane can challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. \"Our current job is to build the plane, and make it fly safely and reliably,\" Lin said, adding it will take about 20 years to see if the plane can compete with Airbus and Boeing. Market observers said that there are two advantages for C919 - one is price, and the second is after-sale services. The aircraft's price tag will be lower than that of comparable Boeing and Airbus aircraft, and it will be exempt from import duties. Also, the whole production and service teams will be based within China, which will provide convenience to Chinese airlines. The C919, China's first self-developed trunk jetliner, is fitted with 158-168 seats with a range of 4,075-5,555 kilometers. The plane conducted a successful maiden flight in 2017.

To date, COMAC has received 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers worldwide. Boeing and China have an enduring partnership of more than 45 years. More than 50 percent of all commercial jets operating in China now are Boeing aircraft, and more than 10,000 Boeing aircraft currently fly around the world using Chinese-made components and assemblies, according to the official website of Boeing. Airbus told the Global Times earlier that China is the largest single-country market for Airbus' commercial aircraft. Deliveries to the Chinese market last year represented over 20 percent of Airbus' total deliveries worldwide.

The Chinese-built aircraft, which is designed to challenge the dual monopoly by Airbus and Boeing, has completed all flight test missions with the test aircraft. COMAC explained on its official accounts on social media that the six experimental aircrafts completed the testing tasks of the program, entering the final stage to obtain certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to start working on a commercial scale, a milestone in China's ambitions to climb the manufacturing supply chain. The C919 program is known to be designed to directly compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo, both narrow-body commercial planes, Chinese program faced a series of technical problems and tighter US export restrictions after it was introduced in 2008. China Eastern receives the first batch of COMAC C919s this month: The Changjiang Daily newspaper, owned by the local government in Wuhan, said in a report published on July 8 that China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to receive the first batch of C919 aircraft this month. The state-owned airlines company placed an order for five COMAC C919s in March last year. The narrow-body aircraft is assembled in China and relies heavily on Western components including engines and avionics. Since the beginning of July 2022, the three largest state-owned airlines in China have concluded the largest order for airlines in the country since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, by announcing the purchase of about 300 Airbus aircraft. Air China and China Southern Airlines, in separate disclosures filed to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, announced that they would each buy 96 A320neo aircrafts worth of $12.2 billion at list prices. China Eastern Airlines also stated that it will buy 100 aircraft of the same type, worth of $12.8 billion. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2023 and continue until 2027, with the bulk delivered in 2024. The aviation sector in China has recorded a recovery in recent months, from the blow it suffered after the authorities closed the huge city of Shanghai last April due to the new wave of the pandemic. artnership with Russia: China has worked for years to produce efficient aircraft engines, however, the most reliable estimates of the country's main scientific research institution, indicate that China is still stumbling in achieving its goal, and that its reliance on Russian systems has not achieved its promises. In 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to expand their technological cooperation, the two leaders stressed that China-Russia relations have entered a new era of comprehensive and strategic partnership, through a number of initiatives to establish research centers and promote academic exchange. Certainly, one of the most prominent aspects of cooperation between the two countries revolved around the development of a wide-body passenger aircraft, the success of which was likely to lead to qualitative changes in the international aviation industry, with the emergence of a real and serious competitor to Boeing and Airbus. However, the two countries found that the plane would need to rely on foreign suppliers for its engine, because neither Russia nor China was able to build this engine. Long term vs. short term: With Russia's War in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies, the Russian-Chinese attempt to build a giant passenger plane has often failed or will be delayed for years to see the light. This deals a painful blow to the idea of China's autonomy in one of the most prominent technical fields - aviation. Despite this, China cannot be knocked out of international competition in this field in the long run. Once the COMAC C919 enters service, although it cannot compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo in international markets, it is an essential part of Beijing's plans to increase the country's advanced manufacturing in the next five years, all major Chinese government-owned airlines will fly. Although the C919 will not change international scales in the aviation industry soon, the joint coordination between the United States and Europe in the aviation industry reveals concern that COMAC may break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in the aviation industry in the long term. Especially as the past two decades have proven China's ability to join many Western high-tech industries such as automobiles, trains and digital technology. In the middle of last year, the United States and the European Union agreed to end their 17-year trade dispute over aircrafts, and the two sides agreed to stop providing development incentives, which could harm the other side. The background of this agreement is the desire of the two sides to present a united front against China, because the agreement calls for joint action against third-party anti-market practices, which includes China calling on foreign investors to benefit from its low-cost aviation technology that harms Boeing and Airbus. But there are those who believe there is a lot of exaggeration about the strength of the Chinese aviation industry, that this industry still depends in essence on Western technologies, and that the US and the EU can eliminate the Chinese aviation industry, but they do not want to, at least for the time being, because doing so means colliding with China. Both Boeing and Airbus salivate for Chinese markets, as the demand for aviation in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to expand at twice the rate in the West, therefore, American and European companies have a lot to lose from direct confrontation with China. This is especially so now, as the US and Europe are concentrating their efforts to break the Russian economy.

The C919 features seating for up to 168 passengers and has a range of 2,200 nautical miles, placing it in direct competition with two of the world's most delivered passengers jets, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. COMAC's original planned first delivery and entry into service timing for the C919 was 2016, although technical difficulties delayed the program's commercial service launch multiple times since then. The majority of the C919 program's key components, such as the engines and avionics systems, are supplied by western companies such as Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace - which all have joint ventures and partnerships with Chinese companies supplying COMAC. The corporation requires foreign suppliers to manufacture parts made for the C919 in China. An update on the certification published by CGTN, a Chinese state media publication, notes that the first delivery of China's first domestically produced jet could occur by the end of the year to launch customer China Eastern Airlines. According to CGTN, 28 different airlines have ordered a combined 800 C919 aircraft from COMAC.

The C919 can also be configured to carry as many as 180 passengers in a single-class densely packed cabin, which airlines might find appealing on high-capacity routes. History of China Eastern and COMAC: Both based in Shanghai, China Eastern, became the launch customer of COMAC's C919 aircraft. In March 2021, China Eastern and COMAC together, witnessed by high- ranking officials from the Shanghai government and senior management from both companies, signed a purchase agreement for five C919 aircraft in Shanghai. The first C919 for China Eastern took its maiden flight in Shanghai on May 14th this year. After finishing the production flight test, it stays in the COMAC manufacturing center located near the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. As a public company, China Eastern released its first-half-year report on August 31st, saying it plans to receive one C919 from the Chinese civil aircraft OEM during the second half of 2022. However, in China Eastern's annual report of 2021, released at the end of March this year, China Eastern said it would receive three C919s in 2022 and another two in 2023. COMAC finally got C919's type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th. The C919 development team was received by China's top leader the next day for glory, the day before China's National Day. The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony at Beijing Capital International Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market. The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. Although now the C919 has received the type certificate, however before COMAC can deliver it to any airline customer. Also, the aircraft needs to receive an AC also issued by CAAC as well before it can enter into service. Therefore, delivering the first 919 before the end of the year will require close cooperation between COMAC and China Eastern. According to COMAC, the C919 program has 815 orders from 28 different customers. And part of these orders will be transferred to firm orders after the C919 receives the type certificate from CAAC. According to the private share offering plan of 2022 released by China Eastern in May, the listed price of C919 is $99 million.

The producer made the announcement on its official WeChat account, which also contained an image of the plane and Chinese characters that read \"congratulating C919 for completing all test flights before obtaining a certificate.\" On July 23, COMAC said that its C919 jet was nearing certification as its test planes had completed all required trial flights. There are three certificates required for the delivery of an aircraft in China. One is a type certificate, which indicates that the model design of the aircraft meets requirements; the second is a production certification, which indicates that the manufacturing of the aircraft meets national standards; the third is an individual aircraft certificate, indicating that each plane delivered to airlines complies with requirements, according to market watchers. These are all given by the CAAC. The announcement confirms that COMAC has submitted the test results to CAAC and is waiting for approval of a CAAC type certificate, according to Lin Zhijie, an independent market watcher. After COMAC gets the type certificate, the C919 plane is likely to receive the other two certificates in a short time, Lin said on Monday. Market watchers said that obtaining the three certificates means that the plane is certified to fly, a prerequisite for entering commercial flight. Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times in an earlier interview that after obtaining the airworthiness certificate, COMAC is expected to conduct demonstration flights on commercial routes and provide technical training for pilots and relevant personnel, which may take six to 12 months. \"Ideally, the C919 is expected to be put into commercial operation in 2023 if everything goes smoothly,\" Wang said. Since it was first approved in 2006, the C919 is widely believed to aim to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in certain segment of the massive civil aviation industry. However, market watchers said that it's too early to say if a new plane can challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. \"Our current job is to build the plane, and make it fly safely and reliably,\" Lin said, adding it will take about 20 years to see if the plane can compete with Airbus and Boeing. Market observers said that there are two advantages for C919 - one is price, and the second is after-sale services. The aircraft's price tag will be lower than that of comparable Boeing and Airbus aircraft, and it will be exempt from import duties. Also, the whole production and service teams will be based within China, which will provide convenience to Chinese airlines. The C919, China's first self-developed trunk jetliner, is fitted with 158-168 seats with a range of 4,075-5,555 kilometers. The plane conducted a successful maiden flight in 2017. In March 2021, COMAC signed a contract with China Eastern Airlines for five planes. The new planes will be used on routes between Shanghai and Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu, according to the airline. To date, COMAC has received 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers worldwide. Boeing and China have an enduring partnership of more than 45 years. More than 50 percent of all commercial jets operating in China now are Boeing aircraft, and more than 10,000 Boeing aircraft currently fly around the world using Chinese-made components and assemblies, according to the official website of Boeing. Airbus told the Global Times earlier that China is the largest single-country market for Airbus' commercial aircraft. Deliveries to the Chinese market last year represented over 20 percent of Airbus' total deliveries worldwide.

The Chinese-built aircraft, which is designed to challenge the dual monopoly by Airbus and Boeing, has completed all flight test missions with the test aircraft. COMAC explained on its official accounts on social media that the six experimental aircrafts completed the testing tasks of the program, entering the final stage to obtain certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to start working on a commercial scale, a milestone in China's ambitions to climb the manufacturing supply chain. The C919 program is known to be designed to directly compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo, both narrow-body commercial planes, Chinese program faced a series of technical problems and tighter US export restrictions after it was introduced in 2008. China Eastern receives the first batch of COMAC C919s this month: The Changjiang Daily newspaper, owned by the local government in Wuhan, said in a report published on July 8 that China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to receive the first batch of C919 aircraft this month. The state-owned airlines company placed an order for five COMAC C919s in March last year. The narrow-body aircraft is assembled in China and relies heavily on Western components including engines and avionics. Since the beginning of July 2022, the three largest state-owned airlines in China have concluded the largest order for airlines in the country since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, by announcing the purchase of about 300 Airbus aircraft. Air China and China Southern Airlines, in separate disclosures filed to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, announced that they would each buy 96 A320neo aircrafts worth of $12.2 billion at list prices. China Eastern Airlines also stated that it will buy 100 aircraft of the same type, worth of $12.8 billion. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2023 and continue until 2027, with the bulk delivered in 2024. The aviation sector in China has recorded a recovery in recent months, from the blow it suffered after the authorities closed the huge city of Shanghai last April due to the new wave of the pandemic. artnership with Russia: China has worked for years to produce efficient aircraft engines, however, the most reliable estimates of the country's main scientific research institution, indicate that China is still stumbling in achieving its goal, and that its reliance on Russian systems has not achieved its promises. In 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to expand their technological cooperation, the two leaders stressed that China-Russia relations have entered a new era of comprehensive and strategic partnership, through a number of initiatives to establish research centers and promote academic exchange. Certainly, one of the most prominent aspects of cooperation between the two countries revolved around the development of a wide-body passenger aircraft, the success of which was likely to lead to qualitative changes in the international aviation industry, with the emergence of a real and serious competitor to Boeing and Airbus. However, the two countries found that the plane would need to rely on foreign suppliers for its engine, because neither Russia nor China was able to build this engine. Long term vs. short term: With Russia's War in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies, the Russian-Chinese attempt to build a giant passenger plane has often failed or will be delayed for years to see the light. This deals a painful blow to the idea of China's autonomy in one of the most prominent technical fields - aviation. Despite this, China cannot be knocked out of international competition in this field in the long run. Once the COMAC C919 enters service, although it cannot compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo in international markets, it is an essential part of Beijing's plans to increase the country's advanced manufacturing in the next five years, all major Chinese government-owned airlines will fly. Although the C919 will not change international scales in the aviation industry soon, the joint coordination between the United States and Europe in the aviation industry reveals concern that COMAC may break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in the aviation industry in the long term. Especially as the past two decades have proven China's ability to join many Western high-tech industries such as automobiles, trains and digital technology. In the middle of last year, the United States and the European Union agreed to end their 17-year trade dispute over aircrafts, and the two sides agreed to stop providing development incentives, which could harm the other side. The background of this agreement is the desire of the two sides to present a united front against China, because the agreement calls for joint action against third-party anti-market practices, which includes China calling on foreign investors to benefit from its low-cost aviation technology that harms Boeing and Airbus. But there are those who believe there is a lot of exaggeration about the strength of the Chinese aviation industry, that this industry still depends in essence on Western technologies, and that the US and the EU can eliminate the Chinese aviation industry, but they do not want to, at least for the time being, because doing so means colliding with China. Both Boeing and Airbus salivate for Chinese markets, as the demand for aviation in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to expand at twice the rate in the West, therefore, American and European companies have a lot to lose from direct confrontation with China. This is especially so now, as the US and Europe are concentrating their efforts to break the Russian economy. This is evident from the fact that the US Department of Defense has blacklisted Chinese COMAC partners for its military activities. But they have completely avoided dealing a blow to China's commercial aviation industry, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have dealt a severe blow to China's aircraft ambitions and its proud COMAC C919 aircraft which is essentially a Western plane. The role of the Chinese company is actually limited to assembling the plane's fuselage and wings, which is a minor role representing only 25 percent of the costs. The avionics used are manufactured by American companies such as Honeywell, Collins Aerospace, and other European companies, and the aircraft's engine, which is the most difficult part, is the product of a joint venture between the American General Electric and the French company Safran, which manufactures aviation and missile engines. Moreover, China's commercial aviation industry may need more time to compete with its Western counterparts Boeing and Airbus. The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX, has more fuel consumption, has less range, and has no international support network. Make it marketable outside of China. However, the weaknesses in the Chinese plane do not negate the fact that Beijing is trying to pressure Boeing and Airbus indirectly. China's orders for planes from Boeing and Airbus is very low, compared to the number it will need in the coming years. This means that it sends a message to the US and the EU, that it will rely on its domestic production even if it is more expensive. Some experts point out that it is only a matter of time until competition intensifies between Boeing and Airbus on the one hand and COMAC on the other hand in the field of civil aviation, even if it is US and European sanctions against Russia have hindered China from accelerating the development of its aviation industry.", "url": "https://aviationsourcenews.com/analysis/will-the-comac-c919-break-the-boeing-airbus-duopoly/"}, {"title": "COMAC to deliver just one C919 aircraft in 2022", "date": "2022-09-02", "content": "The beginning of the revenue service of the Chinese airliner COMAC C919 should be quite modest. Customer of the launch of the aircraft, carrier China Eastern Airlines said in its first-half report released this week that it expects to receive just one unit of the new plane by the end of this year. Previously, the company had announced that it would receive three C919s. Neither the Chinese airline COMAC commented on the reasons that led to the reduction in the forecast of deliveries of the C919 this year. However, it is not surprising that this can happen, after all the Chinese program accumulates a series of delays due to technical difficulties and problems in the supply of components imported from companies in the West. So far, China Eastern has ordered five C919s, four of which will be delivered in 2023, according to the company's report. The first aircraft destined for the company is already ready and made its first test flight in May this year. Despite the expectation of being the launch operator of the first commercial jet entirely designed in the country, China Eastern is apparently in no hurry to receive the aircraft from COMAC. In July this year, the company signed an order for 100 Airbus A320neo family jets, with deliveries starting in 2023, displacing the Boeing 737 MAX, which still remains grounded in the Chinese air market. According to COMAC data, the C919 accumulates a total of 815 letters of intent to purchase from 28 customers, most of them Chinese companies. Part of these orders must be converted into firm orders after the aircraft is certified by CAAC, China's civil aviation regulatory agency, which is expected to grant the aircraft approval soon. The C919 is designed to compete with the traditional Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, which are the best-selling commercial airliners in the world. The wait, however, has been long. COMAC's single-aisle twin-engine aircraft has been in development for nearly 15 years.

The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service, and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. It is hoped that the first aircraft will be delivered to launch customer China Eastern Airline this year. It was hoped that the certification would go ahead on September 19th, but it seems China's own quarantine policies interfered with this plan. President Xi Jinping wanted to attend the C919 certification ceremony, but due to a visit to Uzbekistan on September 14 - 16th, would have needed to quarantine for ten days on his return before the event could go ahead. Hopes for the COMAC C919: The airplane is China's hopes of breaking the Airbus - Boeing duopoly, and the nation has high hopes for sales to pick up to the global market. However, to date, mainly Chinese buyers have firmed up orders for the type, with major investors including Hainan Airlines, China Construction Bank and Air China. However, GECAS has ordered 10 with 10 further options, which could, theoretically, end up anywhere. Nevertheless, it is a momentous occasion for Chinese aviation, and has been a long time in the making. Originally started as a project in 2008, COMAC targeted a maiden flight of the type in 2014. Production of the first prototype began in 2011, with annual production targeted to reach 150 aircraft by 2020. But huge budgetary overruns and teething troubles with the technical side of airplane production saw the timeline slip further and further into the future. Eventually, a completed prototype began high-speed taxi tests in 2017, with the first aircraft taking to the skies in May 2017. In December that year, a second prototype took flight, but things were moving very slowly. Prototypes three, four, and five had all begun flying by October 2019, and the very last of the test campaign aircraft, prototype six, took flight in December that year. Since then, the test aircraft have been put through their paces, testing for everything from extreme weather conditions to avionics and electrical system conformity. The first pre-delivery flight took place in May this year, with aircraft B-001J completing a three-hour flight. The aircraft bears the livery of Chinese airline OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of China Eastern, and should arrive with the airline later this year. However, it may well be the only C919 to be delivered to a customer in 2022. Some challenges to overcome: When the C919 was first floated, some airlines in the west showed interest. Indeed, European low-cost giant Ryanair had agreed to cooperate on the development of the aircraft, including the signing of an MoU for a 200-seat variant. While Michael O'Leary has expressed ongoing support for the plane in recent years, it might look less attractive now. The issue is that, after its first pre-delivery flight, the list sales price of the C919 was revealed to be 653 million yuan, which is getting very close to the list prices of Boeing and Airbus alternatives. It's around double the initially projected purchase price of $50 million. As well as the higher purchase price, there is the issue of operational challenges to consider. The availability of spare parts, technical support and qualified pilots to fly the plane is going to be hugely challenging outside of China for many years to come. While the type may gain some traction in the Asian markets, for it to reach the west is going to take a mammoth effort from COMAC.

The airplane left its base in Shanghai on Thursday, landing at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport for the first time. It continued to conduct the demonstration flight to Aba Hongyuan Airport the following day, marking the first time a C919 has flown to a high-plateau airport. Another C919 conducted a week-long plateau demonstration in Yunnan Province in August, which was its first visit to a plateau airport then. The demonstration flights are part of the functional and reliability test flights, which is a pre-requisite for Type Certification.

The producer made the announcement on its official WeChat account, which also contained an image of the plane and Chinese characters that read \"congratulating C919 for completing all test flights before obtaining a certificate.\" On July 23, COMAC said that its C919 jet was nearing certification as its test planes had completed all required trial flights. There are three certificates required for the delivery of an aircraft in China. One is a type certificate, which indicates that the model design of the aircraft meets requirements; the second is a production certification, which indicates that the manufacturing of the aircraft meets national standards; the third is an individual aircraft certificate, indicating that each plane delivered to airlines complies with requirements, according to market watchers. These are all given by the CAAC. The announcement confirms that COMAC has submitted the test results to CAAC and is waiting for approval of a CAAC type certificate, according to Lin Zhijie, an independent market watcher. After COMAC gets the type certificate, the C919 plane is likely to receive the other two certificates in a short time, Lin said on Monday. Market watchers said that obtaining the three certificates means that the plane is certified to fly, a prerequisite for entering commercial flight. Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times in an earlier interview that after obtaining the airworthiness certificate, COMAC is expected to conduct demonstration flights on commercial routes and provide technical training for pilots and relevant personnel, which may take six to 12 months. \"Ideally, the C919 is expected to be put into commercial operation in 2023 if everything goes smoothly,\" Wang said. Since it was first approved in 2006, the C919 is widely believed to aim to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in certain segment of the massive civil aviation industry. However, market watchers said that it's too early to say if a new plane can challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. \"Our current job is to build the plane, and make it fly safely and reliably,\" Lin said, adding it will take about 20 years to see if the plane can compete with Airbus and Boeing. Market observers said that there are two advantages for C919 - one is price, and the second is after-sale services. The aircraft's price tag will be lower than that of comparable Boeing and Airbus aircraft, and it will be exempt from import duties. Also, the whole production and service teams will be based within China, which will provide convenience to Chinese airlines. The C919, China's first self-developed trunk jetliner, is fitted with 158-168 seats with a range of 4,075-5,555 kilometers. The plane conducted a successful maiden flight in 2017. In March 2021, COMAC signed a contract with China Eastern Airlines for five planes. The new planes will be used on routes between Shanghai and Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu, according to the airline. To date, COMAC has received 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers worldwide. Boeing and China have an enduring partnership of more than 45 years. More than 50 percent of all commercial jets operating in China now are Boeing aircraft, and more than 10,000 Boeing aircraft currently fly around the world using Chinese-made components and assemblies, according to the official website of Boeing. Airbus told the Global Times earlier that China is the largest single-country market for Airbus' commercial aircraft. Deliveries to the Chinese market last year represented over 20 percent of Airbus' total deliveries worldwide.

The Chinese-built aircraft, which is designed to challenge the dual monopoly by Airbus and Boeing, has completed all flight test missions with the test aircraft. COMAC explained on its official accounts on social media that the six experimental aircrafts completed the testing tasks of the program, entering the final stage to obtain certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to start working on a commercial scale, a milestone in China's ambitions to climb the manufacturing supply chain. The C919 program is known to be designed to directly compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo, both narrow-body commercial planes, Chinese program faced a series of technical problems and tighter US export restrictions after it was introduced in 2008. China Eastern receives the first batch of COMAC C919s this month: The Changjiang Daily newspaper, owned by the local government in Wuhan, said in a report published on July 8 that China Eastern Airlines is scheduled to receive the first batch of C919 aircraft this month. The state-owned airlines company placed an order for five COMAC C919s in March last year. The narrow-body aircraft is assembled in China and relies heavily on Western components including engines and avionics. Since the beginning of July 2022, the three largest state-owned airlines in China have concluded the largest order for airlines in the country since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, by announcing the purchase of about 300 Airbus aircraft. Air China and China Southern Airlines, in separate disclosures filed to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, announced that they would each buy 96 A320neo aircrafts worth of $12.2 billion at list prices. China Eastern Airlines also stated that it will buy 100 aircraft of the same type, worth of $12.8 billion. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2023 and continue until 2027, with the bulk delivered in 2024. The aviation sector in China has recorded a recovery in recent months, from the blow it suffered after the authorities closed the huge city of Shanghai last April due to the new wave of the pandemic. artnership with Russia: China has worked for years to produce efficient aircraft engines, however, the most reliable estimates of the country's main scientific research institution, indicate that China is still stumbling in achieving its goal, and that its reliance on Russian systems has not achieved its promises. In 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to expand their technological cooperation, the two leaders stressed that China-Russia relations have entered a new era of comprehensive and strategic partnership, through a number of initiatives to establish research centers and promote academic exchange. Certainly, one of the most prominent aspects of cooperation between the two countries revolved around the development of a wide-body passenger aircraft, the success of which was likely to lead to qualitative changes in the international aviation industry, with the emergence of a real and serious competitor to Boeing and Airbus. However, the two countries found that the plane would need to rely on foreign suppliers for its engine, because neither Russia nor China was able to build this engine. Long term vs. short term: With Russia's War in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies, the Russian-Chinese attempt to build a giant passenger plane has often failed or will be delayed for years to see the light. This deals a painful blow to the idea of China's autonomy in one of the most prominent technical fields - aviation. Despite this, China cannot be knocked out of international competition in this field in the long run. Once the COMAC C919 enters service, although it cannot compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo in international markets, it is an essential part of Beijing's plans to increase the country's advanced manufacturing in the next five years, all major Chinese government-owned airlines will fly. Although the C919 will not change international scales in the aviation industry soon, the joint coordination between the United States and Europe in the aviation industry reveals concern that COMAC may break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in the aviation industry in the long term. Especially as the past two decades have proven China's ability to join many Western high-tech industries such as automobiles, trains and digital technology. In the middle of last year, the United States and the European Union agreed to end their 17-year trade dispute over aircrafts, and the two sides agreed to stop providing development incentives, which could harm the other side. The background of this agreement is the desire of the two sides to present a united front against China, because the agreement calls for joint action against third-party anti-market practices, which includes China calling on foreign investors to benefit from its low-cost aviation technology that harms Boeing and Airbus. But there are those who believe there is a lot of exaggeration about the strength of the Chinese aviation industry, that this industry still depends in essence on Western technologies, and that the US and the EU can eliminate the Chinese aviation industry, but they do not want to, at least for the time being, because doing so means colliding with China. Both Boeing and Airbus salivate for Chinese markets, as the demand for aviation in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to expand at twice the rate in the West, therefore, American and European companies have a lot to lose from direct confrontation with China. This is especially so now, as the US and Europe are concentrating their efforts to break the Russian economy. This is evident from the fact that the US Department of Defense has blacklisted Chinese COMAC partners for its military activities. But they have completely avoided dealing a blow to China's commercial aviation industry, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have dealt a severe blow to China's aircraft ambitions and its proud COMAC C919 aircraft which is essentially a Western plane. The role of the Chinese company is actually limited to assembling the plane's fuselage and wings, which is a minor role representing only 25 percent of the costs. The avionics used are manufactured by American companies such as Honeywell, Collins Aerospace, and other European companies, and the aircraft's engine, which is the most difficult part, is the product of a joint venture between the American General Electric and the French company Safran, which manufactures aviation and missile engines. Moreover, China's commercial aviation industry may need more time to compete with its Western counterparts Boeing and Airbus. The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX, has more fuel consumption, has less range, and has no international support network. Make it marketable outside of China. However, the weaknesses in the Chinese plane do not negate the fact that Beijing is trying to pressure Boeing and Airbus indirectly. China's orders for planes from Boeing and Airbus is very low, compared to the number it will need in the coming years. This means that it sends a message to the US and the EU, that it will rely on its domestic production even if it is more expensive. Some experts point out that it is only a matter of time until competition intensifies between Boeing and Airbus on the one hand and COMAC on the other hand in the field of civil aviation, even if it is US and European sanctions against Russia have hindered China from accelerating the development of its aviation industry.", "url": "https://aviationsourcenews.com/analysis/will-the-comac-c919-break-the-boeing-airbus-duopoly/"}, {"title": "COMAC to deliver just one C919 aircraft in 2022", "date": "2022-09-02", "content": "The beginning of the revenue service of the Chinese airliner COMAC C919 should be quite modest. Customer of the launch of the aircraft, carrier China Eastern Airlines said in its first-half report released this week that it expects to receive just one unit of the new plane by the end of this year. Previously, the company had announced that it would receive three C919s. Neither the Chinese airline COMAC commented on the reasons that led to the reduction in the forecast of deliveries of the C919 this year. However, it is not surprising that this can happen, after all the Chinese program accumulates a series of delays due to technical difficulties and problems in the supply of components imported from companies in the West. So far, China Eastern has ordered five C919s, four of which will be delivered in 2023, according to the company's report. The first aircraft destined for the company is already ready and made its first test flight in May this year. Despite the expectation of being the launch operator of the first commercial jet entirely designed in the country, China Eastern is apparently in no hurry to receive the aircraft from COMAC. In July this year, the company signed an order for 100 Airbus A320neo family jets, with deliveries starting in 2023, displacing the Boeing 737 MAX, which still remains grounded in the Chinese air market. According to COMAC data, the C919 accumulates a total of 815 letters of intent to purchase from 28 customers, most of them Chinese companies. Part of these orders must be converted into firm orders after the aircraft is certified by CAAC, China's civil aviation regulatory agency, which is expected to grant the aircraft approval soon. The C919 is designed to compete with the traditional Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, which are the best-selling commercial airliners in the world. The wait, however, has been long. COMAC's single-aisle twin-engine aircraft has been in development for nearly 15 years.

The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony in Beijing Capital Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market. The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service, and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. It is hoped that the first aircraft will be delivered to launch customer China Eastern Airline this year. It was hoped that the certification would go ahead on September 19th, but it seems China's own quarantine policies interfered with this plan. President Xi Jinping wanted to attend the C919 certification ceremony, but due to a visit to Uzbekistan on September 14 - 16th, would have needed to quarantine for ten days on his return before the event could go ahead. Hopes for the COMAC C919: The airplane is China's hopes of breaking the Airbus - Boeing duopoly, and the nation has high hopes for sales to pick up to the global market. However, to date, mainly Chinese buyers have firmed up orders for the type, with major investors including Hainan Airlines, China Construction Bank and Air China. However, GECAS has ordered 10 with 10 further options, which could, theoretically, end up anywhere. Nevertheless, it is a momentous occasion for Chinese aviation, and has been a long time in the making. Originally started as a project in 2008, COMAC targeted a maiden flight of the type in 2014. Production of the first prototype began in 2011, with annual production targeted to reach 150 aircraft by 2020. But huge budgetary overruns and teething troubles with the technical side of airplane production saw the timeline slip further and further into the future. Eventually, a completed prototype began high-speed taxi tests in 2017, with the first aircraft taking to the skies in May 2017. In December that year, a second prototype took flight, but things were moving very slowly. Prototypes three, four, and five had all begun flying by October 2019, and the very last of the test campaign aircraft, prototype six, took flight in December that year. Since then, the test aircraft have been put through their paces, testing for everything from extreme weather conditions to avionics and electrical system conformity. The first pre-delivery flight took place in May this year, with aircraft B-001J completing a three-hour flight. The aircraft bears the livery of Chinese airline OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of China Eastern, and should arrive with the airline later this year. However, it may well be the only C919 to be delivered to a customer in 2022. Some challenges to overcome: When the C919 was first floated, some airlines in the west showed interest. Indeed, European low-cost giant Ryanair had agreed to cooperate on the development of the aircraft, including the signing of an MoU for a 200-seat variant. While Michael O'Leary has expressed ongoing support for the plane in recent years, it might look less attractive now. The issue is that, after its first pre-delivery flight, the list sales price of the C919 was revealed to be 653 million yuan, which is getting very close to the list prices of Boeing and Airbus alternatives. It's around double the initially projected purchase price of $50 million. As well as the higher purchase price, there is the issue of operational challenges to consider. The availability of spare parts, technical support and qualified pilots to fly the plane is going to be hugely challenging outside of China for many years to come. While the type may gain some traction in the Asian markets, for it to reach the west is going to take a mammoth effort from COMAC.

CAAC's delivery of the type certificate to COMAC this week comes 15 years after COMAC first development plan for the new jet was approved in 2007 and five years after making its maiden flight in 2017. Several updates released on social media accounts and digital news managed by Chinese state-run media websites have also provided more updates on the certification of the narrow body jet COMAC wants to use to compete with Airbus and Boeing. A statement released by COMAC celebrating the type certificate received from CAAC for the C919 thanks the aircraft development program's \"global suppliers, partners, customers and all circles for their support and encouragement.\" \"We have worked together for a long time, hand in hand, to succeed in developing the C919 aircraft,\" COMAC writes in its statement. The C919 features seating for up to 168 passengers and has a range of 2,200 nautical miles, placing it in direct competition with two of the world's most delivered passengers jets, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. COMAC's original planned first delivery and entry into service timing for the C919 was 2016, although technical difficulties delayed the program's commercial service launch multiple times since then. The majority of the C919 program's key components, such as the engines and avionics systems, are supplied by western companies such as Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace - which all have joint ventures and partnerships with Chinese companies supplying COMAC. The corporation requires foreign suppliers to manufacture parts made for the C919 in China. An update on the certification published by CGTN, a Chinese state media publication, notes that the first delivery of China's first domestically produced jet could occur by the end of the year to launch customer China Eastern Airlines. According to CGTN, 28 different airlines have ordered a combined 800 C919 aircraft from COMAC.

The C919 can also be configured to carry as many as 180 passengers in a single-class densely packed cabin, which airlines might find appealing on high-capacity routes. History of China Eastern and COMAC: Both based in Shanghai, China Eastern, became the launch customer of COMAC's C919 aircraft. In March 2021, China Eastern and COMAC together, witnessed by high- ranking officials from the Shanghai government and senior management from both companies, signed a purchase agreement for five C919 aircraft in Shanghai. The first C919 for China Eastern took its maiden flight in Shanghai on May 14th this year. After finishing the production flight test, it stays in the COMAC manufacturing center located near the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. As a public company, China Eastern released its first-half-year report on August 31st, saying it plans to receive one C919 from the Chinese civil aircraft OEM during the second half of 2022. However, in China Eastern's annual report of 2021, released at the end of March this year, China Eastern said it would receive three C919s in 2022 and another two in 2023. COMAC finally got C919's type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th. The C919 development team was received by China's top leader the next day for glory, the day before China's National Day. The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony at Beijing Capital International Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market. The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. Although now the C919 has received the type certificate, however before COMAC can deliver it to any airline customer. Also, the aircraft needs to receive an AC also issued by CAAC as well before it can enter into service. Therefore, delivering the first 919 before the end of the year will require close cooperation between COMAC and China Eastern. According to COMAC, the C919 program has 815 orders from 28 different customers. And part of these orders will be transferred to firm orders after the C919 receives the type certificate from CAAC. According to the private share offering plan of 2022 released by China Eastern in May, the listed price of C919 is $99 million.

This feature is a key attribute for any aircraft operating in China, as the country is home to some of the highest altitude airports in the world. In fact, eight of the top 10 highest altitude airports are found within China. COMAC used the B-001F, the same aircraft flew to Beijing for the Type Certification Ceremony at the end of September, and to Zhuhai for the China Airshow earlier this month, for the high-plateau demonstration task. The airplane left its base in Shanghai on Thursday, landing at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport for the first time. It continued to conduct the demonstration flight to Aba Hongyuan Airport the following day, marking the first time a C919 has flown to a high-plateau airport. Another C919 conducted a week-long plateau demonstration in Yunnan Province in August, which was its first visit to a plateau airport then. The demonstration flights are part of the functional and reliability test flights, which is a pre-requisite for Type Certification. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China regulation, airports that are elevated above 1,524m are categorized as plateau airports, and airports elevated above 2,438m are categorized as high-plateau airports. CAAC has additional regulatory requirements for these airports in terms of pilot qualification and aircraft operational verification. High airports in China: China now has 21 high-plateau civil airports, nearly half of the world's total high-plateau civil airports, most of which are located in western provinces and autonomous regions, like Qinghai, Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Hubei.

The COMAC flight test center, with the participation of the CAAC, operated the C919 flight demonstration. ARJ21 traveled the same path: In July 2020, more than four years after its first delivery, in order to expand the scope of the ARJ21 operation, COMAC conducted the ARJ21 high-plateau flight test at Daocheng Yading Airport, the world's highest civil airport with an altitude of 4,411m above sea level. After being certified by the CAAC, the test result expanded ARJ21's flight envelope significantly, making the aircraft capable of reaching all the high- altitude airports scattered in the western part of China, a potential market for which a regional aircraft is ideally suited.

China Eastern Airlines will receive its first C919 before the end of this year, according to Li Yangmin, General Manager of China Eastern, speaking at the China Eastern Group party meeting at the end of October. COMAC finally got C919's type certificate from the CAAC on September 29th. It clears the biggest and final obstacle for C919's first delivery. The first C919 for China Eastern took its maiden flight in May. According to COMAC, the C919 program has 815 orders from 28 customers.

China Eastern Airlines and the C919: Three senior CEA pilots are responsible for the maiden flight of the C919 aircraft from Shanghai Pudong International Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The smaller airport served as the primary airport for the city before Pudong was completed in 1999. The airport now primarily serves domestic destinations and is a hub for China Eastern Airlines. After arriving at the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, the new aircraft passes through the traditional water cannon before officially commissioning into the fleet of CEA. The model is one of five on order by the airline and will enter commercial use in the spring of 2023. China Eastern Airlines has been deeply involved in the design and development of C919 aircraft, trained and provided the first C919 flight crew to fly a jet as a companion during the maiden flight of C919 aircraft, and provided suggestions from the perspectives of customer use and maintenance.

The 100 hours of proving flight are mandatory by Civil Aviation Administration of China regulations. It is a prerequisite for a Chinese domestic airline to add a new aircraft type to its fleet for commercial operations. The objective of the proving flight is to comprehensively test the reliability of China Eastern's C919 operational support system. Successfully completing the proving flight will lay a solid foundation for the successful launch of commercial flights afterward. First two days of proving flight: The first proving flight, MU7801, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 13:25 and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport at 15:17 on December 26th. The C919 arrived at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport at 13:21 on December 27th, making its first appearance in Chengdu after its delivery. After landing, the aircraft received a water salute, a symbol of the highest etiquette in civil aviation. And it returned to its base in SHA at 18:15. According to China Eastern, the 100 hours proving flight will last until mid- February 2023, taking off from 10 airports in nine provinces and municipal cities. Each proving flight will take off from SHA and return to SHA on the same day. Besides the PEK and TFU, the destinations will also include Beijing Daxing International Airport, Xi'an, Haikou, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, and Jinan. The proving flight needs to simulate the upcoming operations of China Eastern, including the whole process of dispatching, passenger boarding, pilot operation, maintenance, and so on. After China Eastern completes the proving flight, the CAAC will review the result. The CAAC will approve the updated China Eastern's Operating Certificate after confirming that China Eastern has the ability to operate the C919 safely. China Eastern aims to put the C919 into commercial operations in the spring of 2023. By then, the C919 will appear on popular routes between Shanghai and Beijing, Xi'an, Kunming, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. The proving flight is also a test for the internal cooperation of China Eastern. As Shang Feng, deputy general manager of the C919 Flight Department of China Eastern, said, \"The proving flight also tested the adaptability of the company's relevant support units to the C919 and the degree of connectivity between relevant departments. China Eastern will optimize the workflow based on the data, experience, and problems found during the proving flight.\" China Eastern's preparation: Regarding personnel preparation, China Eastern has completed the C919 type training of the first batch of 9 pilots, 24 flight attendants, and 13 maintenance personnel. In addition, the second batch of personnel training is ongoing. The number of personnel is enough to meet the requirements of the proving flight and the initial commercial operations. Also, China Eastern has confirmed and purchased the first batch of spares and tooling equipment, according to China Eastern Airlines Technology Company. The ground service department of China Eastern has received weight and balance training from the OEM. China Eastern has carried out the C919 fueling operation training for a total of 150 ground staff and airport representatives from all over the country.

Customer of the launch of the aircraft, carrier China Eastern Airlines said in its first-half report released this week that it expects to receive just one unit of the new plane by the end of this year. Previously, the company had announced that it would receive three C919s. Neither the Chinese airline COMAC commented on the reasons that led to the reduction in the forecast of deliveries of the C919 this year. However, it is not surprising that this can happen, after all the Chinese program accumulates a series of delays due to technical difficulties and problems in the supply of components imported from companies in the West. So far, China Eastern has ordered five C919s, four of which will be delivered in 2023, according to the company's report. The first aircraft destined for the company is already ready and made its first test flight in May this year. Despite the expectation of being the launch operator of the first commercial jet entirely designed in the country, China Eastern is apparently in no hurry to receive the aircraft from COMAC. In July this year, the company signed an order for 100 Airbus A320neo family jets, with deliveries starting in 2023, displacing the Boeing 737 MAX, which still remains grounded in the Chinese air market. According to COMAC data, the C919 accumulates a total of 815 letters of intent to purchase from 28 customers, most of them Chinese companies. Part of these orders must be converted into firm orders after the aircraft is certified by CAAC, China's civil aviation regulatory agency, which is expected to grant the aircraft approval soon. The C919 is designed to compete with the traditional Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, which are the best-selling commercial airliners in the world. The wait, however, has been long. COMAC's single-aisle twin-engine aircraft has been in development for nearly 15 years.

The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony in Beijing Capital Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market. The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service, and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. It is hoped that the first aircraft will be delivered to launch customer China Eastern Airline this year. It was hoped that the certification would go ahead on September 19th, but it seems China's own quarantine policies interfered with this plan. President Xi Jinping wanted to attend the C919 certification ceremony, but due to a visit to Uzbekistan on September 14 - 16th, would have needed to quarantine for ten days on his return before the event could go ahead. Hopes for the COMAC C919: The airplane is China's hopes of breaking the Airbus - Boeing duopoly, and the nation has high hopes for sales to pick up to the global market. However, to date, mainly Chinese buyers have firmed up orders for the type, with major investors including Hainan Airlines, China Construction Bank and Air China. However, GECAS has ordered 10 with 10 further options, which could, theoretically, end up anywhere. Nevertheless, it is a momentous occasion for Chinese aviation, and has been a long time in the making. Originally started as a project in 2008, COMAC targeted a maiden flight of the type in 2014. Production of the first prototype began in 2011, with annual production targeted to reach 150 aircraft by 2020. But huge budgetary overruns and teething troubles with the technical side of airplane production saw the timeline slip further and further into the future. Eventually, a completed prototype began high-speed taxi tests in 2017, with the first aircraft taking to the skies in May 2017. In December that year, a second prototype took flight, but things were moving very slowly. Prototypes three, four, and five had all begun flying by October 2019, and the very last of the test campaign aircraft, prototype six, took flight in December that year. Since then, the test aircraft have been put through their paces, testing for everything from extreme weather conditions to avionics and electrical system conformity. The first pre-delivery flight took place in May this year, with aircraft B-001J completing a three-hour flight. The aircraft bears the livery of Chinese airline OTT Airlines, a subsidiary of China Eastern, and should arrive with the airline later this year. However, it may well be the only C919 to be delivered to a customer in 2022. Some challenges to overcome: When the C919 was first floated, some airlines in the west showed interest. Indeed, European low-cost giant Ryanair had agreed to cooperate on the development of the aircraft, including the signing of an MoU for a 200-seat variant. While Michael O'Leary has expressed ongoing support for the plane in recent years, it might look less attractive now. The issue is that, after its first pre-delivery flight, the list sales price of the C919 was revealed to be 653 million yuan, which is getting very close to the list prices of Boeing and Airbus alternatives. It's around double the initially projected purchase price of $50 million. As well as the higher purchase price, there is the issue of operational challenges to consider. The availability of spare parts, technical support and qualified pilots to fly the plane is going to be hugely challenging outside of China for many years to come. While the type may gain some traction in the Asian markets, for it to reach the west is going to take a mammoth effort from COMAC.

CAAC's delivery of the type certificate to COMAC this week comes 15 years after COMAC first development plan for the new jet was approved in 2007 and five years after making its maiden flight in 2017. Several updates released on social media accounts and digital news managed by Chinese state-run media websites have also provided more updates on the certification of the narrow body jet COMAC wants to use to compete with Airbus and Boeing. A statement released by COMAC celebrating the type certificate received from CAAC for the C919 thanks the aircraft development program's \"global suppliers, partners, customers and all circles for their support and encouragement.\" \"We have worked together for a long time, hand in hand, to succeed in developing the C919 aircraft,\" COMAC writes in its statement. The C919 features seating for up to 168 passengers and has a range of 2,200 nautical miles, placing it in direct competition with two of the world's most delivered passengers jets, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. COMAC's original planned first delivery and entry into service timing for the C919 was 2016, although technical difficulties delayed the program's commercial service launch multiple times since then. The majority of the C919 program's key components, such as the engines and avionics systems, are supplied by western companies such as Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace - which all have joint ventures and partnerships with Chinese companies supplying COMAC. The corporation requires foreign suppliers to manufacture parts made for the C919 in China. An update on the certification published by CGTN, a Chinese state media publication, notes that the first delivery of China's first domestically produced jet could occur by the end of the year to launch customer China Eastern Airlines. According to CGTN, 28 different airlines have ordered a combined 800 C919 aircraft from COMAC.

The C919 can also be configured to carry as many as 180 passengers in a single-class densely packed cabin, which airlines might find appealing on high-capacity routes. History of China Eastern and COMAC: Both based in Shanghai, China Eastern, became the launch customer of COMAC's C919 aircraft. In March 2021, China Eastern and COMAC together, witnessed by high- ranking officials from the Shanghai government and senior management from both companies, signed a purchase agreement for five C919 aircraft in Shanghai. The first C919 for China Eastern took its maiden flight in Shanghai on May 14th this year. After finishing the production flight test, it stays in the COMAC manufacturing center located near the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. As a public company, China Eastern released its first-half-year report on August 31st, saying it plans to receive one C919 from the Chinese civil aircraft OEM during the second half of 2022. However, in China Eastern's annual report of 2021, released at the end of March this year, China Eastern said it would receive three C919s in 2022 and another two in 2023. COMAC finally got C919's type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th. The C919 development team was received by China's top leader the next day for glory, the day before China's National Day. The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony at Beijing Capital International Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market.

Although now the C919 has received the type certificate, however before COMAC can deliver it to any airline customer. Also, the aircraft needs to receive an AC also issued by CAAC as well before it can enter into service. Therefore, delivering the first 919 before the end of the year will require close cooperation between COMAC and China Eastern. According to COMAC, the C919 program has 815 orders from 28 different customers. And part of these orders will be transferred to firm orders after the C919 receives the type certificate from CAAC. According to the private share offering plan of 2022 released by China Eastern in May, the listed price of C919 is $99 million.

In fact, eight of the top 10 highest altitude airports are found within China. COMAC used the B-001F, the same aircraft flew to Beijing for the Type Certification Ceremony at the end of September, and to Zhuhai for the China Airshow earlier this month, for the high-plateau demonstration task. The airplane left its base in Shanghai on Thursday, landing at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport for the first time. It continued to conduct the demonstration flight to Aba Hongyuan Airport the following day, marking the first time a C919 has flown to a high-plateau airport. Another C919 conducted a week-long plateau demonstration in Yunnan Province in August, which was its first visit to a plateau airport then. The demonstration flights are part of the functional and reliability test flights, which is a pre-requisite for Type Certification. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China regulation, airports that are elevated above 1,524m are categorized as plateau airports, and airports elevated above 2,438m are categorized as high-plateau airports. CAAC has additional regulatory requirements for these airports in terms of pilot qualification and aircraft operational verification. High airports in China: China now has 21 high-plateau civil airports, nearly half of the world's total high-plateau civil airports, most of which are located in western provinces and autonomous regions, like Qinghai, Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Hubei.

In the economy cabin, the middle seat in each three-seat row is 1.5 cm wider than its neighboring ones, which offers more comfortableness. With an aisle height of 2.25 meters, the plane comes with an efficient air filtration system, a passenger-centric lighting system and low noise. Besides, there are twenty 12\" drop-down screens that can play 1080P videos. The pre-production phase of aircraft took a long while. The first test flight took place in 2017, while its first commercial contract with CEA was signed in April of this year. It obtained its Type Certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th, 2022. According to CNN, it started mass production in November. China Eastern said it plans to receive the remaining four orders for its first batch of C919s over the next two years, according to The Paper of Shanghai. The airline is the world's first airline operator for C919. It has a fleet of nearly 800 airplanes. Commercial Aviation Corp of China is expected to produce about 25 C919 aircraft per year by 2030, well below current monthly production rates of narrow-body aircraft from rivals, according to analysts at Jefferies. The C919 relies heavily on Western components, including engines and flight control systems, from companies such as GE, Safran and Honeywell International. China is seeking to increase the proportion of domestic parts on the C919 and an alternative engine called the CJ-1000A is being developed.

The 100 hours of proving flight are mandatory by Civil Aviation Administration of China regulations. It is a prerequisite for a Chinese domestic airline to add a new aircraft type to its fleet for commercial operations. The objective of the proving flight is to comprehensively test the reliability of China Eastern's C919 operational support system. Successfully completing the proving flight will lay a solid foundation for the successful launch of commercial flights afterward. First two days of proving flight: The first proving flight, MU7801, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 13:25 and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport at 15:17 on December 26th. The C919 arrived at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport at 13:21 on December 27th, making its first appearance in Chengdu after its delivery. After landing, the aircraft received a water salute, a symbol of the highest etiquette in civil aviation. And it returned to its base in SHA at 18:15. According to China Eastern, the 100 hours proving flight will last until mid- February 2023, taking off from 10 airports in nine provinces and municipal cities. Each proving flight will take off from SHA and return to SHA on the same day. Besides the PEK and TFU, the destinations will also include Beijing Daxing International Airport, Xi'an, Haikou, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, and Jinan. The proving flight needs to simulate the upcoming operations of China Eastern, including the whole process of dispatching, passenger boarding, pilot operation, maintenance, and so on. After China Eastern completes the proving flight, the CAAC will review the result. The CAAC will approve the updated China Eastern's Operating Certificate after confirming that China Eastern has the ability to operate the C919 safely. China Eastern aims to put the C919 into commercial operations in the spring of 2023. By then, the C919 will appear on popular routes between Shanghai and Beijing, Xi'an, Kunming, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. The proving flight is also a test for the internal cooperation of China Eastern. As Shang Feng, deputy general manager of the C919 Flight Department of China Eastern, said, \"The proving flight also tested the adaptability of the company's relevant support units to the C919 and the degree of connectivity between relevant departments. China Eastern will optimize the workflow based on the data, experience, and problems found during the proving flight.\" China Eastern's preparation: Regarding personnel preparation, China Eastern has completed the C919 type training of the first batch of 9 pilots, 24 flight attendants, and 13 maintenance personnel. In addition, the second batch of personnel training is ongoing. The number of personnel is enough to meet the requirements of the proving flight and the initial commercial operations. Also, China Eastern has confirmed and purchased the first batch of spares and tooling equipment, according to China Eastern Airlines Technology Company. The ground service department of China Eastern has received weight and balance training from the OEM. China Eastern has carried out the C919 fueling operation training for a total of 150 ground staff and airport representatives from all over the country.

The C919 can also be configured to carry as many as 180 passengers in a single-class densely packed cabin, which airlines might find appealing on high-capacity routes. History of China Eastern and COMAC: Both based in Shanghai, China Eastern, became the launch customer of COMAC's C919 aircraft. In March 2021, China Eastern and COMAC together, witnessed by high- ranking officials from the Shanghai government and senior management from both companies, signed a purchase agreement for five C919 aircraft in Shanghai. The first C919 for China Eastern took its maiden flight in Shanghai on May 14th this year. After finishing the production flight test, it stays in the COMAC manufacturing center located near the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. As a public company, China Eastern released its first-half-year report on August 31st, saying it plans to receive one C919 from the Chinese civil aircraft OEM during the second half of 2022. However, in China Eastern's annual report of 2021, released at the end of March this year, China Eastern said it would receive three C919s in 2022 and another two in 2023. COMAC finally got C919's type certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th. The C919 development team was received by China's top leader the next day for glory, the day before China's National Day. The certification was awarded at a grand ceremony at Beijing Capital International Airport, marking the start of China's entry into the wider commercial aviation market. The certification of the C919 means it is finally ready to enter service and has passed all the applicable Airworthiness Standards for Transport Aircraft under Part 25 of the China Civil Aviation Regulations. Although now the C919 has received the type certificate, however before COMAC can deliver it to any airline customer. Also, the aircraft needs to receive an AC also issued by CAAC as well before it can enter into service. Therefore, delivering the first 919 before the end of the year will require close cooperation between COMAC and China Eastern. According to COMAC, the C919 program has 815 orders from 28 different customers. And part of these orders will be transferred to firm orders after the C919 receives the type certificate from CAAC. According to the private share offering plan of 2022 released by China Eastern in May, the listed price of C919 is $99 million.

COMAC announced that it had received around 300 orders from carriers during the airshow for the aircraft, which retail at the cost of US$99 million each.", "url": "https://simpleflying.com/china-eastern-1st-comac-c919-delivery/"}, {"title": "China Eastern takes delivery of the world's first made-in-China C919 jet", "date": "2022-12-09", "content": "The world's first C919, a Chinese-made narrowbody jet, was delivered to launch customer China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS) in Shanghai on Friday and took off for a 15-minute flight to mark the historic moment. The plane, a rival to the Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo and Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX single-aisle jet families, is expected to make its maiden commercial flight next spring, according to state-owned Xinhua News Agency. It was certified for safe operations in September and mass production in November. The plane delivered to China Eastern has 164 seats and was painted with \"the world's first C919\" on its side in Chinese and English. Its maiden route will be between Shanghai and the capital Beijing, industry sources have said. China Eastern said on Friday it plans to receive the remaining four of its first batch of C919 orders over the next two years, according to Shanghai's The Paper. That compares with earlier plans to get all four next year. The airline did not respond immediately to a request for comment. China's narrowbody jet ambitions intensified over the last few years amid conflicts with the United States from trade to technology that made China increasingly concerned about being overly dependent on Airbus and Boeing. Commercial Aviation Corp of China (COMAC) is expected to produce around 25 C919s per year by 2030, far lower than the current monthly rates of narrowbody production at its rivals, according to Jefferies analysts. COMAC did not immediately respond to request for comment. The C919 currently relies heavily on Western components, including engines and flight control systems, from companies such as GE (GE.N), Safran (SAF.PA) and Honeywell International (HON.O). China is trying to raise the proportion of domestic parts in the C919 and an alternative engine called the CJ-1000A is under development.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-eastern-takes-delivery-worlds-first-made-in-china-c919-jet-2022-12-09/"}, {"title": "World's first Chinese-made commercial aircraft makes maiden flight", "date": "2022-12-14", "content": "On Friday December 9th, the world's first COMAC C919, a Chinese-made narrow- body jet, was delivered to customer China Eastern Airlines in Shanghai. The plane made a 15-minute flight by three senior CEA pilots from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport to the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The short flight was meant to celebrate the historic moment. The aircraft, a rival to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX, is expected to make its first commercial flight next spring, China 's news agency Xinhua reported. The COMAC's first inaugural route will be between Shanghai and the capital Beijing. The C919 delivered to China Eastern has a 164-seat configuration that comes with a two-class cabin layout, including 8 business class seats and 156 economy class ones, according to Aviation Source news. In the economy cabin, the middle seat in each three-seat row is 1.5 cm wider than its neighboring ones, which offers more comfortableness. With an aisle height of 2.25 meters, the plane comes with an efficient air filtration system, a passenger-centric lighting system and low noise. Besides, there are twenty 12\" drop-down screens that can play 1080P videos. The pre-production phase of aircraft took a long while. The first test flight took place in 2017, while its first commercial contract with CEA was signed in April of this year. It obtained its Type Certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China on September 29th, 2022. According to CNN, it started mass production in November. China Eastern said it plans to receive the remaining four orders for its first batch of C919s over the next two years, according to The Paper of Shanghai. The airline is the world's first airline operator for C919. It has a fleet of nearly 800 airplanes. Commercial Aviation Corp of China is expected to produce about 25 C919 aircraft per year by 2030, well below current monthly production rates of narrow-body aircraft from rivals, according to analysts at Jefferies. The C919 relies heavily on Western components, including engines and flight control systems, from companies such as GE, Safran and Honeywell International.

The 100 hours of proving flight are mandatory by Civil Aviation Administration of China regulations. It is a prerequisite for a Chinese domestic airline to add a new aircraft type to its fleet for commercial operations. The objective of the proving flight is to comprehensively test the reliability of China Eastern's C919 operational support system. Successfully completing the proving flight will lay a solid foundation for the successful launch of commercial flights afterward. First two days of proving flight: The first proving flight, MU7801, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 13:25 and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport at 15:17 on December 26th. The C919 arrived at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport at 13:21 on December 27th, making its first appearance in Chengdu after its delivery. After landing, the aircraft received a water salute, a symbol of the highest etiquette in civil aviation. And it returned to its base in SHA at 18:15. According to China Eastern, the 100 hours proving flight will last until mid- February 2023, taking off from 10 airports in nine provinces and municipal cities. Each proving flight will take off from SHA and return to SHA on the same day. Besides the PEK and TFU, the destinations will also include Beijing Daxing International Airport, Xi'an, Haikou, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, and Jinan. The proving flight needs to simulate the upcoming operations of China Eastern, including the whole process of dispatching, passenger boarding, pilot operation, maintenance, and so on. After China Eastern completes the proving flight, the CAAC will review the result. The CAAC will approve the updated China Eastern's Operating Certificate after confirming that China Eastern has the ability to operate the C919 safely. China Eastern aims to put the C919 into commercial operations in the spring of 2023. By then, the C919 will appear on popular routes between Shanghai and Beijing, Xi'an, Kunming, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. The proving flight is also a test for the internal cooperation of China Eastern. As Shang Feng, deputy general manager of the C919 Flight Department of China Eastern, said, \"The proving flight also tested the adaptability of the company's relevant support units to the C919 and the degree of connectivity between relevant departments. China Eastern will optimize the workflow based on the data, experience, and problems found during the proving flight.\" China Eastern's preparation: Regarding personnel preparation, China Eastern has completed the C919 type training of the first batch of 9 pilots, 24 flight attendants, and 13 maintenance personnel. In addition, the second batch of personnel training is ongoing. The number of personnel is enough to meet the requirements of the proving flight and the initial commercial operations. Also, China Eastern has confirmed and purchased the first batch of spares and tooling equipment, according to China Eastern Airlines Technology Company. The ground service department of China Eastern has received weight and balance training from the OEM. China Eastern has carried out the C919 fueling operation training for a total of 150 ground staff and airport representatives from all over the country.
