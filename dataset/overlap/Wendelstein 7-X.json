In the Wendelstein device the heat is absorbed by about a hundred cubic metres of cooling water flowing around the heated components in closed cycles under high pressure. The heat absorbed is transferred by heat exchangers to a second cooling cycle supplied from a subterranean cold-water basin with a capacity of 1200 cubic metres. A regulator circuit mixes in just as much cooling water as is needed to maintain the temperature required by the components of the experiment. The heated cooling water then passes on to a catch basin and is recooled in cooling towers, finally returning to the cold-water basin.

The objective of fusion research is to derive energy from fusion of atomic nuclei, just as happens in the sun. To ignite the fusion fire, the hydrogen plasma fuel in a future power plant has to be confined in magnetic fields and heated to temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees. Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest fusion device of the stellarator type when completed, is intended to investigate the suitability of this configuration for a power plant. With 70 large superconducting magnet coils in continuous operation it is then to produce a highly stable and thermally insulating magnetic cage confining the plasma. The ring-shaped device is being installed as five almost structurally identical modules: Each of the five sections of the plasma vessel, along which 14 magnet coils are strung, is enclosed by a steel outer sheath, weighing altogether 120 tons. Assembled like slices of cake on the machine's foundation, the five modules form a steel ring from which numerous connection ports protrude. These link the apertures of the plasma chamber through the coil region with the outer vessel. Later, measuring instruments, pumps and heating facilities will be affixed here. The 254th and last port was brazed in between the plasma vessel and outer vessel with millimetre precision on 28 May 2013. The elaborate port installation lasted a good two years. This was preceded by an equally long test phase - \"a huge training session\" as installation head Dr. Lutz Wegener put it - during which the methods for exact placement and connection of the variously configured ports to the bizarrely shaped plasma vessel were developed. One of the many challenges: As stainless steel inevitably shrinks at the seam when it is brazed, the components are distorted and change position. This had also to be allowed for when brazing the five modules of the device together: Calculations and tests during installation planning had predicted here up to eight millimetres shift per seam, this being intolerable since the ports and the subsequently connected measuring instruments would be looking at the wrong place in the plasma. The solution: The module to be brazed, exactly monitored by laser tracker measurements, was shifted on sliding bearings about eight millimetres away from its firmly attached component opposite. Then, to prevent anything shifting, several welders began together to close the two brazing gaps of both the plasma chamber and the outer sheath. For the multi-layered seams with a total length of 40 metres the specialists of the MAN Diesel Turbo company took several weeks, during which the heavy module - in keeping with the shrinkage - slowly returned to its initial position in tenths of a millimetre steps. \"It is a veritable work of art to guide in the right direction such a big and heavy component during brazing\", states Karsten Liesenberg, who is responsible for the vessel installation concept: \"If the laser trackers showed that the module was not being shifted exactly parallel, the brazing crew had to change over to the opposite side of the seam so that the component was again put on the right track\". This precision work was repeated on the other four module boundaries. The ring is meanwhile closed and all five modules are in place with the required two millimetre precision. Till installation of Wendelstein 7-X is completed in 2014, there are still a few tasks to be done, such as linking the magnets to their power and helium supplies and doing the interior of the plasma vessel. This will be accompanied by provision of the systems for heating the plasma, the supply facilities for electric power and cooling, machine control and finally the numerous measuring instruments for diagnosing the behaviour of the plasma.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/51837/05_13"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Preparations for operation of Wendelstein 7-X starting", "date": "2014-05-12", "content": "After years of calculation, planning, component production and installation the Wendelstein 7-X project is now entering a new phase: Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald in May started the preparations for operation of this the world's largest fusion device of the stellarator type. Assembly began in April 2005: A special grab hoisted the first of 70 more than man-sized magnet coils carefully over a just finger-wide slit onto a bizarrely shaped steel vessel. The coil, weighing six tons, and the vessel part were the first components of the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device to arrive at Greifswald from their production facilities throughout Europe. Here, more than 800 kilometres from the home institute at Garching in Bavaria, IPP had opened a second site in 1994 within the framework of a special programme \"Aufbau Ost\" to support the eastern part of Germany. The two sites are pursuing the same objective: copying on earth the energy production of the sun. A fusion power plant is to produce energy from fusion of atomic nuclei. As the fusion fire does not ignite till a temperature of over 100 million degrees is attained, the fuel, viz. a low-density hydrogen plasma, ought not to come into contact with the cold walls. Confined by magnetic fields, the fuel is suspended inside a vacuum chamber almost without contact. The two types of configuration for the magnetic cage are being investigated by IPP at the two separate sites: the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak is being operated at Garching, the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator is being built at Greifswald. The more simply designed tokamaks are still to the fore. Today only a tokamak such as the ITER international test reactor has the confidence to produce an energy-supplying plasma. \"But\", states Project Head Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger, \"the stellarator principle promises strengths where its fellow campaigner shows weaknesses.\" Unlike tokamaks, which work in pulsed mode, stellarators are suitable for continuous operation, by virtue of their specially configured magnetic system. Proving this makes Wendelstein 7-X the key experiment. The structure of its magnetic field is the result of sophisticated optimisation calculations made by the Stellarator Theory division and of its more than ten years of searching for a particularly stable and thermally insulating magnetic cage. Professor Klinger states: \"Wendelstein 7-X is expected to put, for the first time, the quality of its plasma equilibrium and confinement on an equal footing with those of a tokamak. The experiment is to show that stellarators are also suitable for power plants.\" And with discharges lasting 30 minutes, it is to demonstrate its essential superiority, viz. continuous operation. This does not require Wendelstein 7-X to produce energy: Many properties of an ignited plasma can be transferred to stellarators from the ITER tokamak. The device comprises five almost identical modules preinstalled and assembled in a circle in the experimentation hall: 70 superconducting coils strung along a steel plasma vessel are enclosed in a ring-shaped shell. In their vacuum-pumped interior the magnets are later cooled with liquid helium to superconduction temperature at nearly absolute zero. They then need hardly any energy. Besides the major components, miles of cooling ducts, current leads, measuring cables, numerous observation ports and sensors were installed, always in conjunction with control measurements and tightness testing of the many thousands of brazing seams. \"The industrial production and assembly were already an experiment in itself\", states Professor Klinger, \"a task that we at first underestimated: The superconduction technology coupled with the elaborate geometry of the components presented us with exacting quality requirements.\" In fact, construction did not take six years as planned, but nine years. Design and production, measurement and calculation - the complex shaping called for new methods that had first to be developed by the institute and industry during construction. A new basis plan was therefore drawn up in 2007. Since then assembly of Wendelstein 7-X is within schedule and the budget plan, and since 2009 - as first research project in Germany - it is even certified in accordance with industry standard ISO 9001. Companies from the whole of Europe produced the components for Wendelstein 7-X. The investment costs met by the Federal Government, the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the EU came to 370 million euros. Contracts worth more than 80 million were awarded to regional companies. Numerous research facilities at home and abroad were involved in construction of the device: Within the framework of Helmholtz Association Karlsruhe Institute of Technology was responsible for the entire microwave plasma heating, J\u00fclich Research Centre built diagnostics and produced the elaborate connections of the superconducting magnet coils. Installation of these required 160 person-years of work time by superconduction technology specialists from the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krakow. The US fusion institutes at Princeton, Oak Ridge and Los Alamos made contributions that included auxiliary coils and measuring instruments worth 7.5 million dollars for equipping Wendelstein 7-X. At the beginning of May the shell of the device was closed and the first pumps started up. The inauguration ceremony on 20 May 2014 will mark entry into the next work phase, viz. preparation of operation. This will involve testing all technical systems: the vacuum in the vessels, the cooling system, the superconducting coils and the magnetic field produced by them. Professor Klinger: \"If all goes well, we can produce the first plasma in about a year.\"", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3397401/03_14"}, {"title": "Fusion Stellarator Starts Up", "date": "2014-05-21", "content": "The construction of ITER, the 23 000-metric-ton tokamak-style fusion reactor is under way now in France. But a smaller reactor of a different design might be the key to its success. That reactor, the US $1.45 billion Wendelstein 7-X, was inaugurated yesterday, and researchers expect that it will ignite its first plasma a year from now. Housed at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, in Greifswald, Germany, Wendelstein 7-X is a \"stellarator,\" a term coined in the 1950s by the Princeton astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer, who designed the first such machine for exploring the fusion reactions in stars. It's a design that predates the tokamaks in use today but one that had fallen out of favor because the computers of the day weren't able to properly model the 3-D magnetic field confining the plasma. \"The W7-X is the first large stellarator designed to get the physics right,\" says Allen Boozer, an applied physicist at Columbia University, in New York City. Although many view fusion power with skepticism, many others hope that one day we will harness the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms to produce electricity. The helium atoms have a slightly lower mass than the two hydrogen atoms that form them, and this difference in mass is released as energy, according to Einstein's famous principle E=mc2. It is this reaction that powers the sun and, in an uncontrolled fashion, hydrogen bombs. However, for hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium atoms, they have to smash together with extremely high energies, corresponding to temperatures of at least 100 million \u00b0C. At these temperatures, electrons are entirely separated from the atomic nuclei and the gas becomes a plasma, but if the plasma touches a metal wall of the reactor, it immediately cools off, stopping any fusion reactions. Therefore, it has to be trapped in a \"magnetic bottle,\" a magnetic field created by electromagnets arranged in such a way that the plasma doesn't touch the reactor vessel. From the 1950s to the 1970s, these magnetic bottles were stellarators, based on Spitzer's original design of a contorted-torus-shaped reactor vessel with toroidal coils surrounding it and a separate helical coil surrounding the torus. This helical coil was wound in such a way that it produced a magnetic field component perpendicular to that of the toroidal coils. The combination created the \"helicoidal\" magnetic field needed to confine the plasma. During the 1950s, Russian scientists developed what became a more successful design for magnetic confinement: the tokamak. It consisted of a torus-shaped vessel surrounded by toroidal magnets. Instead of the stellarator's helical coil, however, a circular current through the plasma created the component of the magnetic field required to confine the plasma. The tokamak worked better than the stellarators of the time, and fusion researchers switched to the Russian design, demonstrating sustained fusion reactions with the Joint European Torus (JET), in Culham, England, in 1991. (Until ITER-the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor-is complete, JET remains the world's largest magnetic fusion device. Its torus has an inner radius of 0.9 meters and an outer radius of 3 meters, which can confine a plasma with a volume of 100 m3.) But the required circular current through the plasma makes it prone to instabilities, resulting in stoppages called disruptions. Stellarators don't have this problem. Their difficulty was that the design of the machine required intensive 3-D simulation for determining the optimal shape of the magnetic field and the shapes of the helical and toroidal coils that created it. In the 1980s, supercomputers could do the job. At that time, the researchers in Greifswald decided on a new \"bottom-up\" approach, modeling the field using the fundamental equations of magnetohydrodynamics, says Thomas Klinger, who heads the W7-X project. Although Wendelstein 7-X is not designed for actual fusion reactions, the experience of building and operating it will likely contribute valuable insights to the construction of ITER, which requires similar technology. The magnetic field in the machine will be created by superconducting magnets, cooled to a temperature of -269 \u00b0C, and carry a current of 18 200 amperes. The ITER design also calls for superconducting coils, and experience with this cryogenic technology will be important, says Klinger. \"The fact that you have a cryogenic machine drives the quality requirements to a much higher level,\" he says. \"You have to meet high-level industrial standards as they exist in aviation or space science, and there we are contributing to ITER.\" What about a possible follow-up machine? Klinger says it's too early. \"First we have to gain experience running this machine. We have very good evidence that the W7-X is already very, very close to the design we need for a power station,\" he says. \"We first need success with our project. It has to prove to be fully competitive with the tokamak, and it has to be able to run steady state.\" Steady-state operation is best for power generation, in part because you avoid thermal cycling and material fatigue. But it's difficult to achieve in a tokamak. Indeed, David Anderson, who directs research with the Helically Symmetric Experiment stellarator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, believes that stellarators might be better suited for electricity generation. \"They are much easier to operate than tokamaks,\" he says. That's not to say stellarators are necessarily the way to go, according to Larry Grisham, a physicist who was with the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory until he recently became director of strategic development at the magnetometer firm Twinleaf, in Princeton, N.J. \"The major disadvantage of a stellarator relative to a tokamak is that, for a given size, it is much more complicated to fabricate and assemble, and would presumably be even more complicated than a tokamak to repair in a radioactive environment,\" Grisham says. It will, of course, be many years before one design or the other can really prove its worth as a power generator.", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion-stellarator-starts-up"}, {"title": "Stellarators Back Online After Decades in the Dark", "date": "2014-05-30", "content": "Set to go online in just over a year's time, the $1.45B Wendelstein 7-X stellarator is a throwback to an earlier time in high-energy physics. Based on a design first created in the 1950s, the stellarator design fell out of favor with physicists due to the fact that computers of the day couldn't calculate the complex geometries of the magnetic fields required to contain the machine's stellar-hot plasma.Essentially, all fusion reactors, whether they're tokamaks or stellarators, are vessels designed to contain a superheated, plasmatic, atomic soup where hydrogen atoms fuse into helium. Since no known material can withstand such incredible energy levels, fusion researchers employ magnetic fields to confine this awesome energy state within a fixed boundary. Though that explanation sounds simple enough, getting the physics right for such a reactor takes amazing computing power and generations of PhDs.Although stellarators demonstrated some successes in the 1950s and 60s, tokamaks eventually became a more popular and productive reactor design. In fact, much of our understanding of fusion ignition and sustainable energy generation has come from tokamak research. However, the tokamak has its own fatal flaw, the design makes its plasma field susceptible to instabilities that can stop an experiment dead in its tracks.With today's robust computer simulations it looks like the stellarator may make a comeback, with the Wendelstein 7-X as the design's vanguard.Containing 50 non-planar and 20 planar 3.5 meter tall superconducting magnetic coils, the Wendelstein 7-X is designed to produce plasma discharges lasting up to a half an hour. Housed in the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Plasmaphysik, the 7-X was designed to be an engineering test bed for future fusion reactors. Although construction is well underway for the world's largest tokamak at ITER's facility in France, the Wendelstein 7-X (and stellarators in general) could still have a dramatic impact on fusion research. Given the project's relatively small price and the fact that it is less complex than a traditional tokamak, Wendelstein might prove that stellarators still have a say in the pursuit of net-gain fusion reaction.", "url": "https://www.engineering.com/story/stellarators-back-online-after-decades-in-the-dark"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Preparations for operation of Wendelstein 7-X now in full swing", "date": "2015-04-02", "content": "Preparations for operation of the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device at Greifswald are in full swing: A decisive stage is cooling the superconducting magnet coils, which will later generate the magnetic cage for the hot plasma.

With discharges lasting up to 30 minutes, it should demonstrate its significant property, its ability to operate continuously. A ring of 50 superconducting coils, some 3.5 metres high, is the key part of the device. Cooled with liquid helium to the superconducting temperature, not far from absolute zero, once switched on, they consume very little energy. Their special shapes are the result of refined optimisation calculations: their task is to create a particularly stable, thermally insulating magnetic cage for the plasma. To be able to change the magnetic field, a second set of 20 planar, superconducting coils enclose the stellarator coils. The preparations for operation on Wendelstein 7-X have been running for a good year. One by one, the operation of each technical system is being tested. From the end of April 2015 it was the turn of the magnetic coils, the core piece of the device. All the coils had already been tested individually during manufacture. Investigated in particular was how the coils react to a so-called quench - the hardest test, that a superconductor must withstand: the coil suddenly loses its superconducting properties and becomes a normal conductor. With the tests, it was confirmed that the coils withstand the high level of stress undamaged and, once cooled again, are superconducting as well as before. During the operational preparations, it was now a question of the behaviour of the magnetic coils when assembled together: the superconducting electromagnets were first tested under current in groups. A start was made with the planar coils of type A, the type B coils followed and then - from May 2015 - the five different types of stellarator coils in turn: Cooled to 4 Kelvin, i.e. minus 269 degrees Celsius, the individual coil circuits were first tried out at a low current of 500 Ampere and the quench detection system was adjusted. The current was then increased in steps to as much as 12.8 kiloampere, depending on the coil type. In pulses lasting up to four hours, the cryogenic system was also tested and the many valves that steer the various cooling circuits were adjusted. The sensitive current leads between warm and supercooled areas were also tested and adjusted. In addition, the coils were subjected to a simulated quench to test whether the automatic detection system was triggered. Also to be recorded and compared with planed values were the changes in shape of the coils and the mechanical stresses in the housings induced by the magnetic forces of the coils. Everything agrees well with the calculations\", Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, department head of \"Wendelstein 7-X Operation\" was able to state on 17th June. The successful testing in individual groups was followed - with the same procedure - by the test of the complete set of coils. Now, when the current was switched on, all 70 coils exerted their magnetic forces on one another. This was the first time that all coils together were supplied with current up to the ultimate required value of 12.8 kiloampere. \"The complete set of coils has withstood all technical tests\", summed up Dr. Bosch on 6th July the comprehensive series of tests: \"This assures the required functionality of the primary components of the system. We can now take up the challenge of the next major step, the measuring out of the magnetic surfaces.\" This will test whether the coils produce the plasma cage in the desired form and shape.

The measurements, which were much anticipated at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, show: The superconducting magnetic coils, whose technical tests were completed only last week, are producing the required magnetic field. The magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, has a configuration which is in line with the calculations of the physicists. This is an essential milestone in the operational preparations that are currently under way. Later this year, Wendelstein 7-X should produce its first plasma. Although Wendelstein 7-X is not yet in operation, the experiment is already providing the first scientific results: the magnetic field meets the precise requirements for the confinement of the high- temperature fusion plasma. This is demonstrated by the first measurements of the field structure: \"We've got nice closed flux surfaces\", Prof. Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen, the IPP Division Head responsible for this task was pleased to announce. How do you build a magnetic cage for the plasma? The fusion researchers make use of the fact that the charged plasma particles - ions and electrons - are kept on narrow spiral tracks around magnetic field lines by electromagnetic forces. As a result of a suitably formed field, the fast particles - as if guided on tracks - are kept away from the walls of the plasma vessel. To achieve a closed cage, the field lines in the centre of the circular plasma vessel must span closed, nested circular surfaces - like the growth rings inside a tree trunk. This prevents field lines pointing outwards, which would direct the plasma particles against the walls and make it impossible to achieve the high plasma temperatures required. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" reports Dr. Matthias Otte, who is responsible for the measurement process: \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations\". The flux surface diagnostics enables the structure of the field to be precisely measured. For this purpose, a thin electron beam is injected and moves along a field line in circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. It leaves behind a tracer, which is created by collision of the electrons with residual gas in the vessel. If, in addition, a fluorescent rod is moved through the vessel cross section, light spots are created when the electron beam hits the rod. In the camera recording, the entire cross section of the magnetic field gradually becomes visible. During a single measurement that lasts around 60 seconds, the electron beam circulates many times on \"its\" field line in the circular plasma vessel and thereby covers a distance of several kilometres. The spiral field line guides it after each circulation slightly offset through the plane through which the rod is moved. The image of the field cross section gradually forms from the light points on the rod. And indeed: in dotted lines the required nested flux surfaces are shown. \"Following the lengthy assembly time, we are now very pleased with the excellent measurement results\", says Professor Sunn Pedersen: \"The flux surfaces look just how we wanted them to appear.\"", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3897638/07_15"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Magnet tests on Wendelstein 7-X successfully completed", "date": "2015-07-07", "content": "With the successful completion of the testing of all seventy magnetic coils, the functionality of the key technological components for the Wendelstein 7-X fusion experiment is assured.

From the end of April 2015 it was the turn of the magnetic coils, the core piece of the device. All the coils had already been tested individually during manufacture. Investigated in particular was how the coils react to a so-called quench - the hardest test, that a superconductor must withstand: the coil suddenly loses its superconducting properties and becomes a normal conductor. With the tests, it was confirmed that the coils withstand the high level of stress undamaged and, once cooled again, are superconducting as well as before. During the operational preparations, it was now a question of the behaviour of the magnetic coils when assembled together: the superconducting electromagnets were first tested under current in groups. A start was made with the planar coils of type A, the type B coils followed and then - from May 2015 - the five different types of stellarator coils in turn: Cooled to 4 Kelvin, i.e. minus 269 degrees Celsius, the individual coil circuits were first tried out at a low current of 500 Ampere and the quench detection system was adjusted. The current was then increased in steps to as much as 12.8 kiloampere, depending on the coil type. In pulses lasting up to four hours, the cryogenic system was also tested and the many valves that steer the various cooling circuits were adjusted. The sensitive current leads between warm and supercooled areas were also tested and adjusted. In addition, the coils were subjected to a simulated quench to test whether the automatic detection system was triggered. Also to be recorded and compared with planed values were the changes in shape of the coils and the mechanical stresses in the housings induced by the magnetic forces of the coils. Everything agrees well with the calculations\", Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, department head of \"Wendelstein 7-X Operation\" was able to state on 17th June. The successful testing in individual groups was followed - with the same procedure - by the test of the complete set of coils. Now, when the current was switched on, all 70 coils exerted their magnetic forces on one another. This was the first time that all coils together were supplied with current up to the ultimate required value of 12.8 kiloampere. \"The complete set of coils has withstood all technical tests\", summed up Dr. Bosch on 6th July the comprehensive series of tests: \"This assures the required functionality of the primary components of the system. We can now take up the challenge of the next major step, the measuring out of the magnetic surfaces.\" This will test whether the coils produce the plasma cage in the desired form and shape. Later this year, Wendelstein 7-X should produce its first plasma.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3895159/06_15"}, {"title": "Initial testing of the Wendelstein 7-X magnetic field - it's spot on!", "date": "2015-07-16", "content": "Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed sooner than planned. The measurements, which were much anticipated at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, show: The superconducting magnetic coils, whose technical tests were completed only last week, are producing the required magnetic field. The magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, has a configuration which is in line with the calculations of the physicists. This is an essential milestone in the operational preparations that are currently under way. Later this year, Wendelstein 7-X should produce its first plasma. Although Wendelstein 7-X is not yet in operation, the experiment is already providing the first scientific results: the magnetic field meets the precise requirements for the confinement of the high- temperature fusion plasma. This is demonstrated by the first measurements of the field structure: \"We've got nice closed flux surfaces\", Prof. Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen, the IPP Division Head responsible for this task was pleased to announce. How do you build a magnetic cage for the plasma? The fusion researchers make use of the fact that the charged plasma particles - ions and electrons - are kept on narrow spiral tracks around magnetic field lines by electromagnetic forces. As a result of a suitably formed field, the fast particles - as if guided on tracks - are kept away from the walls of the plasma vessel. To achieve a closed cage, the field lines in the centre of the circular plasma vessel must span closed, nested circular surfaces - like the growth rings inside a tree trunk. This prevents field lines pointing outwards, which would direct the plasma particles against the walls and make it impossible to achieve the high plasma temperatures required. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" reports Dr. Matthias Otte, who is responsible for the measurement process: \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations\". The flux surface diagnostics enables the structure of the field to be precisely measured. For this purpose, a thin electron beam is injected and moves along a field line in circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. It leaves behind a tracer, which is created by collision of the electrons with residual gas in the vessel. If, in addition, a fluorescent rod is moved through the vessel cross section, light spots are created when the electron beam hits the rod. In the camera recording, the entire cross section of the magnetic field gradually becomes visible. During a single measurement that lasts around 60 seconds, the electron beam circulates many times on \"its\" field line in the circular plasma vessel and thereby covers a distance of several kilometres. The spiral field line guides it after each circulation slightly offset through the plane through which the rod is moved. The image of the field cross section gradually forms from the light points on the rod. And indeed: in dotted lines the required nested flux surfaces are shown. \"Following the lengthy assembly time, we are now very pleased with the excellent measurement results\", says Professor Sunn Pedersen: \"The flux surfaces look just how we wanted them to appear.\"", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3897638/07_15"}, {"title": "Wendelstein 7-x stellarator puts new twist on nuclear fusion power", "date": "2015-10-25", "content": "In a large complex located at Greifswald in the north-east corner of Germany, sits a new and unusual nuclear fusion reactor awaiting a few final tests before being powered-up for the very first time. Dubbed the Wendelstein 7-x fusion stellarator, it has been more than 15 years in the making and is claimed to be so magnetically efficient that it will be able to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its enormous magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If successful, this new reactor may help realize the long-held goal of continuous operation essential for the success of nuclear fusion power generation. Created by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) and designed with the aid of a supercomputer, the Wendelstein 7-x is the first large-scale optimized stellarator of its type ever to be commissioned. With a name like something out of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and a containment vessel that literally provides a new twist on the doughnut shape we see in standard tokamak fusion reactors, the quirky stellarator design aims to provide an inherently more stable environment for plasma and a more promising route for nuclear fusion research in general. Initially an American design conceived by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University in 1951, the stellarator was deemed too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century, and the more easily constructed toroid of the tokamak won out as the standard model for fusion research. Though some stellarators have been constructed over the course of time - notably the predecessor to this latest iteration known as the Wendelstein 7-AS (Advanced Stellarator) - the calculations required to ensure ultimate plasma containment and control have only become possible with the advent of supercomputers. As such, algorithms specifically created to fuse theory and practice have now been applied to the design of the Wendelstein 7-x, and its designers firmly believe that this latest version will have the stability required to be the precursor machine to full-blown, continuous nuclear fusion power generation. For the eventual success of nuclear fusion power (essentially where two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, are subject to such energy that the strong nuclear force is overcome and they fuse to form helium and release copious amounts of neutron energy), stability is essential. This is because the enormous pressures and temperatures (around 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million \u00b0F)) used to create the plasma, and then accelerate the resulting ion and electron soup around the containment vessel, means that any instability in the magnetic containment field or the pressure vessel itself will result in degradation and ultimately the failure of the process. To achieve a more stable environment, the stellarator eschews the method of inducing current through the plasma to drive electrons and ions around the inside of the vessel as found in tokamak designs, instead relying entirely on external magnetic fields to move the particles along. In this way, stellarator designs are basically immune to the sudden and unexpected disruptions of plasma and the enormous - and often destructive - magnetic field collapses that sometimes occur in tokamaks. As such, a stellarator reactor is able to hold the plasma in a containment field that twists through a set of magnetic coils to continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. This is because, in a normal tokamak, with its doughnut-shaped containment vessel and electromagnet windings that loop through the center of the toroid and around the outside, the magnetic field is stronger in the center than it is on the outer side. This means that plasma contained in a tokamak tends to drift to the outer walls where it then collapses. The stellarator, on the other hand, avoids this situation by twisting the entire containment vessel into a shape that constantly forces the plasma stream into the center of the reactor vessel as it continuously encounters magnetic fields in opposing positions along its entire length. The advantages of the stellarator over the tokamak come at a cost, however, as the many twists and turns that give the stellarator an advantage in magnetic containment also mean that many particles can simply be lost as they veer off course following the path of the containment vessel itself. To help avoid this, a great many more magnetic coils are required for the stellarator and must be set up at very close intervals around the structure and super-cooled with liquid helium for maximum efficiency. In the case of the Wendelstein 7-x, the weight of the 50, 3.5-meter-tall (11.5-ft) non-planar super-conducting electromagnets alone is around 425 tonnes (468 tons) and their placement makes construction difficult and their assembly fraught with problems. Not to mention the fact that piping around vast quantities of liquid helium to ensure that the electromagnets superconduct at temperatures close to absolute zero makes the Wendelstein 7-x a plumber's nightmare, and a tricky addition to an already difficult balancing act. As such, the physical design of the stellarator itself requires access ports for fuel ingress and egress, along with a myriad other entry points for instruments, sensors, and all the other necessary paraphernalia necessary to monitor the enormous pressures, voltages, and temperatures that it will be subject to in operation. Despite all of these problems, tests on the completed stellarator to maintain the sub-millimeter accuracy for the plasma path are progressing and show promise. In one recent test, an electron beam was injected into the stellarator and progressed along a predetermined field line in the circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. As it moved through the machine, the beam created a tracer in its wake created by collisions with electrons contained in the residual gas in the vessel. Meanwhile, as the electron beam constantly circulated through the system, a fluorescent rod was pushed transversely through the vessel in cross section, and when the electron beam struck the rod, visible spots of light were created and the results recorded with a camera. In this way, the whole cross section of the magnetic field was gradually made visible. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" said Dr. Matthias Otte, the man responsible for this measurement process. \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations.\" Whilst in itself just another stepping stone toward the ultimate goal of practical fusion energy, the IPP stellarator is an important juncture in the field. With tokamak-based reactors still requiring more energy in than they actually produce, both the scientific and general public alike have grown wary of the long-held promises surrounding nuclear fusion. And, though many bodies, such as the University of Washington, Lockheed-Martin, and MIT, claim to be \"close\" to producing a working, sustainable, self-powering machine, nuclear fusion still remains a pipe dream. This is where IPP's proving of the technology over the coming months leading to a full-blown commissioning of the machine may well provide the nexus between theory and practicality and, if not deliver on the promise of boundless energy, at least provide a proof of concept and renew flagging interest in a field that may, one day, solve all of our energy needs. With approval to continue from nuclear regulators in Germany expected by the end of this month, the Wendelstein 7-x stellarator is slated for its first fully-operational tests in November this year. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and over one million man-hours of work committed so far, the hopes of Europe's future being a nuclear fusion-powered one may well rest on the ability of this machine to perform as expected.

Dubbed Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), the reactor can continuously contain super-hot plasma for more than 30 minutes at a time. Researchers claim the unusual design, which is housed in a huge lab in Greifswald, Germany, could finally help make fusion power a reality. Containing super-hot plasma for long periods has been the Holy Grail for reactor designs, and could help scientists provide an inexhaustible source of power. Fusion reactors, such as the W7-X, work by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms - deuterium and tritium - and injecting that gas into a containment vessel. Scientist then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms, forming what is described as an ion plasma, which releases huge amounts of energy. Strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the walls; these are produced by superconducting coils surrounding the vessel, and by an electrical current driven through the plasma. The most common design for a reactor is something known as a Tokamak, which is a hollow metal chamber in the shape of a donut. The fuel is heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million\u00b0C, forming a hot plasma. While the Tokamak design is ideal for containing this plasma, it poses some safety risks, for instance, if the current fails or there's a magnetic disruption. These disruptions can unleash magnetic forces powerful enough to damage the reactor. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute say the W7-X is a more practical option and can overcome the safety problems of a Tokamak reactor, according to an in-depth report in Science. 'Tokamak people are waiting to see what happens. There's an excitement around the world about W7-X,' engineer David Anderson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison told Science. In tokamaks, two sets of magnets are used to contain the plasma; an external set surrounding the vacuum chamber and an internal transformer that drives current in the plasma. This causes the magnetic field to be stronger in the centre than it is on the outer side. As a result, plasma contained in a tokamak can moves to the outer walls where it then collapses. In stellarators, plasma is contained by external magnetic coils which create twisted field lines around the inside of the vacuum chamber, according to Science. As such, it overcomes can continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. Its key component is a ring 50 superconducting magnetic coils approximately 3.5 metres in height. In total the device is 16-meters-wide. The stellarator design was first thought up in 1951 by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University. But at the time, it was thought to be too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century. Now using supercomputers and new materials, researchers believe they can finally make Spitzer's vision a reality. 'We all know the trend of global development, the hunger for energy of emerging economies and emerging countries,' said Professor Johanna Wanka, Federal Minister for Education and Research. 'So when we talk about energy, we need research that keeps all options open. And one of these options is nuclear fusion. 'Wendelstein 7-X is an important step forward allowing us to better evaluate the 'fusion option.' The machine took 1.1 million hours to assemble, using what has been described as one of the world's most complex engineering models. Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed in June - much sooner than expected. The test revealed that the magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, was working as scientists predicted. The device is currently awaiting regulatory approval for a startup in November.

Currently running in the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald are the preparations for operation of Wendelstein 7-X. Later this year, the device should produce its first plasma. The objective of fusion research is to develop a power source that is friendly to climate and the environment and, similarly to the sun, harvests energy from the fusion of atomic nuclei. To light the fusion fire in a future power station, the fuel - a hydrogen plasma - must be confined in magnetic fields and heated to a temperature of over 100 million degrees. Wendelstein 7-X, which, once complete, will be the largest stellarator-type fusion device in the world, will not produce energy but will investigate the suitability of this type for a power station. With discharges lasting up to 30 minutes, it should demonstrate its significant property, its ability to operate continuously. A ring of 50 superconducting coils, some 3.5 metres high, is the key part of the device. Cooled with liquid helium to the superconducting temperature, not far from absolute zero, once switched on, they consume very little energy. Their special shapes are the result of refined optimisation calculations: their task is to create a particularly stable, thermally insulating magnetic cage for the plasma.

This causes the magnetic field to be stronger in the centre than it is on the outer side. As a result, plasma contained in a tokamak can moves to the outer walls where it then collapses. In stellarators, plasma is contained by external magnetic coils which create twisted field lines around the inside of the vacuum chamber, according to Science. As such, it overcomes can continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. Its key component is a ring 50 superconducting magnetic coils approximately 3.5 metres in height. In total the device is 16-meters-wide. The stellarator design was first thought up in 1951 by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University. But at the time, it was thought to be too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century. Now using supercomputers and new materials, researchers believe they can finally make Spitzer's vision a reality. 'We all know the trend of global development, the hunger for energy of emerging economies and emerging countries,' said Professor Johanna Wanka, Federal Minister for Education and Research. 'So when we talk about energy, we need research that keeps all options open. And one of these options is nuclear fusion. 'Wendelstein 7-X is an important step forward allowing us to better evaluate the 'fusion option.' The machine took 1.1 million hours to assemble, using what has been described as one of the world's most complex engineering models. Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed in June - much sooner than expected. The test revealed that the magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, was working as scientists predicted. The device is currently awaiting regulatory approval for a startup in November.

According to Gizmodo, the W7-X takes the stellarator design to a whole new scale, featuring a 16-meter-wide ring covered in 250 access ports that contain 50 6-ton magnetic coils.

The superconducting coils, exceeding the height of a man, will create the magnetic field that confines the fusion plasma at a temperature of many million degrees. Currently running in the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald are the preparations for operation of Wendelstein 7-X. Later this year, the device should produce its first plasma. The objective of fusion research is to develop a power source that is friendly to climate and the environment and, similarly to the sun, harvests energy from the fusion of atomic nuclei. To light the fusion fire in a future power station, the fuel - a hydrogen plasma - must be confined in magnetic fields and heated to a temperature of over 100 million degrees. Wendelstein 7-X, which, once complete, will be the largest stellarator-type fusion device in the world, will not produce energy but will investigate the suitability of this type for a power station. With discharges lasting up to 30 minutes, it should demonstrate its significant property, its ability to operate continuously. A ring of 50 superconducting coils, some 3.5 metres high, is the key part of the device. Cooled with liquid helium to the superconducting temperature, not far from absolute zero, once switched on, they consume very little energy. Their special shapes are the result of refined optimisation calculations: their task is to create a particularly stable, thermally insulating magnetic cage for the plasma. To be able to change the magnetic field, a second set of 20 planar, superconducting coils enclose the stellarator coils. The preparations for operation on Wendelstein 7-X have been running for a good year. One by one, the operation of each technical system is being tested. From the end of April 2015 it was the turn of the magnetic coils, the core piece of the device. All the coils had already been tested individually during manufacture. Investigated in particular was how the coils react to a so-called quench - the hardest test, that a superconductor must withstand: the coil suddenly loses its superconducting properties and becomes a normal conductor. With the tests, it was confirmed that the coils withstand the high level of stress undamaged and, once cooled again, are superconducting as well as before. During the operational preparations, it was now a question of the behaviour of the magnetic coils when assembled together: the superconducting electromagnets were first tested under current in groups. A start was made with the planar coils of type A, the type B coils followed and then - from May 2015 - the five different types of stellarator coils in turn: Cooled to 4 Kelvin, i.e. minus 269 degrees Celsius, the individual coil circuits were first tried out at a low current of 500 Ampere and the quench detection system was adjusted. The current was then increased in steps to as much as 12.8 kiloampere, depending on the coil type. In pulses lasting up to four hours, the cryogenic system was also tested and the many valves that steer the various cooling circuits were adjusted. The sensitive current leads between warm and supercooled areas were also tested and adjusted. In addition, the coils were subjected to a simulated quench to test whether the automatic detection system was triggered. Also to be recorded and compared with planed values were the changes in shape of the coils and the mechanical stresses in the housings induced by the magnetic forces of the coils. Everything agrees well with the calculations\", Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, department head of \"Wendelstein 7-X Operation\" was able to state on 17th June. The successful testing in individual groups was followed - with the same procedure - by the test of the complete set of coils. Now, when the current was switched on, all 70 coils exerted their magnetic forces on one another. This was the first time that all coils together were supplied with current up to the ultimate required value of 12.8 kiloampere. \"The complete set of coils has withstood all technical tests\", summed up Dr. Bosch on 6th July the comprehensive series of tests: \"This assures the required functionality of the primary components of the system. We can now take up the challenge of the next major step, the measuring out of the magnetic surfaces.\" This will test whether the coils produce the plasma cage in the desired form and shape. Later this year, Wendelstein 7-X should produce its first plasma.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3895159/06_15"}, {"title": "Initial testing of the Wendelstein 7-X magnetic field - it's spot on!", "date": "2015-07-16", "content": "Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed sooner than planned. The measurements, which were much anticipated at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, show: The superconducting magnetic coils, whose technical tests were completed only last week, are producing the required magnetic field. The magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, has a configuration which is in line with the calculations of the physicists. This is an essential milestone in the operational preparations that are currently under way. Later this year, Wendelstein 7-X should produce its first plasma. Although Wendelstein 7-X is not yet in operation, the experiment is already providing the first scientific results: the magnetic field meets the precise requirements for the confinement of the high- temperature fusion plasma. This is demonstrated by the first measurements of the field structure: \"We've got nice closed flux surfaces\", Prof. Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen, the IPP Division Head responsible for this task was pleased to announce. How do you build a magnetic cage for the plasma? The fusion researchers make use of the fact that the charged plasma particles - ions and electrons - are kept on narrow spiral tracks around magnetic field lines by electromagnetic forces. As a result of a suitably formed field, the fast particles - as if guided on tracks - are kept away from the walls of the plasma vessel. To achieve a closed cage, the field lines in the centre of the circular plasma vessel must span closed, nested circular surfaces - like the growth rings inside a tree trunk. This prevents field lines pointing outwards, which would direct the plasma particles against the walls and make it impossible to achieve the high plasma temperatures required. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" reports Dr. Matthias Otte, who is responsible for the measurement process: \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations\". The flux surface diagnostics enables the structure of the field to be precisely measured. For this purpose, a thin electron beam is injected and moves along a field line in circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. It leaves behind a tracer, which is created by collision of the electrons with residual gas in the vessel. If, in addition, a fluorescent rod is moved through the vessel cross section, light spots are created when the electron beam hits the rod. In the camera recording, the entire cross section of the magnetic field gradually becomes visible. During a single measurement that lasts around 60 seconds, the electron beam circulates many times on \"its\" field line in the circular plasma vessel and thereby covers a distance of several kilometres. The spiral field line guides it after each circulation slightly offset through the plane through which the rod is moved. The image of the field cross section gradually forms from the light points on the rod. And indeed: in dotted lines the required nested flux surfaces are shown. \"Following the lengthy assembly time, we are now very pleased with the excellent measurement results\", says Professor Sunn Pedersen: \"The flux surfaces look just how we wanted them to appear.\"", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3897638/07_15"}, {"title": "Wendelstein 7-x stellarator puts new twist on nuclear fusion power", "date": "2015-10-25", "content": "In a large complex located at Greifswald in the north-east corner of Germany, sits a new and unusual nuclear fusion reactor awaiting a few final tests before being powered-up for the very first time. Dubbed the Wendelstein 7-x fusion stellarator, it has been more than 15 years in the making and is claimed to be so magnetically efficient that it will be able to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its enormous magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If successful, this new reactor may help realize the long-held goal of continuous operation essential for the success of nuclear fusion power generation. Created by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) and designed with the aid of a supercomputer, the Wendelstein 7-x is the first large-scale optimized stellarator of its type ever to be commissioned. With a name like something out of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and a containment vessel that literally provides a new twist on the doughnut shape we see in standard tokamak fusion reactors, the quirky stellarator design aims to provide an inherently more stable environment for plasma and a more promising route for nuclear fusion research in general. Initially an American design conceived by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University in 1951, the stellarator was deemed too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century, and the more easily constructed toroid of the tokamak won out as the standard model for fusion research. Though some stellarators have been constructed over the course of time - notably the predecessor to this latest iteration known as the Wendelstein 7-AS (Advanced Stellarator) - the calculations required to ensure ultimate plasma containment and control have only become possible with the advent of supercomputers. As such, algorithms specifically created to fuse theory and practice have now been applied to the design of the Wendelstein 7-x, and its designers firmly believe that this latest version will have the stability required to be the precursor machine to full-blown, continuous nuclear fusion power generation. For the eventual success of nuclear fusion power (essentially where two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, are subject to such energy that the strong nuclear force is overcome and they fuse to form helium and release copious amounts of neutron energy), stability is essential. This is because the enormous pressures and temperatures (around 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million \u00b0F)) used to create the plasma, and then accelerate the resulting ion and electron soup around the containment vessel, means that any instability in the magnetic containment field or the pressure vessel itself will result in degradation and ultimately the failure of the process. To achieve a more stable environment, the stellarator eschews the method of inducing current through the plasma to drive electrons and ions around the inside of the vessel as found in tokamak designs, instead relying entirely on external magnetic fields to move the particles along. In this way, stellarator designs are basically immune to the sudden and unexpected disruptions of plasma and the enormous - and often destructive - magnetic field collapses that sometimes occur in tokamaks. As such, a stellarator reactor is able to hold the plasma in a containment field that twists through a set of magnetic coils to continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. This is because, in a normal tokamak, with its doughnut-shaped containment vessel and electromagnet windings that loop through the center of the toroid and around the outside, the magnetic field is stronger in the center than it is on the outer side. This means that plasma contained in a tokamak tends to drift to the outer walls where it then collapses. The stellarator, on the other hand, avoids this situation by twisting the entire containment vessel into a shape that constantly forces the plasma stream into the center of the reactor vessel as it continuously encounters magnetic fields in opposing positions along its entire length. The advantages of the stellarator over the tokamak come at a cost, however, as the many twists and turns that give the stellarator an advantage in magnetic containment also mean that many particles can simply be lost as they veer off course following the path of the containment vessel itself. To help avoid this, a great many more magnetic coils are required for the stellarator and must be set up at very close intervals around the structure and super-cooled with liquid helium for maximum efficiency. In the case of the Wendelstein 7-x, the weight of the 50, 3.5-meter-tall (11.5-ft) non-planar super-conducting electromagnets alone is around 425 tonnes (468 tons) and their placement makes construction difficult and their assembly fraught with problems. Not to mention the fact that piping around vast quantities of liquid helium to ensure that the electromagnets superconduct at temperatures close to absolute zero makes the Wendelstein 7-x a plumber's nightmare, and a tricky addition to an already difficult balancing act. As such, the physical design of the stellarator itself requires access ports for fuel ingress and egress, along with a myriad other entry points for instruments, sensors, and all the other necessary paraphernalia necessary to monitor the enormous pressures, voltages, and temperatures that it will be subject to in operation. Despite all of these problems, tests on the completed stellarator to maintain the sub-millimeter accuracy for the plasma path are progressing and show promise. In one recent test, an electron beam was injected into the stellarator and progressed along a predetermined field line in the circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. As it moved through the machine, the beam created a tracer in its wake created by collisions with electrons contained in the residual gas in the vessel. Meanwhile, as the electron beam constantly circulated through the system, a fluorescent rod was pushed transversely through the vessel in cross section, and when the electron beam struck the rod, visible spots of light were created and the results recorded with a camera. In this way, the whole cross section of the magnetic field was gradually made visible. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" said Dr. Matthias Otte, the man responsible for this measurement process. \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations.\" Whilst in itself just another stepping stone toward the ultimate goal of practical fusion energy, the IPP stellarator is an important juncture in the field. With tokamak-based reactors still requiring more energy in than they actually produce, both the scientific and general public alike have grown wary of the long-held promises surrounding nuclear fusion. And, though many bodies, such as the University of Washington, Lockheed-Martin, and MIT, claim to be \"close\" to producing a working, sustainable, self-powering machine, nuclear fusion still remains a pipe dream. This is where IPP's proving of the technology over the coming months leading to a full-blown commissioning of the machine may well provide the nexus between theory and practicality and, if not deliver on the promise of boundless energy, at least provide a proof of concept and renew flagging interest in a field that may, one day, solve all of our energy needs. With approval to continue from nuclear regulators in Germany expected by the end of this month, the Wendelstein 7-x stellarator is slated for its first fully-operational tests in November this year. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and over one million man-hours of work committed so far, the hopes of Europe's future being a nuclear fusion-powered one may well rest on the ability of this machine to perform as expected.

Researchers claim the unusual design, which is housed in a huge lab in Greifswald, Germany, could finally help make fusion power a reality. Containing super-hot plasma for long periods has been the Holy Grail for reactor designs, and could help scientists provide an inexhaustible source of power. Fusion reactors, such as the W7-X, work by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms - deuterium and tritium - and injecting that gas into a containment vessel. Scientist then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms, forming what is described as an ion plasma, which releases huge amounts of energy. Strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the walls; these are produced by superconducting coils surrounding the vessel, and by an electrical current driven through the plasma. The most common design for a reactor is something known as a Tokamak, which is a hollow metal chamber in the shape of a donut. The fuel is heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million\u00b0C, forming a hot plasma. While the Tokamak design is ideal for containing this plasma, it poses some safety risks, for instance, if the current fails or there's a magnetic disruption. These disruptions can unleash magnetic forces powerful enough to damage the reactor. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute say the W7-X is a more practical option and can overcome the safety problems of a Tokamak reactor, according to an in-depth report in Science.

Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device, will investigate the suitability of this type of device for a power station. Following nine years of construction work and more than a million assembly hours, the main assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X was completed in April 2014.

Two teams of PSFC researchers are collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X device, the world's largest fusion experiment designed in the stellarator line of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The PSFC has significant experience with a different configuration of magnetic confinement, having spent decades designing and running the Alcator series of high-magnetic-field tokamak experiments - the Alcator C-Mod device, located on campus, is the latest in that series. There are many similarities between the two designs, however. Both the tokamak and the stellarator seek to harness the energy released from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to provide clean and safe electrical power. Both use helical (spiraling) magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma fuel in a donut-shaped chamber. In a tokamak, this field is generated both by external electromagnets and a large electrical current that is driven in the plasma itself. Driving and sustaining this plasma current, and its impact on stability and transport of energy and particles, is a major focus of the research at MIT. The stellarator concept takes a different approach. First invented by the noted astrophysicist and fusion pioneer Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1950, the stellarator provides the entire helical field through external electromagnets formed in highly complex and twisted shapes. Although the assembly of a modern stellarator like W7-X presents many engineering challenges, this approach has significant operational advantages. Because there is no need to drive a current in the plasma, the configuration is more readily extrapolated to steady-state, a necessity for economic operation of a fusion power plant. The magnetic field geometry of Wendelstein 7-X has been optimized using super-computer simulations of particle orbits. Consistent with its steady-state mission, W7-X has super-conducting coils and is designed to create and sustain hot plasma for up to 30 minutes. The immediate goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that the loss of particles can be kept small so that high temperatures can be achieved. In early phases of the experiment up to 10 megawatts of microwave power will be used to heat the plasma. Later, as much as 8 megawatts of neutral-beam power will be added, after water-cooled armor is installed to handle the exhaust heat. W7-X expects to produce plasmas with fusion-grade densities and temperatures 60-130 million degrees K. Future experiments at W7-X will address the role that plasma turbulence plays in limiting overall performance, and PSFC researchers are working with the W7-X group to investigate this. One PSFC team - principal research scientist Jim Terry and postdoctoral researcher Seung-Gyou Baek - will develop a fast camera system for viewing light emitted from the plasma, and will make important measurements of turbulence near the edge of the plasma. The other team - physics professor Miklos Porkolab and staff scientist Eric Edlund - will develop a specialized interferometer for imaging density fluctuations deep in the hot plasma core. The issues surrounding turbulence are important in stellarators, as they are in tokamaks, since turbulence moves heat and particles across the confining magnetic field faster than would otherwise occur. Both teams expect to have first measurements during the 2017 experimental campaign.

The machine is called the Wendelstein 7-X, or W7-X for short. It's a type of nuclear-fusion machine called a stellarator and is the largest, most sophisticated of its kind. Nuclear fusion could prove to be a clean, inexhaustible energy source. But humans are still a ways from successfully building a reactor that could power a small town, let alone entire cities. But now, we're one step closer. On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics tweeted out a beautiful image of the machine's first plasma - a gas in which all the electrons have been stripped from their atoms, a task that requires tremendous amounts of energy and is critical to achieving nuclear fusion. The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control plasma. This is the first confirmation that the machine is performing as planned. Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics completed construction of the $1.1 billion W7-X. The black horse of nuclear reactors: Known in the plasma physics community as the black horse of reactors that use nuclear fusion, stellarators are notoriously difficult to build. The GIF below shows the many different layers of W7-X, which took 19 years to complete: From 2003 to 2007, the project suffered some major construction setbacks - including one of its contracted manufacturers going out of business - that nearly brought down the whole endeavor. Only a handful of stellarators have been attempted, and even fewer have been completed. By comparison, the more popular cousin to the stellarator, the tokamak, is in wider use. Over three dozen tokamaks are operational around the world, and more than 200 have been built throughout history. These machines are easier to construct and, in the past, have performed better as a nuclear reactor than stellarators. But tokamaks have a major flaw that W7-X is reportedly immune to, suggesting that Germany's latest monster machine could be a game changer. How a nuclear-fusion reactor works: The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control a blob of gas, called a plasma, that has been heated to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. At these blazing temperatures, the electrons are ripped from their atoms, forming ions. Normally the ions bounce off one another like bumper cars, but under these extreme conditions the repulsive forces are overcome. The ions are therefore able to collide and fuse together, which generates energy, and you have accomplished nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is different from what fuels today's nuclear reactors, which operate with energy from atoms that decay, or break apart, instead of fusing together. Nuclear fusion is the process that has been fueling our sun for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for another estimated 4 billion years. Once engineers have heated the gas in the reactor to the right temperature, they use super-chilled magnetic coils to generate powerful magnetic fields that contain and control the plasma. The W7-X, for example, houses 50 magnetic coils that each weigh 6 tons, shown in purple in the GIF below. The difference between tokamaks and stellarators: Tokamaks have for years been considered the most promising machine for producing energy in the way the sun does because the configuration of their magnetic coils contains a plasma that is better than that of currently operational stellarators.

Dubbed the Wendelstein 7-x fusion stellarator, it has been more than 15 years in the making and is claimed to be so magnetically efficient that it will be able to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its enormous magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If successful, this new reactor may help realize the long-held goal of continuous operation essential for the success of nuclear fusion power generation. Created by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) and designed with the aid of a supercomputer, the Wendelstein 7-x is the first large-scale optimized stellarator of its type ever to be commissioned. With a name like something out of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and a containment vessel that literally provides a new twist on the doughnut shape we see in standard tokamak fusion reactors, the quirky stellarator design aims to provide an inherently more stable environment for plasma and a more promising route for nuclear fusion research in general. Initially an American design conceived by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University in 1951, the stellarator was deemed too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century, and the more easily constructed toroid of the tokamak won out as the standard model for fusion research. Though some stellarators have been constructed over the course of time - notably the predecessor to this latest iteration known as the Wendelstein 7-AS (Advanced Stellarator) - the calculations required to ensure ultimate plasma containment and control have only become possible with the advent of supercomputers. As such, algorithms specifically created to fuse theory and practice have now been applied to the design of the Wendelstein 7-x, and its designers firmly believe that this latest version will have the stability required to be the precursor machine to full-blown, continuous nuclear fusion power generation. For the eventual success of nuclear fusion power (essentially where two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, are subject to such energy that the strong nuclear force is overcome and they fuse to form helium and release copious amounts of neutron energy), stability is essential. This is because the enormous pressures and temperatures (around 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million \u00b0F)) used to create the plasma, and then accelerate the resulting ion and electron soup around the containment vessel, means that any instability in the magnetic containment field or the pressure vessel itself will result in degradation and ultimately the failure of the process. To achieve a more stable environment, the stellarator eschews the method of inducing current through the plasma to drive electrons and ions around the inside of the vessel as found in tokamak designs, instead relying entirely on external magnetic fields to move the particles along. In this way, stellarator designs are basically immune to the sudden and unexpected disruptions of plasma and the enormous - and often destructive - magnetic field collapses that sometimes occur in tokamaks. As such, a stellarator reactor is able to hold the plasma in a containment field that twists through a set of magnetic coils to continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. This is because, in a normal tokamak, with its doughnut-shaped containment vessel and electromagnet windings that loop through the center of the toroid and around the outside, the magnetic field is stronger in the center than it is on the outer side. This means that plasma contained in a tokamak tends to drift to the outer walls where it then collapses. The stellarator, on the other hand, avoids this situation by twisting the entire containment vessel into a shape that constantly forces the plasma stream into the center of the reactor vessel as it continuously encounters magnetic fields in opposing positions along its entire length. The advantages of the stellarator over the tokamak come at a cost, however, as the many twists and turns that give the stellarator an advantage in magnetic containment also mean that many particles can simply be lost as they veer off course following the path of the containment vessel itself. To help avoid this, a great many more magnetic coils are required for the stellarator and must be set up at very close intervals around the structure and super-cooled with liquid helium for maximum efficiency. In the case of the Wendelstein 7-x, the weight of the 50, 3.5-meter-tall (11.5-ft) non-planar super-conducting electromagnets alone is around 425 tonnes (468 tons) and their placement makes construction difficult and their assembly fraught with problems. Not to mention the fact that piping around vast quantities of liquid helium to ensure that the electromagnets superconduct at temperatures close to absolute zero makes the Wendelstein 7-x a plumber's nightmare, and a tricky addition to an already difficult balancing act. As such, the physical design of the stellarator itself requires access ports for fuel ingress and egress, along with a myriad other entry points for instruments, sensors, and all the other necessary paraphernalia necessary to monitor the enormous pressures, voltages, and temperatures that it will be subject to in operation. Despite all of these problems, tests on the completed stellarator to maintain the sub-millimeter accuracy for the plasma path are progressing and show promise. In one recent test, an electron beam was injected into the stellarator and progressed along a predetermined field line in the circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. As it moved through the machine, the beam created a tracer in its wake created by collisions with electrons contained in the residual gas in the vessel. Meanwhile, as the electron beam constantly circulated through the system, a fluorescent rod was pushed transversely through the vessel in cross section, and when the electron beam struck the rod, visible spots of light were created and the results recorded with a camera. In this way, the whole cross section of the magnetic field was gradually made visible. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" said Dr. Matthias Otte, the man responsible for this measurement process. \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations.\" Whilst in itself just another stepping stone toward the ultimate goal of practical fusion energy, the IPP stellarator is an important juncture in the field. With tokamak-based reactors still requiring more energy in than they actually produce, both the scientific and general public alike have grown wary of the long-held promises surrounding nuclear fusion. And, though many bodies, such as the University of Washington, Lockheed-Martin, and MIT, claim to be \"close\" to producing a working, sustainable, self-powering machine, nuclear fusion still remains a pipe dream. This is where IPP's proving of the technology over the coming months leading to a full-blown commissioning of the machine may well provide the nexus between theory and practicality and, if not deliver on the promise of boundless energy, at least provide a proof of concept and renew flagging interest in a field that may, one day, solve all of our energy needs. With approval to continue from nuclear regulators in Germany expected by the end of this month, the Wendelstein 7-x stellarator is slated for its first fully-operational tests in November this year. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and over one million man-hours of work committed so far, the hopes of Europe's future being a nuclear fusion-powered one may well rest on the ability of this machine to perform as expected.

Dubbed Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), the reactor can continuously contain super-hot plasma for more than 30 minutes at a time. Researchers claim the unusual design, which is housed in a huge lab in Greifswald, Germany, could finally help make fusion power a reality. Containing super-hot plasma for long periods has been the Holy Grail for reactor designs, and could help scientists provide an inexhaustible source of power. Fusion reactors, such as the W7-X, work by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms - deuterium and tritium - and injecting that gas into a containment vessel. Scientist then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms, forming what is described as an ion plasma, which releases huge amounts of energy. Strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the walls; these are produced by superconducting coils surrounding the vessel, and by an electrical current driven through the plasma. The most common design for a reactor is something known as a Tokamak, which is a hollow metal chamber in the shape of a donut. The fuel is heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million\u00b0C, forming a hot plasma. While the Tokamak design is ideal for containing this plasma, it poses some safety risks, for instance, if the current fails or there's a magnetic disruption. These disruptions can unleash magnetic forces powerful enough to damage the reactor. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute say the W7-X is a more practical option and can overcome the safety problems of a Tokamak reactor, according to an in-depth report in Science. 'Tokamak people are waiting to see what happens. There's an excitement around the world about W7-X,' engineer David Anderson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison told Science. In tokamaks, two sets of magnets are used to contain the plasma; an external set surrounding the vacuum chamber and an internal transformer that drives current in the plasma. This causes the magnetic field to be stronger in the centre than it is on the outer side. As a result, plasma contained in a tokamak can moves to the outer walls where it then collapses. In stellarators, plasma is contained by external magnetic coils which create twisted field lines around the inside of the vacuum chamber, according to Science. As such, it overcomes can continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. Its key component is a ring 50 superconducting magnetic coils approximately 3.5 metres in height. In total the device is 16-meters-wide. The stellarator design was first thought up in 1951 by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University. But at the time, it was thought to be too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century. Now using supercomputers and new materials, researchers believe they can finally make Spitzer's vision a reality. 'We all know the trend of global development, the hunger for energy of emerging economies and emerging countries,' said Professor Johanna Wanka, Federal Minister for Education and Research. 'So when we talk about energy, we need research that keeps all options open. And one of these options is nuclear fusion. 'Wendelstein 7-X is an important step forward allowing us to better evaluate the 'fusion option.' The machine took 1.1 million hours to assemble, using what has been described as one of the world's most complex engineering models. Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed in June - much sooner than expected. The test revealed that the magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, was working as scientists predicted. The device is currently awaiting regulatory approval for a startup in November. If the machine works, scientists believe it could herald a change in the direction for fusion power.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3290389/Stellarator-reactor-turned-time-Strange-twisted-design-finally-make-fusion-power-reality-say-scientists.html"}, {"title": "The world's largest nuclear fusion reactor is about to switch on", "date": "2015-11-10", "content": "It looks like a piece of technology straight out of science fiction, but the Wendelstein 7-X stellarton fusion reactor is totally factual - and it's set to switch online this month. Stellarator reactors such as the W7-X produce energy by using massive coiled superconductors to create powerful magnetic fields that contain hydrogen gas as it is heated to the point that its atoms fuse. According to Gizmodo, the W7-X takes the stellarator design to a whole new scale, featuring a 16-meter-wide ring covered in 250 access ports that contain 50 6-ton magnetic coils. At a cost of more than $1 billion, the W7X took a total of 19 years to build. According to Science News, the labor and cost that went into building the stellarator design could be worth it - as it has some significant advantages over the competing tokamak technology. \"Once started, stellarators naturally purr along in a steady state and they are not prone to the potentially metal-bending magnetic disruptions that plague tokamaks,\" writes Daniel Clery of Science News. The tokamaks are significantly simpler to build, but can only operate for short periods of time and are subject to major magnetic disruptions. All the blood, sweat and dollars put into the project will be tested later this month when Germany's nuclear regulatory body is set to give the go-ahead to start up the W7-X.

Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device, will investigate the suitability of this type of device for a power station. Following nine years of construction work and more than a million assembly hours, the main assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X was completed in April 2014. The operational preparations have been under way ever since. Each technical system was tested in turn, the vacuum in the vessels, the cooling system, the superconducting coils and the magnetic field they produce, the control system, as well as the heating devices and measuring instruments. On 10th December, the day had arrived: the operating team in the control room started up the magnetic field and initiated the computer-operated experiment control system. It fed around one milligram of helium gas into the evacuated plasma vessel, switched on the microwave heating for a short 1,3 megawatt pulse - and the first plasma could be observed by the installed cameras and measuring devices. \"We're starting with a plasma produced from the noble gas helium.

Two teams of PSFC researchers are collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X device, the world's largest fusion experiment designed in the stellarator line of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The PSFC has significant experience with a different configuration of magnetic confinement, having spent decades designing and running the Alcator series of high-magnetic-field tokamak experiments - the Alcator C-Mod device, located on campus, is the latest in that series. There are many similarities between the two designs, however. Both the tokamak and the stellarator seek to harness the energy released from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to provide clean and safe electrical power. Both use helical (spiraling) magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma fuel in a donut-shaped chamber. In a tokamak, this field is generated both by external electromagnets and a large electrical current that is driven in the plasma itself. Driving and sustaining this plasma current, and its impact on stability and transport of energy and particles, is a major focus of the research at MIT. The stellarator concept takes a different approach. First invented by the noted astrophysicist and fusion pioneer Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1950, the stellarator provides the entire helical field through external electromagnets formed in highly complex and twisted shapes. Although the assembly of a modern stellarator like W7-X presents many engineering challenges, this approach has significant operational advantages. Because there is no need to drive a current in the plasma, the configuration is more readily extrapolated to steady-state, a necessity for economic operation of a fusion power plant. The magnetic field geometry of Wendelstein 7-X has been optimized using super-computer simulations of particle orbits. Consistent with its steady-state mission, W7-X has super-conducting coils and is designed to create and sustain hot plasma for up to 30 minutes. The immediate goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that the loss of particles can be kept small so that high temperatures can be achieved. In early phases of the experiment up to 10 megawatts of microwave power will be used to heat the plasma. Later, as much as 8 megawatts of neutral-beam power will be added, after water-cooled armor is installed to handle the exhaust heat. W7-X expects to produce plasmas with fusion-grade densities and temperatures 60-130 million degrees K. Future experiments at W7-X will address the role that plasma turbulence plays in limiting overall performance, and PSFC researchers are working with the W7-X group to investigate this. One PSFC team - principal research scientist Jim Terry and postdoctoral researcher Seung-Gyou Baek - will develop a fast camera system for viewing light emitted from the plasma, and will make important measurements of turbulence near the edge of the plasma. The other team - physics professor Miklos Porkolab and staff scientist Eric Edlund - will develop a specialized interferometer for imaging density fluctuations deep in the hot plasma core. The issues surrounding turbulence are important in stellarators, as they are in tokamaks, since turbulence moves heat and particles across the confining magnetic field faster than would otherwise occur. Both teams expect to have first measurements during the 2017 experimental campaign.

The machine is called the Wendelstein 7-X, or W7-X for short. It's a type of nuclear-fusion machine called a stellarator and is the largest, most sophisticated of its kind. Nuclear fusion could prove to be a clean, inexhaustible energy source. But humans are still a ways from successfully building a reactor that could power a small town, let alone entire cities. But now, we're one step closer. On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics tweeted out a beautiful image of the machine's first plasma - a gas in which all the electrons have been stripped from their atoms, a task that requires tremendous amounts of energy and is critical to achieving nuclear fusion. The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control plasma. This is the first confirmation that the machine is performing as planned. Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics completed construction of the $1.1 billion W7-X. The black horse of nuclear reactors: Known in the plasma physics community as the black horse of reactors that use nuclear fusion, stellarators are notoriously difficult to build. The GIF below shows the many different layers of W7-X, which took 19 years to complete: From 2003 to 2007, the project suffered some major construction setbacks - including one of its contracted manufacturers going out of business - that nearly brought down the whole endeavor. Only a handful of stellarators have been attempted, and even fewer have been completed. By comparison, the more popular cousin to the stellarator, the tokamak, is in wider use. Over three dozen tokamaks are operational around the world, and more than 200 have been built throughout history. These machines are easier to construct and, in the past, have performed better as a nuclear reactor than stellarators. But tokamaks have a major flaw that W7-X is reportedly immune to, suggesting that Germany's latest monster machine could be a game changer. How a nuclear-fusion reactor works: The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control a blob of gas, called a plasma, that has been heated to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. At these blazing temperatures, the electrons are ripped from their atoms, forming ions. Normally the ions bounce off one another like bumper cars, but under these extreme conditions the repulsive forces are overcome. The ions are therefore able to collide and fuse together, which generates energy, and you have accomplished nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is different from what fuels today's nuclear reactors, which operate with energy from atoms that decay, or break apart, instead of fusing together. Nuclear fusion is the process that has been fueling our sun for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for another estimated 4 billion years. Once engineers have heated the gas in the reactor to the right temperature, they use super-chilled magnetic coils to generate powerful magnetic fields that contain and control the plasma. The W7-X, for example, houses 50 magnetic coils that each weigh 6 tons, shown in purple in the GIF below. The difference between tokamaks and stellarators: Tokamaks have for years been considered the most promising machine for producing energy in the way the sun does because the configuration of their magnetic coils contains a plasma that is better than that of currently operational stellarators. But there's a problem: Tokamaks can control the plasma only in short bursts that last for no more than seven minutes. And the energy necessary to generate that plasma is more than the energy engineers get from these periodic bursts. Tokamaks thus consume more energy than they produce, which is not what you want from nuclear-fusion reactors, which have been touted as the \" most important energy source over the next millennium. \" Because of the stellarators' design, experts suspect it could sustain a plasma for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is significantly longer than any tokamak.

Dubbed the Wendelstein 7-x fusion stellarator, it has been more than 15 years in the making and is claimed to be so magnetically efficient that it will be able to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its enormous magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If successful, this new reactor may help realize the long-held goal of continuous operation essential for the success of nuclear fusion power generation. Created by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) and designed with the aid of a supercomputer, the Wendelstein 7-x is the first large-scale optimized stellarator of its type ever to be commissioned. With a name like something out of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and a containment vessel that literally provides a new twist on the doughnut shape we see in standard tokamak fusion reactors, the quirky stellarator design aims to provide an inherently more stable environment for plasma and a more promising route for nuclear fusion research in general. Initially an American design conceived by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University in 1951, the stellarator was deemed too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century, and the more easily constructed toroid of the tokamak won out as the standard model for fusion research. Though some stellarators have been constructed over the course of time - notably the predecessor to this latest iteration known as the Wendelstein 7-AS (Advanced Stellarator) - the calculations required to ensure ultimate plasma containment and control have only become possible with the advent of supercomputers. As such, algorithms specifically created to fuse theory and practice have now been applied to the design of the Wendelstein 7-x, and its designers firmly believe that this latest version will have the stability required to be the precursor machine to full-blown, continuous nuclear fusion power generation. For the eventual success of nuclear fusion power (essentially where two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, are subject to such energy that the strong nuclear force is overcome and they fuse to form helium and release copious amounts of neutron energy), stability is essential. This is because the enormous pressures and temperatures (around 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million \u00b0F)) used to create the plasma, and then accelerate the resulting ion and electron soup around the containment vessel, means that any instability in the magnetic containment field or the pressure vessel itself will result in degradation and ultimately the failure of the process. To achieve a more stable environment, the stellarator eschews the method of inducing current through the plasma to drive electrons and ions around the inside of the vessel as found in tokamak designs, instead relying entirely on external magnetic fields to move the particles along. In this way, stellarator designs are basically immune to the sudden and unexpected disruptions of plasma and the enormous - and often destructive - magnetic field collapses that sometimes occur in tokamaks. As such, a stellarator reactor is able to hold the plasma in a containment field that twists through a set of magnetic coils to continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. This is because, in a normal tokamak, with its doughnut-shaped containment vessel and electromagnet windings that loop through the center of the toroid and around the outside, the magnetic field is stronger in the center than it is on the outer side. This means that plasma contained in a tokamak tends to drift to the outer walls where it then collapses. The stellarator, on the other hand, avoids this situation by twisting the entire containment vessel into a shape that constantly forces the plasma stream into the center of the reactor vessel as it continuously encounters magnetic fields in opposing positions along its entire length. The advantages of the stellarator over the tokamak come at a cost, however, as the many twists and turns that give the stellarator an advantage in magnetic containment also mean that many particles can simply be lost as they veer off course following the path of the containment vessel itself. To help avoid this, a great many more magnetic coils are required for the stellarator and must be set up at very close intervals around the structure and super-cooled with liquid helium for maximum efficiency. In the case of the Wendelstein 7-x, the weight of the 50, 3.5-meter-tall (11.5-ft) non-planar super-conducting electromagnets alone is around 425 tonnes (468 tons) and their placement makes construction difficult and their assembly fraught with problems. Not to mention the fact that piping around vast quantities of liquid helium to ensure that the electromagnets superconduct at temperatures close to absolute zero makes the Wendelstein 7-x a plumber's nightmare, and a tricky addition to an already difficult balancing act. As such, the physical design of the stellarator itself requires access ports for fuel ingress and egress, along with a myriad other entry points for instruments, sensors, and all the other necessary paraphernalia necessary to monitor the enormous pressures, voltages, and temperatures that it will be subject to in operation. Despite all of these problems, tests on the completed stellarator to maintain the sub-millimeter accuracy for the plasma path are progressing and show promise. In one recent test, an electron beam was injected into the stellarator and progressed along a predetermined field line in the circular tracks through the evacuated plasma vessel. As it moved through the machine, the beam created a tracer in its wake created by collisions with electrons contained in the residual gas in the vessel. Meanwhile, as the electron beam constantly circulated through the system, a fluorescent rod was pushed transversely through the vessel in cross section, and when the electron beam struck the rod, visible spots of light were created and the results recorded with a camera. In this way, the whole cross section of the magnetic field was gradually made visible. \"Once the flux surface diagnostics were placed in operation, we were immediately able to see the first magnetic surfaces,\" said Dr. Matthias Otte, the man responsible for this measurement process. \"Our images clearly show how magnetic field lines create closed surfaces in many toroidal circulations.\" Whilst in itself just another stepping stone toward the ultimate goal of practical fusion energy, the IPP stellarator is an important juncture in the field. With tokamak-based reactors still requiring more energy in than they actually produce, both the scientific and general public alike have grown wary of the long-held promises surrounding nuclear fusion. And, though many bodies, such as the University of Washington, Lockheed-Martin, and MIT, claim to be \"close\" to producing a working, sustainable, self-powering machine, nuclear fusion still remains a pipe dream. This is where IPP's proving of the technology over the coming months leading to a full-blown commissioning of the machine may well provide the nexus between theory and practicality and, if not deliver on the promise of boundless energy, at least provide a proof of concept and renew flagging interest in a field that may, one day, solve all of our energy needs. With approval to continue from nuclear regulators in Germany expected by the end of this month, the Wendelstein 7-x stellarator is slated for its first fully-operational tests in November this year. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and over one million man-hours of work committed so far, the hopes of Europe's future being a nuclear fusion-powered one may well rest on the ability of this machine to perform as expected.

Dubbed Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), the reactor can continuously contain super-hot plasma for more than 30 minutes at a time. Researchers claim the unusual design, which is housed in a huge lab in Greifswald, Germany, could finally help make fusion power a reality. Containing super-hot plasma for long periods has been the Holy Grail for reactor designs, and could help scientists provide an inexhaustible source of power. Fusion reactors, such as the W7-X, work by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms - deuterium and tritium - and injecting that gas into a containment vessel. Scientist then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms, forming what is described as an ion plasma, which releases huge amounts of energy. Strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the walls; these are produced by superconducting coils surrounding the vessel, and by an electrical current driven through the plasma. The most common design for a reactor is something known as a Tokamak, which is a hollow metal chamber in the shape of a donut. The fuel is heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million\u00b0C, forming a hot plasma. While the Tokamak design is ideal for containing this plasma, it poses some safety risks, for instance, if the current fails or there's a magnetic disruption. These disruptions can unleash magnetic forces powerful enough to damage the reactor. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute say the W7-X is a more practical option and can overcome the safety problems of a Tokamak reactor, according to an in-depth report in Science. 'Tokamak people are waiting to see what happens. There's an excitement around the world about W7-X,' engineer David Anderson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison told Science. In tokamaks, two sets of magnets are used to contain the plasma; an external set surrounding the vacuum chamber and an internal transformer that drives current in the plasma. This causes the magnetic field to be stronger in the centre than it is on the outer side. As a result, plasma contained in a tokamak can moves to the outer walls where it then collapses. In stellarators, plasma is contained by external magnetic coils which create twisted field lines around the inside of the vacuum chamber, according to Science. As such, it overcomes can continuously hold the plasma away from the walls of the device. Its key component is a ring 50 superconducting magnetic coils approximately 3.5 metres in height. In total the device is 16-meters-wide. The stellarator design was first thought up in 1951 by Lyman Spitzer working at Princeton University. But at the time, it was thought to be too complex for the constraints of materials available in the middle of the 20th Century. Now using supercomputers and new materials, researchers believe they can finally make Spitzer's vision a reality. 'We all know the trend of global development, the hunger for energy of emerging economies and emerging countries,' said Professor Johanna Wanka, Federal Minister for Education and Research. 'So when we talk about energy, we need research that keeps all options open. And one of these options is nuclear fusion. 'Wendelstein 7-X is an important step forward allowing us to better evaluate the 'fusion option.' The machine took 1.1 million hours to assemble, using what has been described as one of the world's most complex engineering models. Testing of the magnetic field in the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device was completed in June - much sooner than expected. The test revealed that the magnetic cage for the fusion plasma, which has a temperature of many million degrees, was working as scientists predicted. The device is currently awaiting regulatory approval for a startup in November. If the machine works, scientists believe it could herald a change in the direction for fusion power.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3290389/Stellarator-reactor-turned-time-Strange-twisted-design-finally-make-fusion-power-reality-say-scientists.html"}, {"title": "The world's largest nuclear fusion reactor is about to switch on", "date": "2015-11-10", "content": "It looks like a piece of technology straight out of science fiction, but the Wendelstein 7-X stellarton fusion reactor is totally factual - and it's set to switch online this month. Stellarator reactors such as the W7-X produce energy by using massive coiled superconductors to create powerful magnetic fields that contain hydrogen gas as it is heated to the point that its atoms fuse. According to Gizmodo, the W7-X takes the stellarator design to a whole new scale, featuring a 16-meter-wide ring covered in 250 access ports that contain 50 6-ton magnetic coils. At a cost of more than $1 billion, the W7X took a total of 19 years to build. According to Science News, the labor and cost that went into building the stellarator design could be worth it - as it has some significant advantages over the competing tokamak technology. \"Once started, stellarators naturally purr along in a steady state and they are not prone to the potentially metal-bending magnetic disruptions that plague tokamaks,\" writes Daniel Clery of Science News. The tokamaks are significantly simpler to build, but can only operate for short periods of time and are subject to major magnetic disruptions. All the blood, sweat and dollars put into the project will be tested later this month when Germany's nuclear regulatory body is set to give the go-ahead to start up the W7-X.

Two teams of PSFC researchers are collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X device, the world's largest fusion experiment designed in the stellarator line of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The PSFC has significant experience with a different configuration of magnetic confinement, having spent decades designing and running the Alcator series of high-magnetic-field tokamak experiments - the Alcator C-Mod device, located on campus, is the latest in that series. There are many similarities between the two designs, however. Both the tokamak and the stellarator seek to harness the energy released from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to provide clean and safe electrical power. Both use helical (spiraling) magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma fuel in a donut-shaped chamber. In a tokamak, this field is generated both by external electromagnets and a large electrical current that is driven in the plasma itself. Driving and sustaining this plasma current, and its impact on stability and transport of energy and particles, is a major focus of the research at MIT. The stellarator concept takes a different approach. First invented by the noted astrophysicist and fusion pioneer Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1950, the stellarator provides the entire helical field through external electromagnets formed in highly complex and twisted shapes. Although the assembly of a modern stellarator like W7-X presents many engineering challenges, this approach has significant operational advantages. Because there is no need to drive a current in the plasma, the configuration is more readily extrapolated to steady-state, a necessity for economic operation of a fusion power plant. The magnetic field geometry of Wendelstein 7-X has been optimized using super-computer simulations of particle orbits. Consistent with its steady-state mission, W7-X has super-conducting coils and is designed to create and sustain hot plasma for up to 30 minutes. The immediate goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that the loss of particles can be kept small so that high temperatures can be achieved. In early phases of the experiment up to 10 megawatts of microwave power will be used to heat the plasma. Later, as much as 8 megawatts of neutral-beam power will be added, after water-cooled armor is installed to handle the exhaust heat. W7-X expects to produce plasmas with fusion-grade densities and temperatures 60-130 million degrees K. Future experiments at W7-X will address the role that plasma turbulence plays in limiting overall performance, and PSFC researchers are working with the W7-X group to investigate this. One PSFC team - principal research scientist Jim Terry and postdoctoral researcher Seung-Gyou Baek - will develop a fast camera system for viewing light emitted from the plasma, and will make important measurements of turbulence near the edge of the plasma. The other team - physics professor Miklos Porkolab and staff scientist Eric Edlund - will develop a specialized interferometer for imaging density fluctuations deep in the hot plasma core. The issues surrounding turbulence are important in stellarators, as they are in tokamaks, since turbulence moves heat and particles across the confining magnetic field faster than would otherwise occur. Both teams expect to have first measurements during the 2017 experimental campaign. These projects are supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics.", "url": "https://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2015/a-new-fusion-collaboration-for-mit-wendelstein-7-x-begins-operation"}, {"title": "Germany turned on its stellarator W7-X", "date": "2015-12-10", "content": "On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics fired up a monster machine that it hopes will change the world. The machine is called the Wendelstein 7-X, or W7-X for short. It's a type of nuclear-fusion machine called a stellarator and is the largest, most sophisticated of its kind. Nuclear fusion could prove to be a clean, inexhaustible energy source. But humans are still a ways from successfully building a reactor that could power a small town, let alone entire cities. But now, we're one step closer. On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics tweeted out a beautiful image of the machine's first plasma - a gas in which all the electrons have been stripped from their atoms, a task that requires tremendous amounts of energy and is critical to achieving nuclear fusion. The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control plasma. This is the first confirmation that the machine is performing as planned. Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics completed construction of the $1.1 billion W7-X. The black horse of nuclear reactors: Known in the plasma physics community as the black horse of reactors that use nuclear fusion, stellarators are notoriously difficult to build. The GIF below shows the many different layers of W7-X, which took 19 years to complete: From 2003 to 2007, the project suffered some major construction setbacks - including one of its contracted manufacturers going out of business - that nearly brought down the whole endeavor. Only a handful of stellarators have been attempted, and even fewer have been completed. By comparison, the more popular cousin to the stellarator, the tokamak, is in wider use. Over three dozen tokamaks are operational around the world, and more than 200 have been built throughout history. These machines are easier to construct and, in the past, have performed better as a nuclear reactor than stellarators. But tokamaks have a major flaw that W7-X is reportedly immune to, suggesting that Germany's latest monster machine could be a game changer. How a nuclear-fusion reactor works: The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control a blob of gas, called a plasma, that has been heated to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. At these blazing temperatures, the electrons are ripped from their atoms, forming ions. Normally the ions bounce off one another like bumper cars, but under these extreme conditions the repulsive forces are overcome. The ions are therefore able to collide and fuse together, which generates energy, and you have accomplished nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is different from what fuels today's nuclear reactors, which operate with energy from atoms that decay, or break apart, instead of fusing together. Nuclear fusion is the process that has been fueling our sun for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for another estimated 4 billion years. Once engineers have heated the gas in the reactor to the right temperature, they use super-chilled magnetic coils to generate powerful magnetic fields that contain and control the plasma. The W7-X, for example, houses 50 magnetic coils that each weigh 6 tons, shown in purple in the GIF below. The difference between tokamaks and stellarators: Tokamaks have for years been considered the most promising machine for producing energy in the way the sun does because the configuration of their magnetic coils contains a plasma that is better than that of currently operational stellarators. But there's a problem: Tokamaks can control the plasma only in short bursts that last for no more than seven minutes. And the energy necessary to generate that plasma is more than the energy engineers get from these periodic bursts. Tokamaks thus consume more energy than they produce, which is not what you want from nuclear-fusion reactors, which have been touted as the \" most important energy source over the next millennium. \" Because of the stellarators' design, experts suspect it could sustain a plasma for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is significantly longer than any tokamak. The French tokamak Tore Supra holds the record: Six minutes 30 seconds. If W7-X succeeds, it could turn the nuclear-fusion community on its head and launch stellarators into the limelight. \"The world is waiting to see if we get the confinement time and then hold it for a long pulse,\" David Gates, head of stellarator physics at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, told Science.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-turned-on-its-monster-stellarator-2015-10"}, {"title": "The Wendelstein 7-X nuclear fusion reactor just fired up for the first time, and it could make fossil fuels redundant", "date": "2015-12-16", "content": "Scientists are rejoicing after the inaugural test run of the Wendelstein 7-X fusion reactor last week. Inside the massive, uniquely-shaped stellarator, one milligram of helium gas was heated to 100 million degrees Celsius, creating a plasma which lasted for one tenth of a second. According to the team operating the reactor, \"everything went according to plan,\" which means we are leaps and bounds closer to harnessing nuclear fusion technology for cleaner energy. The unique design of the W7-X stellarator, a device that recreates the fusion activity inside stars, could also mean more sustainable and safer operations for the future, as compared to typical fusion container designs. Called a \"tokamak,\" doughnut-shaped containers have historically been used to cage plasma within significantly cooled magnetic walls, yet the W7-X's design's twists and turns eliminate the need for a current within the magnetic mechanism. The structure was shaped by a supercomputer, keeping the plasma from touching the walls by making sure it travels at 700 miles per second. Professor Steven Cowley, head of the Centre for Fusion Energy in the UK, states, \"Wendelstein is a natural design which does without the current. It gets the magnetic field controlling the plasma to twist, using weird-shaped magnets. It's a different route to nuclear fusion.\" Compared to the UK's own JET machine, which has produced plasma from hydrogen at 250 million degrees Celsius and 16 megawatts of power through use of a powerful current, the costs of energy differ greatly. The need for an industrial scale fusion reactor to run 24/7 requires cheap, clean power. Ambitiously, the next project will be creating hydrogen plasma at much higher temperatures, which will be attempted in France for the cost of \u20ac15 billion with the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The hope is that the reactor can create a \"fusion burn,\" which is a self-sustaining reaction only needed when firing the machine into motion. Crowley says, \"If it does burn - and all the predictions are that it will - it will be a Wright Brothers moment.\"", "url": "https://inhabitat.com/wendelstein-7-x-nuclear-reactor-fired-up-for-the-first-time-could-make-fossil-fuels-redundant/"}, {"title": "PPPL celebrates role in first research plasma on W7-X stellarator in Germany", "date": "2015-12-22", "content": "Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory have reason to celebrate the first plasma of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute in Greifswald, Germany earlier this month.

No, she was not setting off some new kind of hydrogen bomb. She was inaguriating the fusion reactor Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator, by generating its first hydrogen plasma. Completed in April 2014 the toroidal reactor with its complicated magnetic field is viewed by many as a serious competitor to tokamak-style fusion reactors, such as ITER.  One of the advantages of a stellarator  is that nuclear fusion reactions can take place continuously, while a tokamak operates in a pulsed mode, making it much less efficient as an energy source. However, whether plasma would survive  in an untested toroidal field created by a set of coils of unprecedented complexity was an open question. The coils were  the result of a decade of an enormous computational effort, only made possible by the power of modern supercomputers. On 10 December 2015 researchers at Greifswald loaded the nuclear reactor, also known as W-X with a helium plasma, and to their relief, the plasma behaved exactly as expected. \u201cThis was really the beginning, and the machine works nicely. The confinement time was very large, we knew we were on the right path,\u201d says Hans-Stephan Bosch, who directs the division responsible for the operation of the stellarator.", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/wendelstein-7x-really-starts-up"}, {"title": "Angela Merkel switches on Wendelstein 7-X fusion device", "date": "2016-02-03", "content": "In a bid to advance plasma research, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel actually pushed some buttons herself: on February 3, 2016, Merkel, during a visit to the Wendelstein X-7 experimental fusion reactor at the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, personally flipped the switch to generate the machine's first hydrogen plasma. \"This marks the beginning of an experiment unique in the world, which can bring us one step closer to the energy source of the future,\" the Chancellor said. Wendelstein 7-X, fired up in early December 2015 using helium; now it has started its experimental scientific operation. With Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest and most advanced fusion device of the stellarator type, researchers want to investigate this configuration's suitability for use in a power plant. \"For the Max Planck Society, the operational start of Wendelstein-7X is a milestone in its own history\", said Martin Stratmann, President of the Max Planck Society. Stratamnn went on to thank the Institute's researchers: \"You have achieved a true milestone in plasma physics and technical engineering on the road towards a sustainable energy supply in the 21st century.\" It did not take the Chancellor long to find the button she was expected to press in order to switch on the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X. Staff members at the Max Planck Institute had placed it on a glass cube, adorned with a laser-cut silhouette of the fusion plant, and prominently positioned it on a steel column at the edge of the control room. When Angela Merkel energetically pressed the glass cube, a bright glow flickered on a monitor and provided a glimpse into the heart of the plasma vessel. With the governmental switch of the button, a ceremony reached its peak, which marked the start of the device's scientific experimental operation. \"Every step we are taking on the long road towards a fusion power plant is a success,\" Angela Merkel said. After all, one the world's most pressing questions is how we can address the increasing energy needs of a growing world population without missing our climate goals. \"The benefits of fusion energy are obvious: hydrogen as a fuel is available to an almost unlimited degree. It is a clean energy source without climate-damaging CO2 emissions and long-lived radioactive waste. \" Werner Heisenberg vision comes true: In front of numerous guests from the realms of science and politics, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel triggered a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating, which transformed a tiny quantity of hydrogen gas into an extremely hot low-density hydrogen plasma. This entails separation of the electrons from the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms. Confined in the magnetic cage generated by Wendelstein 7-X, the charged particles levitate without making contact with the walls of the plasma chamber. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations\", states Hans-Stephan Bosch, whose division is responsible for operation of Wendelstein 7-X. \"With Wendelstein 7-X, part of Werner Heisenberg's vision has come true. I am sure it would fill him with joy and pride to see us here today, \"Martin Stratmann said. Such fusion plants stood at the beginning of a long development, which might culminate in completely new possibilities of energy production. \"It is up to us to lay the scientific foundations for this, showcasing options which can be used by society and politics when the time has come,\" said the Max Planck President. A long-term investment in the future of energy supply: The booting up of first hydrogen plasma in the W7-X is to be followed by many other plasma experiments, with the goal of clarifying fundamental questions of plasma research. Chancellor Merkel also held a committed plea for basic research: \"The example of nuclear fusion has clearly demonstrated what a drawn-out and costly process basic research can be. Besides knowledge and a large portion of perseverance, it also requires creativity as well as audacity.\" Those who dared to venture into unexplored territory often did not know where their chosen path would lead them. Sometimes such paths would end in dead ends, and sometimes they would lead to completely unexpected additional insights. But without fundamental research certain findings could not be achieved. Basic research, so Merkel, lays the foundations for a better life. Erwin Sellering also praised the research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Research as a long-term investment aimed at meeting rising energy demand in the future. The Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern congratulated the staff of the Institute on their contribution: \"You carry out excellent work on the highest level.\" As Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, he was proud that the scientists of the region positioned themselves so prominently in the global scientific landscape. The goal: plasma discharges lasting 30 minutes: Before the Federal Chancellor fired the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X, the researchers in Greifswald had started the fusion device on 10 December 2015 with an initial helium plasma. Since then, Wendelstein 7-X has produced more than 300 discharges with the rare gas, helium. These served primarily to clean the plasma vessel. The cleaner the vessel wall, the more the plasma temperature increased, finally attaining six million degrees. In addition, plasma heating and data recording were tested, and the first measuring facilities for investigating the plasma were put into operation, viz. complex instrumentation such as X-ray spectrometers, interferometers, laser scattering and video diagnostics. \"This makes everything ready for the next step\", states Project Head Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" The present initial experimentation phase will last until mid-March. The plasma vessel will then be opened in order to install carbon tiles for protecting the vessel walls and a so-called \"divertor\" for removing impurities. \"These facilities will enable us to attain higher heating powers, higher temperatures, and longer discharges lasting up to ten seconds\", explains Thomas Klinger.

Having fired up the Wendelstein 7-X to produce helium plasma late last year, researchers have built on their early success to generate its first hydrogen plasma, an event they say begins the true scientific operation of the world's largest fusion stellarator. After a decade of construction, the Wendelstein 7-X fusion stellarator was finally started up in December last year. The device is designed to be magnetically efficient enough to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If this vision does one day become a reality, it could help to usher in an era of clean, reliable nuclear fusion power. But it's all about baby steps for scientists working at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), which houses the experimental device. Since producing the first helium plasma on December 10 last year, the Wendelstein 7-X has generated more than 300 discharges. The main purpose of these was to clean the plasma vessel walls, which in turn makes for higher temperatures, but it also allowed for testing of scientific instruments and data recording. \"This makes everything ready for the next step,\" says project boss Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" At a ceremony on Wednesday, quantum physicist (who also happens to be Germany's Federal Chancellor) Angela Merkel spoke for around 20 minutes, before pressing the button to initiate the test. This saw a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating convert a small amount of hydrogen gas into a low-density hydrogen plasma. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations,\" says IPP's Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch. The researchers will continue in this experimentation phase until mid-March. They will then open up the plasma vessel and install carbon tiles for better protection, along with a device designed to remove impurities. These enhancements will make for even higher temperatures and longer discharges lasting up to 10 seconds. They plan on making similar improvements over the next four years until Wendelstein 7-X can produce discharges lasting 30 minutes at a full heating power of 20 megawatts. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and one million man-hours, Wendelstein 7-X will never generate a single watt-hour of energy. Rather it is intended to establish the potential of stellarators as power plants by demonstrating their main advantage over tokamak fusion reactors, which is the ability to operate continuously rather than only in short bursts.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory physicists collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator fusion energy device in Greifswald, Germany, were on hand Feb. 3 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed a button to produce the reactor's first plasma of hydrogen- fueled superhot gas. The W7-X is a stellarator, a device that uses twisted magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. It is a departure from the more common fusion device used in fusion experiments, a donut-shaped device called a \"tokamak\" such as that used at PPPL. The German reactor is the result of an international collaboration, and PPPL's Hutch Neilson was the coordinator of the U.S. effort. \"It was a day of building excitement and it was a very happy mood because everything is working really well on the experiment,\" said Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. \"It was kind of amazing when the chancellor walked into the control room. Her eyes lit up.\" Scientists and dignitaries from around the world watched as Merkel pushed the button to create a hydrogen plasma that lasted a quarter of a second. But that was long enough to begin heating the plasma to 80 million degrees Celsius. By 2020, the W7-X is designed to produce a plasma that lasts up to 30 minutes and would demonstrate that stellarators could be a model for the fusion power plants of the future. Merkel acknowledged that there are \"huge scientific challenges\" and costs associated with developing fusion energy, but she said the possibility of developing fusion energy as a source of generating electric energy is worth the investment. \"Rising energy demands and the vision of an almost inexhaustible energy source are convincing arguments for investing in fusion,\" Merkel said. Neilson and Princeton University Vice President for PPPL A.J. Stewart Smith were among the select group of scientists in the W7-X control room, along with Ed Synakowski, Department of Energy Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. PPPL physicists Samuel Lazerson and Novimir Pablant also attended the event along with other U.S. collaborators. 'Major progress': Greeting Merkel on behalf of the U.S. delegation, Smith said the W7-X is a significant achievement that will lead to \"major progress for the understanding of plasma.\" \"The W7-X is a major step for fusion research. Princeton and the whole U.S. team are absolutely thrilled,\" Smith said to Merkel in German. \"We are so pleased to be involved in this exceptional event. \"I am very impressed by the professional way the IPP team was able to successfully build such a complex daunting machine,\" Smith said. \"The success of W7-X shows that the daunting challenges facing stellarators have been solved.\" The hydrogen plasma is \"a step on the path to making the device perform as planned,\" said David Gates, a PPPL physicist and stellarator physics lead, who was on hand at W7-X for the first test plasma and watched a live stream of the first hydrogen plasma in the PPPL auditorium. \"From a plasma physicist's point of view, this next phase of research is an important milestone.\" PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X scientists, which is funded by $4 million annually from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. PPPL scientists and technicians built some key components of the machine, which took some 20 years and 1 billion euro to build. PPPL researchers designed and delivered the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of plasma in fusion experiments. Physicists also designed and built an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the plasma temperature. A current project is the design and construction of divertor scraper units that intercept heat from the plasma to protect divertor targets from damage. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as researchers and students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, Auburn University, and Xantho Technologies, LLC. 'Exceeding expectations': Neilson said the experiment is already getting good results. \"We're getting data and physics results from it exceeding expectations for what everybody thought would be accomplished during this startup period,\" he said. PPPL researchers have already collaborated on research at the W7-X. Lazerson has been at the W7-X since March 2015 and performed one of the first experiments on the machine when he mapped the structure of the magnetic field and proved that the main magnet system and the trim coils that PPPL designed and had built in the U.S. were working as intended. He presented his research at the APS Division of Plasma Physics Conference in November. Pablant used the X-ray spectrometer to make the first plasma temperature measurements on W7-X. \"I was really proud of the American contingent for the work they've done,\" Neilson said the evening of the event. \"We've made ourselves as indispensable as it's possible to be. We're not on the periphery. We're doing things that matter.\" Two approaches to the same problem: Stellarators and tokamaks are two different approaches to the same difficult challenge of developing fusion as an energy source, and the W7-X is putting more attention on the potential of stellarators, Neilson said. \"The arrival of W7-X on the scene creates sort of a buzz about stellarators,\" Neilson said. \"I think in the U.S., the arrival of such an advanced machine, which is competitive with anything that's out there in terms of capabilities, is just bound to shift the conversation about stellarators.\" PPPL has taken a different approach to stellarators with its quasi- axisymmetric stellarator or QUASAR, which was not completed. With W7-X now operating, it could also lead the U.S. to reconsider stellarators, Neilson said. \"For 10 years, the focus is going to be on W7-X itself,\" he said, \"but it does create an atmosphere in which it's reasonable to ask, 'What about us?'\" PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas - ultra-hot, charged gases - and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. Results of PPPL research have ranged from a portable nuclear materials detector for anti-terrorist use to universally employed computer codes for analyzing and predicting the outcome of fusion experiments. The laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Stellarator reactors such as the W7-X produce energy by using massive coiled superconductors to create powerful magnetic fields that contain hydrogen gas as it is heated to the point that its atoms fuse. According to Gizmodo, the W7-X takes the stellarator design to a whole new scale, featuring a 16-meter-wide ring covered in 250 access ports that contain 50 6-ton magnetic coils. At a cost of more than $1 billion, the W7X took a total of 19 years to build. According to Science News, the labor and cost that went into building the stellarator design could be worth it - as it has some significant advantages over the competing tokamak technology. \"Once started, stellarators naturally purr along in a steady state and they are not prone to the potentially metal-bending magnetic disruptions that plague tokamaks,\" writes Daniel Clery of Science News. The tokamaks are significantly simpler to build, but can only operate for short periods of time and are subject to major magnetic disruptions. All the blood, sweat and dollars put into the project will be tested later this month when Germany's nuclear regulatory body is set to give the go-ahead to start up the W7-X.

Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device, will investigate the suitability of this type of device for a power station. Following nine years of construction work and more than a million assembly hours, the main assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X was completed in April 2014. The operational preparations have been under way ever since. Each technical system was tested in turn, the vacuum in the vessels, the cooling system, the superconducting coils and the magnetic field they produce, the control system, as well as the heating devices and measuring instruments. On 10th December, the day had arrived: the operating team in the control room started up the magnetic field and initiated the computer-operated experiment control system. It fed around one milligram of helium gas into the evacuated plasma vessel, switched on the microwave heating for a short 1,3 megawatt pulse - and the first plasma could be observed by the installed cameras and measuring devices. \"We're starting with a plasma produced from the noble gas helium. We're not changing over to the actual investigation object, a hydrogen plasma, until next year,\" explains project leader Professor Thomas Klinger: \"This is because it's easier to achieve the plasma state with helium. In addition, we can clean the surface of the plasma vessel with helium plasmas.\" The first plasma in the machine had a duration of one tenth of a second and achieved a temperature of around one million degrees. \"We're very satisfied\", concludes Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, whose division is responsible for the operation of the Wendelstein 7-X, at the end of the first day of experimentation. \"Everything went according to plan.\" The next task will be to extend the duration of the plasma discharges and to investigate the best method of producing and heating helium plasmas using microwaves.

Two teams of PSFC researchers are collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X device, the world's largest fusion experiment designed in the stellarator line of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The PSFC has significant experience with a different configuration of magnetic confinement, having spent decades designing and running the Alcator series of high-magnetic-field tokamak experiments - the Alcator C-Mod device, located on campus, is the latest in that series. There are many similarities between the two designs, however. Both the tokamak and the stellarator seek to harness the energy released from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to provide clean and safe electrical power. Both use helical (spiraling) magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma fuel in a donut-shaped chamber. In a tokamak, this field is generated both by external electromagnets and a large electrical current that is driven in the plasma itself. Driving and sustaining this plasma current, and its impact on stability and transport of energy and particles, is a major focus of the research at MIT. The stellarator concept takes a different approach. First invented by the noted astrophysicist and fusion pioneer Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1950, the stellarator provides the entire helical field through external electromagnets formed in highly complex and twisted shapes. Although the assembly of a modern stellarator like W7-X presents many engineering challenges, this approach has significant operational advantages. Because there is no need to drive a current in the plasma, the configuration is more readily extrapolated to steady-state, a necessity for economic operation of a fusion power plant. The magnetic field geometry of Wendelstein 7-X has been optimized using super-computer simulations of particle orbits. Consistent with its steady-state mission, W7-X has super-conducting coils and is designed to create and sustain hot plasma for up to 30 minutes. The immediate goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that the loss of particles can be kept small so that high temperatures can be achieved. In early phases of the experiment up to 10 megawatts of microwave power will be used to heat the plasma. Later, as much as 8 megawatts of neutral-beam power will be added, after water-cooled armor is installed to handle the exhaust heat. W7-X expects to produce plasmas with fusion-grade densities and temperatures 60-130 million degrees K. Future experiments at W7-X will address the role that plasma turbulence plays in limiting overall performance, and PSFC researchers are working with the W7-X group to investigate this. One PSFC team - principal research scientist Jim Terry and postdoctoral researcher Seung-Gyou Baek - will develop a fast camera system for viewing light emitted from the plasma, and will make important measurements of turbulence near the edge of the plasma. The other team - physics professor Miklos Porkolab and staff scientist Eric Edlund - will develop a specialized interferometer for imaging density fluctuations deep in the hot plasma core. The issues surrounding turbulence are important in stellarators, as they are in tokamaks, since turbulence moves heat and particles across the confining magnetic field faster than would otherwise occur. Both teams expect to have first measurements during the 2017 experimental campaign. These projects are supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics.", "url": "https://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2015/a-new-fusion-collaboration-for-mit-wendelstein-7-x-begins-operation"}, {"title": "Germany turned on its stellarator W7-X", "date": "2015-12-10", "content": "On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics fired up a monster machine that it hopes will change the world. The machine is called the Wendelstein 7-X, or W7-X for short. It's a type of nuclear-fusion machine called a stellarator and is the largest, most sophisticated of its kind. Nuclear fusion could prove to be a clean, inexhaustible energy source. But humans are still a ways from successfully building a reactor that could power a small town, let alone entire cities. But now, we're one step closer. On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics tweeted out a beautiful image of the machine's first plasma - a gas in which all the electrons have been stripped from their atoms, a task that requires tremendous amounts of energy and is critical to achieving nuclear fusion. The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control plasma. This is the first confirmation that the machine is performing as planned. Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics completed construction of the $1.1 billion W7-X. The black horse of nuclear reactors: Known in the plasma physics community as the black horse of reactors that use nuclear fusion, stellarators are notoriously difficult to build. The GIF below shows the many different layers of W7-X, which took 19 years to complete: From 2003 to 2007, the project suffered some major construction setbacks - including one of its contracted manufacturers going out of business - that nearly brought down the whole endeavor. Only a handful of stellarators have been attempted, and even fewer have been completed. By comparison, the more popular cousin to the stellarator, the tokamak, is in wider use. Over three dozen tokamaks are operational around the world, and more than 200 have been built throughout history. These machines are easier to construct and, in the past, have performed better as a nuclear reactor than stellarators. But tokamaks have a major flaw that W7-X is reportedly immune to, suggesting that Germany's latest monster machine could be a game changer. How a nuclear-fusion reactor works: The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control a blob of gas, called a plasma, that has been heated to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. At these blazing temperatures, the electrons are ripped from their atoms, forming ions. Normally the ions bounce off one another like bumper cars, but under these extreme conditions the repulsive forces are overcome. The ions are therefore able to collide and fuse together, which generates energy, and you have accomplished nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is different from what fuels today's nuclear reactors, which operate with energy from atoms that decay, or break apart, instead of fusing together. Nuclear fusion is the process that has been fueling our sun for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for another estimated 4 billion years. Once engineers have heated the gas in the reactor to the right temperature, they use super-chilled magnetic coils to generate powerful magnetic fields that contain and control the plasma. The W7-X, for example, houses 50 magnetic coils that each weigh 6 tons, shown in purple in the GIF below. The difference between tokamaks and stellarators: Tokamaks have for years been considered the most promising machine for producing energy in the way the sun does because the configuration of their magnetic coils contains a plasma that is better than that of currently operational stellarators. But there's a problem: Tokamaks can control the plasma only in short bursts that last for no more than seven minutes. And the energy necessary to generate that plasma is more than the energy engineers get from these periodic bursts. Tokamaks thus consume more energy than they produce, which is not what you want from nuclear-fusion reactors, which have been touted as the \" most important energy source over the next millennium. \" Because of the stellarators' design, experts suspect it could sustain a plasma for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is significantly longer than any tokamak. The French tokamak Tore Supra holds the record: Six minutes 30 seconds. If W7-X succeeds, it could turn the nuclear-fusion community on its head and launch stellarators into the limelight. \"The world is waiting to see if we get the confinement time and then hold it for a long pulse,\" David Gates, head of stellarator physics at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, told Science.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-turned-on-its-monster-stellarator-2015-10"}, {"title": "The Wendelstein 7-X nuclear fusion reactor just fired up for the first time, and it could make fossil fuels redundant", "date": "2015-12-16", "content": "Scientists are rejoicing after the inaugural test run of the Wendelstein 7-X fusion reactor last week. Inside the massive, uniquely-shaped stellarator, one milligram of helium gas was heated to 100 million degrees Celsius, creating a plasma which lasted for one tenth of a second. According to the team operating the reactor, \"everything went according to plan,\" which means we are leaps and bounds closer to harnessing nuclear fusion technology for cleaner energy. The unique design of the W7-X stellarator, a device that recreates the fusion activity inside stars, could also mean more sustainable and safer operations for the future, as compared to typical fusion container designs. Called a \"tokamak,\" doughnut-shaped containers have historically been used to cage plasma within significantly cooled magnetic walls, yet the W7-X's design's twists and turns eliminate the need for a current within the magnetic mechanism. The structure was shaped by a supercomputer, keeping the plasma from touching the walls by making sure it travels at 700 miles per second. Professor Steven Cowley, head of the Centre for Fusion Energy in the UK, states, \"Wendelstein is a natural design which does without the current. It gets the magnetic field controlling the plasma to twist, using weird-shaped magnets. It's a different route to nuclear fusion.\" Compared to the UK's own JET machine, which has produced plasma from hydrogen at 250 million degrees Celsius and 16 megawatts of power through use of a powerful current, the costs of energy differ greatly. The need for an industrial scale fusion reactor to run 24/7 requires cheap, clean power. Ambitiously, the next project will be creating hydrogen plasma at much higher temperatures, which will be attempted in France for the cost of \u20ac15 billion with the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The hope is that the reactor can create a \"fusion burn,\" which is a self-sustaining reaction only needed when firing the machine into motion. Crowley says, \"If it does burn - and all the predictions are that it will - it will be a Wright Brothers moment.\"", "url": "https://inhabitat.com/wendelstein-7-x-nuclear-reactor-fired-up-for-the-first-time-could-make-fossil-fuels-redundant/"}, {"title": "PPPL celebrates role in first research plasma on W7-X stellarator in Germany", "date": "2015-12-22", "content": "Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory have reason to celebrate the first plasma of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute in Greifswald, Germany earlier this month.

The W7-X is planned to be the first optimized stellarator to confine a hot plasma in a steady state for up to 30 minutes. In doing so, it could demonstrate that an optimized stellarator could be a model for future fusion reactors. PPPL's contributions to the W7-X include: Designing and delivering the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of the plasma in fusion experiments. Leading magnetic field mapping experiments with the trim coils showing that their effects on the magnetic configuration were as predicted. Designing and building a diagnostic device called an X-ray crystal spectrometer, one of several diagnostics created by U.S. researchers that will analyze experiments on W7-X. Currently building two divertor scraper units in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory that will intercept heat coming from the plasma to protect the W7-X divertor targets from damage. PPPL physicists who have worked extensively on W7-X include: Hutch Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. He coordinates the U.S. collaboration on W7-X and was in Greifswald, Germany at the IPP/W7-X for several months last year. David Gates, the stellarator physics leader at PPPL, was at the first plasma. Sam Lazerson, a physicist, is currently in Greifswald working at the W7-X. Novimir Pablant, designed and built the diagnostic device on the machine with PPPL engineers, and installed it.

No, she was not setting off some new kind of hydrogen bomb. She was inaguriating the fusion reactor Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator, by generating its first hydrogen plasma. Completed in April 2014 the toroidal reactor with its complicated magnetic field is viewed by many as a serious competitor to tokamak-style fusion reactors, such as ITER.  One of the advantages of a stellarator  is that nuclear fusion reactions can take place continuously, while a tokamak operates in a pulsed mode, making it much less efficient as an energy source. However, whether plasma would survive  in an untested toroidal field created by a set of coils of unprecedented complexity was an open question. The coils were  the result of a decade of an enormous computational effort, only made possible by the power of modern supercomputers. On 10 December 2015 researchers at Greifswald loaded the nuclear reactor, also known as W-X with a helium plasma, and to their relief, the plasma behaved exactly as expected. \u201cThis was really the beginning, and the machine works nicely.

Wendelstein 7-X, fired up in early December 2015 using helium; now it has started its experimental scientific operation. With Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest and most advanced fusion device of the stellarator type, researchers want to investigate this configuration's suitability for use in a power plant. \"For the Max Planck Society, the operational start of Wendelstein-7X is a milestone in its own history\", said Martin Stratmann, President of the Max Planck Society. Stratamnn went on to thank the Institute's researchers: \"You have achieved a true milestone in plasma physics and technical engineering on the road towards a sustainable energy supply in the 21st century.\" It did not take the Chancellor long to find the button she was expected to press in order to switch on the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X. Staff members at the Max Planck Institute had placed it on a glass cube, adorned with a laser-cut silhouette of the fusion plant, and prominently positioned it on a steel column at the edge of the control room. When Angela Merkel energetically pressed the glass cube, a bright glow flickered on a monitor and provided a glimpse into the heart of the plasma vessel. With the governmental switch of the button, a ceremony reached its peak, which marked the start of the device's scientific experimental operation. \"Every step we are taking on the long road towards a fusion power plant is a success,\" Angela Merkel said. After all, one the world's most pressing questions is how we can address the increasing energy needs of a growing world population without missing our climate goals. \"The benefits of fusion energy are obvious: hydrogen as a fuel is available to an almost unlimited degree. It is a clean energy source without climate-damaging CO2 emissions and long-lived radioactive waste. \" Werner Heisenberg vision comes true: In front of numerous guests from the realms of science and politics, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel triggered a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating, which transformed a tiny quantity of hydrogen gas into an extremely hot low-density hydrogen plasma.

I am sure it would fill him with joy and pride to see us here today, \"Martin Stratmann said. Such fusion plants stood at the beginning of a long development, which might culminate in completely new possibilities of energy production. \"It is up to us to lay the scientific foundations for this, showcasing options which can be used by society and politics when the time has come,\" said the Max Planck President. A long-term investment in the future of energy supply: The booting up of first hydrogen plasma in the W7-X is to be followed by many other plasma experiments, with the goal of clarifying fundamental questions of plasma research. Chancellor Merkel also held a committed plea for basic research: \"The example of nuclear fusion has clearly demonstrated what a drawn-out and costly process basic research can be. Besides knowledge and a large portion of perseverance, it also requires creativity as well as audacity.\" Those who dared to venture into unexplored territory often did not know where their chosen path would lead them. Sometimes such paths would end in dead ends, and sometimes they would lead to completely unexpected additional insights. But without fundamental research certain findings could not be achieved. Basic research, so Merkel, lays the foundations for a better life. Erwin Sellering also praised the research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Research as a long-term investment aimed at meeting rising energy demand in the future. The Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern congratulated the staff of the Institute on their contribution: \"You carry out excellent work on the highest level.\" As Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, he was proud that the scientists of the region positioned themselves so prominently in the global scientific landscape. The goal: plasma discharges lasting 30 minutes: Before the Federal Chancellor fired the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X, the researchers in Greifswald had started the fusion device on 10 December 2015 with an initial helium plasma. Since then, Wendelstein 7-X has produced more than 300 discharges with the rare gas, helium. These served primarily to clean the plasma vessel.

Having fired up the Wendelstein 7-X to produce helium plasma late last year, researchers have built on their early success to generate its first hydrogen plasma, an event they say begins the true scientific operation of the world's largest fusion stellarator. After a decade of construction, the Wendelstein 7-X fusion stellarator was finally started up in December last year. The device is designed to be magnetically efficient enough to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If this vision does one day become a reality, it could help to usher in an era of clean, reliable nuclear fusion power. But it's all about baby steps for scientists working at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), which houses the experimental device. Since producing the first helium plasma on December 10 last year, the Wendelstein 7-X has generated more than 300 discharges. The main purpose of these was to clean the plasma vessel walls, which in turn makes for higher temperatures, but it also allowed for testing of scientific instruments and data recording. \"This makes everything ready for the next step,\" says project boss Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" At a ceremony on Wednesday, quantum physicist (who also happens to be Germany's Federal Chancellor) Angela Merkel spoke for around 20 minutes, before pressing the button to initiate the test. This saw a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating convert a small amount of hydrogen gas into a low-density hydrogen plasma. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations,\" says IPP's Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch. The researchers will continue in this experimentation phase until mid-March. They will then open up the plasma vessel and install carbon tiles for better protection, along with a device designed to remove impurities. These enhancements will make for even higher temperatures and longer discharges lasting up to 10 seconds. They plan on making similar improvements over the next four years until Wendelstein 7-X can produce discharges lasting 30 minutes at a full heating power of 20 megawatts. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and one million man-hours, Wendelstein 7-X will never generate a single watt-hour of energy. Rather it is intended to establish the potential of stellarators as power plants by demonstrating their main advantage over tokamak fusion reactors, which is the ability to operate continuously rather than only in short bursts.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory physicists collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator fusion energy device in Greifswald, Germany, were on hand Feb. 3 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed a button to produce the reactor's first plasma of hydrogen- fueled superhot gas. The W7-X is a stellarator, a device that uses twisted magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. It is a departure from the more common fusion device used in fusion experiments, a donut-shaped device called a \"tokamak\" such as that used at PPPL. The German reactor is the result of an international collaboration, and PPPL's Hutch Neilson was the coordinator of the U.S. effort. \"It was a day of building excitement and it was a very happy mood because everything is working really well on the experiment,\" said Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. \"It was kind of amazing when the chancellor walked into the control room. Her eyes lit up.\" Scientists and dignitaries from around the world watched as Merkel pushed the button to create a hydrogen plasma that lasted a quarter of a second. But that was long enough to begin heating the plasma to 80 million degrees Celsius. By 2020, the W7-X is designed to produce a plasma that lasts up to 30 minutes and would demonstrate that stellarators could be a model for the fusion power plants of the future. Merkel acknowledged that there are \"huge scientific challenges\" and costs associated with developing fusion energy, but she said the possibility of developing fusion energy as a source of generating electric energy is worth the investment. \"Rising energy demands and the vision of an almost inexhaustible energy source are convincing arguments for investing in fusion,\" Merkel said. Neilson and Princeton University Vice President for PPPL A.J. Stewart Smith were among the select group of scientists in the W7-X control room, along with Ed Synakowski, Department of Energy Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. PPPL physicists Samuel Lazerson and Novimir Pablant also attended the event along with other U.S. collaborators. 'Major progress': Greeting Merkel on behalf of the U.S. delegation, Smith said the W7-X is a significant achievement that will lead to \"major progress for the understanding of plasma.\" \"The W7-X is a major step for fusion research. Princeton and the whole U.S. team are absolutely thrilled,\" Smith said to Merkel in German. \"We are so pleased to be involved in this exceptional event. \"I am very impressed by the professional way the IPP team was able to successfully build such a complex daunting machine,\" Smith said. \"The success of W7-X shows that the daunting challenges facing stellarators have been solved.\" The hydrogen plasma is \"a step on the path to making the device perform as planned,\" said David Gates, a PPPL physicist and stellarator physics lead, who was on hand at W7-X for the first test plasma and watched a live stream of the first hydrogen plasma in the PPPL auditorium. \"From a plasma physicist's point of view, this next phase of research is an important milestone.\" PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X scientists, which is funded by $4 million annually from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. PPPL scientists and technicians built some key components of the machine, which took some 20 years and 1 billion euro to build. PPPL researchers designed and delivered the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of plasma in fusion experiments. Physicists also designed and built an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the plasma temperature. A current project is the design and construction of divertor scraper units that intercept heat from the plasma to protect divertor targets from damage. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as researchers and students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, Auburn University, and Xantho Technologies, LLC. 'Exceeding expectations': Neilson said the experiment is already getting good results. \"We're getting data and physics results from it exceeding expectations for what everybody thought would be accomplished during this startup period,\" he said. PPPL researchers have already collaborated on research at the W7-X. Lazerson has been at the W7-X since March 2015 and performed one of the first experiments on the machine when he mapped the structure of the magnetic field and proved that the main magnet system and the trim coils that PPPL designed and had built in the U.S. were working as intended. He presented his research at the APS Division of Plasma Physics Conference in November. Pablant used the X-ray spectrometer to make the first plasma temperature measurements on W7-X. \"I was really proud of the American contingent for the work they've done,\" Neilson said the evening of the event. \"We've made ourselves as indispensable as it's possible to be. We're not on the periphery. We're doing things that matter.\" Two approaches to the same problem: Stellarators and tokamaks are two different approaches to the same difficult challenge of developing fusion as an energy source, and the W7-X is putting more attention on the potential of stellarators, Neilson said. \"The arrival of W7-X on the scene creates sort of a buzz about stellarators,\" Neilson said. \"I think in the U.S., the arrival of such an advanced machine, which is competitive with anything that's out there in terms of capabilities, is just bound to shift the conversation about stellarators.\" PPPL has taken a different approach to stellarators with its quasi- axisymmetric stellarator or QUASAR, which was not completed. With W7-X now operating, it could also lead the U.S. to reconsider stellarators, Neilson said. \"For 10 years, the focus is going to be on W7-X itself,\" he said, \"but it does create an atmosphere in which it's reasonable to ask, 'What about us?'\" PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas - ultra-hot, charged gases - and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. Results of PPPL research have ranged from a portable nuclear materials detector for anti-terrorist use to universally employed computer codes for analyzing and predicting the outcome of fusion experiments. The laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Two teams of PSFC researchers are collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X device, the world's largest fusion experiment designed in the stellarator line of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The PSFC has significant experience with a different configuration of magnetic confinement, having spent decades designing and running the Alcator series of high-magnetic-field tokamak experiments - the Alcator C-Mod device, located on campus, is the latest in that series. There are many similarities between the two designs, however. Both the tokamak and the stellarator seek to harness the energy released from the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to provide clean and safe electrical power. Both use helical (spiraling) magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma fuel in a donut-shaped chamber. In a tokamak, this field is generated both by external electromagnets and a large electrical current that is driven in the plasma itself. Driving and sustaining this plasma current, and its impact on stability and transport of energy and particles, is a major focus of the research at MIT. The stellarator concept takes a different approach. First invented by the noted astrophysicist and fusion pioneer Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1950, the stellarator provides the entire helical field through external electromagnets formed in highly complex and twisted shapes. Although the assembly of a modern stellarator like W7-X presents many engineering challenges, this approach has significant operational advantages. Because there is no need to drive a current in the plasma, the configuration is more readily extrapolated to steady-state, a necessity for economic operation of a fusion power plant. The magnetic field geometry of Wendelstein 7-X has been optimized using super-computer simulations of particle orbits. Consistent with its steady-state mission, W7-X has super-conducting coils and is designed to create and sustain hot plasma for up to 30 minutes. The immediate goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that the loss of particles can be kept small so that high temperatures can be achieved. In early phases of the experiment up to 10 megawatts of microwave power will be used to heat the plasma. Later, as much as 8 megawatts of neutral-beam power will be added, after water-cooled armor is installed to handle the exhaust heat. W7-X expects to produce plasmas with fusion-grade densities and temperatures 60-130 million degrees K. Future experiments at W7-X will address the role that plasma turbulence plays in limiting overall performance, and PSFC researchers are working with the W7-X group to investigate this. One PSFC team - principal research scientist Jim Terry and postdoctoral researcher Seung-Gyou Baek - will develop a fast camera system for viewing light emitted from the plasma, and will make important measurements of turbulence near the edge of the plasma. The other team - physics professor Miklos Porkolab and staff scientist Eric Edlund - will develop a specialized interferometer for imaging density fluctuations deep in the hot plasma core. The issues surrounding turbulence are important in stellarators, as they are in tokamaks, since turbulence moves heat and particles across the confining magnetic field faster than would otherwise occur. Both teams expect to have first measurements during the 2017 experimental campaign. These projects are supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics.", "url": "https://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2015/a-new-fusion-collaboration-for-mit-wendelstein-7-x-begins-operation"}, {"title": "Germany turned on its stellarator W7-X", "date": "2015-12-10", "content": "On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics fired up a monster machine that it hopes will change the world. The machine is called the Wendelstein 7-X, or W7-X for short. It's a type of nuclear-fusion machine called a stellarator and is the largest, most sophisticated of its kind. Nuclear fusion could prove to be a clean, inexhaustible energy source. But humans are still a ways from successfully building a reactor that could power a small town, let alone entire cities. But now, we're one step closer. On Thursday, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics tweeted out a beautiful image of the machine's first plasma - a gas in which all the electrons have been stripped from their atoms, a task that requires tremendous amounts of energy and is critical to achieving nuclear fusion. The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control plasma. This is the first confirmation that the machine is performing as planned. Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics completed construction of the $1.1 billion W7-X. The black horse of nuclear reactors: Known in the plasma physics community as the black horse of reactors that use nuclear fusion, stellarators are notoriously difficult to build. The GIF below shows the many different layers of W7-X, which took 19 years to complete: From 2003 to 2007, the project suffered some major construction setbacks - including one of its contracted manufacturers going out of business - that nearly brought down the whole endeavor. Only a handful of stellarators have been attempted, and even fewer have been completed. By comparison, the more popular cousin to the stellarator, the tokamak, is in wider use. Over three dozen tokamaks are operational around the world, and more than 200 have been built throughout history. These machines are easier to construct and, in the past, have performed better as a nuclear reactor than stellarators. But tokamaks have a major flaw that W7-X is reportedly immune to, suggesting that Germany's latest monster machine could be a game changer. How a nuclear-fusion reactor works: The key to a successful nuclear-fusion reactor of any kind is to generate, confine, and control a blob of gas, called a plasma, that has been heated to temperatures of more than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. At these blazing temperatures, the electrons are ripped from their atoms, forming ions. Normally the ions bounce off one another like bumper cars, but under these extreme conditions the repulsive forces are overcome. The ions are therefore able to collide and fuse together, which generates energy, and you have accomplished nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is different from what fuels today's nuclear reactors, which operate with energy from atoms that decay, or break apart, instead of fusing together. Nuclear fusion is the process that has been fueling our sun for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for another estimated 4 billion years. Once engineers have heated the gas in the reactor to the right temperature, they use super-chilled magnetic coils to generate powerful magnetic fields that contain and control the plasma. The W7-X, for example, houses 50 magnetic coils that each weigh 6 tons, shown in purple in the GIF below. The difference between tokamaks and stellarators: Tokamaks have for years been considered the most promising machine for producing energy in the way the sun does because the configuration of their magnetic coils contains a plasma that is better than that of currently operational stellarators. But there's a problem: Tokamaks can control the plasma only in short bursts that last for no more than seven minutes. And the energy necessary to generate that plasma is more than the energy engineers get from these periodic bursts. Tokamaks thus consume more energy than they produce, which is not what you want from nuclear-fusion reactors, which have been touted as the \" most important energy source over the next millennium. \" Because of the stellarators' design, experts suspect it could sustain a plasma for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is significantly longer than any tokamak. The French tokamak Tore Supra holds the record: Six minutes 30 seconds. If W7-X succeeds, it could turn the nuclear-fusion community on its head and launch stellarators into the limelight. \"The world is waiting to see if we get the confinement time and then hold it for a long pulse,\" David Gates, head of stellarator physics at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, told Science.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-turned-on-its-monster-stellarator-2015-10"}, {"title": "The Wendelstein 7-X nuclear fusion reactor just fired up for the first time, and it could make fossil fuels redundant", "date": "2015-12-16", "content": "Scientists are rejoicing after the inaugural test run of the Wendelstein 7-X fusion reactor last week.

According to the team operating the reactor, \"everything went according to plan,\" which means we are leaps and bounds closer to harnessing nuclear fusion technology for cleaner energy. The unique design of the W7-X stellarator, a device that recreates the fusion activity inside stars, could also mean more sustainable and safer operations for the future, as compared to typical fusion container designs. Called a \"tokamak,\" doughnut-shaped containers have historically been used to cage plasma within significantly cooled magnetic walls, yet the W7-X's design's twists and turns eliminate the need for a current within the magnetic mechanism. The structure was shaped by a supercomputer, keeping the plasma from touching the walls by making sure it travels at 700 miles per second. Professor Steven Cowley, head of the Centre for Fusion Energy in the UK, states, \"Wendelstein is a natural design which does without the current. It gets the magnetic field controlling the plasma to twist, using weird-shaped magnets. It's a different route to nuclear fusion.\" Compared to the UK's own JET machine, which has produced plasma from hydrogen at 250 million degrees Celsius and 16 megawatts of power through use of a powerful current, the costs of energy differ greatly. The need for an industrial scale fusion reactor to run 24/7 requires cheap, clean power. Ambitiously, the next project will be creating hydrogen plasma at much higher temperatures, which will be attempted in France for the cost of \u20ac15 billion with the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. The hope is that the reactor can create a \"fusion burn,\" which is a self-sustaining reaction only needed when firing the machine into motion. Crowley says, \"If it does burn - and all the predictions are that it will - it will be a Wright Brothers moment.\"", "url": "https://inhabitat.com/wendelstein-7-x-nuclear-reactor-fired-up-for-the-first-time-could-make-fossil-fuels-redundant/"}, {"title": "PPPL celebrates role in first research plasma on W7-X stellarator in Germany", "date": "2015-12-22", "content": "Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory have reason to celebrate the first plasma of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute in Greifswald, Germany earlier this month. The Laboratory has designed and contributed major components to the device and is collaborating on research. Three PPPL physicists attended the December 10 event. PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X, which is funded by $4 million from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as well as researchers and students from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Auburn. The W7-X stellarator is the largest and most advanced fusion experiment of its kind in the world and could yield promising solutions to some of the most difficult challenges in developing fusion energy. Stellarators are fusion devices that use twisting, potato chip-shaped magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. The W7-X is planned to be the first optimized stellarator to confine a hot plasma in a steady state for up to 30 minutes. In doing so, it could demonstrate that an optimized stellarator could be a model for future fusion reactors. PPPL's contributions to the W7-X include: Designing and delivering the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of the plasma in fusion experiments. Leading magnetic field mapping experiments with the trim coils showing that their effects on the magnetic configuration were as predicted. Designing and building a diagnostic device called an X-ray crystal spectrometer, one of several diagnostics created by U.S. researchers that will analyze experiments on W7-X. Currently building two divertor scraper units in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory that will intercept heat coming from the plasma to protect the W7-X divertor targets from damage. PPPL physicists who have worked extensively on W7-X include: Hutch Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. He coordinates the U.S. collaboration on W7-X and was in Greifswald, Germany at the IPP/W7-X for several months last year. David Gates, the stellarator physics leader at PPPL, was at the first plasma. Sam Lazerson, a physicist, is currently in Greifswald working at the W7-X.

Wendelstein 7-X, fired up in early December 2015 using helium; now it has started its experimental scientific operation. With Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest and most advanced fusion device of the stellarator type, researchers want to investigate this configuration's suitability for use in a power plant. \"For the Max Planck Society, the operational start of Wendelstein-7X is a milestone in its own history\", said Martin Stratmann, President of the Max Planck Society. Stratamnn went on to thank the Institute's researchers: \"You have achieved a true milestone in plasma physics and technical engineering on the road towards a sustainable energy supply in the 21st century.\" It did not take the Chancellor long to find the button she was expected to press in order to switch on the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X. Staff members at the Max Planck Institute had placed it on a glass cube, adorned with a laser-cut silhouette of the fusion plant, and prominently positioned it on a steel column at the edge of the control room. When Angela Merkel energetically pressed the glass cube, a bright glow flickered on a monitor and provided a glimpse into the heart of the plasma vessel. With the governmental switch of the button, a ceremony reached its peak, which marked the start of the device's scientific experimental operation. \"Every step we are taking on the long road towards a fusion power plant is a success,\" Angela Merkel said. After all, one the world's most pressing questions is how we can address the increasing energy needs of a growing world population without missing our climate goals. \"The benefits of fusion energy are obvious: hydrogen as a fuel is available to an almost unlimited degree. It is a clean energy source without climate-damaging CO2 emissions and long-lived radioactive waste. \" Werner Heisenberg vision comes true: In front of numerous guests from the realms of science and politics, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel triggered a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating, which transformed a tiny quantity of hydrogen gas into an extremely hot low-density hydrogen plasma. This entails separation of the electrons from the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms.

I am sure it would fill him with joy and pride to see us here today, \"Martin Stratmann said. Such fusion plants stood at the beginning of a long development, which might culminate in completely new possibilities of energy production. \"It is up to us to lay the scientific foundations for this, showcasing options which can be used by society and politics when the time has come,\" said the Max Planck President. A long-term investment in the future of energy supply: The booting up of first hydrogen plasma in the W7-X is to be followed by many other plasma experiments, with the goal of clarifying fundamental questions of plasma research. Chancellor Merkel also held a committed plea for basic research: \"The example of nuclear fusion has clearly demonstrated what a drawn-out and costly process basic research can be. Besides knowledge and a large portion of perseverance, it also requires creativity as well as audacity.\" Those who dared to venture into unexplored territory often did not know where their chosen path would lead them. Sometimes such paths would end in dead ends, and sometimes they would lead to completely unexpected additional insights. But without fundamental research certain findings could not be achieved. Basic research, so Merkel, lays the foundations for a better life. Erwin Sellering also praised the research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Research as a long-term investment aimed at meeting rising energy demand in the future. The Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern congratulated the staff of the Institute on their contribution: \"You carry out excellent work on the highest level.\" As Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, he was proud that the scientists of the region positioned themselves so prominently in the global scientific landscape. The goal: plasma discharges lasting 30 minutes: Before the Federal Chancellor fired the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X, the researchers in Greifswald had started the fusion device on 10 December 2015 with an initial helium plasma. Since then, Wendelstein 7-X has produced more than 300 discharges with the rare gas, helium. These served primarily to clean the plasma vessel.

Having fired up the Wendelstein 7-X to produce helium plasma late last year, researchers have built on their early success to generate its first hydrogen plasma, an event they say begins the true scientific operation of the world's largest fusion stellarator. After a decade of construction, the Wendelstein 7-X fusion stellarator was finally started up in December last year. The device is designed to be magnetically efficient enough to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If this vision does one day become a reality, it could help to usher in an era of clean, reliable nuclear fusion power. But it's all about baby steps for scientists working at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), which houses the experimental device. Since producing the first helium plasma on December 10 last year, the Wendelstein 7-X has generated more than 300 discharges. The main purpose of these was to clean the plasma vessel walls, which in turn makes for higher temperatures, but it also allowed for testing of scientific instruments and data recording. \"This makes everything ready for the next step,\" says project boss Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" At a ceremony on Wednesday, quantum physicist (who also happens to be Germany's Federal Chancellor) Angela Merkel spoke for around 20 minutes, before pressing the button to initiate the test. This saw a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating convert a small amount of hydrogen gas into a low-density hydrogen plasma. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations,\" says IPP's Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch. The researchers will continue in this experimentation phase until mid-March. They will then open up the plasma vessel and install carbon tiles for better protection, along with a device designed to remove impurities. These enhancements will make for even higher temperatures and longer discharges lasting up to 10 seconds. They plan on making similar improvements over the next four years until Wendelstein 7-X can produce discharges lasting 30 minutes at a full heating power of 20 megawatts. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and one million man-hours, Wendelstein 7-X will never generate a single watt-hour of energy. Rather it is intended to establish the potential of stellarators as power plants by demonstrating their main advantage over tokamak fusion reactors, which is the ability to operate continuously rather than only in short bursts.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory physicists collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator fusion energy device in Greifswald, Germany, were on hand Feb. 3 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed a button to produce the reactor's first plasma of hydrogen- fueled superhot gas. The W7-X is a stellarator, a device that uses twisted magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. It is a departure from the more common fusion device used in fusion experiments, a donut-shaped device called a \"tokamak\" such as that used at PPPL. The German reactor is the result of an international collaboration, and PPPL's Hutch Neilson was the coordinator of the U.S. effort. \"It was a day of building excitement and it was a very happy mood because everything is working really well on the experiment,\" said Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. \"It was kind of amazing when the chancellor walked into the control room. Her eyes lit up.\" Scientists and dignitaries from around the world watched as Merkel pushed the button to create a hydrogen plasma that lasted a quarter of a second. But that was long enough to begin heating the plasma to 80 million degrees Celsius. By 2020, the W7-X is designed to produce a plasma that lasts up to 30 minutes and would demonstrate that stellarators could be a model for the fusion power plants of the future. Merkel acknowledged that there are \"huge scientific challenges\" and costs associated with developing fusion energy, but she said the possibility of developing fusion energy as a source of generating electric energy is worth the investment. \"Rising energy demands and the vision of an almost inexhaustible energy source are convincing arguments for investing in fusion,\" Merkel said. Neilson and Princeton University Vice President for PPPL A.J. Stewart Smith were among the select group of scientists in the W7-X control room, along with Ed Synakowski, Department of Energy Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. PPPL physicists Samuel Lazerson and Novimir Pablant also attended the event along with other U.S. collaborators. 'Major progress': Greeting Merkel on behalf of the U.S. delegation, Smith said the W7-X is a significant achievement that will lead to \"major progress for the understanding of plasma.\" \"The W7-X is a major step for fusion research. Princeton and the whole U.S. team are absolutely thrilled,\" Smith said to Merkel in German. \"We are so pleased to be involved in this exceptional event. \"I am very impressed by the professional way the IPP team was able to successfully build such a complex daunting machine,\" Smith said. \"The success of W7-X shows that the daunting challenges facing stellarators have been solved.\" The hydrogen plasma is \"a step on the path to making the device perform as planned,\" said David Gates, a PPPL physicist and stellarator physics lead, who was on hand at W7-X for the first test plasma and watched a live stream of the first hydrogen plasma in the PPPL auditorium. \"From a plasma physicist's point of view, this next phase of research is an important milestone.\" PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X scientists, which is funded by $4 million annually from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. PPPL scientists and technicians built some key components of the machine, which took some 20 years and 1 billion euro to build. PPPL researchers designed and delivered the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of plasma in fusion experiments. Physicists also designed and built an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the plasma temperature. A current project is the design and construction of divertor scraper units that intercept heat from the plasma to protect divertor targets from damage. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as researchers and students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, Auburn University, and Xantho Technologies, LLC. 'Exceeding expectations': Neilson said the experiment is already getting good results. \"We're getting data and physics results from it exceeding expectations for what everybody thought would be accomplished during this startup period,\" he said. PPPL researchers have already collaborated on research at the W7-X. Lazerson has been at the W7-X since March 2015 and performed one of the first experiments on the machine when he mapped the structure of the magnetic field and proved that the main magnet system and the trim coils that PPPL designed and had built in the U.S. were working as intended. He presented his research at the APS Division of Plasma Physics Conference in November. Pablant used the X-ray spectrometer to make the first plasma temperature measurements on W7-X. \"I was really proud of the American contingent for the work they've done,\" Neilson said the evening of the event. \"We've made ourselves as indispensable as it's possible to be. We're not on the periphery. We're doing things that matter.\" Two approaches to the same problem: Stellarators and tokamaks are two different approaches to the same difficult challenge of developing fusion as an energy source, and the W7-X is putting more attention on the potential of stellarators, Neilson said. \"The arrival of W7-X on the scene creates sort of a buzz about stellarators,\" Neilson said. \"I think in the U.S., the arrival of such an advanced machine, which is competitive with anything that's out there in terms of capabilities, is just bound to shift the conversation about stellarators.\" PPPL has taken a different approach to stellarators with its quasi- axisymmetric stellarator or QUASAR, which was not completed. With W7-X now operating, it could also lead the U.S. to reconsider stellarators, Neilson said. \"For 10 years, the focus is going to be on W7-X itself,\" he said, \"but it does create an atmosphere in which it's reasonable to ask, 'What about us?'\" PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas - ultra-hot, charged gases - and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. Results of PPPL research have ranged from a portable nuclear materials detector for anti-terrorist use to universally employed computer codes for analyzing and predicting the outcome of fusion experiments. The laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Staff members at the Max Planck Institute had placed it on a glass cube, adorned with a laser-cut silhouette of the fusion plant, and prominently positioned it on a steel column at the edge of the control room. When Angela Merkel energetically pressed the glass cube, a bright glow flickered on a monitor and provided a glimpse into the heart of the plasma vessel. With the governmental switch of the button, a ceremony reached its peak, which marked the start of the device's scientific experimental operation. \"Every step we are taking on the long road towards a fusion power plant is a success,\" Angela Merkel said. After all, one the world's most pressing questions is how we can address the increasing energy needs of a growing world population without missing our climate goals. \"The benefits of fusion energy are obvious: hydrogen as a fuel is available to an almost unlimited degree. It is a clean energy source without climate-damaging CO2 emissions and long-lived radioactive waste. \" Werner Heisenberg vision comes true: In front of numerous guests from the realms of science and politics, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel triggered a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating, which transformed a tiny quantity of hydrogen gas into an extremely hot low-density hydrogen plasma. This entails separation of the electrons from the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms. Confined in the magnetic cage generated by Wendelstein 7-X, the charged particles levitate without making contact with the walls of the plasma chamber. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations\", states Hans-Stephan Bosch, whose division is responsible for operation of Wendelstein 7-X. \"With Wendelstein 7-X, part of Werner Heisenberg's vision has come true. I am sure it would fill him with joy and pride to see us here today, \"Martin Stratmann said. Such fusion plants stood at the beginning of a long development, which might culminate in completely new possibilities of energy production. \"It is up to us to lay the scientific foundations for this, showcasing options which can be used by society and politics when the time has come,\" said the Max Planck President. A long-term investment in the future of energy supply: The booting up of first hydrogen plasma in the W7-X is to be followed by many other plasma experiments, with the goal of clarifying fundamental questions of plasma research. Chancellor Merkel also held a committed plea for basic research: \"The example of nuclear fusion has clearly demonstrated what a drawn-out and costly process basic research can be. Besides knowledge and a large portion of perseverance, it also requires creativity as well as audacity.\" Those who dared to venture into unexplored territory often did not know where their chosen path would lead them. Sometimes such paths would end in dead ends, and sometimes they would lead to completely unexpected additional insights. But without fundamental research certain findings could not be achieved. Basic research, so Merkel, lays the foundations for a better life. Erwin Sellering also praised the research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Research as a long-term investment aimed at meeting rising energy demand in the future. The Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern congratulated the staff of the Institute on their contribution: \"You carry out excellent work on the highest level.\" As Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, he was proud that the scientists of the region positioned themselves so prominently in the global scientific landscape. The goal: plasma discharges lasting 30 minutes: Before the Federal Chancellor fired the first hydrogen plasma in Wendelstein 7-X, the researchers in Greifswald had started the fusion device on 10 December 2015 with an initial helium plasma. Since then, Wendelstein 7-X has produced more than 300 discharges with the rare gas, helium. These served primarily to clean the plasma vessel. The cleaner the vessel wall, the more the plasma temperature increased, finally attaining six million degrees. In addition, plasma heating and data recording were tested, and the first measuring facilities for investigating the plasma were put into operation, viz. complex instrumentation such as X-ray spectrometers, interferometers, laser scattering and video diagnostics. \"This makes everything ready for the next step\", states Project Head Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" The present initial experimentation phase will last until mid-March. The plasma vessel will then be opened in order to install carbon tiles for protecting the vessel walls and a so-called \"divertor\" for removing impurities. \"These facilities will enable us to attain higher heating powers, higher temperatures, and longer discharges lasting up to ten seconds\", explains Thomas Klinger. Successive extensions are planned until, in about four years, discharges lasting 30 minutes can be produced and it can be checked at the full heating power of 20 megawatts whether Wendelstein 7-X will achieve its optimisation targets.", "url": "https://www.mpg.de/9926419/wendelstein7x-start"}, {"title": "Germany's Wendelstein 7-X fusion reactor produces its first flash of hydrogen plasma", "date": "2016-02-04", "content": "Experimentation with Germany's newest fusion reactor is beginning to heat up, to temperatures of around 80 million degrees Celsius, to be precise. Having fired up the Wendelstein 7-X to produce helium plasma late last year, researchers have built on their early success to generate its first hydrogen plasma, an event they say begins the true scientific operation of the world's largest fusion stellarator. After a decade of construction, the Wendelstein 7-X fusion stellarator was finally started up in December last year. The device is designed to be magnetically efficient enough to continuously contain super-hot plasma in its magnetic field for more than 30 minutes at a time. If this vision does one day become a reality, it could help to usher in an era of clean, reliable nuclear fusion power. But it's all about baby steps for scientists working at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), which houses the experimental device. Since producing the first helium plasma on December 10 last year, the Wendelstein 7-X has generated more than 300 discharges. The main purpose of these was to clean the plasma vessel walls, which in turn makes for higher temperatures, but it also allowed for testing of scientific instruments and data recording. \"This makes everything ready for the next step,\" says project boss Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" At a ceremony on Wednesday, quantum physicist (who also happens to be Germany's Federal Chancellor) Angela Merkel spoke for around 20 minutes, before pressing the button to initiate the test. This saw a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating convert a small amount of hydrogen gas into a low-density hydrogen plasma. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations,\" says IPP's Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch. The researchers will continue in this experimentation phase until mid-March. They will then open up the plasma vessel and install carbon tiles for better protection, along with a device designed to remove impurities. These enhancements will make for even higher temperatures and longer discharges lasting up to 10 seconds. They plan on making similar improvements over the next four years until Wendelstein 7-X can produce discharges lasting 30 minutes at a full heating power of 20 megawatts. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and one million man-hours, Wendelstein 7-X will never generate a single watt-hour of energy. Rather it is intended to establish the potential of stellarators as power plants by demonstrating their main advantage over tokamak fusion reactors, which is the ability to operate continuously rather than only in short bursts.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory physicists collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator fusion energy device in Greifswald, Germany, were on hand Feb. 3 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed a button to produce the reactor's first plasma of hydrogen- fueled superhot gas. The W7-X is a stellarator, a device that uses twisted magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. It is a departure from the more common fusion device used in fusion experiments, a donut-shaped device called a \"tokamak\" such as that used at PPPL. The German reactor is the result of an international collaboration, and PPPL's Hutch Neilson was the coordinator of the U.S. effort. \"It was a day of building excitement and it was a very happy mood because everything is working really well on the experiment,\" said Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. \"It was kind of amazing when the chancellor walked into the control room. Her eyes lit up.\" Scientists and dignitaries from around the world watched as Merkel pushed the button to create a hydrogen plasma that lasted a quarter of a second. But that was long enough to begin heating the plasma to 80 million degrees Celsius. By 2020, the W7-X is designed to produce a plasma that lasts up to 30 minutes and would demonstrate that stellarators could be a model for the fusion power plants of the future. Merkel acknowledged that there are \"huge scientific challenges\" and costs associated with developing fusion energy, but she said the possibility of developing fusion energy as a source of generating electric energy is worth the investment. \"Rising energy demands and the vision of an almost inexhaustible energy source are convincing arguments for investing in fusion,\" Merkel said. Neilson and Princeton University Vice President for PPPL A.J. Stewart Smith were among the select group of scientists in the W7-X control room, along with Ed Synakowski, Department of Energy Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. PPPL physicists Samuel Lazerson and Novimir Pablant also attended the event along with other U.S. collaborators. 'Major progress': Greeting Merkel on behalf of the U.S. delegation, Smith said the W7-X is a significant achievement that will lead to \"major progress for the understanding of plasma.\" \"The W7-X is a major step for fusion research. Princeton and the whole U.S. team are absolutely thrilled,\" Smith said to Merkel in German. \"We are so pleased to be involved in this exceptional event. \"I am very impressed by the professional way the IPP team was able to successfully build such a complex daunting machine,\" Smith said. \"The success of W7-X shows that the daunting challenges facing stellarators have been solved.\" The hydrogen plasma is \"a step on the path to making the device perform as planned,\" said David Gates, a PPPL physicist and stellarator physics lead, who was on hand at W7-X for the first test plasma and watched a live stream of the first hydrogen plasma in the PPPL auditorium. \"From a plasma physicist's point of view, this next phase of research is an important milestone.\" PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X scientists, which is funded by $4 million annually from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. PPPL scientists and technicians built some key components of the machine, which took some 20 years and 1 billion euro to build. PPPL researchers designed and delivered the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of plasma in fusion experiments. Physicists also designed and built an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the plasma temperature. A current project is the design and construction of divertor scraper units that intercept heat from the plasma to protect divertor targets from damage. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as researchers and students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, Auburn University, and Xantho Technologies, LLC. 'Exceeding expectations': Neilson said the experiment is already getting good results. \"We're getting data and physics results from it exceeding expectations for what everybody thought would be accomplished during this startup period,\" he said. PPPL researchers have already collaborated on research at the W7-X. Lazerson has been at the W7-X since March 2015 and performed one of the first experiments on the machine when he mapped the structure of the magnetic field and proved that the main magnet system and the trim coils that PPPL designed and had built in the U.S. were working as intended. He presented his research at the APS Division of Plasma Physics Conference in November. Pablant used the X-ray spectrometer to make the first plasma temperature measurements on W7-X. \"I was really proud of the American contingent for the work they've done,\" Neilson said the evening of the event. \"We've made ourselves as indispensable as it's possible to be. We're not on the periphery. We're doing things that matter.\" Two approaches to the same problem: Stellarators and tokamaks are two different approaches to the same difficult challenge of developing fusion as an energy source, and the W7-X is putting more attention on the potential of stellarators, Neilson said. \"The arrival of W7-X on the scene creates sort of a buzz about stellarators,\" Neilson said. \"I think in the U.S., the arrival of such an advanced machine, which is competitive with anything that's out there in terms of capabilities, is just bound to shift the conversation about stellarators.\" PPPL has taken a different approach to stellarators with its quasi- axisymmetric stellarator or QUASAR, which was not completed. With W7-X now operating, it could also lead the U.S. to reconsider stellarators, Neilson said. \"For 10 years, the focus is going to be on W7-X itself,\" he said, \"but it does create an atmosphere in which it's reasonable to ask, 'What about us?'\" PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas - ultra-hot, charged gases - and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. Results of PPPL research have ranged from a portable nuclear materials detector for anti-terrorist use to universally employed computer codes for analyzing and predicting the outcome of fusion experiments. The laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

The production of the first hydrogen plasma followed on 3 February 2016 and marked the start of the experimental operation of the device. The purpose of the Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device, is to investigate the suitability of this configuration for use in a power plant. The assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X started in April 2005: the centrepiece of the device is a ring consisting of 50 approximately 3.5-metre-tall superconducting magnetic coils. Their special shapes are the result of elaborate optimization calculations carried out by the IPP's \"Stellarator Theory\" division and the quest for a particularly effective heat-insulating magnetic cage that took over ten years. The coils are threaded onto a steel plasma vessel and enclosed in a ring-shaped steel casing. In their vacuum-pumped interior space, the coils are cooled down to a superconduction temperature close to absolute zero using liquid helium. Thus, they consume practically no energy once they are switched on. The magnetic cage generated by them can keep the 30 cubic metres of ultra-thin plasma suspended continuously, i.e. for up to 30 minutes. Following a construction period of nine years and over one million assembly hours, the main work involved in the assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X was completed in April 2014. Preparation for the operation of the device then began: all of the technical systems were tested in turn - the vacuum in the vessels, the cooling system, the superconducting coils and the magnetic field they generate, the control system, and the heating and measuring devices. On 10 December 2015, the big day had arrived: The operating team in the control room energized the magnetic field and launched the computer-operated experiment control system. It fed around one milligram of helium gas into the evacuated plasma vessel and switched on the microwave heating for a short 1.3-megawatt pulse: the first plasma in the machine was observed by the installed cameras and measuring devices. It lasted one tenth of a second and reached a temperature of around one million degrees Celsius. It was decided to use helium as a working gas for the launch of the device, as the noble gas is easier to ionize than the subsequent test object hydrogen. Hydrogen forms molecules that must first be broken up by the microwaves, and then tend to react chemically with the wall of the vessel. This can be avoided with the chemically-inert atomic helium. As a result, a plasma can be developed more easily and safely than with hydrogen. In addition, the heavy helium ions are more efficient when it comes to cleaning the vessel walls, on which water and tiny dirt particles had accumulated during the lengthy assembly period. This emerged clearly from the subsequent approximately 300 helium discharges carried out in the Wendelstein 7-X. The cleaner the vessel walls, the higher the temperature attained by the plasma. In addition, the microwave heating and data recording were tested during these initial discharges and the measuring instruments for observing the plasma were operated for the first time. These include the interferometer, laser scattering and video diagnostics, and the x-ray spectrometer. The discharges were characterized by very high electron temperatures at the beginning of the microwave pulse - approximately 10 keV, i.e. 100 million degrees Celsius at a density of around 1019 particles per cubic metre and four megawatts of microwave output, followed by increasing densities and ion temperatures of up to 1020 particles per cubic metre and 2 keV (Fig. 2). The moderate temperatures measured on the wall covering indicate that stationary conditions were not yet reached and a large proportion of the heat power is used to increase the plasma energy. The generation of the first hydrogen plasma followed on 3 February 2016 as part of a ceremonial event with a large number of guests from the fields of science and politics (Fig. 3). When German Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel pressed the button, a 2-megawatt pulse from the microwave heating system transformed approximately one milligram of hydrogen gas into an ultra-thin hot hydrogen plasma. The plasma ions reached a temperature of around 10 million degrees Celsius and the plasma electrons reached a temperature of around 100 million degrees Celsius. Research tasks of Wendelstein 7-X: The aim of the international fusion research is to develop a climate- and environmentally-friendly power station which generates energy using the fusion of atomic nuclei. Two different configurations have emerged for the magnetic cage, the tokamak and the stellarator. The IPP is the only institute in the world that is testing the two different types simultaneously: the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Greifswald (Fig. 4) and the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak in Garching. This enables the direct comparison of the two configurations. The current view is that an energy-producing plasma can only be generated by a tokamak - the international test[IM1] reactor ITER, which is currently being under construction as a global cooperative project in Cadarache. The Wendelstein 7-X, the world's biggest stellarator-type fusion device, will not generate any energy; however, the system should demonstrate that stellarators are also capable of becoming power stations. With the Wendelstein 7-X, it is intended to show for the first time that a stellarator can achieve the same plasma containment quality as a tokamak. With the Wendelstein 7-X's 30-minute-long discharges, it is intended to demonstrate the key advantage of the stellarator: i.e. the capacity to operate for extended periods. As opposed to this, without complicated additional measures, tokamaks can only work in pulses. The modular coils for the generation of the magnetic field play a key role in attaining this objective. Thanks to their curved shape, they generate the entire magnetic field and dispense with the need for a current in the plasma as required by the tokamak. Moreover, thanks to the irregular coils, the stellarator's magnetic field can be generated relatively freely so that its local strength and curvature can be optimally adapted to the physical laws of the hot plasma. The optimized magnetic field should fulfil seven of the requirements identified for a power plant at once: first, the plasma pressure should have a low retroactive effect on the containing magnetic field and, second, a high quality magnetic field and resilience to possible magnetic field perturbations are required. Third, the energy density of the plasma needed for the economically viable operation of a power station with a sufficiently low magnetic field must be provided. Fourth, the plasma heat loss should be in the right range - the heat losses in the earlier stellarator models were unacceptably high. Fifth, the so-called \"bootstrap\" current must be negligible. This ring current arises through the drop in radial density and temperature and could cause the undesirable deformation of the magnetic field. Sixth, fast particles must also be well contained - a particularly weak point in the \"classic\" stellarators. In a future power plant, the rapid helium nuclei that arise during fusion must keep the plasma at fusion temperature when the external heating is switched off. Seventh, and finally, it must be possible to construct the magnetic field cage using a system of modular superconducting coils in a way that is as technically simple and cost-effective as possible. These seven criteria required the formulation of complex new computer codes. Another prerequisite was the development of suitable computing methods to channel the large codes through the computer at an acceptable speed. This optimization was only possible thanks to the development of the 1980s generation of supercomputers.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2016-06-scientific-experimentation-wendelstein-x-fusion.html"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Wendelstein 7-X fusion device produces its first hydrogen plasma", "date": "2016-02-03", "content": "The Wendelstein 7-X fusion device at Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald produced its first hydrogen plasma on 3 February 2016.

The main purpose of these was to clean the plasma vessel walls, which in turn makes for higher temperatures, but it also allowed for testing of scientific instruments and data recording. \"This makes everything ready for the next step,\" says project boss Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger. \"We are changing from helium to hydrogen plasmas, our proper subject of investigation.\" At a ceremony on Wednesday, quantum physicist (who also happens to be Germany's Federal Chancellor) Angela Merkel spoke for around 20 minutes, before pressing the button to initiate the test. This saw a 2-megawatt pulse of microwave heating convert a small amount of hydrogen gas into a low-density hydrogen plasma. \"With a temperature of 80 million degrees and a lifetime of a quarter of a second, the device's first hydrogen plasma has completely lived up to our expectations,\" says IPP's Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch. The researchers will continue in this experimentation phase until mid-March. They will then open up the plasma vessel and install carbon tiles for better protection, along with a device designed to remove impurities. These enhancements will make for even higher temperatures and longer discharges lasting up to 10 seconds. They plan on making similar improvements over the next four years until Wendelstein 7-X can produce discharges lasting 30 minutes at a full heating power of 20 megawatts. At a cost of more than \u20ac1 billion ($US 1.1 billion) and one million man-hours, Wendelstein 7-X will never generate a single watt-hour of energy. Rather it is intended to establish the potential of stellarators as power plants by demonstrating their main advantage over tokamak fusion reactors, which is the ability to operate continuously rather than only in short bursts.

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory physicists collaborating on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator fusion energy device in Greifswald, Germany, were on hand Feb. 3 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed a button to produce the reactor's first plasma of hydrogen- fueled superhot gas. The W7-X is a stellarator, a device that uses twisted magnetic coils to confine the plasma that fuels fusion reactions in a three-dimensional and steady-state magnetic field. It is a departure from the more common fusion device used in fusion experiments, a donut-shaped device called a \"tokamak\" such as that used at PPPL. The German reactor is the result of an international collaboration, and PPPL's Hutch Neilson was the coordinator of the U.S. effort. \"It was a day of building excitement and it was a very happy mood because everything is working really well on the experiment,\" said Neilson, head of advanced projects at PPPL. \"It was kind of amazing when the chancellor walked into the control room. Her eyes lit up.\" Scientists and dignitaries from around the world watched as Merkel pushed the button to create a hydrogen plasma that lasted a quarter of a second. But that was long enough to begin heating the plasma to 80 million degrees Celsius. By 2020, the W7-X is designed to produce a plasma that lasts up to 30 minutes and would demonstrate that stellarators could be a model for the fusion power plants of the future. Merkel acknowledged that there are \"huge scientific challenges\" and costs associated with developing fusion energy, but she said the possibility of developing fusion energy as a source of generating electric energy is worth the investment. \"Rising energy demands and the vision of an almost inexhaustible energy source are convincing arguments for investing in fusion,\" Merkel said. Neilson and Princeton University Vice President for PPPL A.J. Stewart Smith were among the select group of scientists in the W7-X control room, along with Ed Synakowski, Department of Energy Associate Director of Science for Fusion Energy Sciences. PPPL physicists Samuel Lazerson and Novimir Pablant also attended the event along with other U.S. collaborators. 'Major progress': Greeting Merkel on behalf of the U.S. delegation, Smith said the W7-X is a significant achievement that will lead to \"major progress for the understanding of plasma.\" \"The W7-X is a major step for fusion research. Princeton and the whole U.S. team are absolutely thrilled,\" Smith said to Merkel in German. \"We are so pleased to be involved in this exceptional event. \"I am very impressed by the professional way the IPP team was able to successfully build such a complex daunting machine,\" Smith said. \"The success of W7-X shows that the daunting challenges facing stellarators have been solved.\" The hydrogen plasma is \"a step on the path to making the device perform as planned,\" said David Gates, a PPPL physicist and stellarator physics lead, who was on hand at W7-X for the first test plasma and watched a live stream of the first hydrogen plasma in the PPPL auditorium. \"From a plasma physicist's point of view, this next phase of research is an important milestone.\" PPPL leads the U.S. collaboration with W7-X scientists, which is funded by $4 million annually from the Department of Energy's Office of Science. PPPL scientists and technicians built some key components of the machine, which took some 20 years and 1 billion euro to build. PPPL researchers designed and delivered the five massive 2,400-pound trim coils that fine-tune the shape of plasma in fusion experiments. Physicists also designed and built an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the plasma temperature. A current project is the design and construction of divertor scraper units that intercept heat from the plasma to protect divertor targets from damage. Collaborators include researchers from Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, as well as researchers and students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, Auburn University, and Xantho Technologies, LLC. 'Exceeding expectations': Neilson said the experiment is already getting good results. \"We're getting data and physics results from it exceeding expectations for what everybody thought would be accomplished during this startup period,\" he said. PPPL researchers have already collaborated on research at the W7-X. Lazerson has been at the W7-X since March 2015 and performed one of the first experiments on the machine when he mapped the structure of the magnetic field and proved that the main magnet system and the trim coils that PPPL designed and had built in the U.S. were working as intended. He presented his research at the APS Division of Plasma Physics Conference in November. Pablant used the X-ray spectrometer to make the first plasma temperature measurements on W7-X. \"I was really proud of the American contingent for the work they've done,\" Neilson said the evening of the event. \"We've made ourselves as indispensable as it's possible to be. We're not on the periphery. We're doing things that matter.\" Two approaches to the same problem: Stellarators and tokamaks are two different approaches to the same difficult challenge of developing fusion as an energy source, and the W7-X is putting more attention on the potential of stellarators, Neilson said. \"The arrival of W7-X on the scene creates sort of a buzz about stellarators,\" Neilson said. \"I think in the U.S., the arrival of such an advanced machine, which is competitive with anything that's out there in terms of capabilities, is just bound to shift the conversation about stellarators.\" PPPL has taken a different approach to stellarators with its quasi- axisymmetric stellarator or QUASAR, which was not completed. With W7-X now operating, it could also lead the U.S. to reconsider stellarators, Neilson said. \"For 10 years, the focus is going to be on W7-X itself,\" he said, \"but it does create an atmosphere in which it's reasonable to ask, 'What about us?'\" PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas - ultra-hot, charged gases - and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. Results of PPPL research have ranged from a portable nuclear materials detector for anti-terrorist use to universally employed computer codes for analyzing and predicting the outcome of fusion experiments. The laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

The production of the first hydrogen plasma followed on 3 February 2016 and marked the start of the experimental operation of the device. The purpose of the Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device, is to investigate the suitability of this configuration for use in a power plant. The assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X started in April 2005: the centrepiece of the device is a ring consisting of 50 approximately 3.5-metre-tall superconducting magnetic coils. Their special shapes are the result of elaborate optimization calculations carried out by the IPP's \"Stellarator Theory\" division and the quest for a particularly effective heat-insulating magnetic cage that took over ten years. The coils are threaded onto a steel plasma vessel and enclosed in a ring-shaped steel casing. In their vacuum-pumped interior space, the coils are cooled down to a superconduction temperature close to absolute zero using liquid helium. Thus, they consume practically no energy once they are switched on. The magnetic cage generated by them can keep the 30 cubic metres of ultra-thin plasma suspended continuously, i.e. for up to 30 minutes. Following a construction period of nine years and over one million assembly hours, the main work involved in the assembly of the Wendelstein 7-X was completed in April 2014. Preparation for the operation of the device then began: all of the technical systems were tested in turn - the vacuum in the vessels, the cooling system, the superconducting coils and the magnetic field they generate, the control system, and the heating and measuring devices. On 10 December 2015, the big day had arrived: The operating team in the control room energized the magnetic field and launched the computer-operated experiment control system. It fed around one milligram of helium gas into the evacuated plasma vessel and switched on the microwave heating for a short 1.3-megawatt pulse: the first plasma in the machine was observed by the installed cameras and measuring devices. It lasted one tenth of a second and reached a temperature of around one million degrees Celsius. It was decided to use helium as a working gas for the launch of the device, as the noble gas is easier to ionize than the subsequent test object hydrogen. Hydrogen forms molecules that must first be broken up by the microwaves, and then tend to react chemically with the wall of the vessel. This can be avoided with the chemically-inert atomic helium. As a result, a plasma can be developed more easily and safely than with hydrogen. In addition, the heavy helium ions are more efficient when it comes to cleaning the vessel walls, on which water and tiny dirt particles had accumulated during the lengthy assembly period. This emerged clearly from the subsequent approximately 300 helium discharges carried out in the Wendelstein 7-X. The cleaner the vessel walls, the higher the temperature attained by the plasma. In addition, the microwave heating and data recording were tested during these initial discharges and the measuring instruments for observing the plasma were operated for the first time. These include the interferometer, laser scattering and video diagnostics, and the x-ray spectrometer. The discharges were characterized by very high electron temperatures at the beginning of the microwave pulse - approximately 10 keV, i.e. 100 million degrees Celsius at a density of around 1019 particles per cubic metre and four megawatts of microwave output, followed by increasing densities and ion temperatures of up to 1020 particles per cubic metre and 2 keV (Fig. 2). The moderate temperatures measured on the wall covering indicate that stationary conditions were not yet reached and a large proportion of the heat power is used to increase the plasma energy. The generation of the first hydrogen plasma followed on 3 February 2016 as part of a ceremonial event with a large number of guests from the fields of science and politics (Fig. 3). When German Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel pressed the button, a 2-megawatt pulse from the microwave heating system transformed approximately one milligram of hydrogen gas into an ultra-thin hot hydrogen plasma. The plasma ions reached a temperature of around 10 million degrees Celsius and the plasma electrons reached a temperature of around 100 million degrees Celsius. Research tasks of Wendelstein 7-X: The aim of the international fusion research is to develop a climate- and environmentally-friendly power station which generates energy using the fusion of atomic nuclei. Two different configurations have emerged for the magnetic cage, the tokamak and the stellarator. The IPP is the only institute in the world that is testing the two different types simultaneously: the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Greifswald (Fig. 4) and the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak in Garching. This enables the direct comparison of the two configurations. The current view is that an energy-producing plasma can only be generated by a tokamak - the international test[IM1] reactor ITER, which is currently being under construction as a global cooperative project in Cadarache. The Wendelstein 7-X, the world's biggest stellarator-type fusion device, will not generate any energy; however, the system should demonstrate that stellarators are also capable of becoming power stations. With the Wendelstein 7-X, it is intended to show for the first time that a stellarator can achieve the same plasma containment quality as a tokamak. With the Wendelstein 7-X's 30-minute-long discharges, it is intended to demonstrate the key advantage of the stellarator: i.e. the capacity to operate for extended periods. As opposed to this, without complicated additional measures, tokamaks can only work in pulses. The modular coils for the generation of the magnetic field play a key role in attaining this objective. Thanks to their curved shape, they generate the entire magnetic field and dispense with the need for a current in the plasma as required by the tokamak. Moreover, thanks to the irregular coils, the stellarator's magnetic field can be generated relatively freely so that its local strength and curvature can be optimally adapted to the physical laws of the hot plasma. The optimized magnetic field should fulfil seven of the requirements identified for a power plant at once: first, the plasma pressure should have a low retroactive effect on the containing magnetic field and, second, a high quality magnetic field and resilience to possible magnetic field perturbations are required. Third, the energy density of the plasma needed for the economically viable operation of a power station with a sufficiently low magnetic field must be provided. Fourth, the plasma heat loss should be in the right range - the heat losses in the earlier stellarator models were unacceptably high. Fifth, the so-called \"bootstrap\" current must be negligible. This ring current arises through the drop in radial density and temperature and could cause the undesirable deformation of the magnetic field. Sixth, fast particles must also be well contained - a particularly weak point in the \"classic\" stellarators. In a future power plant, the rapid helium nuclei that arise during fusion must keep the plasma at fusion temperature when the external heating is switched off. Seventh, and finally, it must be possible to construct the magnetic field cage using a system of modular superconducting coils in a way that is as technically simple and cost-effective as possible. These seven criteria required the formulation of complex new computer codes. Another prerequisite was the development of suitable computing methods to channel the large codes through the computer at an acceptable speed. This optimization was only possible thanks to the development of the 1980s generation of supercomputers.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2016-06-scientific-experimentation-wendelstein-x-fusion.html"}, {"title": "Wendelstein 7-X: Upgrading after successful first round of experiments", "date": "2016-07-08", "content": "After about 2,200 plasma pulses since operation began in December 2015 the first experimental campaign on the Wendelstein 7-X research device at Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald was successfully concluded in March.

Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest fusion device of the stellarator type, is to investigate the suitability of this configuration for use in a power plant. Since the start of operation in December 2015 plasmas have been continuously produced in Wendelstein 7-X - first from helium gas and, since February 2016, from hydrogen. A tiny quantity of gas has been transformed about 2,200 times by microwave heating into an extremely hot plasma of ultra-low density, this involving separation of the electrons from the nuclei of the helium or hydrogen atoms. Confined in the magnetic cage of Wendelstein 7-X, the charged particles levitate between the walls of the plasma chamber with almost no contact. \"We are more than satisfied with the results of the first experimental campaign\", states Project Head Professor Thomas Klinger. Starting off from the then attainable pulse length of half a second, pulse lengths of six seconds were ultimately achieved. The plasmas with the highest temperatures were produced by microwave heating powers of four megawatts lasting one second: At mean plasma densities the physicists were able to measure temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius for the plasma electrons, and 10 million degrees for the ions. \"This greatly exceeded what our rather cautious predictions had led us to believe\", says Thomas Klinger. Moreover, the structure and confinement properties of the novel magnetic field proved in the first tests to be as good as expected. Further physical investigations, e.g. on the heat load distribution at the wall or on the influence of the external trimming coils, were accompanied by technical discharges for cleaning the plasma vessel or checking the machine systems, viz. magnets, cooling system, microwave heating and machine control. The experiments were concluded as scheduled on 10 March. Meanwhile the plasma vessel has been re-opened in order to mount 6,000 carbon tiles to protect the vessel walls and insert the divertor: The tiles are installed on the wall of the plasma vessel in ten broad strips conforming to the winding contour of the plasma edge. This is because at the edge of the plasma vessel energy and particles encroach on limited sectors of the vessel wall. If these wall sectors are protected by special divertor plates, the impinging particles can be neutralised and pumped off along with undesirable impurities. This makes the divertor an important tool for controlling impurities and the density of the plasma. The wall elements and their support structures were designed and manufactured at IPP in Garching in cooperation with external companies. Installation of the 6,200 differently shaped wall tiles and 10 divertor modules must be done to a precision of one to two millimetres, this being no easy matter in the asymmetric plasma vessel: \"After exact measurement of the inside wall we therefore compare the wall dimensions with the tile measurements by a numerical method and modify, where necessary, the tiles with a computer-controlled milling cutter\", explains Mathias M\u00fcller from Greifswald's Technical Services. Installation will last till mid-2017: Wendelstein 7-X with clad wall will then be fit for high-power plasmas with heating powers of up to eight megawatts lasting ten seconds. After thorough testing of the divertor function the graphite tiles in subsequent extensions are to be replaced by carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon elements that are also water-cooled.

If these wall sectors are protected by special divertor plates, the impinging particles can be neutralised and pumped off along with undesirable impurities. This makes the divertor an important tool for controlling impurities and the density of the plasma. The wall elements and their support structures were designed and manufactured at IPP in Garching in cooperation with external companies. Installation of the 6,200 differently shaped wall tiles and 10 divertor modules must be done to a precision of one to two millimetres, this being no easy matter in the asymmetric plasma vessel: \"After exact measurement of the inside wall we therefore compare the wall dimensions with the tile measurements by a numerical method and modify, where necessary, the tiles with a computer-controlled milling cutter\", explains Mathias M\u00fcller from Greifswald's Technical Services. Installation will last till mid-2017: Wendelstein 7-X with clad wall will then be fit for high-power plasmas with heating powers of up to eight megawatts lasting ten seconds. After thorough testing of the divertor function the graphite tiles in subsequent extensions are to be replaced by carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon elements that are also water-cooled. In about four years this will make discharges of up to 30 minutes possible in which it can be checked at a heating power of 10 megawatts whether Wendelstein 7-X can also permanently achieve its optimisation objectives.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/4073918/07_16"}, {"title": "Confirmation of Wendelstein 7-X magnetic field", "date": "2016-12-05", "content": "Physicist Sam Lazerson of the U.S. Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has teamed with German scientists to confirm that the Wendelstein 7-X fusion energy device called a stellarator in Greifswald, Germany, produces high-quality magnetic fields that are consistent with their complex design.

Twisty magnetic fields: Stellarators confine the hot, charged gas, otherwise known as plasma, that fuels fusion reactions in twisty -- or 3D -- magnetic fields, compared with the symmetrical -- or 2D --fields that the more widely used tokamaks create. The twisty configuration enables stellarators to control the plasma with no need for the current that tokamaks must induce in the gas to complete the magnetic field. Stellarator plasmas thus run little risk of disrupting, as can happen in tokamaks, causing the internal current to abruptly halt and fusion reactions to shut down. PPPL has played key roles in the W7-X project. The Laboratory designed and delivered five barn door-sized trim coils that fine-tune the stellarator's magnetic fields and made their measurement possible. \"We've confirmed that the magnetic cage that we've built works as designed,\" said Lazerson, who led roughly half the experiments that validated the configuration of the field. \"This reflects U.S. contributions to W7-X,\" he added, \"and highlights PPPL's ability to conduct international collaborations.\" Support for this work comes from Euratom and the DOE Office of Science.

But since then, there's been a big question - is the device working the way it's supposed to? That's pretty crucial when you're talking about a machine that could potentially maintain controlled nuclear fusion reactions one day, and thankfully, the answer is yes. A team of researchers from the US and Germany have now confirmed that the Wendelstein 7-X (W 7-X) stellerator is producing the super-strong, twisty, 3D magnetic fields that its design predicted, with \"unprecedented accuracy\". The researchers found an error rate less than one in 100,000. \"To our knowledge, this is an unprecedented accuracy, both in terms of the as-built engineering of a fusion device, as well as in the measurement of magnetic topology,\" the researchers write in Nature Communications. That might not sound exciting, but it's crucial, because that magnetic field is the only thing that will trap hot balls of plasma long enough for nuclear fusion to occur. Nuclear fusion is one of the most promising sources of clean energy out there - with little more than salt water, it offers limitless energy using the same reaction that powers our Sun. Unlike nuclear fission, which is achieved by our current nuclear plants, and involves splitting the nucleus of an atom into smaller neutrons and nuclei, nuclear fusion generates huge amounts of energy when atoms are fused together at incredibly high temperatures. And it produces no radioactive waste or other byproducts. Based on the longevity of our Sun, nuclear fusion also has the potential to supply humanity with energy for as long as we need it - if we can figure out how to harness the reaction, that is. And that's a pretty big 'if', because scientists have been working on the problem for more than 60 years, and we're still a fair way off our goal. The main challenge is that, in order to achieve controlled nuclear fusion, we have to actually recreate conditions inside the Sun. That means building a machine that's capable of producing and controlling a 100-million-degree-Celsius (180 million degree Fahrenheit) ball of plasma gas. As you can imagine, that's easier said than done. But there are several nuclear fusion reactor designs in operation around the world right now that are trying their best, and the W 7-X is one of the most promising attemps. Instead of trying to control plasma with just a 2D magnetic field, which is the approach used by the more common tokamak reactors, the stellerator works by generating twisted, 3D magnetic fields. This allows stellerators to control plasma without the need for any electrical current - which tokamaks rely on - and as a result, it makes stellerators more stable, because they can keep going even if the internal current is interrupted. Well, that was the idea of its design, at least. Despite the fact that the machine successfully controlled helium plasma in December 2015, and then the more challenging hydrogen plasma in February 2016, no one had shown that the magnetic field was actually working as it should be. To measure it, a team of researchers from the US Department of Energy and the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics in Germany sent an electron beam along the magnetic field lines in the reactor. Using a fluorescent rod, they swept through those lines and created light in the shape of the fields. The result, which you can see in the image above, shows the exact type of twisted magnetic fields that it was supposed to make. \"We've confirmed that the magnetic cage that we've built works as designed,\" said one of the lead researchers, Sam Lazerson from the US Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Despite this success, W 7-X isn't actually intended to generate electricity from nuclear fusion - it's simply a proof of concept to show that it could work. In 2019, the reactor will begin to use deuterium instead of hydrogen to produce actual fusion reactions inside the machine, but it won't be capable of generating more energy than it current requires to run. That's something that the next-generation of stellerators will hopefully overcome. \"The task has just started,\" explain the researchers in a press release. It's not something that will happen tomorrow, but it's an incredibly exciting time for nuclear fusion, with W 7-X officially competing with France's ITER tokamak reactor - both of which have been able to trap plasma for long enough for fusion to occur.

This cladding is to protect the vessel walls and allow higher temperatures and plasma discharges lasting 10 seconds in forthcoming experiments. A special function is exercised here by the ten sections of the divertor: As broad strips on the wall of the plasma vessel, the divertor tiles conform exactly to the twisting contour of the plasma edge. They thus protect especially those wall areas to which particles escaping from the edge of the plasma ring are specifically directed. Along with unwanted impurities the impinging particles are neutralised and pumped off. The divertor is thus an important tool for regulating the purity and density of the plasma. The smaller predecessor, the Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator at IPP in Garching, had already yielded encouraging results in divertor tests. But not till the much larger successor, Wendelstein 7-X at Greifswald, did the geometry conditions come up to power plant size, particularly the ratio of the divertor area to the plasma volume. \"We are therefore very excited that we are now able for the first time to investigate whether the divertor concept of an optimised stellarator can really work properly\", says Project Head Professor Thomas Klinger. These tests will play a major role: Many detailed investigations will carefully check how to guide the plasma and what magnetic field structures and heating and replenishing methods are most successful. Newly enlisted measuring instruments will also allow observation of turbulence in the plasma for the first time: The small eddies entailed influence how successful magnetic confinement and thermal insulation of the hot plasma are, these being important parameters for a future power plant, because they determine the size of the plant and hence its economical merit. \"We shall be able for the first time to check whether the promising predictions of theory for a completely optimised stellarator are correct. In comparison with previous devices, Wendelstein 7-X is expected to yield quite new, possibly even better, conditions\", says Thomas Klinger. As all ten microwave transmitters for the microwave heating of the plasma are meanwhile ready for use, this will allow a higher energy throughput and plasmas of higher density. It will now be possible to raise the energy to 80 megajoules once all versions of the microwave heating have been tackled and tested, as compared with 4 megajoules in 2016. The rather low plasma density hitherto can now be more than doubled to attain values meeting power plant requirements. This has significant consequences: First the density of the plasma has to be sufficient to allow electrons and ions to exchange energy effectively. Previously, the microwave heating had only been able to heat essentially just the electrons. Instead of hot electrons with 100 million degrees and cold ions with 10 million degrees as hitherto the electrons and ions in the new plasma will have almost equal temperatures of up to 70 million degrees. This should also enhance the thermal insulation of the plasma. Whereas it was hitherto just upper average in relation to the size of the device, the effect of optimising Wendelstein 7-X should now become visible: \"It's getting very exciting\", states Thomas Klinger.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/4254576/08_17"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "PPPL physicists essential to new campaign on world's most powerful stellarator", "date": "2017-08-28", "content": "Physicists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory are providing critical expertise for the first full campaign of the world's largest and most powerful stellarator, a magnetic confinement fusion experiment, the Wendelstein 7-X in Germany. The fusion facility resumes operating on August 28, 2017, and will investigate the suitability of its optimized magnetic fields to create steady state plasmas and to serve as a model for a future power plant for the production of a \"star in a jar,\" a virtually limitless source of safe and clean energy for generating electricity. The W7-X started up in December, 2015, and concluded its initial run in March, 2016. The facility has since been upgraded to prepare for the high-power campaign that is set to begin. Deeply involved in the new 15-week run are PPPL physicists Sam Lazerson and Novimir Pablant, who are spending two years at the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany. Lazerson, who previously mapped the W7-X magnetic fields with barn-door sized magnetic coils built by PPPL, heads a task force that will plan and run a series of experiments on the stellarator. Pablant, who designed an x-ray crystal spectrometer to record the behavior of W7-X plasma, will operate the diagnostic together with a German spectrometer and will contribute to planning and executing research. First run in designed configuration: \"This will be the first run of the machine in its designed configuration,\" said David Gates, who heads the stellarator physics division at PPPL and oversees the laboratory's role as lead U.S. collaborator in the W7-X project. The new run will test a device called an \"island divertor\" for exhausting thermal energy and impurities. The campaign will also increase the heating power of the stellarator to eight megawatts to enable operation at a higher beta -- the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure, a key factor for plasma confinement. Such progress marks steps toward lengthening the confinement time of the hot, charged plasma gas that fuels fusion reactions within the optimized machine. \"The goal is to increase plasma confinement compared with traditional stellarators,\" said Gates. Going forward, Max Planck engineers plan to install a U.S.-built \"scraper element\" on the W7-X after completion of the initial 15-week campaign. The following phase will study the ability of the unit, originally designed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and completed at PPPL, to intercept heat flowing toward the divertor and improve its performance. Plans call next for installation of a water-cooled divertor in 2019 to further increase the allowable pulse length of the stellarator. PPPL, on Princeton University's Forrestal Campus in Plainsboro, N.J., is devoted to creating new knowledge about the physics of plasmas -- ultra-hot, charged gases -- and to developing practical solutions for the creation of fusion energy. The Laboratory is managed by the University for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science, which is the largest single supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

Moreover, first confirmation for the optimisation concept on which Wendelstein 7-X is based, was obtained. Wendelstein 7-X at Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, the world's largest fusion device of the stellarator type, is investigating the suitability of this concept for application in power plants. Unlike in the first experimentation phase 2015/16, the plasma vessel of Wendelstein 7-X has been fitted with interior cladding since September last year (see PI 8/2017). The vessel walls are now covered with graphite tiles, thus allowing higher temperatures and longer plasma discharges. With the so-called divertor it is also possible to control the purity and density of the plasma: The divertor tiles follow the twisted contour of the plasma edge in the form of ten broad strips along the wall of the plasma vessel. In this way, they protect particularly the wall areas onto which the particles escaping from the edge of the plasma ring are made to impinge. Along with impurities, the impinging particles are here neutralised and pumped off. \"First experience with the new wall elements are highly positive\", states Professor Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen. While by the end of the first campaign pulse lengths of six seconds were being attained, plasmas lasting up to 26 seconds are now being produced. A heating energy of up to 75 megajoules could be fed into the plasma, this being 18 times as much as in the first operation phase without divertor. The heating power could also be increased, this being a prerequisite to high plasma density. In this way a record value for the fusion product was attained. This product of the ion temperature, plasma density and energy confinement time specifies how close one is getting to the reactor values needed to ignite a plasma. At an ion temperature of about 40 million degrees and a density of 0.8 x 1020 particles per cubic metre Wendelstein 7-X has attained a fusion product affording a good 6 x 1026 degrees x second per cubic metre, the world's stellarator record. \"This is an excellent value for a device of this size, achieved, moreover, under realistic conditions, i.e. at a high temperature of the plasma ions\", says Professor Sunn Pedersen. The energy confinement time attained, this being a measure of the quality of the thermal insulation of the magnetically confined plasma, indicates with an imposing 200 milliseconds that the numerical optimisation on which Wendelstein 7-X is based might work: \"This makes us optimistic for our further work.\" The fact that optimisation is taking effect not only in respect of the thermal insulation is testified to by the now completed evaluation of experimental data from the first experimentation phase from December 2015 to March 2016, which has just been reported in Nature Physics (see below). This shows that also the bootstrap current behaves as expected. This electric current is induced by pressure differences in the plasma and could distort the tailored magnetic field. Particles from the plasma edge would then no longer impinge on the right area of the divertor. The bootstrap current in stellarators should therefore be kept as low as possible. Analysis has now confirmed that this has actually been accomplished in the optimised field geometry. \"Thus, already during the first experimentation phase important aspects of the optimisation could be verified\", states first author Dr. Andreas Dinklage. \"More exact and systematic evaluation will ensue in further experiments at much higher heating power and higher plasma pressure.\" Since the end of 2017 Wendelstein 7-X has undergone further extensions: These include new measuring equipment and heating systems. Plasma experiments are to be resumed in July.

Water-cooled inner cladding of the plasma vessel will make the facility suitable for higher heating power and longer plasma pulses. Production of the new cladding's centrepiece, the so-called divertor, was taken over by the institute's Garching branch. For tomorrow, final delivery to Greifswald is scheduled, where the preparations for installation of the components have been completed. The installation work will last until well into next year. Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator fusion device, is to investigate the suitability of such devices for power plants. At the end of 2018, the experiments on Wendelstein 7-X were temporarily terminated after two successful work phases (see PI 11/18). Upgrading of the plasma vessel has been ongoing since then. \"First of all, most of the old components had to be taken out. Installation of the new ones can now begin,\" says Prof. Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, whose division is responsible for technical operation of the device. Whereas most of the wall protection components were previously operated uncooled, large sections of the wall will be water-cooled starting with the next round of experiments: \"This will then enable Wendelstein 7-X to generate plasma pulses lasting up to 30 minutes\", states Professor Bosch. Centrepiece of the new wall cladding is the so-called divertor, the most heavily loaded component of the plasma vessel. In ten double strips on the inner wall of the plasma vessel, the divertor tiles follow the curved contour of the plasma edge. They protect those wall areas to which particles from the edge of the plasma are magnetically directed. A pump behind a gap in the middle of each double strip removes the impinging plasma and impurity particles. In this way, the divertor can be used to control the purity and density of the plasma. Demanding manifacture: In the high-performance experiments planned, the new water-cooled divertor plates, which replace the previous uncooled ones, are designed to withstand a load of up to ten megawatts per square metre - like a space shuttle re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Without water cooling, however, the heat-resistant divertor tiles made of carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon could not withstand this load for the intended 30-minute plasma pulses. They are therefore welded onto water-cooled plates made of a copper-chromium-zirconium alloy. The coolant, supplied by small steel tubes, ensures that the heat energy is removed. Each of the ten curved divertor strips consists of twelve of these plates, which in turn are composed of individual elements. In total, these 890 elements comprise almost half a million individual parts, from the heat-resistant surfaces to the special screws. The high-performance components are the result of a long development, manufacturing and testing process carried out by the Integrated Technical Centre (ITZ) and the \"Components in the Plasma Vessel\" work group at IPP in Garching in cooperation with industrial companies. \"The complex geometry of the components was particularly challenging, given the high level of accuracy and reliability required,\" explains IPP engineer Dr. Jean Boscary, who headed production and assembly of the \"big puzzle\": \"There should be no water leakage later in Wendelstein 7-X\". Accordingly, already the preparatory work was extensive: In 2003, the development and production contract for the divertor elements was concluded with an industrial company. After four pre-series and more than 60 prototypes, five years of series production could start in 2009. To complete a divertor element, 82 manufacturing steps and 44 tests were necessary. The surface of each of the 16,000 carbon tiles had to be milled three-dimensionally into shape - with tolerances of sometimes only 0.1 millimetres to avoid any overheating of protruding edges. The joining technique between carbon and copper alloy was specially developed for Wendelstein 7-X. At IPP in Garching, the divertor elements were then joined together on steel frames to form plates. Cooling pipes and cooling water distributors were joined by means of a special welding technique developed at the ITZ: \"Among the 2,000 welded joints, the subsequent tests were only able to detect two leaks,\" says Dr. Boscary. In other respects, too, there were always quality assurance tests between the individual work steps. For production control, for example, the load capacity of the parts was examined in Garching's GLADIS heat test rig. The experience gained in this \"largest heat protection project in fusion research to date\" is unique worldwide, Jean Boscary emphasizes. All ten divertor strips have now been completed. A major part has already been delivered to IPP at Greifswald; the last transport is scheduled for tomorrow. Challenging assembly: At Greifswald, everything is prepared for installation of the high-performance components: In particular, the water pipes are installed in the plasma vessel, a total of 4.5 kilometres. \"In the meantime, we have started laying the complex water pipes that bridge the last 40 centimetres between the vessel wall and the divertor plates,\" explains assembly head Dr. Lutz Wegener. Later on, the plates must fit exactly to these connections. Although the extremely tricky work had previously been practised in a one-to-one model - \"virtually a double assembly,\" says Dr. Wegener - there are surprises when installing the 240 fitting pipes. The great tightness between the components makes welding a challenge, for which a special precision technique is used anyway. Often new designs and new manufacturing are necessary. In the narrow space also many screws are difficult to access for tools and a solution has to be found on a case-by-case basis: \"Welded or screwed - the connections should remain tight for the next twenty years\". Compared with these tasks, subsequent installation of the divertor plates should be easier. \"We have already developed special tools for this purpose - for example to lift and move the 70-kilogram plates,\" says Lutz Wegener. Even the kick plate, on which the technicians in the vessel walk over the sensitive divertor and wall protection tiles, was a separate development project: it had to guarantee safe standing in a very confined space and be adapted to the unusual shape of the plasma vessel. On the other hand, it must not damage the wall structures or lead to any impurities that could later perturb the plasma. Plasma operation is expected to resume at the end of 2021. It is planned to begin with low water cooling, low heating power and short plasma pulses in order to allow testing of all installations in operation after the long break in experiments. With full cooling, longer pulses with plasma energies of up to one gigajoule should be possible - a target that will be slowly approached. Instead of the previous hundred-second pulses with heating powers of two megawatts and plasma energies of 200 megajoules, the cooled high-performance divertor should later allow pulses lasting up to 30 minutes at full heating power. Wendelstein 7-X will then be able to demonstrate the essential advantage of stellarators, namely their ability to operate continuously.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/4828222/01_20"}, {"title": "Wendelstein 7-X upgrade moves to divertor stage", "date": "2020-03-17", "content": "The upgrade of the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device - Germany's Wendelstein 7-X - is set to enter a new stage with the final delivery of components for the so-called divertor.

This gets round the problems tokamaks face when magnetic coils confining the plasma are necessarily less dense on the outside of the toroidal ring. The Wendelstein 7-X will not be used to produce energy but should demonstrate whether stellarators are suitable as a power plant.

Wendelstein 7-X is the world's largest stellarator fusion device. Its goal is to investigate the suitability of such facilities for power production. Stellarators differ from a tokamak fusion reactor such as the Joint European Torus (JET) in the UK or Iter under construction in France.

This avoids problems tokamaks face when magnetic coils confining the plasma are necessarily less dense on the outside of the toroidal ring.

Water-cooled inner cladding of the plasma vessel will make the facility suitable for higher heating power and longer plasma pulses. Production of the new cladding's centrepiece, the so-called divertor, was taken over by the institute's Garching branch. For tomorrow, final delivery to Greifswald is scheduled, where the preparations for installation of the components have been completed. The installation work will last until well into next year. Wendelstein 7-X, the world's largest stellarator fusion device, is to investigate the suitability of such devices for power plants. At the end of 2018, the experiments on Wendelstein 7-X were temporarily terminated after two successful work phases (see PI 11/18). Upgrading of the plasma vessel has been ongoing since then. \"First of all, most of the old components had to be taken out. Installation of the new ones can now begin,\" says Prof. Dr. Hans-Stephan Bosch, whose division is responsible for technical operation of the device. Whereas most of the wall protection components were previously operated uncooled, large sections of the wall will be water-cooled starting with the next round of experiments: \"This will then enable Wendelstein 7-X to generate plasma pulses lasting up to 30 minutes\", states Professor Bosch. Centrepiece of the new wall cladding is the so-called divertor, the most heavily loaded component of the plasma vessel. In ten double strips on the inner wall of the plasma vessel, the divertor tiles follow the curved contour of the plasma edge. They protect those wall areas to which particles from the edge of the plasma are magnetically directed. A pump behind a gap in the middle of each double strip removes the impinging plasma and impurity particles. In this way, the divertor can be used to control the purity and density of the plasma. Demanding manifacture: In the high-performance experiments planned, the new water-cooled divertor plates, which replace the previous uncooled ones, are designed to withstand a load of up to ten megawatts per square metre - like a space shuttle re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Without water cooling, however, the heat-resistant divertor tiles made of carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon could not withstand this load for the intended 30-minute plasma pulses. They are therefore welded onto water-cooled plates made of a copper-chromium-zirconium alloy. The coolant, supplied by small steel tubes, ensures that the heat energy is removed. Each of the ten curved divertor strips consists of twelve of these plates, which in turn are composed of individual elements. In total, these 890 elements comprise almost half a million individual parts, from the heat-resistant surfaces to the special screws. The high-performance components are the result of a long development, manufacturing and testing process carried out by the Integrated Technical Centre (ITZ) and the \"Components in the Plasma Vessel\" work group at IPP in Garching in cooperation with industrial companies. \"The complex geometry of the components was particularly challenging, given the high level of accuracy and reliability required,\" explains IPP engineer Dr. Jean Boscary, who headed production and assembly of the \"big puzzle\": \"There should be no water leakage later in Wendelstein 7-X\". Accordingly, already the preparatory work was extensive: In 2003, the development and production contract for the divertor elements was concluded with an industrial company. After four pre-series and more than 60 prototypes, five years of series production could start in 2009. To complete a divertor element, 82 manufacturing steps and 44 tests were necessary. The surface of each of the 16,000 carbon tiles had to be milled three-dimensionally into shape - with tolerances of sometimes only 0.1 millimetres to avoid any overheating of protruding edges. The joining technique between carbon and copper alloy was specially developed for Wendelstein 7-X. At IPP in Garching, the divertor elements were then joined together on steel frames to form plates. Cooling pipes and cooling water distributors were joined by means of a special welding technique developed at the ITZ: \"Among the 2,000 welded joints, the subsequent tests were only able to detect two leaks,\" says Dr. Boscary. In other respects, too, there were always quality assurance tests between the individual work steps. For production control, for example, the load capacity of the parts was examined in Garching's GLADIS heat test rig. The experience gained in this \"largest heat protection project in fusion research to date\" is unique worldwide, Jean Boscary emphasizes. All ten divertor strips have now been completed. A major part has already been delivered to IPP at Greifswald; the last transport is scheduled for tomorrow. Challenging assembly: At Greifswald, everything is prepared for installation of the high-performance components: In particular, the water pipes are installed in the plasma vessel, a total of 4.5 kilometres. \"In the meantime, we have started laying the complex water pipes that bridge the last 40 centimetres between the vessel wall and the divertor plates,\" explains assembly head Dr. Lutz Wegener. Later on, the plates must fit exactly to these connections. Although the extremely tricky work had previously been practised in a one-to-one model - \"virtually a double assembly,\" says Dr. Wegener - there are surprises when installing the 240 fitting pipes. The great tightness between the components makes welding a challenge, for which a special precision technique is used anyway. Often new designs and new manufacturing are necessary. In the narrow space also many screws are difficult to access for tools and a solution has to be found on a case-by-case basis: \"Welded or screwed - the connections should remain tight for the next twenty years\". Compared with these tasks, subsequent installation of the divertor plates should be easier. \"We have already developed special tools for this purpose - for example to lift and move the 70-kilogram plates,\" says Lutz Wegener. Even the kick plate, on which the technicians in the vessel walk over the sensitive divertor and wall protection tiles, was a separate development project: it had to guarantee safe standing in a very confined space and be adapted to the unusual shape of the plasma vessel. On the other hand, it must not damage the wall structures or lead to any impurities that could later perturb the plasma. Plasma operation is expected to resume at the end of 2021. It is planned to begin with low water cooling, low heating power and short plasma pulses in order to allow testing of all installations in operation after the long break in experiments. With full cooling, longer pulses with plasma energies of up to one gigajoule should be possible - a target that will be slowly approached. Instead of the previous hundred-second pulses with heating powers of two megawatts and plasma energies of 200 megajoules, the cooled high-performance divertor should later allow pulses lasting up to 30 minutes at full heating power. Wendelstein 7-X will then be able to demonstrate the essential advantage of stellarators, namely their ability to operate continuously.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/4828222/01_20"}, {"title": "Wendelstein 7-X upgrade moves to divertor stage", "date": "2020-03-17", "content": "The upgrade of the world's largest stellarator-type fusion device - Germany's Wendelstein 7-X - is set to enter a new stage with the final delivery of components for the so-called divertor.

This gets round the problems tokamaks face when magnetic coils confining the plasma are necessarily less dense on the outside of the toroidal ring. The Wendelstein 7-X will not be used to produce energy but should demonstrate whether stellarators are suitable as a power plant.

Wendelstein 7-X has been operating in Greifswald since December 2015 and is being commissioned in stages. Whereas in the first two experimental phases the plasma was initially confined using a magnetic field cage and an uncooled exhaust (divertor), a water cooling system has just been installed. This should make possible half-hour-long plasma discharges at high heating power in Wendelstein 7-X. The first three experimental phases of Wendelstein 7-X were highly successful: Among other things, the team was already able to set the stellarator world record for the so-called triple product of temperature, density and confinement time. This triple product is a measure of the performance of fusion experiments. However, Wendelstein 7-X is not yet complete and is undergoing upgrades in 2021. When the stellarator started up in December 2015, the plasma was confined using a so-called limiter configuration. This already allowed for good studies with the facility, but only for the short time of about one second. In 2017/18, the team switched to the divertor configuration magnetically limited the hot plasma, through a so-called divertor. This allows the interaction of the hot plasma with the material walls to take place separately and far away from the magnetically confined plasma interior. Divertors were first used successfully in the early 1980s at the ASDEX tokamak at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching and are now standard in all fusion facilities. Unlike tokamaks, whose divertor is axially symmetric, in stellarators it is asymmetric and therefore three-dimensional. Wendelstein 7-X features ten separate divertor modules, one at the bottom and one at the top of each of the five sectors that make up the facility. The divertor used in the second experimental phase was covered with carbon plates. It did not yet have active cooling, which limited the plasma duration to a few tens of seconds. Between plasma discharges, the plates cooled down again by emitting heat and light. Because of this intrinsic limit, steady-state plasmas were not possible. During this phase, Wendelstein 7-X carried out fundamental studies and investigated many important physical aspects - but this was only an intermediate step. Towards continuous operation: A major advantage of the stellarator is that it can in principle run in continuous operation, whereas tokamak-type facilities operate in pulsed mode. An important mission of Wendelstein 7-X is to prove this advantage and demonstrate 30-minute long plasma discharges at high heating power. To reach this goal, the power supplied to the plasma also has to be dissipated in a stationary manner. This is only possible with water cooling of the divertor and other parts of the plasma vessel. Upgrade campaign: Upgrades since 2019 have equipped Wendelstein 7-X with the active water cooling necessary for steady-state operation. The old divertor has already been completely removed and has just been replaced by an actively cooled one. On the side facing the plasma, it has the same contour as the uncooled divertor, but now consists of carbon fiber-reinforced carbon tiles (CFC) welded onto water-cooled metal plates. The total of 120 divertor tiles required were designed, built and tested over the past several years at the Garching branch of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. Since the individual divertor modules weigh up to 70 kilograms but have to be installed with a tolerance of less than one millimeter, assembly is very time-consuming. In addition, security measures during the Corona pandemic complicated the work and required more time than anticipated. As part of the work, around seven kilometers of water pipes were laid in the plasma vessel, which had to be bolted or welded at around 3000 separation points. Because of the confined space in the plasma vessel, this was also a very time-consuming and complex job: All seams had to be tight, and neither air nor water leaks were allowed! Ten cryovacuum pumps are installed in the extremely confined space behind the divertor, cooled with water, liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. The five upper cryogenic pumps have already been installed and tested for leaks. The divertor modules have also been successfully installed in the upper part of the plasma vessel, so that assembly of the lower divertor modules can now begin. The divertor is supplied with cooling via 480 water circuits, which also require extensive installations outside the plasma vessel. Here, too, installation space is at a premium. In addition, numerous other plant components are being modified or rebuilt during this expansion phase, including cryopump cooling, another high-frequency heater, stronger transmitter tubes for electron cyclotron resonance heating, and many plasma diagnostics - a complex mix of different jobs that were affected to varying degrees by the Corona pandemic.

Wendelstein 7-X has been operating in Greifswald since December 2015 and is being commissioned in stages. Whereas in the first two experimental phases the plasma was initially confined using a magnetic field cage and an uncooled exhaust (divertor), a water cooling system has just been installed. This should make possible half-hour-long plasma discharges at high heating power in Wendelstein 7-X. The first three experimental phases of Wendelstein 7-X were highly successful: Among other things, the team was already able to set the stellarator world record for the so-called triple product of temperature, density and confinement time. This triple product is a measure of the performance of fusion experiments. However, Wendelstein 7-X is not yet complete and is undergoing upgrades in 2021. When the stellarator started up in December 2015, the plasma was confined using a so-called limiter configuration. This already allowed for good studies with the facility, but only for the short time of about one second. In 2017/18, the team switched to the divertor configuration magnetically limited the hot plasma, through a so-called divertor. This allows the interaction of the hot plasma with the material walls to take place separately and far away from the magnetically confined plasma interior. Divertors were first used successfully in the early 1980s at the ASDEX tokamak at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching and are now standard in all fusion facilities. Unlike tokamaks, whose divertor is axially symmetric, in stellarators it is asymmetric and therefore three-dimensional. Wendelstein 7-X features ten separate divertor modules, one at the bottom and one at the top of each of the five sectors that make up the facility. The divertor used in the second experimental phase was covered with carbon plates. It did not yet have active cooling, which limited the plasma duration to a few tens of seconds. Between plasma discharges, the plates cooled down again by emitting heat and light. Because of this intrinsic limit, steady-state plasmas were not possible. During this phase, Wendelstein 7-X carried out fundamental studies and investigated many important physical aspects - but this was only an intermediate step. Towards continuous operation: A major advantage of the stellarator is that it can in principle run in continuous operation, whereas tokamak-type facilities operate in pulsed mode. An important mission of Wendelstein 7-X is to prove this advantage and demonstrate 30-minute long plasma discharges at high heating power. To reach this goal, the power supplied to the plasma also has to be dissipated in a stationary manner. This is only possible with water cooling of the divertor and other parts of the plasma vessel. Upgrade campaign: Upgrades since 2019 have equipped Wendelstein 7-X with the active water cooling necessary for steady-state operation. The old divertor has already been completely removed and has just been replaced by an actively cooled one. On the side facing the plasma, it has the same contour as the uncooled divertor, but now consists of carbon fiber-reinforced carbon tiles (CFC) welded onto water-cooled metal plates. The total of 120 divertor tiles required were designed, built and tested over the past several years at the Garching branch of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. Since the individual divertor modules weigh up to 70 kilograms but have to be installed with a tolerance of less than one millimeter, assembly is very time-consuming. In addition, security measures during the Corona pandemic complicated the work and required more time than anticipated. As part of the work, around seven kilometers of water pipes were laid in the plasma vessel, which had to be bolted or welded at around 3000 separation points. Because of the confined space in the plasma vessel, this was also a very time-consuming and complex job: All seams had to be tight, and neither air nor water leaks were allowed! Ten cryovacuum pumps are installed in the extremely confined space behind the divertor, cooled with water, liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. The five upper cryogenic pumps have already been installed and tested for leaks. The divertor modules have also been successfully installed in the upper part of the plasma vessel, so that assembly of the lower divertor modules can now begin. The divertor is supplied with cooling via 480 water circuits, which also require extensive installations outside the plasma vessel. Here, too, installation space is at a premium. In addition, numerous other plant components are being modified or rebuilt during this expansion phase, including cryopump cooling, another high-frequency heater, stronger transmitter tubes for electron cyclotron resonance heating, and many plasma diagnostics - a complex mix of different jobs that were affected to varying degrees by the Corona pandemic. Restart in 2021: Assembly of all is now scheduled for completion by the end of 2021, about six months later than originally planned. In parallel, preparations are already underway for the commissioning of Wendelstein 7-X after the modification.

In the last three years, engineers and technicians controlled the operations while learning how to use W7-X. Their aim was to fulfil the technical capabilities of the experiment. At this latest stage of improvements, they say the new water-cooled divertor (high-heat flux divertor) is the key to enhanced performance. Divertors are important components in fusion devices. Being instrumental for energy dissipation and regulation of particles exhaust in the plasma, they prevent their unfavourable contact with the vessel wall which could lead to contamination of the plasma itself. To succeed in this function, the divertor baffles must withstand high temperatures. Owing to the 120 new divertor modules with a cooling system, W7-X can now operate at significantly higher plasma energies. Thus the divertor and other components require a total of 6.8 kilometres of cooling pipes. These pipes of varying shapes and thicknesses were manufactured, insulated, fitted and welded. They form the 657 independent cooling circuits that dissipate heat in W7-X. It will become possible in future to generate higher plasma energies via three new or upgraded heating systems with with a total of more than doubled output, these are: the new ion heating system with radio waves that can feed in a maximum of 1.5 megawatts of power, the neutral particle injection system with doubled heating power reaching to 7 megawatts, and the electron microwave heating system that was upgraded to 10 megawatts. Furthermore, 60 kilometres of additional cables and hoses were installed, adding to the 280 kilometres already in place. Finally, 40 diagnostics were upgraded or newly installed to ensure more precise and extensive plasma measurements. From autumn 2022 onwards, an international team of scientists will once again drive W7-X to new heights of performance. \"With the improved equipment, we want to be able to keep high-performance plasmas with up to 18 gigajoules of energy turnover stable for half an hour in a few years,\" explains Professor Dr. Thomas Klinger, Head of Stellarator Transport and Stability Division, IPP, Greifswald. \"Now it will be a matter of approaching this goal step-by-step and learning more about plasma operation at higher energies without putting too much stress on the machine too quickly,\" he adds. For the upcoming experimental campaign (OP 2.1) alone, which is expected to last until end of March 2023, several hundred experiment proposals have been submitted by researchers from IPP, numerous international institutes as well as universities from the EU, US and Japa. \"An important task will be to learn how we can increase the heating energy arriving in the plasma and thus the plasma temperatures,\" says Professor Klinger. Up to one gigajoule of energy turnover - injected heating power multiplied by duration of discharge - is planned for phase OP 2.1. Prior to the latest improvements, this value had reached 75 megajoules at most. The plasma energy content - kinetic energy of all plasma particles - could reach to up to 1 megajoule at that time. This is still as yet another stellarator world record. In addition, long-lasting plasmas of 100 seconds duration with good plasma values were achieved. So far the heating of electrons in the plasma was indeed very successful. Electrons should then transfer their energy on to the ions and therefore heat the ions. However, the ions have not yet reached the expected temperatures. In this regard, the study of plasma turbulence would be crucial to future research. On the one hand, turbulence can play an important role in expulsions and removal of impurities in the plasma. On the other hand, it can cause anomalous losses of energy. It is the current task of the Greifswald researchers to understand and control this better in upcoming experiments.", "url": "https://www.ipp.mpg.de/5272648/03_22"}]}]
