[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Steward Observatory Mirror Lab Awarded Contract for Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Mirror", "date": "2004-10-29", "content": "The LSST Corporation has awarded a $2.3 million contract to the University of Arizona Steward Observatory Mirror Lab to purchase the glass and begin engineering work for the 8.4-meter diameter main mirror for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Acquiring the LSST primary mirror was made possible by a generous, private donation from Arizona businessman Richard Caris. The UA award covers the first of four phases in an estimated $13.8 million effort to design, cast, polish and integrate the mirror into the LSST mirror support cell. Coupled with substantial support provided by Research Corporation under the leadership of John Schaefer, these private funds boost the LSST off the drawing board and into production. The LSST is a proposed world-class, ground-based telescope that can survey the entire visible sky every three nights. It will generate an awesome 30 terabytes of data per night from a three billion-pixel digital camera, producing a vast database of information on the universe. LSST will take exposures every 10 seconds, opening a movie-like window on objects that change or move on rapid timescales -- exploding supernovae, Earth-approaching asteroids, and distant Kuiper belt objects. Via the light-bending gravity of dark matter, LSST will chart the history of the expansion of the universe, yielding a unique probe of the nature of the mysterious dark energy that fills our universe. \"LSST's rapid deep coverage of the universe is a qualitative leap in capability that is enabled by progress in microelectronics, software, and large optics fabrication,\" states University of California, Davis, Professor and LSST Director J. Anthony Tyson. \"LSST will change the way we observe the universe by mapping the visible sky deeply, rapidly, and continuously. It will open entirely new windows on our universe, yielding discoveries in a variety of areas of astronomy and fundamental physics.\" \"The LSST will catalog objects, characterize them automatically and alert astronomers to interesting results,\" Steward Observatory astronomer and LSST board member Philip A. Pinto said. \"And, unlike data from any other big telescope, LSST data will be public, all the time, available right away for everyone.\" Richard Caris, founder and Chairman of the Board of Interface, Inc., in Scottsdale, AZ, donated the funds for the LSST primary mirror. Caris became involved with astronomy in Arizona when his company provided load cells for the Large Binocular Telescope. Intrigued with the UA Steward Observatory astronomy department and mirror lab, Caris first became interested in the proposed LSST and its search for Near Earth Objects. He later was drawn to its mission to probe Dark Matter and Dark Energy. The data being available to anyone, not just professional astronomers, further motivated him to donate the funds to purchase the LSST mirror and jump start the project. \"This is an example of how private money can have a major impact on getting these kinds of projects off the ground and going,\" Pinto said. \"There's the value of the mirror itself. But there's an enormous value in getting started at the moment. We'll save three or four years on the construction schedule. We'll be in good shape to get the mirror on time for first light in 2012.\" Steward Observatory's Mirror Lab team will create the mirror by melting borosilicate glass in a mold of hollow, hexagonal core boxes that give the mirror its strong, lightweight \"honeycomb\" structure. The mold spins inside a giant rotating furnace during casting, reaching peak temperatures at 1180 degrees Celsius (2,156 degrees Fahrenheit) and a spin rate of seven revolutions per minute. The Mirror Lab has produced four 6.5-meter mirrors and two 8.4-meter mirrors by this technique in the last decade. The prime engineering challenge of the LSST mirror will be leaving a large hole in the middle of the mirror, according to LSST Project Manager Donald W. Sweeney. \"The hole will accommodate the telescope's 5-meter tertiary (third) mirror. Along with a convex (outwardly curved) 3.4-meter secondary mirror, the total LSST optical system will be the fastest, most compact system of this scale ever built for an advanced research telescope,\" Sweeney said. \"The challenge compared to previous 8.4-meter telescopes is to engineer the LSST so its three mirrors will be held in perfect alignment,\" Mirror Lab Director and Regents' Professor of astronomy Roger Angel said. The LSST was one of the two highest priorities for future ground-based telescope facilities in the most recent Decadal Survey of astronomy conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. LSST will open a new frontier in addressing time variable phenomena in astronomy, according to the May 2000 academy report \"Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium.\" The immediate goal of the LSST Corporation is to prepare a detailed design for consideration by funding organizations and foundations, toward telescope first light as early as 2012. Four sites in Chile, Mexico, and the Canary Islands are currently being evaluated to host the telescope, to be reduced to two finalists for the site in 2005.", "url": "https://www.lsst.org/sites/default/files/docs/LSSTjan2005_2.pdf"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) receives $14.2 million National Science Foundation Design and Development Award", "date": "2005-08-22", "content": "The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) has been awarded a four-year, $14.2 million Cooperative Agreement with the National Science Foundation to design and develop a world-class, 8.4-meter telescope scheduled for completion in 2012. This award will allow engineers and scientists to complete design work already underway so that the LSST can begin construction in 2009. This unique system for surveying the heavens is made possible by advances in several technologies including: Large optics fabrication to create the telescope's distinctive 3- mirror design which includes a convex 4-meter secondary mirror, the size of many primary mirrors on today's large research telescopes. Data management systems to process and catalog the 30 terabytes of data generated nightly, the equivalent of 7,000 DVDs. New detectors needed to build the LSST's 3 billion pixel digital camera, the largest ever created. The LSST will image an area of the sky roughly fifty times that of the full moon every 15 seconds, opening a movie-like window on objects that change or move on rapid time scales - supernovae explosions which can be seen halfway across the universe, nearby asteroids which might potentially strike Earth, and faint objects in the outer solar system, far beyond Pluto. Using the light-bending gravity of dark matter, the LSST will chart the history of the expansion of the universe and probe the mysterious nature of dark energy. The LSST data will be \"open\" to the public and scientists around the world - anyone with a web browser will be able to access the images and other data produced by the LSST. \"The LSST is a public-private partnership and will offer a 'New Sky' available to everyone,\" said LSST Director J. Anthony Tyson of the University of California, Davis. \"Curious minds of all ages will be able to ask new questions of the LSST's public database and zoom into a color movie of the deep universe.\" The LSST Corporation awarded a $2.3 million contract to the University of Arizona Steward Observatory Mirror Lab in January, 2005, to purchase the glass and begin engineering work for the LSST's 8.4-meter diameter main mirror. Although the final site for the LSST has not been decided, the telescope will be placed in one of three candidate locations -- Las Campanas, Chile; Cerro Pachon, Chile; or San Pedro Martir, Baja California, Mexico.

The decision to place the LSST on Cerro Pach\u00f3n follows a two-year campaign of in-depth testing and analysis of the atmospheric conditions and quality of astronomical \"seeing\" at four sites in Chile, Mexico, and the Canary Islands. The eleven members of the Site Selection Committee, chaired by Marc Sarazin from the European Southern Observatory, reviewed detailed proposals from two final sites, San Pedro M\u00e1rtir in Baja California, Mexico, and Cerro Pach\u00f3n, regarding their suitability for the project. The final selection of Cerro Pach\u00f3n was made by the LSST Corporation Board of Directors based on a recommendation from the Site Selection Committee. Important factors when considering a site for the LSST include the number of clear nights per year, seasonal weather patterns, and the quality of images as seen through the local atmosphere. The chosen site also needed to have an existing observatory infrastructure and access to fiber optic links, to accommodate the anticipated 30 terabytes of data LSST will produce each night. Director of the Astronomy Department at Universidad de Chile Leonardo Bronfman said \"Chilean astronomers are enthusiastic about having the LSST sited in Chile and participating in its development and operation. We have unparalleled access to a wide suite of facilities in Chile, and are eager to utilize these resources to complement the strengths of LSST.\" \"The LSST will be the World's most powerful survey telescope and demands a superb site. We finally had a difficult decision between two wonderful sites at Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile and San Pedro M\u00e1rtir in Mexico. It's too bad we can't build two telescopes - one in each hemisphere.\" said Donald Sweeney, LSST Project Manager. \"The final decision was influenced by the existing infrastructure at Cerro Pach\u00f3n and the array of synergistic facilities in the south.\" Cerro Pach\u00f3n is already home to the Gemini South 8-meter telescope and the SOAR 4.1-meter telescope. LSST will be located on a peak on Cerro Pach\u00f3n named El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n. \"Siting LSST in Chile leverages the significant multi-wavelength astronomy investments already there,\" said University of California, Davis, Professor and LSST Director J.

The survey will last for 10 years and will produce 2000 images of every part of the sky over 20,000 square degrees. It will be constructed on Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a mountain in northern Chile. LSST will produce 30 Terabytes of data per night, yielding a total database of 100 Petabytes. This massive data set will be used to construct for the first time a color \"movie\" of the sky that will enable unique and powerful studies of objects that move or change in brightness. Examples range from potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids to exploding massive stars in the distant Universe. The total ten-year data set can also be used to probe the mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, two of the most pressing challenges to our current understanding of the fundamental forces and basic building blocks of Nature. Thirty-four universities and national labs have joined together in a public-private partnership to build LSST. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science have contributed funds for design and development of the LSST. Significant private support has come from Charles Simonyi, who said he was motivated by the broad impact of the project. \"The broad science and educational opportunities enabled by LSST have been reaffirmed by this top ranking by the National Academy of Sciences. With LSST we'll be able to gather thousands of times more data than possible until now, producing a 'movie' of our Universe and a database suitable for answering a wide range of pressing questions: What is dark energy? How did the Milky Way form? Are there potentially hazardous asteroids that may impact the Earth? And what sort of new phenomena have yet to be discovered? Let's get on with construction.\" Another major donor, Bill Gates, said \"LSST is just as imaginative in its technology and approach as it is with its science mission. The 8.4 meter LSST telescope and the three gigapixel camera are thus a shared resource for all humanity - the ultimate network peripheral device to explore the Universe.\" A unique feature of the project is that the database and resulting catalogs will be made available to the US and Chilean communities at large with no proprietary restrictions. A sophisticated data management system will provide easy access, enabling simple queries and exploration of the images by individual users, including professionals, amateurs, educators, and the public. The public will actively share the adventure of discovery of our dynamic Universe as described by Google CEO Eric Schmidt: \"LSST will produce a New Sky. Unique probes of our universe will result from this innovation, enabling discovery of unimagined phenomena. LSST will collect and organize the information in an expansive new view of our Universe, making it available to curious minds of all ages.\"", "url": "https://www.lsst.org/sites/default/files/docs/LSST_PR09.pdf"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "World's Largest Digital Camera Receives Green Light from US Government", "date": "2011-11-09", "content": "Last week the U.S. Department of Energy gave a green light to a project that aims to build the largest digital camera this planet has ever seen.

The parabolic mirror will be cast at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab. The molten borosilicate, made by the Ohara Corporation, will be spun cast at 2140 degrees Fahrenheit. Describing the production of the first such mirror in 2005, the Lab explained the process: The glass was \"... melted in a rotating furnace until it flowed into a honeycomb mold. Once the glass had cooled and the mold material was removed, scientists at the lab used a series of fine abrasives to polish the mirror, checking its figure regularly using a number of precision optical tests.\" How precise? Once the mirror cools, and the polishing is complete - a process that is expected to take a year - it will be accurate to within 1/20 the wavelength of light, or put another way, \"one part in 10 billion in terms of precision manufacturing,\" according to Patrick McCarthy, the project's director.

The parabolic mirror will be cast at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab. The molten borosilicate, made by the Ohara Corporation, will be spun cast at 2140 degrees Fahrenheit. Describing the production of the first such mirror in 2005, the Lab explained the process: The glass was \"... melted in a rotating furnace until it flowed into a honeycomb mold. Once the glass had cooled and the mold material was removed, scientists at the lab used a series of fine abrasives to polish the mirror, checking its figure regularly using a number of precision optical tests.\" How precise? Once the mirror cools, and the polishing is complete - a process that is expected to take a year - it will be accurate to within 1/20 the wavelength of light, or put another way, \"one part in 10 billion in terms of precision manufacturing,\" according to Patrick McCarthy, the project's director.

On 1 August, the National Science Foundation moved to release the first major chunk of construction funding-$27.5 million-for the $473 million project. The Department of Energy will also chip in about $165 million for the scope's camera and related instruments. LSST has a highly unusual design, with a very wide field of view so it can scan the entire sky every few nights. \"This concept is the next stage in the technological revolution that is going on in astronomy,\" says Gerry Gilmore of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Instead of looking at distant and faint objects for long periods to get enough light, LSST will look at things that change fast. \"This next step will look at a big enough patch of sky and cover it repeatedly and rapidly. We're all looking forward to it,\" Gilmore says. The development of LSST has been going on for more than a decade. In the National Research Council's 2010 decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics, researchers put it at the top of their wish list for ground-based telescopes. LSST is expected to begin full science operations in 2022 and will survey the sky for 10 years from Cerro Pach\u00f3n in northern Chile. After a rigorous design and development phase, the project team is ready to get down and dirty and actually build this amazing facility,\" said LSST Project Manager Victor Krabbendam in a statement. Gilmore says that the United Kingdom is now negotiating joining the project as an international partner. LSST will view a patch of sky 3.5\u00b0 across; that's seven times the diameter of the sun or moon. It will focus light onto a 3.2-gigapixel camera that takes an exposure every 20 seconds. This wide viewing angle is achieved by having three mirrors rather than the usual two: An 8.4-meter primary mirror reflects light onto a 3.4-meter secondary and from there onto a 5-meter tertiary mirror sitting in a large hole in the middle of the primary. So the primary is like a giant ring. \"It's a big telephoto lens,\" Gilmore says. LSST will map out the faint variable stars that are used to measure distances in the local universe and the flashgunlike supernovae that help gauge longer distances. It will measure weak gravitational lensing deep in space as a way of detecting dark energy and dark matter. Researchers will use it to study the flashes of light given out when black holes, including the giant ones at the centers of galaxies, consume stars and other material. Closer to home, LSST will map near-Earth asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in the far solar system. One of the project's biggest challenges will be coping with the volume of data the telescope will produce, far too much to be processed by human beings. \"This is big data in extremis. It'll be like a gigantic video stream pouring down from the sky,\" Gilmore says. The telescope is expected to produce about 30 terabytes of data per night and advanced data-mining techniques will need to be developed to find objects of interest in the stream of images. Automated systems will also be needed to spot fast-changing objects in the sky and alert other telescopes to home in on them quickly for more detailed study, similar to the existing system for studying gamma ray bursts. \"We'll need to move another couple of steps up the complexity ladder,\" Gilmore says.", "url": "https://www.science.org/content/article/unusual-new-telescope-gets-green-light"}, {"title": "Penn State is a member of a new $678 million telescope project", "date": "2014-08-19", "content": "The U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy have completed an agreement to support the $678 million construction costs of a major new tool for studying the universe, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will be located in Chile.

Willaman Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Penn State, chair of the LSST's Active Galactic Nuclei Science Collaboration, chair of the LSST Deep Drilling Interest Group, and a member of the LSST Science Advisory Committee. The large size of the telescope mirror (27 feet in diameter) and its camera's wide field of view will allow the LSST to view the entire available sky every few days. One of the many scientific programs enabled by this frequent viewing of the sky is the identification and tracking of asteroids and comets with orbits that indicate they could collide with the Earth. \"In addition to the enormous dataset, LSST will produce nearly real-time alerts to unusual celestial events, ranging from powerful supernova explosions of giant stars to the destruction of stars by supermassive black holes,\" commented Donald Schneider, distinguished professor and head of Penn State's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.The LSST mission directly addresses the most pressing questions in astronomy and physics, which also are driving advances in big-data science and big-data computing. By digitally imaging the sky during the decade after its completion, the LSST will produce a petabyte-scale database that is expected to reveal new knowledge that will enrich both scientific research and education in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics.The early development of the LSST was supported by the LSST Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of universities and other research institutions including Penn State. Fabrication of the major mirror components already is underway, thanks to private funding received from the Charles and Lisa Simonyi Foundation for Arts and Sciences, Bill Gates, and other individuals.This new agreement, which provides support for the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to manage the construction of the LSST, marks the official federal start of the LSST project, the top-ranked major ground-based facility recommended by the National Research Council's Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey in 2010. Receipt of federal construction funds now lets major contracts to move forward and sets the project on a pace that allows the science survey to begin in 2022.The LSST project is an NSF and Department of Energy (DOE) partnership. NSF is responsible for the telescope and site, education and outreach, and the data-management system. DOE is providing the camera and related instrumentation.Steven Kahn, LSST director, of Stanford University, commented on the unique contributions LSST will make to astronomy and fundamental physics: \"The broad range of science enabled by the LSST survey will change our understanding of the dynamic universe on timescales ranging from its earliest moments after the Big Bang to the motions of asteroids in the solar system today. The open nature of our data products means that the public will have the opportunity to share in this exciting adventure along with the scientific community.

One of the many scientific programs enabled by this frequent viewing of the sky is the identification and tracking of asteroids and comets with orbits that indicate they could collide with the Earth. \"In addition to the enormous dataset, LSST will produce nearly real-time alerts to unusual celestial events, ranging from powerful supernova explosions of giant stars to the destruction of stars by supermassive black holes,\" commented Donald Schneider, distinguished professor and head of Penn State's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.The LSST mission directly addresses the most pressing questions in astronomy and physics, which also are driving advances in big-data science and big-data computing. By digitally imaging the sky during the decade after its completion, the LSST will produce a petabyte-scale database that is expected to reveal new knowledge that will enrich both scientific research and education in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics.The early development of the LSST was supported by the LSST Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of universities and other research institutions including Penn State.

On 1 August, the National Science Foundation moved to release the first major chunk of construction funding-$27.5 million-for the $473 million project. The Department of Energy will also chip in about $165 million for the scope's camera and related instruments. LSST has a highly unusual design, with a very wide field of view so it can scan the entire sky every few nights. \"This concept is the next stage in the technological revolution that is going on in astronomy,\" says Gerry Gilmore of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Instead of looking at distant and faint objects for long periods to get enough light, LSST will look at things that change fast. \"This next step will look at a big enough patch of sky and cover it repeatedly and rapidly. We're all looking forward to it,\" Gilmore says. The development of LSST has been going on for more than a decade. In the National Research Council's 2010 decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics, researchers put it at the top of their wish list for ground-based telescopes. LSST is expected to begin full science operations in 2022 and will survey the sky for 10 years from Cerro Pach\u00f3n in northern Chile. After a rigorous design and development phase, the project team is ready to get down and dirty and actually build this amazing facility,\" said LSST Project Manager Victor Krabbendam in a statement. Gilmore says that the United Kingdom is now negotiating joining the project as an international partner. LSST will view a patch of sky 3.5\u00b0 across; that's seven times the diameter of the sun or moon. It will focus light onto a 3.2-gigapixel camera that takes an exposure every 20 seconds. This wide viewing angle is achieved by having three mirrors rather than the usual two: An 8.4-meter primary mirror reflects light onto a 3.4-meter secondary and from there onto a 5-meter tertiary mirror sitting in a large hole in the middle of the primary. So the primary is like a giant ring. \"It's a big telephoto lens,\" Gilmore says. LSST will map out the faint variable stars that are used to measure distances in the local universe and the flashgunlike supernovae that help gauge longer distances. It will measure weak gravitational lensing deep in space as a way of detecting dark energy and dark matter. Researchers will use it to study the flashes of light given out when black holes, including the giant ones at the centers of galaxies, consume stars and other material. Closer to home, LSST will map near-Earth asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in the far solar system. One of the project's biggest challenges will be coping with the volume of data the telescope will produce, far too much to be processed by human beings. \"This is big data in extremis. It'll be like a gigantic video stream pouring down from the sky,\" Gilmore says. The telescope is expected to produce about 30 terabytes of data per night and advanced data-mining techniques will need to be developed to find objects of interest in the stream of images. Automated systems will also be needed to spot fast-changing objects in the sky and alert other telescopes to home in on them quickly for more detailed study, similar to the existing system for studying gamma ray bursts. \"We'll need to move another couple of steps up the complexity ladder,\" Gilmore says.", "url": "https://www.science.org/content/article/unusual-new-telescope-gets-green-light"}, {"title": "Penn State is a member of a new $678 million telescope project", "date": "2014-08-19", "content": "The U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy have completed an agreement to support the $678 million construction costs of a major new tool for studying the universe, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will be located in Chile.

A Scottsdale high-tech entrepreneur on Monday donated $20 million toward the Giant Magellan Telescope, which is scheduled to be completed in 2021 in Chile. Richard F. Caris, founder and chairman of Interface Inc., has donated more than $2 million in the past toward other university astronomy projects. Interface specializes in high-tech equipment used in aerospace, medical, automotive and other industries. The donation will go toward the university's commitment to raise $60 million for the Giant Magellan project. The university's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab also is manufacturing the giant mirrors for the 25-meter telescope. Partnership in Giant Magellan ensures that UA astronomers will have observation time on the telescope, which will have 10 times the resolution of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. \"Astronomers are always trying to push the frontiers both in terms of discovery and technology. We tend to be doing things that are expensive,\" said Buell Jannuzi, head of the UA Department of Astronomy and director of the Steward Observatory. Donations in the tens of millions by single individuals are rare at Arizona's three state universities. Dan Petrocelli, development director for Steward Observatory, said the $20 million gift is the largest single donation the observatory has received in its more than 90-year history. \"It helps the U of A maintain its world-class status in astronomy for at least the next 50 years,\" he said. In honor of the donation, the UA mirror lab in Tucson will be renamed the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab. The lab began crafting mirrors more than a quarter-century ago under the direction of founder Roger Angel. The mirrors became larger and more advanced over time. The mirrors the lab is crafting for Giant Magellan are the among the largest telescope mirrors ever made. The lab is located under the stands of the university's football stadium. The location was chosen to take advantage of vacant space high enough to accommodate the giant mirrors. The Giant Magellan is an Earth-based telescope that will be made up of an array of seven mirrors, each about 27 feet in diameter. The process of manufacturing a mirror, from casting to grinding to polishing, can take several years. The first mirror was more than six years in the making and was completed in 2012. The second and third mirrors are now under construction. The fourth, center mirror will be cast in late March. The mirrors are cast from glass chunks in an enormous furnace. Temperatures reach about 2,140 degrees. The oven gradually drops to room temperature over a span of about 12 weeks. The gradual cooling is necessary to ensure the material doesn't break. Once cast, the mirrors resemble circular ice-skating rinks. Workers then grind and polish the surface using diamond-grinding tools. The lab uses a laser to analyze and map the mirror's surface. Adjustments are made based on the results. The mirror surface is ground and polished so precisely that if the mirror were expanded to the size of the United States, the highest and lowest points would differ by no more than half an inch. As the mirrors are finished, they will be stored until ready for shipment to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The location, on a mountaintop, was chosen because of its altitude and clear skies. The Giant Magellan is designed to collect more light and provide better resolution than telescopes used today. Put another way, if the Giant Magellan were in Phoenix and pointed at Tucson, it would be able to see the torch on a dime in Tucson, Jannuzi said. Scientists hope to learn more about the universe, including getting a clearer picture of planets that orbit nearby stars and a better look at faint galaxies. The Giant Magellan project is an international consortium made up of universities, such as the UA, the University of Chicago and Harvard University, and institutes in Australia and South Korea. The donation by Caris is a relatively unusual fete for Arizona's university system, which includes the UA, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University.

It will eventually be shipped, by truck and boat, to a mountaintop in Chile. Together with its glass mirror blank and cell, the load will weigh 50 tons, said Bill Gressler, who handles logistics for the telescope and site. From its perch in the Andean foothills, LSST will make the deepest, widest, fastest movie ever made - a movie of the entire sky visible from Cerro Pachon that will help astrophysicists uncover the secrets of dark matter and energy and the history of the universe. It will also reveal, on a nightly basis, 1 million transient events or \"things that go bump in the night,\" as Steward Observatory astronomer Philip Pinto puts it - exploding stars, moving asteroids, possibly planets in our own solar system beyond Pluto. It will undoubtedly uncover things astronomers have never seen before. Pinto said the LSST is a shift in thinking for the current generation of giant telescopes. Its 8.4-meter (27.6 feet) mirror was designed to deliver a wide field of view - 49 times the area of the moon as seen from Earth - as opposed to the much narrower view afforded by telescopes with similar-sized mirrors that concentrate on pinpoint resolution. \"The idea is to look at all of the sky as often as possible, about every three days,\" said Pinto. \"The other radical new way of thinking is you do one very carefully done set of observations, then everyone uses it to do science, sort of like the human genome projects.\" The massive flow of data - 20 to 30 terabytes per night - will require the services of one of the largest supercomputers in the world and a computer sorting system, yet to be devised. First, though, it required a mirror, unique in the world, to create that wide field of view on a giant telescope that must pivot and point quickly and accurately. \"There has never been a telescope that moves around the sky this quickly,\" said Gressler, project manager for telescope and site with the LSST Project Team. Including two mirror surfaces on the one giant slab made it possible to devise a compact telescope with a wide field of view, he said. One of Gressler's logistical tasks is to deliver the mirror and its cell to the end of a winding mountain road in the foothills of the Chilean Andes. The last 25 miles is not paved and has grades of up to 16 percent. Among the restrictions along the way is a tunnel at Puclaro Dam, which is 11 meters wide (36 feet). The box containing the LSST mirror is 30 feet square. It was made by Tucson's CAID Industries, which has made the steel shipping containers for all of the UA's mirrors. Gressler has an immediate logistical challenge. He has to move the mirror from the UA's Mirror Lab, where four giant mirrors are in various stages of completion and space is at a premium. He has found space in a hangar at Million Air Tucson, a concierge service for private jets at Tucson International Airport. That will require a slow nighttime drive on a flatbed truck from UA Stadium and permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to widen a gate. The mirror will come back for final testing in about two years before starting its longer journey by truck, probably to the port of Houston, where it will be loaded onto a ship for its voyage to La Serena, Chile. Making unique mirrors is basically the job description at the mirror lab which, under direction of founder Roger Angel, set out to make the largest single mirror surfaces in the world. Its borosilicate mirrors, cast in a spinning furnace beneath the bleachers of Arizona Stadium, are honeycombed with air pockets to produce mirrors that are both rigid and lightweight. The technical teams at Steward have perfected the process over the years, but that doesn't make it easy. \"It's a unique mirror. There has never been another one like it,\" said Buddy Martin, who headed the effort of grinding and polishing the mirror to exacting tolerances. The LSST is two mirrors in one. The primary mirror, which collects the light from the night sky, is on the outer edge. It reflects light to a secondary mirror being made elsewhere, which, in turn, reflects that light to the interior edge of the mirror. From there it is directed to the instrument that records it - a giant 3,200-megapixel camera, the largest ever made, sitting right above the hollow center of the LSST mirror. When he began the task, Martin thought it would take the usual two years, but soon realized that he was polishing two mirrors with \"additional complexity because the shapes had to be coordinated in a way we've never done before.\" Testing also became more complex, he said. The outer mirror had to be tested 20 meters above the surface and the inner mirror at 8 meters. That meant reconfiguration of the testing tower. Completion and testing of the mirror was cause for celebration in January for the corporation formed to build it, the Tucson-based LSST Corporation. It put together a variety of philanthropic and institutional sources to get the project started, with the expectation that it would become part of a federally-funded telescope project.", "url": "https://tucson.com/news/blogs/scientific-bent/big-mirror-about-to-move-from-ua-lab/article_992c2619-6037-5409-9756-da29c695e64b.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "UA gets $20 million grant toward giant telescope", "date": "2014-12-15", "content": "University of Arizona astronomers are closer to having their own high-powered window to the universe. A Scottsdale high-tech entrepreneur on Monday donated $20 million toward the Giant Magellan Telescope, which is scheduled to be completed in 2021 in Chile. Richard F. Caris, founder and chairman of Interface Inc., has donated more than $2 million in the past toward other university astronomy projects. Interface specializes in high-tech equipment used in aerospace, medical, automotive and other industries. The donation will go toward the university's commitment to raise $60 million for the Giant Magellan project. The university's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab also is manufacturing the giant mirrors for the 25-meter telescope. Partnership in Giant Magellan ensures that UA astronomers will have observation time on the telescope, which will have 10 times the resolution of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. \"Astronomers are always trying to push the frontiers both in terms of discovery and technology. We tend to be doing things that are expensive,\" said Buell Jannuzi, head of the UA Department of Astronomy and director of the Steward Observatory. Donations in the tens of millions by single individuals are rare at Arizona's three state universities. Dan Petrocelli, development director for Steward Observatory, said the $20 million gift is the largest single donation the observatory has received in its more than 90-year history. \"It helps the U of A maintain its world-class status in astronomy for at least the next 50 years,\" he said. In honor of the donation, the UA mirror lab in Tucson will be renamed the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab. The lab began crafting mirrors more than a quarter-century ago under the direction of founder Roger Angel. The mirrors became larger and more advanced over time. The mirrors the lab is crafting for Giant Magellan are the among the largest telescope mirrors ever made. The lab is located under the stands of the university's football stadium. The location was chosen to take advantage of vacant space high enough to accommodate the giant mirrors. The Giant Magellan is an Earth-based telescope that will be made up of an array of seven mirrors, each about 27 feet in diameter. The process of manufacturing a mirror, from casting to grinding to polishing, can take several years. The first mirror was more than six years in the making and was completed in 2012. The second and third mirrors are now under construction. The fourth, center mirror will be cast in late March. The mirrors are cast from glass chunks in an enormous furnace. Temperatures reach about 2,140 degrees. The oven gradually drops to room temperature over a span of about 12 weeks. The gradual cooling is necessary to ensure the material doesn't break. Once cast, the mirrors resemble circular ice-skating rinks. Workers then grind and polish the surface using diamond-grinding tools. The lab uses a laser to analyze and map the mirror's surface. Adjustments are made based on the results. The mirror surface is ground and polished so precisely that if the mirror were expanded to the size of the United States, the highest and lowest points would differ by no more than half an inch. As the mirrors are finished, they will be stored until ready for shipment to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The location, on a mountaintop, was chosen because of its altitude and clear skies. The Giant Magellan is designed to collect more light and provide better resolution than telescopes used today. Put another way, if the Giant Magellan were in Phoenix and pointed at Tucson, it would be able to see the torch on a dime in Tucson, Jannuzi said. Scientists hope to learn more about the universe, including getting a clearer picture of planets that orbit nearby stars and a better look at faint galaxies. The Giant Magellan project is an international consortium made up of universities, such as the UA, the University of Chicago and Harvard University, and institutes in Australia and South Korea. The donation by Caris is a relatively unusual fete for Arizona's university system, which includes the UA, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University. Philanthropist Agnese Nelms Haury, who died earlier this year, left the UA $50 million, one of the largest single gifts in school history. Her donation will be used to create an endowment to fund programs that she was passionate about, the school said. In May, businesswoman and philanthropist Julie Ann Wrigley announced she was donating another $25 million to ASU's Global Institute of Sustainability. Wrigley, the widow of chewing-gum heir William Wrigley, has already given $25 million. The combined commitment made her one of three individuals or families who have promised $50 million or more to ASU. In 2007, the former CEO of America West Airlines, William A.

Gressler has an immediate logistical challenge. He has to move the mirror from the UA's Mirror Lab, where four giant mirrors are in various stages of completion and space is at a premium. He has found space in a hangar at Million Air Tucson, a concierge service for private jets at Tucson International Airport. That will require a slow nighttime drive on a flatbed truck from UA Stadium and permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to widen a gate. The mirror will come back for final testing in about two years before starting its longer journey by truck, probably to the port of Houston, where it will be loaded onto a ship for its voyage to La Serena, Chile. Making unique mirrors is basically the job description at the mirror lab which, under direction of founder Roger Angel, set out to make the largest single mirror surfaces in the world. Its borosilicate mirrors, cast in a spinning furnace beneath the bleachers of Arizona Stadium, are honeycombed with air pockets to produce mirrors that are both rigid and lightweight. The technical teams at Steward have perfected the process over the years, but that doesn't make it easy. \"It's a unique mirror. There has never been another one like it,\" said Buddy Martin, who headed the effort of grinding and polishing the mirror to exacting tolerances. The LSST is two mirrors in one. The primary mirror, which collects the light from the night sky, is on the outer edge. It reflects light to a secondary mirror being made elsewhere, which, in turn, reflects that light to the interior edge of the mirror. From there it is directed to the instrument that records it - a giant 3,200-megapixel camera, the largest ever made, sitting right above the hollow center of the LSST mirror. When he began the task, Martin thought it would take the usual two years, but soon realized that he was polishing two mirrors with \"additional complexity because the shapes had to be coordinated in a way we've never done before.\" Testing also became more complex, he said. The outer mirror had to be tested 20 meters above the surface and the inner mirror at 8 meters. That meant reconfiguration of the testing tower. Completion and testing of the mirror was cause for celebration in January for the corporation formed to build it, the Tucson-based LSST Corporation. It put together a variety of philanthropic and institutional sources to get the project started, with the expectation that it would become part of a federally-funded telescope project.", "url": "https://tucson.com/news/blogs/scientific-bent/big-mirror-about-to-move-from-ua-lab/article_992c2619-6037-5409-9756-da29c695e64b.html"}, {"title": "LSST lays first stone", "date": "2015-04-15", "content": "A new ground-based telescope promises unprecedented information about distant galaxies, nearby asteroids and even the mysterious dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of our universe.

The telescope's camera - the size of a small car and weighing more than three tons - will capture full-sky images at such high resolution that it would take 1,500 high-definition television screens to display just one of them. This has already been a busy year for the LSST Project. Its dual-surface primary/tertiary mirror - the first of its kind for a major telescope - was completed; a traditional stone-laying ceremony in northern Chile marked the beginning of on-site construction of the facility; and a nearly 2,000-square-foot, 2-story-tall clean room was completed at SLAC to accommodate fabrication of the camera. \"We are very gratified to see everyone's hard work appreciated and acknowledged by this DOE approval,\" said SLAC Director Chi-Chang Kao. \"SLAC is honored to be partnering with the National Science Foundation and other DOE labs on this groundbreaking endeavor. We're also excited about the wide range of scientific opportunities offered by LSST, in particular increasing our understanding of dark energy.\" Components of the camera are being built by an international collaboration of universities and labs, including DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and SLAC. SLAC is responsible for overall project management and systems engineering, camera body design and fabrication, data acquisition and camera control software, cryostat design and fabrication, and integration and testing of the entire camera. Building and testing the camera will take approximately five years. SLAC is also designing and constructing the NSF-funded database for the telescope's data management system. LSST will generate a vast public archive of data - approximately 6 million gigabytes per year, or the equivalent of shooting roughly 800,000 images with a regular 8-megapixel digital camera every night, albeit of much higher quality and scientific value. This data will help researchers study the formation of galaxies, track potentially hazardous asteroids, observe exploding stars and better understand dark matter and dark energy, which together make up 95 percent of the universe but whose natures remain unknown. \"We have a busy agenda for the rest of 2015 and 2016,\" said Kahn. \"Construction of the telescope on the mountain is well underway. The contracts for fabrication of the telescope mount and the dome enclosure have been awarded and the vendors are at full steam.\" Nadine Kurita, camera project manager at SLAC, said fabrication of the state- of-the-art sensors for the camera has already begun, and contracts are being awarded for optical elements and other major components. \"After several years of focusing on designs and prototypes, we are excited to start construction of key parts of the camera. The coming year will be crucial as we assemble and test the sensors for the focal plane.\" The National Research Council's Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey, Astro2010, ranked the LSST as the top ground-based priority for the field for the current decade. The recent report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritisation Panel of the federal High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, setting forth the strategic plan for U.S. particle physics, also recommended completion of the LSST. \"We've been working hard for years to get to this point,\" said Kurita. \"Everyone is very excited to start building the camera and take a big step toward conducting a deep survey of the southern night sky.\"", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/09/01/worlds-most-powerful-telescope-digital-camera-gets-green-light-for-construction/"}, {"title": "World's largest camera coming to Chile", "date": "2015-10-01", "content": "There is currently a gigantic camera being built in the mountains of Chile, in the foothills of the Andes, that will be like nothing we've ever seen before. While the new iPhone 6S camera may have just upgraded from eight megapixels to 12, this will have a whopping 3,200 megapixels - making it a 3.2 billion pixel camera. Named the LSST, or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, it is set to be the largest camera in the world. Scheduled to be finished in 2019, it will combine a telescope, mirror, camera, data system, and survey technology. This thing is going to be huge. It's just one addition to a class of giant land-based telescopes coming online in the next decade. It will have a lower enclosure 100 feet in diameter, a service and operations building of 32,000 square feet attached to it, as well as another section for the calibration telescope. What it will do: The LSST will record the entirety of the visible nighttime sky twice a week, taking over 800 panaromic images during each of those nights. This will result in 30 terabytes of data each evening. From these captures, it will produce an animated 3D map of the universe. With a large depth of details, these maps will allow us to analyze the solar system in a new way, including studying mysterious dark matter and learn more about our own Milky Way galaxy. How it will work: The LSST will focus on capturing images of space at night. It's able to cover 10 square degrees of sky. This ability comes from its large mirror and field of view, which work hand-in-hand to capture billions of objects that are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. The powerful data system will be able to keep track of the brightness and positions of space objects, like galaxy clusters and asteroids, as well as comparing the images being taken in the present with those of the past. This even includes detecting and keeping track of asteroids that might be threatening to Earth. Access to the findings: Luckily, these maps won't be an exclusive experience to scientists. The public will be able to view the moving 3D map via the internet each night as it captures the sky. These new, highly detailed images will allow us to see billions of objects in space that we can't with our own eyes. Education is important to the team behind the LSST. The group is also planning to develop research projects which students can do in school, in their home, or out at museums. Why Chile?

The ceremony marks the commencement of on-site construction of the telescope and its support base. The GMT is poised to become the world's largest telescope when it begins early operations in 2021. It will produce images 10 times sharper than those delivered by Hubble Space Telescope and will address key questions in cosmology, astrophysics, and the study of planets outside our solar system. \"We are thrilled to be breaking ground on the Giant Magellan Telescope site at such an exciting time for astronomy,\" says Dr. Taft Armandroff, GMT Board Chair and director of McDonald Observatory. \"With its unprecedented size and resolving power, the Giant Magellan Telescope will allow current and future generations of astronomers to continue the journey of cosmic discovery.\" The GMT will be located at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. Known for its clear, dark skies and outstanding astronomical image clarity, Las Campanas is one of the world's premier locations for astronomy. Construction crews will soon be busy on the site building the roads, power, data, and other infrastructure needed to support the observatory. The unique design of the telescope combines seven of the largest mirrors that can be manufactured, each 8.4 meters (27 feet) across, to create a single telescope effectively 25 meters or 85 feet in diameter. The giant mirrors are being developed at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory. Each mirror must be polished to an accuracy of 25 nanometers or one millionth of an inch. One giant mirror has been polished to meet its exacting specifications. Three others are being processed, and production of the additional mirrors will be started at the rate of one per year. The telescope will begin early operations with these first mirrors in 2021, and the telescope is expected to reach full operational capacity within the next decade. \"An enormous amount of work has gone into the design phase of the project and development of the giant mirrors that are the heart of the telescope. The highest technical risks have been retired, and we are looking forward to bringing the components of the telescope together on the mountain top,\" says Patrick McCarthy, interim president of the GMT Organization.

While the new iPhone 6S camera may have just upgraded from eight megapixels to 12, this will have a whopping 3,200 megapixels - making it a 3.2 billion pixel camera. Named the LSST, or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, it is set to be the largest camera in the world. Scheduled to be finished in 2019, it will combine a telescope, mirror, camera, data system, and survey technology. This thing is going to be huge. It's just one addition to a class of giant land-based telescopes coming online in the next decade. It will have a lower enclosure 100 feet in diameter, a service and operations building of 32,000 square feet attached to it, as well as another section for the calibration telescope. What it will do: The LSST will record the entirety of the visible nighttime sky twice a week, taking over 800 panaromic images during each of those nights. This will result in 30 terabytes of data each evening. From these captures, it will produce an animated 3D map of the universe. With a large depth of details, these maps will allow us to analyze the solar system in a new way, including studying mysterious dark matter and learn more about our own Milky Way galaxy. How it will work: The LSST will focus on capturing images of space at night. It's able to cover 10 square degrees of sky. This ability comes from its large mirror and field of view, which work hand-in-hand to capture billions of objects that are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. The powerful data system will be able to keep track of the brightness and positions of space objects, like galaxy clusters and asteroids, as well as comparing the images being taken in the present with those of the past. This even includes detecting and keeping track of asteroids that might be threatening to Earth. Access to the findings: Luckily, these maps won't be an exclusive experience to scientists. The public will be able to view the moving 3D map via the internet each night as it captures the sky. These new, highly detailed images will allow us to see billions of objects in space that we can't with our own eyes. Education is important to the team behind the LSST. The group is also planning to develop research projects which students can do in school, in their home, or out at museums. Why Chile? Telescopes are almost never located in highly populated areas because of the threat of light pollution. Cloud cover can also be a problem, so they are also usually put at higher altitudes and in drier climates. Cerro Pach\u00f3n, the mountain in Chile where the LSST will be located, was chosen as the best option by an appointed committee. Construction started in 2014, and it's scheduled to be completed by 2019.

It will produce images 10 times sharper than those delivered by Hubble Space Telescope and will address key questions in cosmology, astrophysics, and the study of planets outside our solar system. \"We are thrilled to be breaking ground on the Giant Magellan Telescope site at such an exciting time for astronomy,\" says Dr. Taft Armandroff, GMT Board Chair and director of McDonald Observatory. \"With its unprecedented size and resolving power, the Giant Magellan Telescope will allow current and future generations of astronomers to continue the journey of cosmic discovery.\" The GMT will be located at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. Known for its clear, dark skies and outstanding astronomical image clarity, Las Campanas is one of the world's premier locations for astronomy. Construction crews will soon be busy on the site building the roads, power, data, and other infrastructure needed to support the observatory. The unique design of the telescope combines seven of the largest mirrors that can be manufactured, each 8.4 meters (27 feet) across, to create a single telescope effectively 25 meters or 85 feet in diameter. The giant mirrors are being developed at the University of Arizona's Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory. Each mirror must be polished to an accuracy of 25 nanometers or one millionth of an inch. One giant mirror has been polished to meet its exacting specifications. Three others are being processed, and production of the additional mirrors will be started at the rate of one per year. The telescope will begin early operations with these first mirrors in 2021, and the telescope is expected to reach full operational capacity within the next decade. \"An enormous amount of work has gone into the design phase of the project and development of the giant mirrors that are the heart of the telescope.

Soon, it will become more powerful still: Scientists recently primed the telescope to find evidence of dark energy in the early universe, prying open its eye so it can see and process a wide swath of sky. On April 8, scientists will dedicate the new telescope, capping off the $40 million upgrade and beginning the real work. The dark energy experiment, called Hetdex, isn't how astronomy has traditionally been done. In the classical model, a lone astronomer goes to a mountaintop and solemnly points a telescope at one predetermined object. But Hetdex won't look for any objects in particular; it will just scan the sky and churn petabytes of the resulting data through a silicon visual cortex. That's only possible because of today's steroidal computers, which let scientists analyze, store, and send such massive quantities of data. The hope is so-called blind surveys like this one will find stuff astronomers never even knew to look for. In this realm, computers take over curation of the sky, telling astronomers what is interesting and worthy of further study, rather than the other way around. These wide-eyed projects are becoming a standard part of astronomers' arsenal, and the greatest part about them is that their best discoveries are still totally TBD. Big Sky Country: To understand dark energy---that mysterious stuff that pulls the taffy of spacetime---the Hetdex team needed Hobby-Eberly to study one million galaxies 9-11 billion light-years away as they fly away from Earth. To get that many galaxies in a reasonable amount of time, they broadened the view of its 91 tessellated stop-sign-shaped mirrors by 100. They also created an instrument called Virus, with 35,000 optical fibers that send the light from the universe to a spectrograph, which splits it up into constituent wavelengths. All that data can determine both how far away a galaxy is and how fast it's traveling away from Earth. But when a telescope takes a ton of data down from the sky, scientists can also uncover the unexpected. Hetdex's astronomers will find more than just the stretch marks of dark energy. They'll discover things about supermassive black holes, star formation, dark matter, and the ages of stars in nearby galaxies. The classical method still has advantages; if you know exactly what you want to look at, you write up a nice proposal to Hubble and explain why a fixed gaze at the Whirlpool Galaxy would yield significant results. \"But what you see is what you get,\" says astronomer Douglas Hudgins. \"This is an object, and the science of that object is what you're stuck with.\"Hobby-Eberly is only the most recent telescope to open its eyes to this new method. When NASA's Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope launches in the 2020s, its view will be 100 times wider than Hubble's---and boast 288 megapixels. It'll check out the effects of dark energy and find new planets, but some of its work is similarly object-agnostic. \"The survey science will enable everything from soup to nuts,\" says Hudgins, who's working on the program. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope---the LSST, not pronounced \"Liszt\"---will similarly capture the whole sky every few nights, for 10 years, making a decade-long, high-def movie. Its gaze, at any given time, see a space the size of 40 full moons. Electronics and algorithms will auto-check the images to see what has changed or moved or surged or dimmed from night to night. \"The most exciting thing about the LSST will be discovering things that are rare or truly novel or unusual,\" says Lucianne Walkowicz, head of the telescope's eight science collaborations. Mythical Creatures of the Cosmos: Scientists will always need science-of-that-specific-object observations---to follow up on weirdness, to look deeper, to zoom, to see through a different filter. But until pretty recently, they didn't have the option of big, blind surveys. The silicon boxes of the past couldn't handle them. And---most importantly---they didn't have the torque to twist useful information from the background noise. Back in the Lone Star State, where Hobby-Eberly will study more than lone stars, the Hetdex team has turned to the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The data will go straight from telescope to computing center, where the scientists hope to auto-process it in near-real-time and store the resulting petabytes. \"All I do on a daily basis is just write computer code. That's what I am now: a computer coder,\" says Gebhardt, who is an astronomer. He believes their processing pipeline will be ready when the full survey starts in August or September. And like Walkowicz and Hudgins, he looks forward to the \"strange oddballs,\" the who-knows-whats. \"You don't know how to find them, because you don't know what to look for,\" he says. But because Hetdex isn't exactly looking for anything, it doesn't need to know how. And that, really, is why object-agnostic research excites scientists. \"I could sit here and describe five things to you,\" says Hudgins, \"and I guarantee that once we do the survey, the most exciting thing is something I didn't think of.\" Sarah Scoles is the author of Making Contact and They Are Already Here.

Its 3-ton camera, built with National Science Foundation support, will be the largest digital instrument ever built for ground-based astronomy and will take pictures fast enough to capture the entire southern sky every three nights. According to a TED talk by Andy Connolly, Professor of Astronomy at the University of Washington and Team Lead for LSST Simulations, the Hubble Space Telescope would need 120 years to image an equivalent area of sky. Imaging at this rate will generate about 15 terabytes (15 trillion bytes) of raw data per night and 30 petabytes over its 10-year survey life. (A petabyte is approximately the amount of data in 200,000 movie-length DVDs.) Even after processing, that's still a 15 PB (15,000 TB) store. Such huge datasets will give astronomers a ten-year time-lapse \"movie\" of the southern sky, yielding new subject matter for time-domain studies and a deeper understanding of the dynamic behavior of the universe. It will also change the way science is done - astronomer-and-telescope is giving way to astronomer-and-data as an engine of new knowledge. Preparing the information: The LSST's biggest strength may be its ability to capture transients - rare or changing events usually missed in narrow-field searches and static images. The good news is that software will alert astronomers almost immediately when a transient is detected to enable fast follow-up observations by other instruments. The not-so-good news is that up to 10 million such events are possible each night. With detection rates like these, good data handling is essential. The LSST Data Management Team is designing user tools that can operate on a variety of computing systems without the need for large downloads, all based on open-source software. Their system includes two basic types of products: those produced for nightly observing and those produced for annual science releases. Nightly processing will subtract two exposures of the each image field to quickly highlight changes. The data stream from the camera will be pipeline processed and continuously updated in real time, with a transient alert triggered within 60 seconds of completing an image readout. Data complied into scheduled science releases will get considerable reprocessing to ensure that all contents are consistent, that false detections are filtered and that faint signal sources are confirmed. Reprocessing will also classify objects using both standard categories and dimensions derived mathematically from the data themselves. Products will be reprocessed at time intervals from nightly to annually, which means that their quality will improve as additional observations are accumulated. Preparing the science: The LSST program includes Science Collaborations, teams of scientists and technical experts that work to grow the observatory's science agendas. There are currently eight collaborations in such areas as galaxies, dark energy and active galactic nuclei. One of the most unique, however, is the Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration which, unlike other teams, doesn't focus on a specific astronomy topic but cuts across them all. New methods will be needed to handle heavy computational loads, to optimize data representations, and to guide astronomers through the discovery process. The ISSC focus is on such new approaches to ensure that astronomers realize the best return from the anticipated flood of new data. \"Data analysis is changing because of the volume of data we're facing,\" says Kirk Borne, an astrophysicist and data scientist with Booz Allen Hamilton, and a core member of the ISSC. \"Traditional data analysis is more about fitting a physical model to observed data. When I was growing up, we didn't have sample sizes like this. We were trying to understand a particular phenomenon with our small sample sets. Now, it's more unsupervised. Instead of asking 'tell me about my model,' you ask 'tell me what you know.' Data become the model, which means that more is different.\" LSST data will almost certainly expand the chances for surprise. \"When we start adding different measurement domains like gravitational wave physics and neutrino astrophysics for exploration,\" adds Borne, \"we start seeing these interesting new associations. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies are connected with colliding starbursting galaxies, for example, but it was a discovery made by combining optical radiation with infrared. Quasars were discovered when people compared bright radio observations of galaxies with optical images of galaxies.\" Preparing the people: The LSST Data Management Team is starting to orient the astronomy community to what's coming with a series of conferences and workshops. \"We try to cover as many meetings as we can, giving talks and hosting hack sessions,\" says William O'Mullane, the team Project Manager. Science notebooks, which allow users to collaborate, analyze data and publish their results online, will be an integral tool for LSST research communities and one that's being introduced early. \"We rolled out Jupyterlab [an upgraded type of science notebook] at a recent workshop,\" he adds, \"which is a much faster way to get people working with the stack [the image manipulation code set].\" The next generation of big data astronomers is also being groomed through graduate curricula and a special fellowship program. \"Getting students involved early is a very good thing, both for the field and for them,\" says Mario Juric, Associate Professor of Astronomy at the University of Washington, and the LSST Data Management System Science Team Coordinator. \"Students need to understand early on what it's like to do large-scale experiments, to design equipment and software, and to collaborate with very large teams. Astronomy today is entering the age of big data just like particle physics did 20 or 30 years ago. \"We also have a Data Science Fellowship Program,\" adds Juric, \"a cooperative effort a few of us initiated in 2015 to educate the next generation of astronomer data scientists through a two-year series of workshops.\" The program is funded by the LSST Corporation, a non-profit organization dedicated to enabling science with the telescope, and student interest has been intense. Only about a dozen people were admitted from among 200 applicants in a recent selection cycle. Telescope data are being packaged for a wide audience, too. The LSST Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program is working to involve classrooms, citizen scientists and the general public as deeply in big data astronomy as they want (or dare) to go. Primary EPO goals are to help educators integrate real LSST data into classrooms and introductory astronomy courses, and to help non-specialists access LSST data in ways similar to those of professional astronomers. Working through platforms like Zooniverse, almost anyone will be able to conduct serious research projects. \"Citizen volunteers should be thought of as members of the science collaboration,\" says Amanda Bauer, Head of LSST EPO. The future IS the data: The LSST will cement an age where software is as critical to astronomy as the telescope. \"When I was in graduate school,\" says Juric, \"I worked on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and I didn't touch a telescope; I did all my research out of a database. I know many students who have done the same. So we're already seeing that kind of migration.\" O'Mullane would agree. \"Large surveys like SDSS, Gaia and now LSST provide enough data for a different approach,\" he says. \"Astronomers are not always reaching for a telescope. In fact, missions like LSST basically only offer you the archive; you can't even request the observatory to make a specific observation.\"", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2017/12/the-lsst-and-big-data-science"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Teledyne e2v sensors to equip LSST telescope", "date": "2017-10-18", "content": "SLAC is building this immense camera, which will record images covering an area 49 times that of a full moon.

The work will be performed by Miner\u00eda y Montajes Conpax (known as Conpax), a construction services company that has previously performed site work for other observatories in Chile. Using a combination of hydraulic drilling and hammering, the excavation work is expected to take about five months to complete. Excavation is a key step towards the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope, which is expected to see first light as early as 2024. The 25-meter diameter Giant Magellan Telescope, expected to have a final weight of about 1,600 metric tons, will comprise seven 8.4-meter mirrors supported by a steel telescope structure that will be seated on the concrete pier. It will be housed inside a rotating enclosure that will measure 65 meters (~22 stories) tall and 56 meters wide. As well as working on the enclosure and telescope pier foundations, Conpax will excavate a recess in the summit rock for the lower portion of the mirror coating chamber and foundations for a utility building and tunnel on the summit. GMTO Project Manager, Dr. James Fanson, said, \"With the start of construction of the permanent buildings on the site, the GMT is showing tangible progress towards completion. We are delighted that Conpax is carrying out this important work.\" The most challenging part of their work on the summit will be to excavate the solid rock of the mountain top to a depth of 7 meters (23 feet) to hold the concrete for the telescope pier. Much of this work will be done with a hydraulic rock hammer and jack hammer to ensure that the integrity of the solid bedrock below the pier is undamaged. Dr. Fanson said, \"In total, we expect to remove 5,000 cubic meters or 13,300 tons of rock from the mountain and will need 330 dump truck loads to remove it from the summit.\" Las Campanas Observatory, located in the southern Atacama Desert of Chile and owned by the Carnegie Institution for Science, is one of the world's premier astronomical sites, known for its clear, dark skies and stable airflow, producing exceptionally sharp images. With its unique design, the Giant Magellan Telescope will produce images that are 10 times sharper than those from the Hubble Space Telescope in the infrared region of the spectrum and will be used by astronomers to study planets around other stars and to look back to the time when the first galaxies formed.

When it's ready, LSST will image almost all of the sky visible from its vantage point on a Chilean mountain, Cerro Pach\u00f3n, every few nights for a decade to make an astronomical movie of unprecedented proportions. The camera is a combination of many extremes. Its largest lens is one of the biggest ever created for astronomy and astrophysics. The ceramic grid that will hold its imaging sensors is so flat that no feature larger than a human red blood cell sticks up from its surface. The electronics that control the sensors are customized to fit in a very tight space and use as little power as possible. All of these specifications are vital for letting LSST achieve its scientific goals. And not many of them are easy to achieve. The LSST camera will do what no camera has been capable of doing before, and building it requires solving technical problems that have never been solved before. A game of 'Operation': \"When you consider a project this complex, you can't just dive in and say 'Here, I'm going to design and build this in one shot,' right?\" says Tim Bond, head of the LSST Camera Integration and Test team at SLAC. \"You have to divide and conquer. So you break it up into smaller pieces that individual groups can work on.\" One of those pieces is figuring out how to get the camera's sensors into place. The 3.2-billion-pixel LSST camera will be the largest digital camera ever constructed. Much like handheld digital cameras, the LSST camera will be made up of imaging sensors called charge-coupled devices-189 of them. These sensors and their bundles of electronics are arranged into 21 nine-sensor pallets called \"rafts.\" Each one weighs more than 20 pounds and stands almost 2 feet tall. Each sensor is fragile enough to chip if it even touches one of the other rafts. And, to minimize gaps in the sensors' images, all of the rafts must be installed two hundredths of an inch apart inside the camera's ceramic grid. The LSST engineers couldn't possibly install the delicate rafts by hand without destroying them, so they took on the challenge of creating a device that could do this very specific task in their place. They concocted one concept after another. Travis Lange, a SLAC mechanical engineer, created computer models of each to find a design that could both do the job and be built with the level of machining precision available. \"One of the bigger challenges for this is just the tolerance of all the individual pieces and how it corresponds to how much motion I am allowed to use,\" Lange says. If a part is the wrong size by even just the width of a human hair, it's a problem. \"If you have many of those parts that are off by that much, those errors all stack up.\" One of the designs that the team drew up resembled a claw-machine game. The device would sit on a structure above the cryostat, the apparatus that keeps the camera cold. With a long arm, it would reach through to a raft waiting for installation below. Over the course of several hours, it would pull the raft up through a very precisely sized slot and into place in the grid. Four specialized cameras pointing at the edges of the imaging sensors would help steer the raft into place without hitting neighboring sensors, and unique imaging software would measure the gaps between rafts in real time. \"It's a crazy game of 'Operation,'\" Lange says. The team went with the claw-machine plan. In May 2018, they put it to the test with its first practice raft and a mock-up of the camera. After most of a day had passed, the raft was successfully in place. The installation robot has since gone through several other successful test runs. Now that they've figured out the kinks in the process, installing each raft takes about two hours. Engineers plan to start the real installation process this summer. Not your everyday refrigerator: The electronics and sensors crammed together inside the camera heat up as electricity runs through them. But heat is the enemy of astronomical observation. A warm sensor will sabotage its own observations by behaving as if it senses light where there is none. And as anyone who has ever heard their laptop fan working overtime before the computer crashed may know, heat can also cause electronics to stop working. To keep the camera cold enough, the engineers needed to create a customized refrigeration system. They eventually made a system of eight refrigeration circuits-two for the electronics and six for the sensors. Each of these systems works similarly to a kitchen refrigerator, in which a fluid refrigerant carries heat away from the object or area it's supposed to cool. Networks of tubes carry the refrigerant into and out of the camera. At first, the team used only metal tubes for this job. Metal is good at keeping moisture out, which is important because any water that gets into the tubes from the surrounding air would freeze and clog the system. At parts of the system where the camera would need to move around with the telescope as it points to different parts of the sky, the tubes were corrugated to make them into flexible metal hoses. But there was a problem. The refrigeration system's compressor, a device that forces the refrigerant to dump its absorbed heat outside the camera, uses lubricating oil to work smoothly. As the refrigeration system ran, some of the oil would leave the compressor and travel through the tubes. This wouldn't have been a problem if the oil had traveled at a consistent pace all the way through the circuit, back to the compressor. But that wasn't happening; the oil was getting slowed down and sometimes trapped by the grooves in the corrugated metal hoses. The compressor was getting oil back in trickles or spurts rather than in a steady stream. This made the refrigeration system unpredictable and harder to maintain. So the team switched to a different kind of hose for the refrigeration system's \"joints,\" says Diane Hascall, a SLAC mechanical engineer on the LSST camera team. \"You can almost think of it like a garden hose. But it's a very special garden hose that's made to work with refrigerants.\" The new hoses, called smooth-bore hoses, are made of layers of rubber, braid and other flexible materials, and they are smooth on the inside. The smooth hose lets oil return to the compressor more effectively, Hascall says. But there was a trade-off. Unlike the metal hoses, the smooth-bore hoses do let some moisture in. To deal with that, the team installed filter dryers that absorb moisture from the system. They are still figuring out how often the dryers need to be replaced to keep the camera in good shape. Building next-gen technology: Building each component of a piece of technology as sophisticated as LSST is a challenge in itself, but the challenges don't end there. Engineers must also design specialized equipment, software and procedures to test different pieces; put the pieces together; and determine what maintenance the technology will need to run smoothly. \"There's a huge number of subsystems,\" Bond says. \"All of those subsystems have to present their products. And all those products have to be assembled and tested and work in the final finished full product.\" Bond says working on the project has been a great boon to the engineering team. He says figuring out all of the unexpected challenges that have come with making such an advanced piece of technology has been a great experience, and he looks forward to seeing what future projects the team will tackle together. \"It's like picking a bunch of players to set up a hockey team or something,\" Bond says. \"We've actually put together a very good team, and we're just getting some of our younger people up to speed and trained for the next generation of experiments and projects that will come along.\" ", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/engineering-the-worlds-largest-digital-camera"}, {"title": "A miniature camera for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope", "date": "2019-06-19", "content": "Scientists at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are building the world's largest digital camera for astronomy and astrophysics. The minivan-sized 3200-megapixel 'eye' of the future Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will enable unprecedented views of the universe starting in the fall of 2022 and provide new insights into dark energy and other cosmic mysteries. In the meantime, the lab has completed its work on a miniature version that will soon be used for testing the telescope and taking LSST's first images of the night sky. These images will include glimpses of the motions of asteroids and objects in our solar system with orbits beyond that of Neptune, as well as alerts of sudden events such as supernovae, exploding stars that temporarily light up parts of the sky. The device, called ComCam (short for Commissioning Camera), will use only 4% of the full LSST camera's focal plane and produce much smaller images, but it will provide enough \"imaging power\" to test the observatory while its ultimate camera is still under construction. In fact, ComCam's 144 megapixels outnumber the pixel count that was available to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a pioneering astrophysical survey project in the early 2000s. \"ComCam will give us a great head start in checking all of the interfaces between the camera, telescope, site infrastructure and data management,\" says Kevin Reil, LSST commissioning scientist and SLAC staff scientist. After completing the integration of imaging sensors into ComCam and other tasks, the SLAC team today shipped the device to LSST headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. There, more components will be added before the finished ComCam is sent to its final destination in Chile later this year. A miniature LSST camera The extraordinarily high image quality of the full LSST camera will be largely due to its 189 state-of-the-art imaging sensors. Arranged into square arrays, called rafts, of nine sensors each, they'll make up the camera's focal plane. ComCam has only a single raft, which was provided by Brookhaven National Laboratory and recently inserted into the ComCam cryostat at SLAC. The cryostat, specially designed and built for ComCam, holds the raft in place and cools its imaging sensors to very low temperatures to eliminate unwanted background signals and improve image quality. The ComCam cryostat uses a different refrigeration system from that of the final LSST camera, which requires a more complex system in order to handle 21 rafts. The raft also contains electronics boards that will digitize data taken with ComCam. These data will be sent to data management systems at the National Science Foundation-supported National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and centers at France's National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics and in Chile, where they will be analyzed by scientists around the world. SLAC is also building and testing the camera control system, which will allow the observatory software to send commands to ComCam, for instance, to change filters and take images. The LSST camera will use the same control system. Toward first images: Once ComCam arrives in Tucson, LSST scientists will add lenses, a filter changer and a shutter. They will integrate the complete instrument with the observatory software and computing infrastructure and perform crucial tests, including a dry run that will simulate a night of observations. \"In large projects like LSST, it's exciting to watch the hardware and software come together into a working system over the years,\" says Brian Stalder, LSST commissioning scientist in Tucson. Finally, ComCam will be sent to Chile and installed on the actual telescope, paving the way for LSST commissioning. In addition, it'll produce LSST's first images, albeit at a much smaller scale than the final camera. Although science studies won't be ComCam's primary purpose, the team expects the camera to produce images of very good quality, Reil says. \"It'll be exciting to see these early images taken with our brand new, world- class telescope.\" Editor's note: This article is adapted from an article originally published by SLAC.

A game of 'Operation': \"When you consider a project this complex, you can't just dive in and say 'Here, I'm going to design and build this in one shot,' right?\" says Tim Bond, head of the LSST Camera Integration and Test team at SLAC. \"You have to divide and conquer. So you break it up into smaller pieces that individual groups can work on.\" One of those pieces is figuring out how to get the camera's sensors into place. The 3.2-billion-pixel LSST camera will be the largest digital camera ever constructed. Much like handheld digital cameras, the LSST camera will be made up of imaging sensors called charge-coupled devices-189 of them. These sensors and their bundles of electronics are arranged into 21 nine-sensor pallets called \"rafts.\" Each one weighs more than 20 pounds and stands almost 2 feet tall. Each sensor is fragile enough to chip if it even touches one of the other rafts. And, to minimize gaps in the sensors' images, all of the rafts must be installed two hundredths of an inch apart inside the camera's ceramic grid. The LSST engineers couldn't possibly install the delicate rafts by hand without destroying them, so they took on the challenge of creating a device that could do this very specific task in their place. They concocted one concept after another. Travis Lange, a SLAC mechanical engineer, created computer models of each to find a design that could both do the job and be built with the level of machining precision available. \"One of the bigger challenges for this is just the tolerance of all the individual pieces and how it corresponds to how much motion I am allowed to use,\" Lange says. If a part is the wrong size by even just the width of a human hair, it's a problem. \"If you have many of those parts that are off by that much, those errors all stack up.\" One of the designs that the team drew up resembled a claw-machine game. The device would sit on a structure above the cryostat, the apparatus that keeps the camera cold. With a long arm, it would reach through to a raft waiting for installation below. Over the course of several hours, it would pull the raft up through a very precisely sized slot and into place in the grid. Four specialized cameras pointing at the edges of the imaging sensors would help steer the raft into place without hitting neighboring sensors, and unique imaging software would measure the gaps between rafts in real time. \"It's a crazy game of 'Operation,'\" Lange says. The team went with the claw-machine plan. In May 2018, they put it to the test with its first practice raft and a mock-up of the camera. After most of a day had passed, the raft was successfully in place. The installation robot has since gone through several other successful test runs. Now that they've figured out the kinks in the process, installing each raft takes about two hours. Engineers plan to start the real installation process this summer. Not your everyday refrigerator: The electronics and sensors crammed together inside the camera heat up as electricity runs through them. But heat is the enemy of astronomical observation. A warm sensor will sabotage its own observations by behaving as if it senses light where there is none. And as anyone who has ever heard their laptop fan working overtime before the computer crashed may know, heat can also cause electronics to stop working. To keep the camera cold enough, the engineers needed to create a customized refrigeration system. They eventually made a system of eight refrigeration circuits-two for the electronics and six for the sensors. Each of these systems works similarly to a kitchen refrigerator, in which a fluid refrigerant carries heat away from the object or area it's supposed to cool. Networks of tubes carry the refrigerant into and out of the camera. At first, the team used only metal tubes for this job. Metal is good at keeping moisture out, which is important because any water that gets into the tubes from the surrounding air would freeze and clog the system. At parts of the system where the camera would need to move around with the telescope as it points to different parts of the sky, the tubes were corrugated to make them into flexible metal hoses. But there was a problem. The refrigeration system's compressor, a device that forces the refrigerant to dump its absorbed heat outside the camera, uses lubricating oil to work smoothly. As the refrigeration system ran, some of the oil would leave the compressor and travel through the tubes. This wouldn't have been a problem if the oil had traveled at a consistent pace all the way through the circuit, back to the compressor. But that wasn't happening; the oil was getting slowed down and sometimes trapped by the grooves in the corrugated metal hoses. The compressor was getting oil back in trickles or spurts rather than in a steady stream. This made the refrigeration system unpredictable and harder to maintain. So the team switched to a different kind of hose for the refrigeration system's \"joints,\" says Diane Hascall, a SLAC mechanical engineer on the LSST camera team. \"You can almost think of it like a garden hose. But it's a very special garden hose that's made to work with refrigerants.\" The new hoses, called smooth-bore hoses, are made of layers of rubber, braid and other flexible materials, and they are smooth on the inside. The smooth hose lets oil return to the compressor more effectively, Hascall says. But there was a trade-off. Unlike the metal hoses, the smooth-bore hoses do let some moisture in. To deal with that, the team installed filter dryers that absorb moisture from the system. They are still figuring out how often the dryers need to be replaced to keep the camera in good shape. Building next-gen technology: Building each component of a piece of technology as sophisticated as LSST is a challenge in itself, but the challenges don't end there. Engineers must also design specialized equipment, software and procedures to test different pieces; put the pieces together; and determine what maintenance the technology will need to run smoothly. \"There's a huge number of subsystems,\" Bond says. \"All of those subsystems have to present their products. And all those products have to be assembled and tested and work in the final finished full product.\" Bond says working on the project has been a great boon to the engineering team. He says figuring out all of the unexpected challenges that have come with making such an advanced piece of technology has been a great experience, and he looks forward to seeing what future projects the team will tackle together. \"It's like picking a bunch of players to set up a hockey team or something,\" Bond says. \"We've actually put together a very good team, and we're just getting some of our younger people up to speed and trained for the next generation of experiments and projects that will come along.\" ", "url": "https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/engineering-the-worlds-largest-digital-camera"}, {"title": "A miniature camera for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope", "date": "2019-06-19", "content": "Scientists at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are building the world's largest digital camera for astronomy and astrophysics. The minivan-sized 3200-megapixel 'eye' of the future Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will enable unprecedented views of the universe starting in the fall of 2022 and provide new insights into dark energy and other cosmic mysteries. In the meantime, the lab has completed its work on a miniature version that will soon be used for testing the telescope and taking LSST's first images of the night sky. These images will include glimpses of the motions of asteroids and objects in our solar system with orbits beyond that of Neptune, as well as alerts of sudden events such as supernovae, exploding stars that temporarily light up parts of the sky. The device, called ComCam (short for Commissioning Camera), will use only 4% of the full LSST camera's focal plane and produce much smaller images, but it will provide enough \"imaging power\" to test the observatory while its ultimate camera is still under construction. In fact, ComCam's 144 megapixels outnumber the pixel count that was available to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a pioneering astrophysical survey project in the early 2000s. \"ComCam will give us a great head start in checking all of the interfaces between the camera, telescope, site infrastructure and data management,\" says Kevin Reil, LSST commissioning scientist and SLAC staff scientist. After completing the integration of imaging sensors into ComCam and other tasks, the SLAC team today shipped the device to LSST headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. There, more components will be added before the finished ComCam is sent to its final destination in Chile later this year. A miniature LSST camera The extraordinarily high image quality of the full LSST camera will be largely due to its 189 state-of-the-art imaging sensors. Arranged into square arrays, called rafts, of nine sensors each, they'll make up the camera's focal plane. ComCam has only a single raft, which was provided by Brookhaven National Laboratory and recently inserted into the ComCam cryostat at SLAC. The cryostat, specially designed and built for ComCam, holds the raft in place and cools its imaging sensors to very low temperatures to eliminate unwanted background signals and improve image quality. The ComCam cryostat uses a different refrigeration system from that of the final LSST camera, which requires a more complex system in order to handle 21 rafts. The raft also contains electronics boards that will digitize data taken with ComCam. These data will be sent to data management systems at the National Science Foundation-supported National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and centers at France's National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics and in Chile, where they will be analyzed by scientists around the world. SLAC is also building and testing the camera control system, which will allow the observatory software to send commands to ComCam, for instance, to change filters and take images. The LSST camera will use the same control system. Toward first images: Once ComCam arrives in Tucson, LSST scientists will add lenses, a filter changer and a shutter. They will integrate the complete instrument with the observatory software and computing infrastructure and perform crucial tests, including a dry run that will simulate a night of observations. \"In large projects like LSST, it's exciting to watch the hardware and software come together into a working system over the years,\" says Brian Stalder, LSST commissioning scientist in Tucson. Finally, ComCam will be sent to Chile and installed on the actual telescope, paving the way for LSST commissioning. In addition, it'll produce LSST's first images, albeit at a much smaller scale than the final camera. Although science studies won't be ComCam's primary purpose, the team expects the camera to produce images of very good quality, Reil says. \"It'll be exciting to see these early images taken with our brand new, world- class telescope.\" Editor's note: This article is adapted from an article originally published by SLAC.

It's also the \"largest CCD charge coupled device mosaic in the world,\" according to the contractor that worked on it.

To achieve that feat, it will use three mirrors, with the primary at 8.4 meters in diameter, the secondary at 3.4 meters and the tertiary at 5 meters. The challenge is to get rid of any aberrations, which is where the lens above comes into play. SLAC said that the 1.55-meter L1 lens shown above is the \"largest high-performance optical lens ever fabricated.\" It was designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, based on work spanning nearly two decades, and fabricated using very advanced optic systems.

The camera itself is the size of a small car and weighs more than three tons. Each massive image it produces will be a gold mine for scientists, and it's expected that the LSST will detect about 20 billion galaxies during a 10-year time frame, while also creating time-lapse movies that could reveal changes in galaxies and stars.

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will sit on top of a mountain in Chile some 8,800 feet up and snap 3.2-gigapixel images of the sky every 20 seconds. All told, it will be able to snap digital images of the entire southern sky every few nights. By taking relatively long 15-second exposures, scientists will be able to study the early universe, track dimly-lit asteroids and better understand dark energy. The LSST cameras has 32 times the resolution of the best consumers shooters out there in order to image the maximum amount of sky possible. It's also the \"largest CCD charge coupled device mosaic in the world,\" according to the contractor that worked on it. To focus all that light, the telescope has a very wide 3.5-degree diameter field of view and extremely fast aperture, giving it an immense 319 meters-squared, degrees-squared \"entundue\" -- three times more than the best current telescopes. To achieve that feat, it will use three mirrors, with the primary at 8.4 meters in diameter, the secondary at 3.4 meters and the tertiary at 5 meters. The challenge is to get rid of any aberrations, which is where the lens above comes into play. SLAC said that the 1.55-meter L1 lens shown above is the \"largest high-performance optical lens ever fabricated.\" It was designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, based on work spanning nearly two decades, and fabricated using very advanced optic systems. It was built, along with the 1.2-diameter L2 companion lens, by Ball Aerospace and subcontractor Arizona Optical Systems in a process that took five years. \"The success of the fabrication of this unique optical assembly is a testament to LLNL's world-leading expertise in large optics, built on decades of experience in the construction of the world's largest and most powerful laser systems,\" said physicist Scot Olivier. The camera itself is the size of a small car and weighs more than three tons. Each massive image it produces will be a gold mine for scientists, and it's expected that the LSST will detect about 20 billion galaxies during a 10-year time frame, while also creating time-lapse movies that could reveal changes in galaxies and stars. The images won't just benefit scientists. \"Anyone with a computer will be able to fly through the universe, past objects 100 million times fainter than can be observed with the unaided eye.\" SLAC and LSST hope it will become a platform for crowd-sourced astronomical discoveries. The LSST is scheduled to start imaging the southern sky by 2023. Suffice to say, this is one valuable piece of glass, so moving it from Tucson, Arizona to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park was a bit of an event, according to SLAC's Flickr site.

The LSST collaboration announced the new name at the 235th American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu on Monday evening, in conjunction with US funding agencies the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. Scheduled to begin operation in late 2022, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will undertake a decade-long survey of the sky using an 8.4-meter telescope and a 3200-megapixel camera to study, among other things, the invisible material Rubin is best known for bringing into the realm of accepted theory. Rubin was a role model, a mentor, and a boundary-breaker fueled by a true love of science and the stars. \"For me, doing astronomy is incredibly great fun,\" she said in a 1989 interview with physicist and writer Alan Lightman. \"It's just an incredible joy to get up every morning and come to work and, in some much larger framework, not even really quite know what it is I'm going to be doing.\" Between the Lightman interview and \"An Interesting Voyage,\" a biography she wrote in 2010 for the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, among other things, she left behind a detailed record of the story of her life. A curious child: Rubin's father, Pesach Kobchefski, was born in Lithuania. Her mother, Rose Applebaum, was a second-generation American born to Bessarabian parents in Philadelphia. Rubin's parents met at work at the Bell Telephone Company. They married and raised two children, Vera and her older sister, Ruth. Rubin was born in 1928. She wrote that she remembered growing up \"amid a cheery scatter of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins... largely shielded from the financial difficulties\" of the Great Depression. Ruth and Vera shared a room, with Vera's bed against a window with a clear view of the north sky. \"Soon it was more interesting to watch the stars than to sleep,\" Rubin wrote. Her parents encouraged her curiosity. Her mother gave her written permission at an early age to check out books from the \"12 and over\" section of the library, and her father helped her build a homemade telescope. \"My parents were very, very supportive,\" Rubin said in the interview with Lightman, \"except that they didn't like me to stay up all night.\" Rubin's teachers were not universally as encouraging. Her high school physics teacher, she wrote, \"did not know how to include the few young girls in the class, so he chose to ignore us.\" Still, Rubin knew she wanted to go into astronomy. \"I didn't know a single astronomer,\" she said, \"but I just knew that was what I wanted to do.\" She did know about at least one female astronomer: Maria Mitchell, the first female professional astronomer in the United States. From 1865 to 1888, Mitchell taught at Vassar College in New York and served as director of Vassar College Observatory. Looking to follow in her footsteps, Rubin applied to Vassar. She was accepted with a necessary scholarship. Rubin said that when she told the high school physics teacher about it, he replied, \"'As long as you stay away from science, you should be okay.'\" She graduated in three years as the only astronomy major in her class. A family effort: Rubin spent summers in Washington, DC, working at the Naval Research Laboratory. The summer of 1947, her parents introduced her to Robert Rubin. He was training to be an officer in the US Navy and studying chemistry at Cornell University. The two married in 1948. She was 19 and he was 21. Vera had been accepted to Harvard University, which was well known for its astronomy department, but she decided to join her husband at Cornell instead. Rubin completed her master's thesis just before giving birth to her first child, and she gave a talk on her research at the 1950 meeting of the American Astronomical Society just after. Her adviser had said it made more sense for him to give the talk, as he was already a member of AAS and she would be a new mother, but Rubin insisted she would do it. \"We had no car,\" Rubin wrote. \"My parents drove from Washington, DC, to Ithaca, then crossed the snowy New York hills with Bob, me and their first grandchild, 'thereby aging 20 years,' my father later insisted.\" She gave a 10-minute talk on her study of the velocity distribution of the galaxies that at that time had published velocities. It solicited replies from several \"angry-sounding men,\" along with pioneering astronomer Martin Schwarzschild, who, Rubin wrote, kindly \"said what you say to a young student: 'This is very interesting, and when there are more data, we will know more.'\" For a few months after the experience, Rubin stayed home with her newborn son. But she couldn't keep away from the science. \"I would push David to the playground, sit him in the sandbox, and read the Astrophysical Journal ,\" Rubin wrote. With her husband's encouragement, she enrolled in the astronomy PhD program at Georgetown University. Her classes took place at night, twice per week. Those nights, between 1952 and 1954, Rubin's mother babysat David while Bob drove her to the observatory and waited to take her back home, eating his dinner in the car. In astronomy, \"women generally required more luck and perseverance than men did,\" Rubin wrote. \"It helped to have supportive parents and a supportive husband.\" PhD and beyond: Theoretical physicist and cosmologist George Gamow-known for his contributions to developing the Big Bang theory, among other foundational work-heard about Rubin's AAS talk and began asking her questions, Rubin wrote. One question-\"Is there a scale length in the distribution of galaxies?\"-so intrigued her that she decided to take it on for her thesis. Gamow served as her advisor. Rubin wrote that when she sent her research to the Astrophysical Journal in 1954, then-editor and later Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar rejected it, saying he wanted her to wait until his student finished his work on the same subject. She did not wait, publishing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences instead. In 1955, Georgetown offered Rubin a research position, which soon became a teaching position as well. She stayed there for 10 years. In 1962, Rubin taught a graduate course in statistical astronomy with six students, five who worked for the US Naval Observatory and one who worked for NASA. \"Due to their jobs, the students were experts in star catalogs,\" Rubin wrote, \"so I gave the students a research problem: Can we use cataloged stars to determine a rotation curve for stars distant from the center of our g alaxy?\" The group completed the paper, \"some of it finished by seven of us working around my large kitchen table, long into the night,\" Rubin wrote, and they submitted it to the Astrophysical Journal. The editor called to say he would accept the paper but that he would not take the then-unusual step of publishing the names of the students, Rubin wrote. When Rubin replied that she would then withdraw the paper, however, he changed his mind. Rubin wrote that she received many negative \"and some very unpleasant\" responses to the paper, but that it continued to be referenced every few years, even as she was writing in 2010. As she pointed out in her article, \" t his was my first flat rotation curve\"-a result she would see repeated in what would become her most famous publication. During the 1963-1964 school year, Bob took a sabbatical so Vera could move the family to San Diego and work with married couple Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge. With two other scientists, they had in 1957 published the seminal paper explaining how thermonuclear reactions in stars could transform a universe originally made up only of hydrogen, helium and lithium into one that could support life. With the Burbidges, Rubin traveled to both Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and McDonald Observatory in Texas. More than three decades later, in letter to Margaret Burbidge on her 80th birthday, Rubin described what the scientist had meant to her: \"Did the words 'role model' and 'mentor' exist then? I think they did not. But for most of the women that followed you into astronomical careers, these were the roles you filled for us.\" What Rubin best remembers from when she first arrived in San Diego, she wrote, \"was my elation because you took me seriously and were interested in what I had to say... \"From you we have learned that a woman too can rise to great heights as an astronomer, and that it's all right to be charming, gracious, brilliant, and to be concerned for others as we make our way in the world of science.\" The view from Palomar: In 1964, Rubin and her family returned home. Shortly thereafter, Vera and Bob took off again for the meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Hamburg. On the last evening of the conference, influential astronomer Allan Sandage, who in 1958 had published the first good estimate of the Hubble constant, asked Rubin if she were interested in observing on Palomar Mountain at the Carnegie Institution's 200-inch telescope. It was a telescope, located on a mountain northeast of San Diego, that women had officially been prohibited from using. \"Of course, I said yes,\" Rubin wrote. Rubin would be observing on the same mountain where, in 1933, astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a startling discovery. He noticed that the galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving too quickly-so quickly that they should have broken apart. Judging by the mass of their visible matter, they should not have had the gravitational pull to hold together. He concluded that the cluster must be more massive than it appeared, and that most of this mass must come from matter that could not be seen. The Swiss astronomer called the source of the missing mass dunkle Materie, or dark matter. He presented this idea to the Swiss Physical Society, but it did not catch on. On Rubin's first night at Palomar in December 1965, clouds prevented anyone from observing, so another observer took her on an unofficial tour of the facilities. The tour included the single available toilet, labeled \"MEN.\" On Rubin's next visit, \"I drew a skirted woman and pasted her up on the door,\" she wrote. The third time she came to observe, heating had been added to the observing room, along with a gender-neutral bathroom. The world's best spectrograph: In 1965, Rubin decided to prioritize observing over teaching. She asked her colleague Bernie Burke-famous for co-discovering the first detection of radio noise from another planet, Jupiter-for a job at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Burke invited her to the DTM's community lunch. And that's where she met astronomer Kent Ford. Working over the previous decade, Ford had pioneered the use of highly sensitive light detectors called photomultiplier tubes for astronomical observation. \"Kent Ford had built a very exceptional spectrograph,\" Rubin said. \"He probably had the best spectrograph anywhere. He had a spectrograph that could do things that no other spectrographs could do.\" Rubin got the job at DTM, becoming the first female scientist on its staff. Using Ford's spectrograph on the telescope at Lowell Observatory in Arizona, Ford and Rubin could observe objects that were not otherwise detectable. Among the astronomers who noticed was Jim Peebles, winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics. By 1968, Rubin and Ford had published nine papers. \"It was an exciting time,\" Rubin wrote, \"but I was not comfortable with the very rapid pace of the competition. Even very polite phone calls asking me which galaxies I was studying made me uncomfortable.\" So she decided to go back to a subject she had previously dabbled in: the velocity of stars and regions of ionized hydrogen in M31, the Andromeda galaxy. \"I decided to pick a problem that I could go observing and make headway on, hopefully a problem that people would be interested in, but not so interested in that anyone would bother me before I was done,\" Rubin said. Astronomers had been studying the spectra of light from Andromeda since at least January 1899, but no one had taken a look with an instrument as advanced as Ford's. One astronomer had gotten a better look than most, though. In the 1940s, astronomer Walter Baade had taken advantage of wartime blackout rules-meant to make it difficult for enemy planes to hit targets during World War II-to observe Andromeda from Mount Wilson Observatory northeast of Los Angeles. He resolved the stars at the center of the galaxy for the first time and identified 688 emission regions worthy of study. Not knowing this, Rubin and Ford set out to do the same for themselves. They spent a frustrating night taking turns at the US Naval Observatory telescope in Arizona, huddled next to a small heater in negative 20 degree cold, before deciding they needed a new tactic. On their way out in the morning, they ran into Naval Observatory Director Gerald Kron. \"He took us into his warm office, opened a large cabinet and showed us copies of Baade's many plates of stars in M31!\" Rubin wrote. Rubin and Ford obtained copies of the images from the Carnegie Institute and went to work. A rotation curveball: Rubin and Ford made their observations at Lowell Observatory and Kitt Peak. \"On a typical clear night we would obtain four to five spectra,\" Rubin wrote. \"The surprises came very quickly.\" In our solar system, planets closest to the center are the fastest-moving, as they are most affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. Mercury, the closest, moves about 1.6 times as rapidly as Earth, whereas Neptune, the farthest, moves at less than 0.2 times Earth's speed. \"The expectation was that galaxies behaved the same way, in that stars farthest from the massive center would be moving most slowly,\" Rubin wrote. But that's not what they found. The rotation curves were flat, meaning that objects closer to the center of Andromeda were moving at the same speed as objects closer to the outskirts. \"This was discovered over the course of about 4 ice cream cones that first night,\" Rubin wrote, \"as I alternated between developing the plates and eating .\" This time, Rubin said, people believed the data. \"It just piled up too fast. Soon there were 20, then 40, then 60 rotation curves, and they were all flat... And it was just a joy to have that kind of a program, after a program where you had to go through deep analysis and everybody doubted the answer.\" But what did the flat rotation curves mean? The popularly accepted answer is that the way the galaxies in Andromeda move is influenced by dark matter. If a galaxy is formed in the center of a disk of invisible dark matter, the gravitational pull of the dark matter will affect how quickly each of its parts moves, flattening the rotation curves. Theorists Peebles, Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Amos Yahil and others had predicted the existence of dark matter independent of Rubin and Ford's findings, Rubin said. \"The ideas had been around for a while... But the observations fit in so well, since there was already a framework, so some people embraced the observations very enthusiastically.\" Rubin was agnostic about the idea of dark matter and wrote that she would be delighted if the explanation actually came in the form of a new understanding of how gravity works on the cosmic scale. \"One needs to keep an open mind in seeking solutions,\" she wrote. A scientific legacy: Rubin continued her work, receiving recognition for her contributions in various ways. From 1972 to 1977 she served as associate editor of the Astronomical Journal, and from 1977 to 1982 she served as associate editor of A strophysical Journal Letters. In 1993, she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton. In 1994 she received the Dickson Prize in Science from Carnegie-Mellon University and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship from the American Astronomical Society. In 1996 she became the second woman to receive the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London. In 1996 President Clinton nominated her to provide input to Congress as a member of the National Science Board for a term of six years. In 1997 she and a few other members of the board were invited to visit the McMurdo research station at the South Pole. Rubin wrote that she was asked if she would spend her time at McMurdo with the astronomers. \"With a little embarrassment, I asked if that meant that I would miss everything else, the penguins, the mountains and all the other events,\" she wrote. \"Without much difficulty, I voted for the penguins.\" In 2004 the National Academy of Sciences awarded Rubin the James Craig Watson Medal for \"her seminal observations of dark matter in galaxies... and for generous mentoring of young astronomers, men and women.\" Rubin made it a priority to listen to and encourage students and up-and-coming astronomers, and she was especially interested in improving the chances for women in science. Asked by Lightman, \"Do you think that your experience in science has been different because you are a woman rather than a man?\" she replied, \"Of course. Yes, of course. But I'm the wrong person to ask that question. The tragedy in that question is all the women who would have liked to have become astronomers and didn't.\" Rubin shared her love of astronomy far and wide. \"We are fortunate to live in an era when it is possible to learn so much about the u niverse,\" she wrote. \"But I envy our children, our grandchildren, and their children. They will know more than any of us do now, and they may even be able to travel there!\" All four of the Rubin children have gone into science. Her son Allan, quoted in the 2010 article, remembered his parents often spent evenings \"with their work spread out along the very long dining room table, which wasn't used for eating unless a lot of company was expected,\" he said. \"At some point I grew old enough to realize that if what they really wanted to do after dinner was the same thing they did all day at work, then they must have pretty good jobs.\" Rubin's daughter followed Vera into the field of astronomy, initially hooked by a lesson her mother taught on black holes. Over several decades, Judy collaborated on numerous publications and attended meetings around the world with her mom. Rubin died in 2016 at the age of 88. Her name lives on in the AAS Vera Rubin Early Career Prize, Vera Rubin Ridge on the planet Mars, Asteroid 5726 Rubin and, now, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n.

Announced at the 2020 American Astronomical Society winter meeting, the name recognizes the role Rubin played in better understanding dark matter, which will be one of the observatory survey's four main themes. \"Named after an astronomer who provided important evidence of the existence of dark matter, the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory seems destined to make science history with its extraordinary capabilities that will come to bear in the next few years,\" said France C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation director. \"Congress has helped make this inspiring commemoration a reality. The Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly advance what we know about dark matter and dark energy, so the Rubin name will have yet another way to inspire women and men eager to investigate.\" The initiative to rename the observatory was started in June 2019 by House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and was enacted into law on Dec. 20, 2019. Science operations at the Rubin Observatory, located on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile, will start in 2022. The observatory consists of an integrated system featuring a wide field ground-based telescope with an 8.4-meter mirror, a 3,200-megapixel camera built by the Department of Energy, an automated data processing system, and an online public engagement platform. The construction and operations of the Rubin Observatory and its DOE LSST Camera is a U.S. federal partnership of NSF and DOE, with private and international contributors. \"It is fitting for this major new observatory, which includes the study of dark matter and dark energy as one of the major research topics, to be named for a pioneering astronomer whose observations were so critical to our understanding of this area,\" said Paul Dabbar, DOE undersecretary for science. Dr. Rubin's life and singular achievements as a scientist remain a model for all those seeking to satisfy humanity's unceasing curiosity about our universe.\" During its first 10 years, this system will deliver an unprecedented optical survey of the visible sky - to be named the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The survey's design is driven by four themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. Rubin Observatory Director Steve Kahn said, \"We are deeply honored to have our observatory named after Vera Rubin. Through her discovery of flat rotation curves in galaxies, which provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, Vera made one of the most important contributions to science in the past century, not only for astronomy, but also for fundamental physics. When construction is completed in 2022, the Rubin Observatory and the LSST Camera will help build on her pioneering work to dramatically improve our understanding of the Universe on many different scales.\" Vera Rubin's work spanned several areas in observational astronomy, but she is most recognized for uncovering the discrepancy between the observed and predicted motions of matter in galaxies. This discrepancy is interpreted as evidence for dark matter, which exerts gravitational force but does not emit light. Her work was confirmed using numerous observational techniques, and it has had a major impact on cosmology. Although Vera Rubin received many scientific honors, such as the National Medal of Science and being voted into the National Academy of Sciences, she experienced gender-based resistance early in her career. She was an outspoken advocate for women in the sciences, recognized for paving the way for other women in astronomy, and for achieving remarkable professional success while facing challenges that her male colleagues did not have to overcome. As both a scientist and a woman, she improved the field for those who came after. \"We are pleased LSST has now been named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,\" said sons Allan, David and Karl Rubin. \"We believe that this is a great way to honor our mother's achievements in astronomy and her work for equal rights for women in science.\" In addition, the telescope at the Rubin Observatory has been named the Simonyi Survey Telescope in recognition of a significant private donation made early in the construction phase used to design, develop and fabricate the telescope's primary mirror.", "url": "https://beta.nsf.gov/news/nsf-supported-observatory-renamed-astronomer-vera"}, {"title": "New telescope to be named after pioneering female dark matter astronomer", "date": "2020-01-10", "content": "A large telescope under construction in the mountains of Chile will be named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, after the pioneering researcher who discovered evidence in galaxies for the existence of dark matter. It is also a recognition of her struggle as a woman astronomer in a field of science that was dominated by men. Vera Rubin's contribution to our understanding of dark matter began with observations in 1968 of the Andromeda Galaxy, a large companion to our own Milky Way. She measured the speed of the stars in the galaxy as they orbited around the galactic centre and to her surprise, she found that the stars were moving much too fast to be held by the galaxy's gravity. At the speed she observed, these stars should be flying off in all directions like water drops from a rotating lawn sprinkler. That meant that since they weren't flying out of the galaxy, there had to be something else - some hidden mass that was providing the extra gravity to hold the stars in place. The invisible mass is now known as dark matter and is believed to make up about 80 per cent of the matter in the universe. Although even today, no one knows exactly what the dark stuff is. Rubin was not the first to come up with this idea. Thirty-five years earlier, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a similar calculation based on observations of a group of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and postulated the existence of extra matter hidden in the group. His ideas were not widely accepted by the astronomical community because he didn't have further evidence. That direct evidence was provided when Rubin and her colleague Kent Ford showed how stars were moving in Andromeda Galaxy. According to Newtownian physics, the stars in the centre of a spiral galaxy should be moving faster than those on the outside. You can see this effect by watching water swirl down a drain. The water closest to the drain moves faster than the water in the rest of the sink. But Rubin observed that the stars around the outside of Andromeda were moving just as fast as those in the centre, so there had to be an invisible force at work. Born in 1928, Vera Rubin had an interest in astronomy since childhood, but found it difficult to pursue a career in the field because she was a woman. In fact, when she applied to Princeton University in 1948 for graduate work, she didn't get a response because back then, women were not accepted in the astronomy program. Undeterred, she attended Cornell, and then Georgetown University, where she taught for ten years. Later, she became the first woman to use the 200-inch Hale telescope at the famous Palomar Observatory to study the large-scale motion of galaxies. That was the same instrument used by Fritz Zwicky to study the Coma Cluster. Then while at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., she focused on the rotation of individual galaxies such as Andromeda, which led her to the evidence for dark matter that she found in the motion of the stars. Throughout the rest of her career, she continued on dark matter research but also became an outspoken advocate and role model for women in science. President Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Science in 1993. A ridge on Mars as well as an asteroid are named in her honour. She died in 2016 at the age of 88. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a wide field telescope that will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space And Time. It will observe the entire sky at once, tracking the motions of galaxies and continuing the investigation of dark matter, which has now, thanks to Rubin's pioneering work, become its own field in astronomy.

Rubin was a role model, a mentor, and a boundary-breaker fueled by a true love of science and the stars. \"For me, doing astronomy is incredibly great fun,\" she said in a 1989 interview with physicist and writer Alan Lightman. \"It's just an incredible joy to get up every morning and come to work and, in some much larger framework, not even really quite know what it is I'm going to be doing.\" Between the Lightman interview and \"An Interesting Voyage,\" a biography she wrote in 2010 for the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, among other things, she left behind a detailed record of the story of her life. A curious child: Rubin's father, Pesach Kobchefski, was born in Lithuania. Her mother, Rose Applebaum, was a second-generation American born to Bessarabian parents in Philadelphia. Rubin's parents met at work at the Bell Telephone Company. They married and raised two children, Vera and her older sister, Ruth. Rubin was born in 1928. She wrote that she remembered growing up \"amid a cheery scatter of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins... largely shielded from the financial difficulties\" of the Great Depression. Ruth and Vera shared a room, with Vera's bed against a window with a clear view of the north sky. \"Soon it was more interesting to watch the stars than to sleep,\" Rubin wrote. Her parents encouraged her curiosity. Her mother gave her written permission at an early age to check out books from the \"12 and over\" section of the library, and her father helped her build a homemade telescope. \"My parents were very, very supportive,\" Rubin said in the interview with Lightman, \"except that they didn't like me to stay up all night.\" Rubin's teachers were not universally as encouraging. Her high school physics teacher, she wrote, \"did not know how to include the few young girls in the class, so he chose to ignore us.\" Still, Rubin knew she wanted to go into astronomy. \"I didn't know a single astronomer,\" she said, \"but I just knew that was what I wanted to do.\" She did know about at least one female astronomer: Maria Mitchell, the first female professional astronomer in the United States. From 1865 to 1888, Mitchell taught at Vassar College in New York and served as director of Vassar College Observatory. Looking to follow in her footsteps, Rubin applied to Vassar. She was accepted with a necessary scholarship. Rubin said that when she told the high school physics teacher about it, he replied, \"'As long as you stay away from science, you should be okay.'\" She graduated in three years as the only astronomy major in her class. A family effort: Rubin spent summers in Washington, DC, working at the Naval Research Laboratory. The summer of 1947, her parents introduced her to Robert Rubin. He was training to be an officer in the US Navy and studying chemistry at Cornell University. The two married in 1948. She was 19 and he was 21. Vera had been accepted to Harvard University, which was well known for its astronomy department, but she decided to join her husband at Cornell instead. Rubin completed her master's thesis just before giving birth to her first child, and she gave a talk on her research at the 1950 meeting of the American Astronomical Society just after. Her adviser had said it made more sense for him to give the talk, as he was already a member of AAS and she would be a new mother, but Rubin insisted she would do it. \"We had no car,\" Rubin wrote. \"My parents drove from Washington, DC, to Ithaca, then crossed the snowy New York hills with Bob, me and their first grandchild, 'thereby aging 20 years,' my father later insisted.\" She gave a 10-minute talk on her study of the velocity distribution of the galaxies that at that time had published velocities. It solicited replies from several \"angry-sounding men,\" along with pioneering astronomer Martin Schwarzschild, who, Rubin wrote, kindly \"said what you say to a young student: 'This is very interesting, and when there are more data, we will know more.'\" For a few months after the experience, Rubin stayed home with her newborn son. But she couldn't keep away from the science. \"I would push David to the playground, sit him in the sandbox, and read the Astrophysical Journal ,\" Rubin wrote. With her husband's encouragement, she enrolled in the astronomy PhD program at Georgetown University. Her classes took place at night, twice per week. Those nights, between 1952 and 1954, Rubin's mother babysat David while Bob drove her to the observatory and waited to take her back home, eating his dinner in the car. In astronomy, \"women generally required more luck and perseverance than men did,\" Rubin wrote. \"It helped to have supportive parents and a supportive husband.\" PhD and beyond: Theoretical physicist and cosmologist George Gamow-known for his contributions to developing the Big Bang theory, among other foundational work-heard about Rubin's AAS talk and began asking her questions, Rubin wrote. One question-\"Is there a scale length in the distribution of galaxies?\"-so intrigued her that she decided to take it on for her thesis. Gamow served as her advisor. Rubin wrote that when she sent her research to the Astrophysical Journal in 1954, then-editor and later Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar rejected it, saying he wanted her to wait until his student finished his work on the same subject. She did not wait, publishing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences instead. In 1955, Georgetown offered Rubin a research position, which soon became a teaching position as well. She stayed there for 10 years. In 1962, Rubin taught a graduate course in statistical astronomy with six students, five who worked for the US Naval Observatory and one who worked for NASA. \"Due to their jobs, the students were experts in star catalogs,\" Rubin wrote, \"so I gave the students a research problem: Can we use cataloged stars to determine a rotation curve for stars distant from the center of our g alaxy?\" The group completed the paper, \"some of it finished by seven of us working around my large kitchen table, long into the night,\" Rubin wrote, and they submitted it to the Astrophysical Journal. The editor called to say he would accept the paper but that he would not take the then-unusual step of publishing the names of the students, Rubin wrote. When Rubin replied that she would then withdraw the paper, however, he changed his mind. Rubin wrote that she received many negative \"and some very unpleasant\" responses to the paper, but that it continued to be referenced every few years, even as she was writing in 2010. As she pointed out in her article, \" t his was my first flat rotation curve\"-a result she would see repeated in what would become her most famous publication. During the 1963-1964 school year, Bob took a sabbatical so Vera could move the family to San Diego and work with married couple Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge. With two other scientists, they had in 1957 published the seminal paper explaining how thermonuclear reactions in stars could transform a universe originally made up only of hydrogen, helium and lithium into one that could support life. With the Burbidges, Rubin traveled to both Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and McDonald Observatory in Texas. More than three decades later, in letter to Margaret Burbidge on her 80th birthday, Rubin described what the scientist had meant to her: \"Did the words 'role model' and 'mentor' exist then? I think they did not. But for most of the women that followed you into astronomical careers, these were the roles you filled for us.\" What Rubin best remembers from when she first arrived in San Diego, she wrote, \"was my elation because you took me seriously and were interested in what I had to say... \"From you we have learned that a woman too can rise to great heights as an astronomer, and that it's all right to be charming, gracious, brilliant, and to be concerned for others as we make our way in the world of science.\" The view from Palomar: In 1964, Rubin and her family returned home. Shortly thereafter, Vera and Bob took off again for the meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Hamburg. On the last evening of the conference, influential astronomer Allan Sandage, who in 1958 had published the first good estimate of the Hubble constant, asked Rubin if she were interested in observing on Palomar Mountain at the Carnegie Institution's 200-inch telescope. It was a telescope, located on a mountain northeast of San Diego, that women had officially been prohibited from using. \"Of course, I said yes,\" Rubin wrote. Rubin would be observing on the same mountain where, in 1933, astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a startling discovery. He noticed that the galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving too quickly-so quickly that they should have broken apart. Judging by the mass of their visible matter, they should not have had the gravitational pull to hold together. He concluded that the cluster must be more massive than it appeared, and that most of this mass must come from matter that could not be seen. The Swiss astronomer called the source of the missing mass dunkle Materie, or dark matter. He presented this idea to the Swiss Physical Society, but it did not catch on. On Rubin's first night at Palomar in December 1965, clouds prevented anyone from observing, so another observer took her on an unofficial tour of the facilities. The tour included the single available toilet, labeled \"MEN.\" On Rubin's next visit, \"I drew a skirted woman and pasted her up on the door,\" she wrote. The third time she came to observe, heating had been added to the observing room, along with a gender-neutral bathroom. The world's best spectrograph: In 1965, Rubin decided to prioritize observing over teaching. She asked her colleague Bernie Burke-famous for co-discovering the first detection of radio noise from another planet, Jupiter-for a job at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Burke invited her to the DTM's community lunch. And that's where she met astronomer Kent Ford. Working over the previous decade, Ford had pioneered the use of highly sensitive light detectors called photomultiplier tubes for astronomical observation. \"Kent Ford had built a very exceptional spectrograph,\" Rubin said. \"He probably had the best spectrograph anywhere. He had a spectrograph that could do things that no other spectrographs could do.\" Rubin got the job at DTM, becoming the first female scientist on its staff. Using Ford's spectrograph on the telescope at Lowell Observatory in Arizona, Ford and Rubin could observe objects that were not otherwise detectable. Among the astronomers who noticed was Jim Peebles, winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics. By 1968, Rubin and Ford had published nine papers. \"It was an exciting time,\" Rubin wrote, \"but I was not comfortable with the very rapid pace of the competition. Even very polite phone calls asking me which galaxies I was studying made me uncomfortable.\" So she decided to go back to a subject she had previously dabbled in: the velocity of stars and regions of ionized hydrogen in M31, the Andromeda galaxy. \"I decided to pick a problem that I could go observing and make headway on, hopefully a problem that people would be interested in, but not so interested in that anyone would bother me before I was done,\" Rubin said. Astronomers had been studying the spectra of light from Andromeda since at least January 1899, but no one had taken a look with an instrument as advanced as Ford's. One astronomer had gotten a better look than most, though. In the 1940s, astronomer Walter Baade had taken advantage of wartime blackout rules-meant to make it difficult for enemy planes to hit targets during World War II-to observe Andromeda from Mount Wilson Observatory northeast of Los Angeles. He resolved the stars at the center of the galaxy for the first time and identified 688 emission regions worthy of study. Not knowing this, Rubin and Ford set out to do the same for themselves. They spent a frustrating night taking turns at the US Naval Observatory telescope in Arizona, huddled next to a small heater in negative 20 degree cold, before deciding they needed a new tactic. On their way out in the morning, they ran into Naval Observatory Director Gerald Kron. \"He took us into his warm office, opened a large cabinet and showed us copies of Baade's many plates of stars in M31!\" Rubin wrote. Rubin and Ford obtained copies of the images from the Carnegie Institute and went to work. A rotation curveball: Rubin and Ford made their observations at Lowell Observatory and Kitt Peak. \"On a typical clear night we would obtain four to five spectra,\" Rubin wrote. \"The surprises came very quickly.\" In our solar system, planets closest to the center are the fastest-moving, as they are most affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. Mercury, the closest, moves about 1.6 times as rapidly as Earth, whereas Neptune, the farthest, moves at less than 0.2 times Earth's speed. \"The expectation was that galaxies behaved the same way, in that stars farthest from the massive center would be moving most slowly,\" Rubin wrote. But that's not what they found. The rotation curves were flat, meaning that objects closer to the center of Andromeda were moving at the same speed as objects closer to the outskirts. \"This was discovered over the course of about 4 ice cream cones that first night,\" Rubin wrote, \"as I alternated between developing the plates and eating .\" This time, Rubin said, people believed the data. \"It just piled up too fast. Soon there were 20, then 40, then 60 rotation curves, and they were all flat... And it was just a joy to have that kind of a program, after a program where you had to go through deep analysis and everybody doubted the answer.\" But what did the flat rotation curves mean? The popularly accepted answer is that the way the galaxies in Andromeda move is influenced by dark matter. If a galaxy is formed in the center of a disk of invisible dark matter, the gravitational pull of the dark matter will affect how quickly each of its parts moves, flattening the rotation curves. Theorists Peebles, Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Amos Yahil and others had predicted the existence of dark matter independent of Rubin and Ford's findings, Rubin said. \"The ideas had been around for a while... But the observations fit in so well, since there was already a framework, so some people embraced the observations very enthusiastically.\" Rubin was agnostic about the idea of dark matter and wrote that she would be delighted if the explanation actually came in the form of a new understanding of how gravity works on the cosmic scale. \"One needs to keep an open mind in seeking solutions,\" she wrote. A scientific legacy: Rubin continued her work, receiving recognition for her contributions in various ways. From 1972 to 1977 she served as associate editor of the Astronomical Journal, and from 1977 to 1982 she served as associate editor of A strophysical Journal Letters. In 1993, she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton. In 1994 she received the Dickson Prize in Science from Carnegie-Mellon University and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship from the American Astronomical Society. In 1996 she became the second woman to receive the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London. In 1996 President Clinton nominated her to provide input to Congress as a member of the National Science Board for a term of six years. In 1997 she and a few other members of the board were invited to visit the McMurdo research station at the South Pole. Rubin wrote that she was asked if she would spend her time at McMurdo with the astronomers. \"With a little embarrassment, I asked if that meant that I would miss everything else, the penguins, the mountains and all the other events,\" she wrote. \"Without much difficulty, I voted for the penguins.\" In 2004 the National Academy of Sciences awarded Rubin the James Craig Watson Medal for \"her seminal observations of dark matter in galaxies... and for generous mentoring of young astronomers, men and women.\" Rubin made it a priority to listen to and encourage students and up-and-coming astronomers, and she was especially interested in improving the chances for women in science. Asked by Lightman, \"Do you think that your experience in science has been different because you are a woman rather than a man?\" she replied, \"Of course. Yes, of course. But I'm the wrong person to ask that question. The tragedy in that question is all the women who would have liked to have become astronomers and didn't.\" Rubin shared her love of astronomy far and wide. \"We are fortunate to live in an era when it is possible to learn so much about the u niverse,\" she wrote. \"But I envy our children, our grandchildren, and their children. They will know more than any of us do now, and they may even be able to travel there!\" All four of the Rubin children have gone into science. Her son Allan, quoted in the 2010 article, remembered his parents often spent evenings \"with their work spread out along the very long dining room table, which wasn't used for eating unless a lot of company was expected,\" he said. \"At some point I grew old enough to realize that if what they really wanted to do after dinner was the same thing they did all day at work, then they must have pretty good jobs.\" Rubin's daughter followed Vera into the field of astronomy, initially hooked by a lesson her mother taught on black holes. Over several decades, Judy collaborated on numerous publications and attended meetings around the world with her mom. Rubin died in 2016 at the age of 88. Her name lives on in the AAS Vera Rubin Early Career Prize, Vera Rubin Ridge on the planet Mars, Asteroid 5726 Rubin and, now, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n.

Rubin Observatory, making it the first national U.S. observatory to be named after a female astronomer. Announced at the 2020 American Astronomical Society winter meeting, the name recognizes the role Rubin played in better understanding dark matter, which will be one of the observatory survey's four main themes. \"Named after an astronomer who provided important evidence of the existence of dark matter, the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory seems destined to make science history with its extraordinary capabilities that will come to bear in the next few years,\" said France C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation director. \"Congress has helped make this inspiring commemoration a reality. The Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly advance what we know about dark matter and dark energy, so the Rubin name will have yet another way to inspire women and men eager to investigate.\" The initiative to rename the observatory was started in June 2019 by House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and was enacted into law on Dec. 20, 2019. Science operations at the Rubin Observatory, located on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile, will start in 2022. The observatory consists of an integrated system featuring a wide field ground-based telescope with an 8.4-meter mirror, a 3,200-megapixel camera built by the Department of Energy, an automated data processing system, and an online public engagement platform. The construction and operations of the Rubin Observatory and its DOE LSST Camera is a U.S. federal partnership of NSF and DOE, with private and international contributors. \"It is fitting for this major new observatory, which includes the study of dark matter and dark energy as one of the major research topics, to be named for a pioneering astronomer whose observations were so critical to our understanding of this area,\" said Paul Dabbar, DOE undersecretary for science. Dr. Rubin's life and singular achievements as a scientist remain a model for all those seeking to satisfy humanity's unceasing curiosity about our universe.\" During its first 10 years, this system will deliver an unprecedented optical survey of the visible sky - to be named the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The survey's design is driven by four themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. Rubin Observatory Director Steve Kahn said, \"We are deeply honored to have our observatory named after Vera Rubin. Through her discovery of flat rotation curves in galaxies, which provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, Vera made one of the most important contributions to science in the past century, not only for astronomy, but also for fundamental physics. When construction is completed in 2022, the Rubin Observatory and the LSST Camera will help build on her pioneering work to dramatically improve our understanding of the Universe on many different scales.\" Vera Rubin's work spanned several areas in observational astronomy, but she is most recognized for uncovering the discrepancy between the observed and predicted motions of matter in galaxies. This discrepancy is interpreted as evidence for dark matter, which exerts gravitational force but does not emit light. Her work was confirmed using numerous observational techniques, and it has had a major impact on cosmology. Although Vera Rubin received many scientific honors, such as the National Medal of Science and being voted into the National Academy of Sciences, she experienced gender-based resistance early in her career. She was an outspoken advocate for women in the sciences, recognized for paving the way for other women in astronomy, and for achieving remarkable professional success while facing challenges that her male colleagues did not have to overcome. As both a scientist and a woman, she improved the field for those who came after. \"We are pleased LSST has now been named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,\" said sons Allan, David and Karl Rubin. \"We believe that this is a great way to honor our mother's achievements in astronomy and her work for equal rights for women in science.\" In addition, the telescope at the Rubin Observatory has been named the Simonyi Survey Telescope in recognition of a significant private donation made early in the construction phase used to design, develop and fabricate the telescope's primary mirror.", "url": "https://beta.nsf.gov/news/nsf-supported-observatory-renamed-astronomer-vera"}, {"title": "New telescope to be named after pioneering female dark matter astronomer", "date": "2020-01-10", "content": "A large telescope under construction in the mountains of Chile will be named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, after the pioneering researcher who discovered evidence in galaxies for the existence of dark matter. It is also a recognition of her struggle as a woman astronomer in a field of science that was dominated by men. Vera Rubin's contribution to our understanding of dark matter began with observations in 1968 of the Andromeda Galaxy, a large companion to our own Milky Way. She measured the speed of the stars in the galaxy as they orbited around the galactic centre and to her surprise, she found that the stars were moving much too fast to be held by the galaxy's gravity. At the speed she observed, these stars should be flying off in all directions like water drops from a rotating lawn sprinkler. That meant that since they weren't flying out of the galaxy, there had to be something else - some hidden mass that was providing the extra gravity to hold the stars in place. The invisible mass is now known as dark matter and is believed to make up about 80 per cent of the matter in the universe. Although even today, no one knows exactly what the dark stuff is. Rubin was not the first to come up with this idea. Thirty-five years earlier, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a similar calculation based on observations of a group of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and postulated the existence of extra matter hidden in the group. His ideas were not widely accepted by the astronomical community because he didn't have further evidence. That direct evidence was provided when Rubin and her colleague Kent Ford showed how stars were moving in Andromeda Galaxy. According to Newtownian physics, the stars in the centre of a spiral galaxy should be moving faster than those on the outside. You can see this effect by watching water swirl down a drain. The water closest to the drain moves faster than the water in the rest of the sink. But Rubin observed that the stars around the outside of Andromeda were moving just as fast as those in the centre, so there had to be an invisible force at work. Born in 1928, Vera Rubin had an interest in astronomy since childhood, but found it difficult to pursue a career in the field because she was a woman. In fact, when she applied to Princeton University in 1948 for graduate work, she didn't get a response because back then, women were not accepted in the astronomy program. Undeterred, she attended Cornell, and then Georgetown University, where she taught for ten years. Later, she became the first woman to use the 200-inch Hale telescope at the famous Palomar Observatory to study the large-scale motion of galaxies. That was the same instrument used by Fritz Zwicky to study the Coma Cluster. Then while at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., she focused on the rotation of individual galaxies such as Andromeda, which led her to the evidence for dark matter that she found in the motion of the stars. Throughout the rest of her career, she continued on dark matter research but also became an outspoken advocate and role model for women in science. President Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Science in 1993. A ridge on Mars as well as an asteroid are named in her honour. She died in 2016 at the age of 88. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a wide field telescope that will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space And Time. It will observe the entire sky at once, tracking the motions of galaxies and continuing the investigation of dark matter, which has now, thanks to Rubin's pioneering work, become its own field in astronomy.

With two other scientists, they had in 1957 published the seminal paper explaining how thermonuclear reactions in stars could transform a universe originally made up only of hydrogen, helium and lithium into one that could support life. With the Burbidges, Rubin traveled to both Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and McDonald Observatory in Texas. More than three decades later, in letter to Margaret Burbidge on her 80th birthday, Rubin described what the scientist had meant to her: \"Did the words 'role model' and 'mentor' exist then? I think they did not. But for most of the women that followed you into astronomical careers, these were the roles you filled for us.\" What Rubin best remembers from when she first arrived in San Diego, she wrote, \"was my elation because you took me seriously and were interested in what I had to say... \"From you we have learned that a woman too can rise to great heights as an astronomer, and that it's all right to be charming, gracious, brilliant, and to be concerned for others as we make our way in the world of science.\" The view from Palomar: In 1964, Rubin and her family returned home. Shortly thereafter, Vera and Bob took off again for the meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Hamburg. On the last evening of the conference, influential astronomer Allan Sandage, who in 1958 had published the first good estimate of the Hubble constant, asked Rubin if she were interested in observing on Palomar Mountain at the Carnegie Institution's 200-inch telescope. It was a telescope, located on a mountain northeast of San Diego, that women had officially been prohibited from using. \"Of course, I said yes,\" Rubin wrote. Rubin would be observing on the same mountain where, in 1933, astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a startling discovery. He noticed that the galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving too quickly-so quickly that they should have broken apart. Judging by the mass of their visible matter, they should not have had the gravitational pull to hold together. He concluded that the cluster must be more massive than it appeared, and that most of this mass must come from matter that could not be seen. The Swiss astronomer called the source of the missing mass dunkle Materie, or dark matter. He presented this idea to the Swiss Physical Society, but it did not catch on. On Rubin's first night at Palomar in December 1965, clouds prevented anyone from observing, so another observer took her on an unofficial tour of the facilities. The tour included the single available toilet, labeled \"MEN.\" On Rubin's next visit, \"I drew a skirted woman and pasted her up on the door,\" she wrote. The third time she came to observe, heating had been added to the observing room, along with a gender-neutral bathroom. The world's best spectrograph: In 1965, Rubin decided to prioritize observing over teaching. She asked her colleague Bernie Burke-famous for co-discovering the first detection of radio noise from another planet, Jupiter-for a job at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Burke invited her to the DTM's community lunch. And that's where she met astronomer Kent Ford. Working over the previous decade, Ford had pioneered the use of highly sensitive light detectors called photomultiplier tubes for astronomical observation. \"Kent Ford had built a very exceptional spectrograph,\" Rubin said. \"He probably had the best spectrograph anywhere. He had a spectrograph that could do things that no other spectrographs could do.\" Rubin got the job at DTM, becoming the first female scientist on its staff. Using Ford's spectrograph on the telescope at Lowell Observatory in Arizona, Ford and Rubin could observe objects that were not otherwise detectable. Among the astronomers who noticed was Jim Peebles, winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics. By 1968, Rubin and Ford had published nine papers. \"It was an exciting time,\" Rubin wrote, \"but I was not comfortable with the very rapid pace of the competition. Even very polite phone calls asking me which galaxies I was studying made me uncomfortable.\" So she decided to go back to a subject she had previously dabbled in: the velocity of stars and regions of ionized hydrogen in M31, the Andromeda galaxy. \"I decided to pick a problem that I could go observing and make headway on, hopefully a problem that people would be interested in, but not so interested in that anyone would bother me before I was done,\" Rubin said. Astronomers had been studying the spectra of light from Andromeda since at least January 1899, but no one had taken a look with an instrument as advanced as Ford's. One astronomer had gotten a better look than most, though. In the 1940s, astronomer Walter Baade had taken advantage of wartime blackout rules-meant to make it difficult for enemy planes to hit targets during World War II-to observe Andromeda from Mount Wilson Observatory northeast of Los Angeles. He resolved the stars at the center of the galaxy for the first time and identified 688 emission regions worthy of study. Not knowing this, Rubin and Ford set out to do the same for themselves. They spent a frustrating night taking turns at the US Naval Observatory telescope in Arizona, huddled next to a small heater in negative 20 degree cold, before deciding they needed a new tactic. On their way out in the morning, they ran into Naval Observatory Director Gerald Kron. \"He took us into his warm office, opened a large cabinet and showed us copies of Baade's many plates of stars in M31!\" Rubin wrote. Rubin and Ford obtained copies of the images from the Carnegie Institute and went to work. A rotation curveball: Rubin and Ford made their observations at Lowell Observatory and Kitt Peak. \"On a typical clear night we would obtain four to five spectra,\" Rubin wrote. \"The surprises came very quickly.\" In our solar system, planets closest to the center are the fastest-moving, as they are most affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. Mercury, the closest, moves about 1.6 times as rapidly as Earth, whereas Neptune, the farthest, moves at less than 0.2 times Earth's speed. \"The expectation was that galaxies behaved the same way, in that stars farthest from the massive center would be moving most slowly,\" Rubin wrote. But that's not what they found. The rotation curves were flat, meaning that objects closer to the center of Andromeda were moving at the same speed as objects closer to the outskirts. \"This was discovered over the course of about 4 ice cream cones that first night,\" Rubin wrote, \"as I alternated between developing the plates and eating .\" This time, Rubin said, people believed the data. \"It just piled up too fast. Soon there were 20, then 40, then 60 rotation curves, and they were all flat... And it was just a joy to have that kind of a program, after a program where you had to go through deep analysis and everybody doubted the answer.\" But what did the flat rotation curves mean? The popularly accepted answer is that the way the galaxies in Andromeda move is influenced by dark matter. If a galaxy is formed in the center of a disk of invisible dark matter, the gravitational pull of the dark matter will affect how quickly each of its parts moves, flattening the rotation curves. Theorists Peebles, Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Amos Yahil and others had predicted the existence of dark matter independent of Rubin and Ford's findings, Rubin said. \"The ideas had been around for a while... But the observations fit in so well, since there was already a framework, so some people embraced the observations very enthusiastically.\" Rubin was agnostic about the idea of dark matter and wrote that she would be delighted if the explanation actually came in the form of a new understanding of how gravity works on the cosmic scale. \"One needs to keep an open mind in seeking solutions,\" she wrote. A scientific legacy: Rubin continued her work, receiving recognition for her contributions in various ways. From 1972 to 1977 she served as associate editor of the Astronomical Journal, and from 1977 to 1982 she served as associate editor of A strophysical Journal Letters. In 1993, she received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton. In 1994 she received the Dickson Prize in Science from Carnegie-Mellon University and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship from the American Astronomical Society. In 1996 she became the second woman to receive the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in London. In 1996 President Clinton nominated her to provide input to Congress as a member of the National Science Board for a term of six years. In 1997 she and a few other members of the board were invited to visit the McMurdo research station at the South Pole. Rubin wrote that she was asked if she would spend her time at McMurdo with the astronomers. \"With a little embarrassment, I asked if that meant that I would miss everything else, the penguins, the mountains and all the other events,\" she wrote. \"Without much difficulty, I voted for the penguins.\" In 2004 the National Academy of Sciences awarded Rubin the James Craig Watson Medal for \"her seminal observations of dark matter in galaxies... and for generous mentoring of young astronomers, men and women.\" Rubin made it a priority to listen to and encourage students and up-and-coming astronomers, and she was especially interested in improving the chances for women in science. Asked by Lightman, \"Do you think that your experience in science has been different because you are a woman rather than a man?\" she replied, \"Of course. Yes, of course. But I'm the wrong person to ask that question. The tragedy in that question is all the women who would have liked to have become astronomers and didn't.\" Rubin shared her love of astronomy far and wide. \"We are fortunate to live in an era when it is possible to learn so much about the u niverse,\" she wrote. \"But I envy our children, our grandchildren, and their children. They will know more than any of us do now, and they may even be able to travel there!\" All four of the Rubin children have gone into science. Her son Allan, quoted in the 2010 article, remembered his parents often spent evenings \"with their work spread out along the very long dining room table, which wasn't used for eating unless a lot of company was expected,\" he said. \"At some point I grew old enough to realize that if what they really wanted to do after dinner was the same thing they did all day at work, then they must have pretty good jobs.\" Rubin's daughter followed Vera into the field of astronomy, initially hooked by a lesson her mother taught on black holes. Over several decades, Judy collaborated on numerous publications and attended meetings around the world with her mom. Rubin died in 2016 at the age of 88. Her name lives on in the AAS Vera Rubin Early Career Prize, Vera Rubin Ridge on the planet Mars, Asteroid 5726 Rubin and, now, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory on Cerro Pach\u00f3n.

Rubin Observatory, making it the first national U.S. observatory to be named after a female astronomer. Announced at the 2020 American Astronomical Society winter meeting, the name recognizes the role Rubin played in better understanding dark matter, which will be one of the observatory survey's four main themes. \"Named after an astronomer who provided important evidence of the existence of dark matter, the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory seems destined to make science history with its extraordinary capabilities that will come to bear in the next few years,\" said France C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation director. \"Congress has helped make this inspiring commemoration a reality. The Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly advance what we know about dark matter and dark energy, so the Rubin name will have yet another way to inspire women and men eager to investigate.\" The initiative to rename the observatory was started in June 2019 by House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and was enacted into law on Dec. 20, 2019. Science operations at the Rubin Observatory, located on Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile, will start in 2022. The observatory consists of an integrated system featuring a wide field ground-based telescope with an 8.4-meter mirror, a 3,200-megapixel camera built by the Department of Energy, an automated data processing system, and an online public engagement platform. The construction and operations of the Rubin Observatory and its DOE LSST Camera is a U.S. federal partnership of NSF and DOE, with private and international contributors. \"It is fitting for this major new observatory, which includes the study of dark matter and dark energy as one of the major research topics, to be named for a pioneering astronomer whose observations were so critical to our understanding of this area,\" said Paul Dabbar, DOE undersecretary for science. Dr. Rubin's life and singular achievements as a scientist remain a model for all those seeking to satisfy humanity's unceasing curiosity about our universe.\" During its first 10 years, this system will deliver an unprecedented optical survey of the visible sky - to be named the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The survey's design is driven by four themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. Rubin Observatory Director Steve Kahn said, \"We are deeply honored to have our observatory named after Vera Rubin. Through her discovery of flat rotation curves in galaxies, which provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, Vera made one of the most important contributions to science in the past century, not only for astronomy, but also for fundamental physics. When construction is completed in 2022, the Rubin Observatory and the LSST Camera will help build on her pioneering work to dramatically improve our understanding of the Universe on many different scales.\" Vera Rubin's work spanned several areas in observational astronomy, but she is most recognized for uncovering the discrepancy between the observed and predicted motions of matter in galaxies. This discrepancy is interpreted as evidence for dark matter, which exerts gravitational force but does not emit light. Her work was confirmed using numerous observational techniques, and it has had a major impact on cosmology. Although Vera Rubin received many scientific honors, such as the National Medal of Science and being voted into the National Academy of Sciences, she experienced gender-based resistance early in her career. She was an outspoken advocate for women in the sciences, recognized for paving the way for other women in astronomy, and for achieving remarkable professional success while facing challenges that her male colleagues did not have to overcome. As both a scientist and a woman, she improved the field for those who came after. \"We are pleased LSST has now been named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,\" said sons Allan, David and Karl Rubin. \"We believe that this is a great way to honor our mother's achievements in astronomy and her work for equal rights for women in science.\" In addition, the telescope at the Rubin Observatory has been named the Simonyi Survey Telescope in recognition of a significant private donation made early in the construction phase used to design, develop and fabricate the telescope's primary mirror.", "url": "https://beta.nsf.gov/news/nsf-supported-observatory-renamed-astronomer-vera"}, {"title": "New telescope to be named after pioneering female dark matter astronomer", "date": "2020-01-10", "content": "A large telescope under construction in the mountains of Chile will be named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, after the pioneering researcher who discovered evidence in galaxies for the existence of dark matter. It is also a recognition of her struggle as a woman astronomer in a field of science that was dominated by men. Vera Rubin's contribution to our understanding of dark matter began with observations in 1968 of the Andromeda Galaxy, a large companion to our own Milky Way. She measured the speed of the stars in the galaxy as they orbited around the galactic centre and to her surprise, she found that the stars were moving much too fast to be held by the galaxy's gravity. At the speed she observed, these stars should be flying off in all directions like water drops from a rotating lawn sprinkler. That meant that since they weren't flying out of the galaxy, there had to be something else - some hidden mass that was providing the extra gravity to hold the stars in place. The invisible mass is now known as dark matter and is believed to make up about 80 per cent of the matter in the universe. Although even today, no one knows exactly what the dark stuff is. Rubin was not the first to come up with this idea. Thirty-five years earlier, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky made a similar calculation based on observations of a group of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and postulated the existence of extra matter hidden in the group. His ideas were not widely accepted by the astronomical community because he didn't have further evidence. That direct evidence was provided when Rubin and her colleague Kent Ford showed how stars were moving in Andromeda Galaxy. According to Newtownian physics, the stars in the centre of a spiral galaxy should be moving faster than those on the outside. You can see this effect by watching water swirl down a drain. The water closest to the drain moves faster than the water in the rest of the sink. But Rubin observed that the stars around the outside of Andromeda were moving just as fast as those in the centre, so there had to be an invisible force at work. Born in 1928, Vera Rubin had an interest in astronomy since childhood, but found it difficult to pursue a career in the field because she was a woman. In fact, when she applied to Princeton University in 1948 for graduate work, she didn't get a response because back then, women were not accepted in the astronomy program. Undeterred, she attended Cornell, and then Georgetown University, where she taught for ten years. Later, she became the first woman to use the 200-inch Hale telescope at the famous Palomar Observatory to study the large-scale motion of galaxies. That was the same instrument used by Fritz Zwicky to study the Coma Cluster. Then while at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., she focused on the rotation of individual galaxies such as Andromeda, which led her to the evidence for dark matter that she found in the motion of the stars. Throughout the rest of her career, she continued on dark matter research but also became an outspoken advocate and role model for women in science. President Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Science in 1993. A ridge on Mars as well as an asteroid are named in her honour. She died in 2016 at the age of 88. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a wide field telescope that will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space And Time. It will observe the entire sky at once, tracking the motions of galaxies and continuing the investigation of dark matter, which has now, thanks to Rubin's pioneering work, become its own field in astronomy.

When the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins observations in 2023, its SUV-size camera will be able to capture complete panoramas of the southern sky every few nights. And that requires a new type of camera never seen before. The imaging sensors for the world's largest digital camera have captured the first-ever 3,200-megapixel images by teams at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California Once this array of sensors is installed in the camera at SLAC and delivered to the Rubin Observatory in Chile, it will contribute to the observatory's 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. This survey will serve as a catalog of billions of galaxies and astrophysical objects, essentially creating \"the largest astronomical movie of all time\" and unlock the mysteries of the universe. The first 3,200-megapixel images captured using the sensors are so sprawling that they would require 378 4K ultra-high-definition TV screens to showcase just one of them at its full size. The assembly of the sensors in the camera's focal plane was completed in January, and the first images were used to test it. \"The focal plane will produce the images for the LSST, so it's the capable and sensitive eye of the Rubin Observatory,\" said Vincent Riot, LSST camera project manager, in a statement. Riot is from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The camera's focal plane, similar to an imaging sensor in a digital camera, includes 189 sensors that provide 16 megapixels each. And it's more than 2 feet wide, compared to the normal 1.4-inch-wide sensor in digital full-frame cameras. This makes the sensor large enough to image a part of the sky that is equal to 40 full moons. The observatory's capabilities will enable it to spot faint objects 100 million times dimmer than what we can see with the naked eye. It's designed to map the Milky Way, explore dark energy and dark matter, and survey the solar system. During the 10-year survey, the camera is expected to image 20 billion galaxies. \"These data will improve our knowledge of how galaxies have evolved over time and will let us test our models of dark matter and dark energy more deeply and precisely than ever,\" said Steven Ritz, project scientist for the LSST Camera at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in a statement. \"The observatory will be a wonderful facility for a broad range of science - from detailed studies of our solar system to studies of faraway objects toward the edge of the visible universe.\" Capturing the first images: Before the LSST camera could point its eye to the sky, it had to undergo delicate assembly as well as testing. The focal plane took six months to assemble. Each grid of nine sensors is called a scientific raft, and 25 rafts had to be fitted into their spots along the grid. The sensors can easily crack if they come in contact with each other, and they only have a tiny gap between rafts - less than five human hairs wide. And the rafts cost about $3 million each. This explains why the team spent a year preparing before starting to install any of the rafts. The focal plane itself is inside a cryostat, a device that keeps the sensors at a cool negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature they require to operate. Although assembly of the focal plane was completed in January, the coronavirus pandemic kept the team from accessing the lab to take the first images using the focal plane in May - and even then, with limited staff and social distancing in place. While testing of the focal plane continues, the first images are a huge milestone. Although the camera itself isn't completely assembled, the team was able to use a 150-micron pinhole that acted as a projector for the focal plane to take some initial pictures. The first images include a Romanesco vegetable, which was chosen for its detailed surface, as well as Vera Rubin herself, who the observatory is named for. Rubin, who died in 2016, once mentored fellow aspiring female astronomers and advocated for women in science. It's fitting that the first national US observatory named for a female astronomer is in her honor. Rubin, considered to be one of the most influential female astronomers, provided some of the first evidence that dark matter - which comprises much of the universe but can't be seen - existed. The new images revealed the amount of detail the sensors can capture. \"Taking these images is a major accomplishment,\" said Aaron Roodman, professor and chair of the particle physics and astrophysics department and the scientist at SLAC responsible for the assembly and testing of the LSST camera, in a statement. \"With the tight specifications we really pushed the limits of what's possible to take advantage of every square millimeter of the focal plane and maximize the science we can do with it.\" Next comes the assembly of the camera: inserting the focal plane and cryostat into the camera body, adding the world's largest optical lens, shutter and filter exchange system. The team estimated that the camera would be ready for testing by mid-2021 before it's sent off to Chile. \"It's a milestone that brings us a big step closer to exploring fundamental questions about the universe in ways we haven't been able to before,\" said said JoAnne Hewett, SLAC's chief research officer and associate lab director for fundamental physics, in a statement.

When the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins observations in 2023, its SUV-size camera will be able to capture complete panoramas of the southern sky every few nights. And that requires a new type of camera never seen before. The imaging sensors for the world's largest digital camera have captured the first-ever 3,200-megapixel images by teams at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California Once this array of sensors is installed in the camera at SLAC and delivered to the Rubin Observatory in Chile, it will contribute to the observatory's 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. This survey will serve as a catalog of billions of galaxies and astrophysical objects, essentially creating \"the largest astronomical movie of all time\" and unlock the mysteries of the universe. The first 3,200-megapixel images captured using the sensors are so sprawling that they would require 378 4K ultra-high-definition TV screens to showcase just one of them at its full size. The assembly of the sensors in the camera's focal plane was completed in January, and the first images were used to test it. \"The focal plane will produce the images for the LSST, so it's the capable and sensitive eye of the Rubin Observatory,\" said Vincent Riot, LSST camera project manager, in a statement. Riot is from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The camera's focal plane, similar to an imaging sensor in a digital camera, includes 189 sensors that provide 16 megapixels each. And it's more than 2 feet wide, compared to the normal 1.4-inch-wide sensor in digital full-frame cameras. This makes the sensor large enough to image a part of the sky that is equal to 40 full moons. The observatory's capabilities will enable it to spot faint objects 100 million times dimmer than what we can see with the naked eye. It's designed to map the Milky Way, explore dark energy and dark matter, and survey the solar system. During the 10-year survey, the camera is expected to image 20 billion galaxies. \"These data will improve our knowledge of how galaxies have evolved over time and will let us test our models of dark matter and dark energy more deeply and precisely than ever,\" said Steven Ritz, project scientist for the LSST Camera at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in a statement. \"The observatory will be a wonderful facility for a broad range of science - from detailed studies of our solar system to studies of faraway objects toward the edge of the visible universe.\" Capturing the first images: Before the LSST camera could point its eye to the sky, it had to undergo delicate assembly as well as testing. The focal plane took six months to assemble. Each grid of nine sensors is called a scientific raft, and 25 rafts had to be fitted into their spots along the grid. The sensors can easily crack if they come in contact with each other, and they only have a tiny gap between rafts - less than five human hairs wide. And the rafts cost about $3 million each. This explains why the team spent a year preparing before starting to install any of the rafts. The focal plane itself is inside a cryostat, a device that keeps the sensors at a cool negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the temperature they require to operate. Although assembly of the focal plane was completed in January, the coronavirus pandemic kept the team from accessing the lab to take the first images using the focal plane in May - and even then, with limited staff and social distancing in place. While testing of the focal plane continues, the first images are a huge milestone. Although the camera itself isn't completely assembled, the team was able to use a 150-micron pinhole that acted as a projector for the focal plane to take some initial pictures. The first images include a Romanesco vegetable, which was chosen for its detailed surface, as well as Vera Rubin herself, who the observatory is named for. Rubin, who died in 2016, once mentored fellow aspiring female astronomers and advocated for women in science. It's fitting that the first national US observatory named for a female astronomer is in her honor. Rubin, considered to be one of the most influential female astronomers, provided some of the first evidence that dark matter - which comprises much of the universe but can't be seen - existed.

Rubin Observatory and Women of Chilean Astronomy", "date": "2021-03-31", "content": "In March 2020, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory sat partially erected, perched on Chile's Cerro Pach\u00f3n in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The Observatory had halted construction of the 8.4-meter telescope and its associated buildings due to the coronavirus pandemic. By October 2020, with safety precautions in place, construction teams began to slowly return to the mountain. Earlier this month, just one year after its unexpected closure, the Rubin Observatory reached a major milestone when crew used a crane to lower the top end of the telescope, weighing approximately 28 tons and measuring 10 meters in diameter, through the observatory's open dome and into its place on the telescope. This was one of the last remaining heavy pieces to be added to the telescope as the project nears completion and looks forward to beginning regular observations in 2022. On March 2, 2021, the Top-End Assembly for the telescope was lifted by crane into the observatory dome and installed on the telescope mount. Once in operation, the Rubin Observatory will survey the sky above it, capturing images every few nights to create a catalog of data and a map of the visible universe. Astronomers will use this accumulation of roughly 20 terabytes of data each night, enough to hold the equivalent of four million of your favorite songs, to push our scientific understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. Initially called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory was renamed to honor a pioneer in astronomy, particularly in the field of dark matter, one of the many mysteries the new observatory is expected to help probe. Beginning in the 1960s, Dr. Vera Rubin used a new instrument designed by Kent Ford to study the motion of galaxies. Rubin discovered that the stars in the galaxies she observed orbited faster than expected. One explanation for this discrepancy was that there was more mass in the galaxy than could be seen in the stars alone. Rubin's observations helped provide the best observational evidence that the universe is not only composed of ordinary matter, but is actually dominated by dark matter. In 2019, two U.S. House of Representative members, Eddie Bernice Johnson and Jennifer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, introduced the congressional bill to rename the observatory, the text of which noted Rubin's pioneering astronomical work, but also the barriers she faced because of her gender. Princeton University, Rubin's preferred choice for graduate work, did not allow women to apply to its programs and the astronomical community largely ignored Rubin's research early in her career. Eventually she succeeded in securing a position at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and became the first woman to officially observe at the Palomar Observatory, which was home to the world's largest telescope. Before her death in 2016, Rubin served as a mentor to other women astronomers and fought for better gender parity in astronomy. Rubin observed the universe with some of the largest telescopes available during the late twentieth century, including those in Chile, at the newly established Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and the Las Campanas Observatory. When Rubin began her astronomical career, Chile held a small fraction of the world's telescopes. However, largely due to the nearly perfect dry and clear conditions, particularly in the Atacama Desert in Chile's northern region, today Chile contains the vast majority, around 70%, of the world's large ground-based telescopes. The Carnegie Institution Swope telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, is named after Henrietta Swope, who worked at the Harvard College Observatory during the early 20th century. Swope used the relationship between the luminosities and periodicities of variable stars established by Henrietta Leavitt to measure distances to galaxies.

In 1997, she discovered one of the first free floating brown dwarfs using the European Southern Observatory's La Silla observatory. Brown dwarfs are star-like objects that are too small to fuse hydrogen but too large to be planets. Their discovery and subsequent study refuted the hypothesis that brown dwarfs may account for a significant amount of the dark matter in the universe.

Rubin Observatory sat partially erected, perched on Chile's Cerro Pach\u00f3n in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The Observatory had halted construction of the 8.4-meter telescope and its associated buildings due to the coronavirus pandemic. By October 2020, with safety precautions in place, construction teams began to slowly return to the mountain. Earlier this month, just one year after its unexpected closure, the Rubin Observatory reached a major milestone when crew used a crane to lower the top end of the telescope, weighing approximately 28 tons and measuring 10 meters in diameter, through the observatory's open dome and into its place on the telescope. This was one of the last remaining heavy pieces to be added to the telescope as the project nears completion and looks forward to beginning regular observations in 2022. On March 2, 2021, the Top-End Assembly for the telescope was lifted by crane into the observatory dome and installed on the telescope mount. Once in operation, the Rubin Observatory will survey the sky above it, capturing images every few nights to create a catalog of data and a map of the visible universe. Astronomers will use this accumulation of roughly 20 terabytes of data each night, enough to hold the equivalent of four million of your favorite songs, to push our scientific understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. Initially called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory was renamed to honor a pioneer in astronomy, particularly in the field of dark matter, one of the many mysteries the new observatory is expected to help probe. Beginning in the 1960s, Dr. Vera Rubin used a new instrument designed by Kent Ford to study the motion of galaxies. Rubin discovered that the stars in the galaxies she observed orbited faster than expected. One explanation for this discrepancy was that there was more mass in the galaxy than could be seen in the stars alone. Rubin's observations helped provide the best observational evidence that the universe is not only composed of ordinary matter, but is actually dominated by dark matter. In 2019, two U.S. House of Representative members, Eddie Bernice Johnson and Jennifer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, introduced the congressional bill to rename the observatory, the text of which noted Rubin's pioneering astronomical work, but also the barriers she faced because of her gender. Princeton University, Rubin's preferred choice for graduate work, did not allow women to apply to its programs and the astronomical community largely ignored Rubin's research early in her career. Eventually she succeeded in securing a position at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and became the first woman to officially observe at the Palomar Observatory, which was home to the world's largest telescope. Before her death in 2016, Rubin served as a mentor to other women astronomers and fought for better gender parity in astronomy. Rubin observed the universe with some of the largest telescopes available during the late twentieth century, including those in Chile, at the newly established Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and the Las Campanas Observatory. When Rubin began her astronomical career, Chile held a small fraction of the world's telescopes. However, largely due to the nearly perfect dry and clear conditions, particularly in the Atacama Desert in Chile's northern region, today Chile contains the vast majority, around 70%, of the world's large ground-based telescopes. The Carnegie Institution Swope telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, is named after Henrietta Swope, who worked at the Harvard College Observatory during the early 20th century. Swope used the relationship between the luminosities and periodicities of variable stars established by Henrietta Leavitt to measure distances to galaxies.

Rubin Observatory: New view of the universe", "date": "2021-04-26", "content": "The next era of our investigation of the cosmos is about to be kick-started by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a ground-based telescope currently under construction on the El Pen\u00f3n peak of Cerro Pach\u00f3n in northern Chile. The observatory is a federal project run by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The new observatory - named in honor of astronomer Vera Rubin - is scheduled to begin operations in October 2023, according to a statement published on the Rubin Observatory website. When it's up and running, Rubin will allow astronomers to consider some of the universe's most pressing mysteries. \"There are four main scientific themes that have guided our design of the observatory,\" Vera C. Rubin director Steven Kahn, an astrophysicist at Stanford University in California, wrote in an email. \"Cataloging all of the small moving objects in the solar system. Mapping the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Investigating many kinds of stellar variability in the sky. And determining the nature of dark matter and dark energy, two of the greatest mysteries of modern physics.\" Kahn said that the Rubin Observatory will also enable other kinds of studies that are independent of these areas. \"We expect the observatory to make many discoveries - things we did not even know existed before,\" Kahn told All About Space. A wider view of the universe: These four investigatory elements will be united under the umbrella of the decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time, according to an article from the Kavli Institute for Particle Physics and Cosmology, a joint operation of Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LSST will build upon previous sky surveys that have formed the fundamental data pillars of astronomy for many years, systematically mapping the universe and providing insights that have shaped our understanding of the cosmos. As impressive as these past surveys and the telescopes that conducted them have been, their view has been limited to a tiny fraction of the sky. This is one of the areas in which the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will really up the ante. Originally named the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in its initial proposal and in a paper posted in May 2008 on the preprint site arXiv.org, the design of the observatory's main instrument - the Simonyi Survey Telescope - has been guided by three key watchwords: width, depth and speed. \"The Rubin Observatory will be very different from all the existing large telescopes ,\" said Kahn. \"Most telescopes are designed to make detailed investigations of individual objects - stars, galaxies and clusters of such objects. Rubin is designed instead to make a deep imaging survey of the sky over the entire Southern Hemisphere.\" The key to this wide-field view is the telescope's unique three-mirror design, which features a 27.6-foot-wide primary mirror. This design boosts what astronomers call the etendue of the system - a quality that is the product of the collecting area of the primary mirror and the field of view of the camera and describes how spread out the light in a system is. \"The Rubin Observatory will have an etendue more than 10 times larger than all previous facilities and any currently planned for development anywhere else in the world,\" said Kahn. \"It is world-unique in that sense.\" A camera like no other: In order to obtain such high etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory team had to combine this unusual three-mirror optical system with the use of a record- breaking piece of kit - the largest digital camera ever created. This SUV-sized camera is also the first in the world to have a 3.2-gigabyte capability, according to a news release published by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in September 2020. Just one image produced by the camera would take over 350 4K TVs to display. The camera will take one 15-second exposure of the sky every 20 seconds, enabling it to capture about 10,000 square degrees of the sky over the course of three nights. This grants the observatory the ability to both track moving objects like asteroids and record the changes in stars and events like supernovas. The movement of objects close to Earth and the rate at which objects like stars change occur over an extreme range of time periods. Fortunately, the observatory can survey the sky on timescales ranging from years down to around 15 seconds. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will also provide unprecedented depth by observing the universe in six different optical bands, with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 1,060 nanometers. That covers ultraviolet light, right through the visible light spectrum to infrared. As a result, the observatory will be able to image some extremely faint objects missed by previous surveys, according to Air & Space magazine. \"Rubin will obtain nearly 1,000 images of every part of the southern sky. By comparing images taken at different times, we can detect everything that moves in the sky and everything that varies in brightness,\" said Kahn. \"By adding together those 1,000 individual images, we can obtain the deepest images of every part of the southern sky.\" How will Vera C. Rubin Observatory handle large amounts of data? Collecting so many highly detailed images presents a major challenge, as it represents a huge amount of data that has to be handled - around 20 terabytes every night. Thus, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory requires another revolution just to process this sheer wealth of information. \"We also had to develop the technology to process all of that data, to store it, and to enable scientists to query it in order conduct their investigations,\" said Kahn. \"All of that was new and is beyond state of the art.\" For Kahn, part of the beauty of the project is that no one is quite sure what will be discovered in the data it provides. \"We don't know what we will find,\" he said. \"That is the rationale behind building the experiment in the first place.\" Kahn knows one thing for sure: the impact it will have on astronomy is tremendous. \"Rubin will detect and catalog something like 20 billion galaxies, meaning for the first time we will know about more galaxies than there are people on Earth.\" This number represents roughly 10% of all galaxies estimated to exist in the observable universe. \"It will be a remarkable human achievement to be able to make such a record of our universe this way, equivalent in some respects to some of the first maps ever made of the entire Earth,\" Kahn told All About Space. \"It is very exciting to be part of this project.

Rubin Observatory requires another revolution just to process this sheer wealth of information. \"We also had to develop the technology to process all of that data, to store it, and to enable scientists to query it in order conduct their investigations,\" said Kahn. \"All of that was new and is beyond state of the art.\" For Kahn, part of the beauty of the project is that no one is quite sure what will be discovered in the data it provides. \"We don't know what we will find,\" he said. \"That is the rationale behind building the experiment in the first place.\" Kahn knows one thing for sure: the impact it will have on astronomy is tremendous. \"Rubin will detect and catalog something like 20 billion galaxies, meaning for the first time we will know about more galaxies than there are people on Earth.\" This number represents roughly 10% of all galaxies estimated to exist in the observable universe. \"It will be a remarkable human achievement to be able to make such a record of our universe this way, equivalent in some respects to some of the first maps ever made of the entire Earth,\" Kahn told All About Space. \"It is very exciting to be part of this project.

Rubin Observatory and Women of Chilean Astronomy", "date": "2021-03-31", "content": "In March 2020, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory sat partially erected, perched on Chile's Cerro Pach\u00f3n in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The Observatory had halted construction of the 8.4-meter telescope and its associated buildings due to the coronavirus pandemic. By October 2020, with safety precautions in place, construction teams began to slowly return to the mountain. Earlier this month, just one year after its unexpected closure, the Rubin Observatory reached a major milestone when crew used a crane to lower the top end of the telescope, weighing approximately 28 tons and measuring 10 meters in diameter, through the observatory's open dome and into its place on the telescope. This was one of the last remaining heavy pieces to be added to the telescope as the project nears completion and looks forward to beginning regular observations in 2022. On March 2, 2021, the Top-End Assembly for the telescope was lifted by crane into the observatory dome and installed on the telescope mount. Once in operation, the Rubin Observatory will survey the sky above it, capturing images every few nights to create a catalog of data and a map of the visible universe. Astronomers will use this accumulation of roughly 20 terabytes of data each night, enough to hold the equivalent of four million of your favorite songs, to push our scientific understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. Initially called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory was renamed to honor a pioneer in astronomy, particularly in the field of dark matter, one of the many mysteries the new observatory is expected to help probe. Beginning in the 1960s, Dr. Vera Rubin used a new instrument designed by Kent Ford to study the motion of galaxies. Rubin discovered that the stars in the galaxies she observed orbited faster than expected. One explanation for this discrepancy was that there was more mass in the galaxy than could be seen in the stars alone. Rubin's observations helped provide the best observational evidence that the universe is not only composed of ordinary matter, but is actually dominated by dark matter. In 2019, two U.S. House of Representative members, Eddie Bernice Johnson and Jennifer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, introduced the congressional bill to rename the observatory, the text of which noted Rubin's pioneering astronomical work, but also the barriers she faced because of her gender. Princeton University, Rubin's preferred choice for graduate work, did not allow women to apply to its programs and the astronomical community largely ignored Rubin's research early in her career. Eventually she succeeded in securing a position at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and became the first woman to officially observe at the Palomar Observatory, which was home to the world's largest telescope. Before her death in 2016, Rubin served as a mentor to other women astronomers and fought for better gender parity in astronomy. Rubin observed the universe with some of the largest telescopes available during the late twentieth century, including those in Chile, at the newly established Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and the Las Campanas Observatory. When Rubin began her astronomical career, Chile held a small fraction of the world's telescopes. However, largely due to the nearly perfect dry and clear conditions, particularly in the Atacama Desert in Chile's northern region, today Chile contains the vast majority, around 70%, of the world's large ground-based telescopes. The Carnegie Institution Swope telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, is named after Henrietta Swope, who worked at the Harvard College Observatory during the early 20th century. Swope used the relationship between the luminosities and periodicities of variable stars established by Henrietta Leavitt to measure distances to galaxies. A gift she made to the Carnegie Institution helped the initial development of the Las Campanas Observatory. Most Chilean observatories constructed in the last 60 years are operated by North American and European nations. For their access to Chile's pristine skies, these international collaborators agreed to reserve 10% of observing time for Chilean astronomers, a percentage that many argue is not adequate. The number of Chilean universities offering PhD degrees in astronomy has increased in the last decade and the number of professional astronomers working in Chile has tripled in that decade alone. At the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, all of the data will be made available to both Chilean and U.S astronomers which should aid the growing number of astronomers in Chile. However, in Chile, women astronomers still only account for 15% of the country's astronomers, which is about half their representation worldwide. Placing Rubin's name on a new observatory and providing greater access to its data is a recognition of her incredible accomplishments and tireless efforts but it is also a reminder of the continued marginalization of women in astronomy and the further inequity across race and nationality. While the number of women astronomers in Chile remains low, women have succeeded in contributing to the extension of our knowledge of the universe. Dr. Mar\u00eda Teresa Ruiz broke through her own barriers as she worked to become a trailblazer for women in Chilean astronomy. Born in Santiago, Ruiz was the first woman to earn a degree in the newly formed astronomy program at the University of Chile. When she graduated there were no astronomy PhD granting programs in Chile so she traveled to the United States where she attended Princeton University, the same institution where two decades earlier, Rubin had not been permitted to apply. In 1975, Ruiz became the first woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics at Princeton. Ruiz eventually returned to Chile and helped to rebuild and foster the university system. In 1997, she discovered one of the first free floating brown dwarfs using the European Southern Observatory's La Silla observatory. Brown dwarfs are star-like objects that are too small to fuse hydrogen but too large to be planets. Their discovery and subsequent study refuted the hypothesis that brown dwarfs may account for a significant amount of the dark matter in the universe. For her long and accomplished career in astronomy, Ruiz was awarded Chile's National Prize for Exact Sciences and remains a leader for science in Chile. Ruiz paved the way for younger scientists to follow in her footsteps. Dr. B\u00e1rbara Rojas-Ayala began her astronomical studies under Ruiz and continues to research dwarf stars at the University of Tarapac\u00e1. Dr. Maritza Soto has already impressed with the discovery of three planets, the first of which she discovered in 2011 while a graduate student at the University of Chile. Soto continues her research while hoping to normalize careers in astronomy, particularly for women. In 2019, Soto hoped to import that \"astronomy is not alien stuff that only two people in the world do; it's really a career path. It's something you can do, that anyone can do, if you work a lot for it. It's not impossible, you don't have to be a genius,\" she says. \"You can just be a normal person.\" By the time the Vera Rubin Observatory begins operations in 2022, followed by other large telescopes built along the Chilean Andes, we can hope that the number of women astronomers using those facilities will continue to rise. To accomplish this, major steps still need to be taken and enforced to make the astronomy community more inviting and more supportive of women, particularly in the places that host the world's telescopes.

Rubin Observatory: New view of the universe", "date": "2021-04-26", "content": "The next era of our investigation of the cosmos is about to be kick-started by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a ground-based telescope currently under construction on the El Pen\u00f3n peak of Cerro Pach\u00f3n in northern Chile. The observatory is a federal project run by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The new observatory - named in honor of astronomer Vera Rubin - is scheduled to begin operations in October 2023, according to a statement published on the Rubin Observatory website. When it's up and running, Rubin will allow astronomers to consider some of the universe's most pressing mysteries. \"There are four main scientific themes that have guided our design of the observatory,\" Vera C. Rubin director Steven Kahn, an astrophysicist at Stanford University in California, wrote in an email. \"Cataloging all of the small moving objects in the solar system. Mapping the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Investigating many kinds of stellar variability in the sky. And determining the nature of dark matter and dark energy, two of the greatest mysteries of modern physics.\" Kahn said that the Rubin Observatory will also enable other kinds of studies that are independent of these areas. \"We expect the observatory to make many discoveries - things we did not even know existed before,\" Kahn told All About Space. A wider view of the universe: These four investigatory elements will be united under the umbrella of the decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time, according to an article from the Kavli Institute for Particle Physics and Cosmology, a joint operation of Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LSST will build upon previous sky surveys that have formed the fundamental data pillars of astronomy for many years, systematically mapping the universe and providing insights that have shaped our understanding of the cosmos. As impressive as these past surveys and the telescopes that conducted them have been, their view has been limited to a tiny fraction of the sky. This is one of the areas in which the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will really up the ante. Originally named the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in its initial proposal and in a paper posted in May 2008 on the preprint site arXiv.org, the design of the observatory's main instrument - the Simonyi Survey Telescope - has been guided by three key watchwords: width, depth and speed. \"The Rubin Observatory will be very different from all the existing large telescopes ,\" said Kahn. \"Most telescopes are designed to make detailed investigations of individual objects - stars, galaxies and clusters of such objects. Rubin is designed instead to make a deep imaging survey of the sky over the entire Southern Hemisphere.\" The key to this wide-field view is the telescope's unique three-mirror design, which features a 27.6-foot-wide primary mirror. This design boosts what astronomers call the etendue of the system - a quality that is the product of the collecting area of the primary mirror and the field of view of the camera and describes how spread out the light in a system is. \"The Rubin Observatory will have an etendue more than 10 times larger than all previous facilities and any currently planned for development anywhere else in the world,\" said Kahn. \"It is world-unique in that sense.\" A camera like no other: In order to obtain such high etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory team had to combine this unusual three-mirror optical system with the use of a record- breaking piece of kit - the largest digital camera ever created. This SUV-sized camera is also the first in the world to have a 3.2-gigabyte capability, according to a news release published by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in September 2020. Just one image produced by the camera would take over 350 4K TVs to display. The camera will take one 15-second exposure of the sky every 20 seconds, enabling it to capture about 10,000 square degrees of the sky over the course of three nights. This grants the observatory the ability to both track moving objects like asteroids and record the changes in stars and events like supernovas. The movement of objects close to Earth and the rate at which objects like stars change occur over an extreme range of time periods. Fortunately, the observatory can survey the sky on timescales ranging from years down to around 15 seconds. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will also provide unprecedented depth by observing the universe in six different optical bands, with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 1,060 nanometers. That covers ultraviolet light, right through the visible light spectrum to infrared. As a result, the observatory will be able to image some extremely faint objects missed by previous surveys, according to Air & Space magazine. \"Rubin will obtain nearly 1,000 images of every part of the southern sky. By comparing images taken at different times, we can detect everything that moves in the sky and everything that varies in brightness,\" said Kahn. \"By adding together those 1,000 individual images, we can obtain the deepest images of every part of the southern sky.\" How will Vera C. Rubin Observatory handle large amounts of data? Collecting so many highly detailed images presents a major challenge, as it represents a huge amount of data that has to be handled - around 20 terabytes every night. Thus, the Vera C.

Through the LSST, the Rubin Observatory, a joint initiative of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, will collect and process more than 20 terabytes of data each night - and up to 10 petabytes each year for 10 years - and will build detailed composite images of the southern sky. Over its expected decade of observations, astrophysicists estimate the Department of Energy's LSST Camera will detect and capture images of an estimated 30 billion stars, galaxies, stellar clusters and asteroids. Each point in the sky will be visited around 1,000 times over the survey's 10 years, providing researchers with valuable time series data. Scientists plan to use this data to address fundamental questions about our universe, such as the formation of our solar system, the course of near-Earth asteroids, the birth and death of stars, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the universe's murky early years and its ultimate fate, among other things. \"Our goal is to maximize the scientific output and societal impact of Rubin LSST, and these analysis tools will go a huge way toward doing just that,\" said Jeno Sokoloski, director for science at the LSST Corporation. \"They will be freely available to all researchers, students, teachers and members of the general public.\" The Rubin Observatory will produce an unprecedented data set through the LSST.

Researchers from CMU's Department of Physics in the Mellon College of Science, Department of Statistics and Data Science in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center will contribute to this project. Through the LSST, the Rubin Observatory, a joint initiative of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, will collect and process more than 20 terabytes of data each night - and up to 10 petabytes each year for 10 years - and will build detailed composite images of the southern sky. Over its expected decade of observations, astrophysicists estimate the Department of Energy's LSST Camera will detect and capture images of an estimated 30 billion stars, galaxies, stellar clusters and asteroids. Each point in the sky will be visited around 1,000 times over the survey's 10 years, providing researchers with valuable time series data. Scientists plan to use this data to address fundamental questions about our universe, such as the formation of our solar system, the course of near-Earth asteroids, the birth and death of stars, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the universe's murky early years and its ultimate fate, among other things. \"Our goal is to maximize the scientific output and societal impact of Rubin LSST, and these analysis tools will go a huge way toward doing just that,\" said Jeno Sokoloski, director for science at the LSST Corporation. \"They will be freely available to all researchers, students, teachers and members of the general public.\" The Rubin Observatory will produce an unprecedented data set through the LSST. To take advantage of this opportunity, the LSST Corporation created LINCC, whose launch was announced August 9 at the Rubin Observatory Project & Community Workshop. One of LINCC's primary goals is to create new and improved analysis infrastructure that can accommodate the data's scale and complexity that will result in meaningful and useful pipelines of discovery for LSST data. \"Many of the LSST's science objectives share common traits and computational challenges. If we develop our algorithms and analysis frameworks with forethought, we can use them to enable many of the survey's core science objectives,\" said Rachel Mandelbaum, professor of physics and member of the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon. The LINCC analysis platforms are supported by Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt that bets early on exceptional people making the world better. This project is part of Schmidt Futures' work in astrophysics, which aims to accelerate our knowledge about the universe by supporting the development of software and hardware platforms to facilitate research across the field of astronomy. \"Many years ago, the Schmidt family provided one of the first grants to advance the original design of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We believe this telescope is one of the most important and eagerly awaited instruments in astrophysics in this decade. By developing platforms to analyze the astronomical datasets captured by the LSST, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Washington are transforming what is possible in the field of astronomy,\" said Stuart Feldman, chief scientist at Schmidt Futures. \"Tools that utilize the power of cloud computing will allow any researcher to search and analyze data at the scale of the LSST, not just speeding up the rate at which we make discoveries but changing the scientific questions that we can ask,\" said Andrew Connolly, a professor of astronomy, director of the eScience Institute and former director of the Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology Institute at the University of Washington. Connolly and Carnegie Mellon's Mandelbaum will co-lead the project, which will consist of programmers and scientists based at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, who will create platforms using professional software engineering practices and tools. Specifically, they will create a \"cloud-first\" system that also supports high-performance computing systems in partnership with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, and the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab. LSSTC will run programs to engage the LSST Science Collaborations and broader science community in the design, testing and use of the new tools. \"The software funded by this gift will magnify the scientific return on the public investment by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to build and operate Rubin Observatory's revolutionary telescope, camera and data systems,\" said Adam Bolton, director of the Community Science and Data Center at NSF's NOIRLab. CSDC will collaborate with LINCC scientists and engineers to make the LINCC framework accessible to the broader astronomical community. Through this new project, new algorithms and processing pipelines developed at LINCC will be able to be used across fields within astrophysics and cosmology to sift through false signals, filter out noise in the data and flag potentially important objects for follow-up observations. The tools developed by LINCC will support a \"census of our solar system\" that will chart the courses of asteroids; help researchers to understand how the universe changes with time; and build a 3D view of the universe's history. \"The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is very excited to continue to support data-intensive astrophysics research being done by scientists worldwide. The work will set the stage for the forefront of computational infrastructure by providing the community with tools and frameworks to handle the massive amount of data coming off of the next generation of telescopes,\" said Shawn Brown, director of the PSC. Northwestern University and the University of Arizona, in addition to Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, are hub sites for LINCC. The University of Pittsburgh will partner with the Carnegie Mellon hub.

Rubin Observatory", "date": "2021-10-19", "content": "For much of the past decade, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have been designing major optical components for the world's newest telescope, while their industrial partners have fabricated the components. Now, with the September shipment of the last of six optical filters for the telescope's camera to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, the Livermore researchers have finished their work. It is anticipated that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory facility in northern Chile, with its Legacy Survey of Space and Time Camera (LSSTCam), will start imaging the southern sky in 2024. \"We're all very excited,\" said LLNL engineer Vincent Riot, who has been the Rubin LSSTCam manager for the past four years while working at Livermore and at SLAC on special assignment. \"The optical lenses and filters have been a long time in the making,\" he said. \"This project has been under way for about 10 years. Now, we'll soon see the integration of all of the camera's components as part of the telescope's commissioning.\" The six optical filters were fabricated using glass raw material from New York State that was shipped to Thales Space SESO in Aix-en-Provence in southern France. Thales Space SESO shaped and polished the glass into the optical filters between 2016 and 2020. In turn, the optical filters were transported to Westford, Mass.-based Materion, which coated the glass of the six filters. The East Coast company built a special chamber for coating the LSSTCam filters and also built a custom metrology station to measure the filter coatings. Coating work was challenging: Justin Wolfe, an LLNL optical engineer and the LSSTCam optics subsystems manager, noted that two factors made coating the LSSTCam optical filters especially challenging. First, the six LSSTCam filters are some of the largest optical filters ever produced. Second, the filters must have a stringent uniformity within about two percent. \"It's one thing to have uniformity over 2 inches; it's another to have it over 30 inches,\" Wolfe said. \"It is a complex process to get a substrate ready for coating when you have three different vendors, 18 months of preparation and an irreversible coating process if mistakes are made.\" Each filter is about 30 inches (76 centimeters) in diameter and weighs about 90 lbs., ranging in thickness from about \u00bd inch (13 millimeters) to one inch (26 millimeters). The filters are labeled u, g, r, i, z and y; each transmits light from a segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, progressing throughout the entire visible range and moving from the near ultraviolet (u) to the near-infrared (y). The r-band filter, which covers a spectral band near the center of this range, will be one of the filters used most often for the LSSTCam. It also will be particularly useful for testing the camera because standard optical techniques can be used to verify the optical performance of the camera when this filter is in place. \"As optics for large telescope systems are always a challenge, it is very gratifying to complete the work on these filters and all of the camera optical assemblies,\" Wolfe said. \"The team did a great job and we are all very proud to have played a role in delivering these first-of-a-kind optical assemblies. \"Optics and especially optical filters are notorious for causing significant delays in projects like this one. Given unanticipated delays the last couple of years due to the pandemic and other factors, it is a great relief to know that the optics have all been delivered in good shape in time to meet the needs of the project.\" Filters inserted into mechanical mounts: Once Materion finished coating the filters between March and September of this year, they were shipped to LLNL to be placed into Lab-designed mechanical mounts in the National Ignition Facility optical assembly building. \"We have benefitted from NIF's state-of-the-art assembly building that offers a top-notch clean room and skilled technicians who are used to handling very large optics,\" Riot said. In addition to Riot and Wolfe, other Lab employees who worked on the LSSTCam optical lenses and filters are Scott Winters, camera subsystem manager until 2018; Frank Arredondo, assembly technician; Jeremy Huckins, mechanical engineer; Simon Cohen, optical engineer; Brian Bauman, optical designer; Matt Rempel and Angela Tanner, contract administrators; and Kristen Leong, resource analyst. A key feature of the LSSTCam's optical assemblies will be its three lenses, one of which is the world's largest high-performance optical lens ever fabricated, at 5.1 feet (1.57 meters) in diameter. This optical lens was listed in the latest edition of Guinness World Records. The world's largest lens and its two companion lenses (at 1.2 meters and 72 centimeters in diameter) were shipped from LLNL to SLAC for integration into the LSSTCam in 2019. The three lenses were built between 2014 and 2019 by Boulder, Colo.-based Ball Aerospace and its subcontractor, Tucson-based Arizona Optical Systems. SLAC is managing the overall design and fabrication, as well as the subcomponent integration and final assembly of the Rubin Observatory's $168 million, 3,200-megapixel digital camera. In addition to SLAC and LLNL, the team building the camera includes an international collaboration of universities and labs, including the Paris-based Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York state. \"The success of the fabrication of these optical filters and assemblies is a testament to LLNL's world-leading expertise in large optics, built on decades of experience in the construction of the world's largest and most powerful laser systems,\" said physicist Scot Olivier, who helped manage Livermore's involvement in the LSSTCam project for more than a decade. Olivier said without the dedicated and exceptional work of LLNL optical scientists Lynn Seppala and Brian Bauman and LLNL engineers Riot, Winters and Wolfe, the LSSTCam filters and optics, including the world's largest lens, would not be the reality they are today. \"Riot's contributions to LSSTCam also go far beyond the camera optics - as the current overall project manager for the LSSTCam, Riot is a principal figure in the successful development of this major scientific instrument that is poised to revolutionize the field of astronomy,\" Olivier added. Rubin Observatory Director Steven Kahn, a physicist at Stanford University and SLAC, noted that \"LLNL has been a key partner in the development of the Rubin Observatory since the beginning of the project in the early 2000s. The Lab has made major contributions to the overall telescope design, the camera optics and the camera project management.\" Livermore's researchers made essential contributions to the optical design of LSSTCam's lenses and mirrors, the way LSSTCam will survey the sky, how it compensates for temperature and gravity and more. Will observe more galaxies than people on Earth: The 8.4-meter telescope at Rubin Observatory will take digital images of the entire visible southern sky every few nights, revealing unprecedented details of the universe and helping unravel some of its greatest mysteries. During a 10-year time frame, Rubin Observatory will detect about 20 billion galaxies - the first time a telescope will observe more galaxies than there are people on Earth - and will create a time-lapse \"movie\" of the sky. This data will help researchers better understand dark matter and dark energy, which together make up 95 percent of the universe, but whose makeup remains unknown, as well as study the formation of galaxies, track potentially hazardous asteroids and observe exploding stars. The telescope's camera - the size of a small car and weighing more than three tons - will capture full-sky images at such high resolution that it would take 1,500 high-definition television screens to display just one picture. Construction on Rubin Observatory started in 2014 on El Pe\u00f1on, a peak 8,800 feet high along the Cerro Pach\u00f3n ridge in the Andes Mountains, located 220 miles north of Santiago, Chile. Financial support for the Rubin Observatory comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded Rubin Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The DOE-funded effort to build the LSSTCam is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LSSTCam, including the three lenses and six filters designed by LLNL researchers and built by Lab industrial partners, will be shipped from SLAC to the telescope site in Chile in the summer of 2022.", "url": "https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-engineers-deliver-final-optical-components-worlds-newest-telescope-vera-c-rubin"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington to Pioneer Platforms that Harness Astrophysical Data to Unravel the Universe's Mysteries", "date": "2021-08-25", "content": "Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Washington have announced an expansive, multi-year collaboration to create new software platforms to analyze large astronomical datasets generated by the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will be carried out by the Vera C.

The LSST Camera generates a lot of heat-because of its size it produces about ten times more heat than early astronomical cameras. The refrigeration system is needed to maintain the focal plane sensors at their optimal operating temperature, and to remove the heat generated by the associated electronics, without introducing vibrations that would affect image quality. The Camera team has developed two separate systems to achieve this: the \"Cold\" system, which cools the raft electronics, and the \"Cryo\" system, which cools the camera's CCDs. The Cold and Cryo systems were operating together early in 2021, but at that time the Cryo system was operating with temporary (integration and testing) heat exchangers, and the Utility Trunk wasn't yet connected to the Cryostat. There were also some performance issues with the Cold system that needed to be solved. All of this work took place in the intervening months, and in September the Camera team was ready to start the multi-step process necessary to get both the systems running again. The Cold system was started up first, on September 27th, and was soon cooling the raft electronics to a range between -10\u00b0C and +10\u00b0C. The improvements made by the team had resolved previous performance issues, and the system was running smoothly. Next came preparation for the startup of the Cryo system. This involved a number of careful and specific steps, especially since it was the first time running the system with the production heat exchangers. Each of the six circuits of the Cryo system was deliberately turned on, then off, then on again. And with that, the system began to cool the CCDs-ultimately reaching a very chilly -100\u00b0C. Both the Cold and Cryo systems take between 12-18 hours to reach their full cooldown temperatures. Now that both systems are running successfully, the Camera team will begin a full suite of Electro-Optical tests to optimize the performance of the focal plane (which includes the CCDs, readout board electronics, and thermal systems). This will be followed by a complete set of verification tests with nearly-final operating conditions. These tests will involve collecting about six weeks of data (in the form of many, many images), and testing a variety of factors like diffusion, read noise, dark or hot pixels or columns, gain, cross-talk, non-linearity, brighter-fatter, and charge transfer inefficiency.

The LINCC analysis platforms are supported by Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt that bets early on exceptional people making the world better. This project is part of Schmidt Futures' work in astrophysics, which aims to accelerate our knowledge about the universe by supporting the development of software and hardware platforms to facilitate research across the field of astronomy. \"Many years ago, the Schmidt family provided one of the first grants to advance the original design of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We believe this telescope is one of the most important and eagerly awaited instruments in astrophysics in this decade. By developing platforms to analyze the astronomical datasets captured by the LSST, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Washington are transforming what is possible in the field of astronomy,\" said Stuart Feldman, chief scientist at Schmidt Futures. \"Tools that utilize the power of cloud computing will allow any researcher to search and analyze data at the scale of the LSST, not just speeding up the rate at which we make discoveries but changing the scientific questions that we can ask,\" said Andrew Connolly, a professor of astronomy, director of the eScience Institute and former director of the Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology Institute at the University of Washington. Connolly and Carnegie Mellon's Mandelbaum will co-lead the project, which will consist of programmers and scientists based at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, who will create platforms using professional software engineering practices and tools. Specifically, they will create a \"cloud-first\" system that also supports high-performance computing systems in partnership with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, and the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab. LSSTC will run programs to engage the LSST Science Collaborations and broader science community in the design, testing and use of the new tools. \"The software funded by this gift will magnify the scientific return on the public investment by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to build and operate Rubin Observatory's revolutionary telescope, camera and data systems,\" said Adam Bolton, director of the Community Science and Data Center at NSF's NOIRLab. CSDC will collaborate with LINCC scientists and engineers to make the LINCC framework accessible to the broader astronomical community. Through this new project, new algorithms and processing pipelines developed at LINCC will be able to be used across fields within astrophysics and cosmology to sift through false signals, filter out noise in the data and flag potentially important objects for follow-up observations. The tools developed by LINCC will support a \"census of our solar system\" that will chart the courses of asteroids; help researchers to understand how the universe changes with time; and build a 3D view of the universe's history. \"The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is very excited to continue to support data-intensive astrophysics research being done by scientists worldwide. The work will set the stage for the forefront of computational infrastructure by providing the community with tools and frameworks to handle the massive amount of data coming off of the next generation of telescopes,\" said Shawn Brown, director of the PSC. Northwestern University and the University of Arizona, in addition to Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, are hub sites for LINCC. The University of Pittsburgh will partner with the Carnegie Mellon hub.

Rubin Observatory", "date": "2021-10-19", "content": "For much of the past decade, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have been designing major optical components for the world's newest telescope, while their industrial partners have fabricated the components. Now, with the September shipment of the last of six optical filters for the telescope's camera to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, the Livermore researchers have finished their work. It is anticipated that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory facility in northern Chile, with its Legacy Survey of Space and Time Camera (LSSTCam), will start imaging the southern sky in 2024. \"We're all very excited,\" said LLNL engineer Vincent Riot, who has been the Rubin LSSTCam manager for the past four years while working at Livermore and at SLAC on special assignment. \"The optical lenses and filters have been a long time in the making,\" he said. \"This project has been under way for about 10 years. Now, we'll soon see the integration of all of the camera's components as part of the telescope's commissioning.\" The six optical filters were fabricated using glass raw material from New York State that was shipped to Thales Space SESO in Aix-en-Provence in southern France. Thales Space SESO shaped and polished the glass into the optical filters between 2016 and 2020. In turn, the optical filters were transported to Westford, Mass.-based Materion, which coated the glass of the six filters. The East Coast company built a special chamber for coating the LSSTCam filters and also built a custom metrology station to measure the filter coatings. Coating work was challenging: Justin Wolfe, an LLNL optical engineer and the LSSTCam optics subsystems manager, noted that two factors made coating the LSSTCam optical filters especially challenging. First, the six LSSTCam filters are some of the largest optical filters ever produced. Second, the filters must have a stringent uniformity within about two percent. \"It's one thing to have uniformity over 2 inches; it's another to have it over 30 inches,\" Wolfe said. \"It is a complex process to get a substrate ready for coating when you have three different vendors, 18 months of preparation and an irreversible coating process if mistakes are made.\" Each filter is about 30 inches (76 centimeters) in diameter and weighs about 90 lbs., ranging in thickness from about \u00bd inch (13 millimeters) to one inch (26 millimeters). The filters are labeled u, g, r, i, z and y; each transmits light from a segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, progressing throughout the entire visible range and moving from the near ultraviolet (u) to the near-infrared (y). The r-band filter, which covers a spectral band near the center of this range, will be one of the filters used most often for the LSSTCam. It also will be particularly useful for testing the camera because standard optical techniques can be used to verify the optical performance of the camera when this filter is in place. \"As optics for large telescope systems are always a challenge, it is very gratifying to complete the work on these filters and all of the camera optical assemblies,\" Wolfe said. \"The team did a great job and we are all very proud to have played a role in delivering these first-of-a-kind optical assemblies. \"Optics and especially optical filters are notorious for causing significant delays in projects like this one. Given unanticipated delays the last couple of years due to the pandemic and other factors, it is a great relief to know that the optics have all been delivered in good shape in time to meet the needs of the project.\" Filters inserted into mechanical mounts: Once Materion finished coating the filters between March and September of this year, they were shipped to LLNL to be placed into Lab-designed mechanical mounts in the National Ignition Facility optical assembly building. \"We have benefitted from NIF's state-of-the-art assembly building that offers a top-notch clean room and skilled technicians who are used to handling very large optics,\" Riot said. In addition to Riot and Wolfe, other Lab employees who worked on the LSSTCam optical lenses and filters are Scott Winters, camera subsystem manager until 2018; Frank Arredondo, assembly technician; Jeremy Huckins, mechanical engineer; Simon Cohen, optical engineer; Brian Bauman, optical designer; Matt Rempel and Angela Tanner, contract administrators; and Kristen Leong, resource analyst. A key feature of the LSSTCam's optical assemblies will be its three lenses, one of which is the world's largest high-performance optical lens ever fabricated, at 5.1 feet (1.57 meters) in diameter. This optical lens was listed in the latest edition of Guinness World Records. The world's largest lens and its two companion lenses (at 1.2 meters and 72 centimeters in diameter) were shipped from LLNL to SLAC for integration into the LSSTCam in 2019. The three lenses were built between 2014 and 2019 by Boulder, Colo.-based Ball Aerospace and its subcontractor, Tucson-based Arizona Optical Systems. SLAC is managing the overall design and fabrication, as well as the subcomponent integration and final assembly of the Rubin Observatory's $168 million, 3,200-megapixel digital camera. In addition to SLAC and LLNL, the team building the camera includes an international collaboration of universities and labs, including the Paris-based Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York state. \"The success of the fabrication of these optical filters and assemblies is a testament to LLNL's world-leading expertise in large optics, built on decades of experience in the construction of the world's largest and most powerful laser systems,\" said physicist Scot Olivier, who helped manage Livermore's involvement in the LSSTCam project for more than a decade. Olivier said without the dedicated and exceptional work of LLNL optical scientists Lynn Seppala and Brian Bauman and LLNL engineers Riot, Winters and Wolfe, the LSSTCam filters and optics, including the world's largest lens, would not be the reality they are today. \"Riot's contributions to LSSTCam also go far beyond the camera optics - as the current overall project manager for the LSSTCam, Riot is a principal figure in the successful development of this major scientific instrument that is poised to revolutionize the field of astronomy,\" Olivier added. Rubin Observatory Director Steven Kahn, a physicist at Stanford University and SLAC, noted that \"LLNL has been a key partner in the development of the Rubin Observatory since the beginning of the project in the early 2000s. The Lab has made major contributions to the overall telescope design, the camera optics and the camera project management.\" Livermore's researchers made essential contributions to the optical design of LSSTCam's lenses and mirrors, the way LSSTCam will survey the sky, how it compensates for temperature and gravity and more. Will observe more galaxies than people on Earth: The 8.4-meter telescope at Rubin Observatory will take digital images of the entire visible southern sky every few nights, revealing unprecedented details of the universe and helping unravel some of its greatest mysteries. During a 10-year time frame, Rubin Observatory will detect about 20 billion galaxies - the first time a telescope will observe more galaxies than there are people on Earth - and will create a time-lapse \"movie\" of the sky. This data will help researchers better understand dark matter and dark energy, which together make up 95 percent of the universe, but whose makeup remains unknown, as well as study the formation of galaxies, track potentially hazardous asteroids and observe exploding stars. The telescope's camera - the size of a small car and weighing more than three tons - will capture full-sky images at such high resolution that it would take 1,500 high-definition television screens to display just one picture. Construction on Rubin Observatory started in 2014 on El Pe\u00f1on, a peak 8,800 feet high along the Cerro Pach\u00f3n ridge in the Andes Mountains, located 220 miles north of Santiago, Chile. Financial support for the Rubin Observatory comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science and private funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded Rubin Project Office for construction was established as an operating center under management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The DOE-funded effort to build the LSSTCam is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The LSSTCam, including the three lenses and six filters designed by LLNL researchers and built by Lab industrial partners, will be shipped from SLAC to the telescope site in Chile in the summer of 2022.", "url": "https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-engineers-deliver-final-optical-components-worlds-newest-telescope-vera-c-rubin"}, {"title": "Camera Cooldown", "date": "2021-11-12", "content": "The LSST Camera team at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory celebrated a very cold day during the last week of October-not because of the weather, but because both of the systems that keep the LSST Camera cool were running successfully together for the first time since January 2021. The LSST Camera generates a lot of heat-because of its size it produces about ten times more heat than early astronomical cameras. The refrigeration system is needed to maintain the focal plane sensors at their optimal operating temperature, and to remove the heat generated by the associated electronics, without introducing vibrations that would affect image quality. The Camera team has developed two separate systems to achieve this: the \"Cold\" system, which cools the raft electronics, and the \"Cryo\" system, which cools the camera's CCDs. The Cold and Cryo systems were operating together early in 2021, but at that time the Cryo system was operating with temporary (integration and testing) heat exchangers, and the Utility Trunk wasn't yet connected to the Cryostat. There were also some performance issues with the Cold system that needed to be solved. All of this work took place in the intervening months, and in September the Camera team was ready to start the multi-step process necessary to get both the systems running again. The Cold system was started up first, on September 27th, and was soon cooling the raft electronics to a range between -10\u00b0C and +10\u00b0C. The improvements made by the team had resolved previous performance issues, and the system was running smoothly. Next came preparation for the startup of the Cryo system. This involved a number of careful and specific steps, especially since it was the first time running the system with the production heat exchangers. Each of the six circuits of the Cryo system was deliberately turned on, then off, then on again. And with that, the system began to cool the CCDs-ultimately reaching a very chilly -100\u00b0C. Both the Cold and Cryo systems take between 12-18 hours to reach their full cooldown temperatures. Now that both systems are running successfully, the Camera team will begin a full suite of Electro-Optical tests to optimize the performance of the focal plane (which includes the CCDs, readout board electronics, and thermal systems). This will be followed by a complete set of verification tests with nearly-final operating conditions. These tests will involve collecting about six weeks of data (in the form of many, many images), and testing a variety of factors like diffusion, read noise, dark or hot pixels or columns, gain, cross-talk, non-linearity, brighter-fatter, and charge transfer inefficiency.

Rubin Observatory in Chile begins operations. The information it collects will far surpass previous data sets and is expected to yield significant breakthroughs in astrophysics. The first star map can be traced back to the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus around 129 BC. While no record of his map exists today, the work he did marked the start of a long and important tradition. In 1989, the European Space Agency launched the High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, punning on his name. In its three years of operation, it was able to measure with high precision the brightness, position, and motion of more than 110,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. ESA's follow-up mission, Gaia, launched 24 years later, has increased that number to 2 billion, but its limited size means it can only peer so far into the universe. Next year, the new land-based observatory, named after Vera Rubin-a pioneering astrophysicist of the 20th century-will begin operation, and it will have the ability to see much farther. This is because the observatory will be fitted with a large mirror-8.4 meters in diameter-that will help us detect not only objects in our galaxy that are too faint to be seen by Gaia, but also the dim light that reaches us from galaxies as far as billions of light years away. Its large field of view means that it will be able to image the entire sky above it every few days, after which it will start again. And it will keep doing this for 10 years, creating a series of maps that demonstrate the movement of these galaxies in space and time. This data will help us understand more about the dark energy that is causing the universe to expand at an ever greater rate. It will also be used to probe the nature of dark matter. In the 1970s, it was Rubin who provided the first observational evidence that there is far more to the universe than the luminous objects we can see. By mapping the position and motion of stars at the outer edges of galaxies, she showed that the speed at which they spin around their galactic centers was too high for there not to be some unseen extra matter providing the additional gravitational pull necessary to keep them in orbit. In doing so, she proved the existence of the mysterious substance called dark matter. Dark matter accounts for about 85 per cent of all material in the universe-in 2022, the observatory named in Rubin's honor will help us see how this substance affects the formation and evolution of galaxies, and even the shape of the universe itself.

If all goes well, this camera will one day fit into the heart of the future Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. For the last seven years, engineers have been crafting the camera in a clean room at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif. In May 2023, if all goes according to plan, the camera will finally fly to its destination, itself currently under construction in the desert highlands of northern Chile. Building a camera as complex as this requires a good deal of patience, testing, and careful engineering. The road to that flight has been long, and there's still some way to go before the end is in sight. \"We're at the stage where we've got all the camera's mechanisms fully assembled,\" says Hannah Pollek, a staff engineer at SLAC. Any typical camera needs a lens, and this camera is certainly no exception. At 1.57 meters across, this lens is the world's largest, as recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. When it's installed, it will catch light reflected through a triplet of mirrors, built separately. In action, the telescope will point at a parcel of sky, 3.5 degrees across-in other words, seven times the width of the full moon. The camera will take two exposures, back-to-back, approximately 15 seconds each-bracketed by the sweeping of a colossal shutter. Then, the telescope will move along to the next parcel, and so forth, in a mission to survey the southern sky for years on end. Behind the lens sit the detectors, which are fashioned from charge-coupled device sensors, common in astronomy. With the lens cap removed, the detectors are visible as a silver-and-blue grid, the different colors being a consequence of the camera having two different suppliers. Together, they can construct images that are as large as 3.2 gigapixels. To do that repeatedly, those detectors need to be chilled. That's why there's a large bundle of tubing behind the camera. Some of it is for data or power, but most is plumbing for the refrigeration. They help a cryostat cool the detectors to around -100 \u00b0C. Those temperatures eliminate much of the noise that the CCDs might otherwise pick up. The detectors aren't the only part of the camera that need to be kept on ice. The camera's back-end electronics generate some 1,100 watts of heat, and cold liquid is pumped through as a counter. This doesn't need a cryostat, but it has given the camera's engineers headaches. Recently, they've had to swap out the fluid they use, necessitating a complete rework of the plumbing. The engineers are still tinkering with the new system. There are a few components that remain to be installed. For astronomers, key to the camera's operation are the filters that will fit over the lens. There are six of them, each coated to only let through specific wavelengths of light. Built in Massachusetts and Provence, France, and shipped to California, they now sit on the floor of the camera's clean room. When they're installed, five of them will sit in a carousel about the camera-the sixth resting in storage, waiting for its turn to be swapped in. In practice, the mechanism takes about 2 minutes to slot a filter in between the lens and the detectors. The filters are delicate glass, so engineers have been testing the system with dummy metal disks of the same weight. After the filters are installed, along with a few final body panels, engineers will swing the camera down to point it at the floor. They'll test its performance in a darkened environment by shuffling around light sources. If building and testing the camera is one saga, then actually getting it to its final destination is an entirely different ordeal. English-language technical instructions have to be rewritten in Spanish for the benefit of local Chilean technicians. The lenses and other glass parts will have to be removed. The camera will have to be mounted within a shipping container and clamped inside special frames, specifically designed to isolate vibrations and keep the camera stable in forces up to 2 g s. Even that system has been tested in a mockup of its special flight-a chartered Boeing 747 cargo plane from San Francisco to Santiago, a direct flight that typically doesn't exist. \"We really want to avoid extra trucking in the .US.,\" says Margaux Lopez, a staff engineer at SLAC. \"It just makes more sense to put our camera on a chartered plane with all of the rest of the stuff in the clean room. We have an incredible amount of support equipment that also needs to go down.\" If all goes well with the last phase of construction, this camera will soon depart California for Chile and catch its first glimpse of the night sky by 2024.", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-world-s-largest-camera-is-nearly-complete"}, {"title": "The world's first 3.2 gigapixel camera is one step closer to completion", "date": "2022-10-11", "content": "The world's largest camera with a 3,200-megapixel sensor is one step closer to being sent to its new home at the Vera C.

For the last seven years, scientists and engineers have worked to develop and build a camera that will form the heart of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time telescope and hopefully help us to better understand dark matter and dark energy which make up about 95% of the universe. Named after the American astronomer Vera Rubin, the camera of the LSST telescope has now been fitted with 189 science sensors which are placed into specially built, highly precise rafts costing up to $3 million dollars. Each raft is made up of 9 sensors, capable of outputting a 16MP image and four corner rafts enable the telescope to focus and move with the earth's rotation. It took six, long months just to install the sensors which have no more than the width of 5 human hairs between them. One small error during the construction would've meant a big setback and a massive waste of money so precision was key. With the camera's mechanisms now fully assembled and the lens ready to do, the next stage in the process is to finish the setup of this Gigapixel camera.

After almost seven years of construction, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time camera will rightfully bear the title of 'the greatest of its kind', with a lens diameter of around 160cm and a weight of more than 3 tons. Apart from the impressive size, the optical device accommodates a 3200-megapixel imaging surface composed of 189 CCD sensors. The huge camera can spot a small object from around 24km away and is planned to be installed in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the secluded mountains of Chile to continuously monitor the night sky for the next decade. By capturing large areas of the sky on a regular basis, astronomers will study billions of new stars and dust particles on the moon. It is also said the LSST camera will help scientists to shed light on some of the universe's biggest mysteries, including unknown astronomical phenomena such as nebulae, dying stars, dark energy, and dark matter. Entering the Guinness Book of Records: 'Although the camera isn't fully complete yet, all of its mechanical components are now together for the first time -in one photogenic structure,' mentioned the researchers. Once mounted in its last destination, the super camera will have a field of view of 9.6 square degrees, enabling it to capture more than 40 times the area of the full moon in the sky, which occupies approximately 0.2 square degrees. The camera has already been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the largest lens ever constructed, holding roughly the size of a small car. This colossal optical device will make its journey to Chile by a custom-equipped 747 cargo jet that will fly it directly to its destination in spring next year.

If all goes well, this camera will one day fit into the heart of the future Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. For the last seven years, engineers have been crafting the camera in a clean room at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif. In May 2023, if all goes according to plan, the camera will finally fly to its destination, itself currently under construction in the desert highlands of northern Chile. Building a camera as complex as this requires a good deal of patience, testing, and careful engineering. The road to that flight has been long, and there's still some way to go before the end is in sight. \"We're at the stage where we've got all the camera's mechanisms fully assembled,\" says Hannah Pollek, a staff engineer at SLAC. Any typical camera needs a lens, and this camera is certainly no exception. At 1.57 meters across, this lens is the world's largest, as recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records. When it's installed, it will catch light reflected through a triplet of mirrors, built separately. In action, the telescope will point at a parcel of sky, 3.5 degrees across-in other words, seven times the width of the full moon. The camera will take two exposures, back-to-back, approximately 15 seconds each-bracketed by the sweeping of a colossal shutter. Then, the telescope will move along to the next parcel, and so forth, in a mission to survey the southern sky for years on end. Behind the lens sit the detectors, which are fashioned from charge-coupled device sensors, common in astronomy. With the lens cap removed, the detectors are visible as a silver-and-blue grid, the different colors being a consequence of the camera having two different suppliers. Together, they can construct images that are as large as 3.2 gigapixels. To do that repeatedly, those detectors need to be chilled. That's why there's a large bundle of tubing behind the camera. Some of it is for data or power, but most is plumbing for the refrigeration. They help a cryostat cool the detectors to around -100 \u00b0C. Those temperatures eliminate much of the noise that the CCDs might otherwise pick up. The detectors aren't the only part of the camera that need to be kept on ice. The camera's back-end electronics generate some 1,100 watts of heat, and cold liquid is pumped through as a counter. This doesn't need a cryostat, but it has given the camera's engineers headaches. Recently, they've had to swap out the fluid they use, necessitating a complete rework of the plumbing. The engineers are still tinkering with the new system. There are a few components that remain to be installed. For astronomers, key to the camera's operation are the filters that will fit over the lens. There are six of them, each coated to only let through specific wavelengths of light. Built in Massachusetts and Provence, France, and shipped to California, they now sit on the floor of the camera's clean room. When they're installed, five of them will sit in a carousel about the camera-the sixth resting in storage, waiting for its turn to be swapped in. In practice, the mechanism takes about 2 minutes to slot a filter in between the lens and the detectors. The filters are delicate glass, so engineers have been testing the system with dummy metal disks of the same weight. After the filters are installed, along with a few final body panels, engineers will swing the camera down to point it at the floor. They'll test its performance in a darkened environment by shuffling around light sources. If building and testing the camera is one saga, then actually getting it to its final destination is an entirely different ordeal. English-language technical instructions have to be rewritten in Spanish for the benefit of local Chilean technicians. The lenses and other glass parts will have to be removed. The camera will have to be mounted within a shipping container and clamped inside special frames, specifically designed to isolate vibrations and keep the camera stable in forces up to 2 g s. Even that system has been tested in a mockup of its special flight-a chartered Boeing 747 cargo plane from San Francisco to Santiago, a direct flight that typically doesn't exist. \"We really want to avoid extra trucking in the .US.,\" says Margaux Lopez, a staff engineer at SLAC. \"It just makes more sense to put our camera on a chartered plane with all of the rest of the stuff in the clean room. We have an incredible amount of support equipment that also needs to go down.\" If all goes well with the last phase of construction, this camera will soon depart California for Chile and catch its first glimpse of the night sky by 2024.", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-world-s-largest-camera-is-nearly-complete"}, {"title": "The world's first 3.2 gigapixel camera is one step closer to completion", "date": "2022-10-11", "content": "The world's largest camera with a 3,200-megapixel sensor is one step closer to being sent to its new home at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. For the last seven years, scientists and engineers have worked to develop and build a camera that will form the heart of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time telescope and hopefully help us to better understand dark matter and dark energy which make up about 95% of the universe. Named after the American astronomer Vera Rubin, the camera of the LSST telescope has now been fitted with 189 science sensors which are placed into specially built, highly precise rafts costing up to $3 million dollars. Each raft is made up of 9 sensors, capable of outputting a 16MP image and four corner rafts enable the telescope to focus and move with the earth's rotation. It took six, long months just to install the sensors which have no more than the width of 5 human hairs between them. One small error during the construction would've meant a big setback and a massive waste of money so precision was key. With the camera's mechanisms now fully assembled and the lens ready to do, the next stage in the process is to finish the setup of this Gigapixel camera. Once it's ready, it will be shipped to an altitude of 8,700ft at Carron Pach\u00f3n where observation conditions are optimal. \"We're at the stage where we've got all the camera's mechanisms fully assembled,\" says Hannah Pollek, a staff engineer at SLAC. When set up, the telescope will be able to capture a 3.5-degree section of the sky and will take two back-to-back exposures, both roughly 15 seconds long. During its service, it will catalog over 90% of near-Earth objects that are more than 300m wide plus a further 10,000 primitive objects in the Kuiper Belt - a donut-shaped ring of icy objects that acts as a fossil record for the solar system. Data recorded will be sent directly to the National Virtual Observatory ready for astronomers and the public who want to see images from deep space Within the next year, it is hoped the camera will be transported to its new home in Chile but there are some fine tweaks and final tests to be done. 2001: The initial proposal for the LSST telescope was submitted and six years later in 2007, construction of the mirror began thanks to private funds. 2006: The site at El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Cerro Pach\u00f3n mountain was selected to be the location of the telescope due to the number of clear nights it has per year, seasonal weather patterns and the quality of images as seen through the local atmosphere. The telescope will sit at 2,682m and 100km away in the town of La Serena is the LSST Base Facility. 2010: Alongside the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, LSST becomes one of the top- ranked, ground-based projects for studying dark energy and dark matter. 2014: On 1 August, the National Science Foundation authorized $27.5 million of funding for the construction of the telescope. 2015: Construction of the telescope began at Cerro Pach\u00f3n with a ceremonial laying of the first stone. 2017: Around 72% of the camera was complete and the project was on track to stay within budget and on schedule. 2018: With construction underway and the shell of the summit building complete it was time to start installing the inner workings such as a HVAC system. the dome, mirror coating chamber and the telescope mount. Back at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the cryostat has been completed, the lenses ground and 12 of the 21 CCB Sensor rafts had been delivered ready to be fitted. 2020: Work at both the SLAC site and Cerro Pach\u00f3n were suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, work on software still continued and the commissioning camera arrived at the base facility in La Serena. 2021: The final six filters needed for the camera were finished and delivered and by November, the camera had been cooled to its final operating temperature so rigorous testing began. 2022: Now the camera is fully assembled with the lens, sensors, cryostat and utility trunk it is ready to be shipped to its final destination following successful lab tests. There are still specialized filters to install but using the camera's special filter carousel it takes just minutes. 2024: It is hoped that by 2024, the 2.2 gigapixel camera will be assembled and working at the site in Cerro Pach\u00f3n and ready to photograph deep space.", "url": "https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/the-worlds-first-32-gigapixel-camera-is-one-step-closer-to-completion"}, {"title": "to be installed in rubin observatory, world's biggest camera shoots dust on the moon", "date": "2022-12-08", "content": "Meet the biggest camera in the world: The largest digital camera in the world is getting close to completion, being built by a team of researchers from the SLAC laboratory.
