[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Team predicts satellite could locate hundreds of Earth-sized planets", "date": "2010-01-12", "content": "The race to find exoplanets - planets outside our solar system - continues to quicken. Last week NASA researchers announced that the agency's new space telescope, Kepler, has discovered five new exoplanets, expanding the number of known exoplanets to 422, an increase of about 25 percent in the past year alone. A satellite proposed by MIT researchers could accelerate these discoveries and even detect hundreds of Earth-sized planets - a few of which could be natural candidates for life. The MIT team, led by Senior Research Scientist George Ricker of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, is awaiting NASA approval for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which would conduct the first-ever spaceborne survey of transiting planets, or planets that pass in front of their host stars as seen from Earth. By searching a region of the sky 400 times larger than revealed by Kepler's scope, TESS would observe 2.5 million of the closest and brightest stars when it is launched. Ricker's team predicts it would detect between 1,600 and 2,700 planets within two years, including between 100 and 300 small planets. \"Although TESS should find hundreds of small planets, only a handful would be in the 'habitable zone' and would be natural candidates for life,\" said MIT assistant professor of physics Joshua Winn, who is part of Ricker's team. Most of the 422 exoplanets discovered to date by astronomer Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory) are hot Jupiters, giant planets that are likely inhospitable to biological activity. TESS would focus on finding smaller planets similar in size to Earth. Using six wide-angled, high-precision cameras to scan the sky for temporary drops in brightness caused when a planet passes in front of its star, TESS would measure the light obscured by a planet as it transits. TESS would then catalog the light curves caused by these transits so that follow-up work through ground observations and high-resolution spectroscopy can determine the planet's mass, radius and density. Spectroscopic studies with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope of bright exoplanets found by TESS could reveal details about a planet's atmosphere, such as whether water or carbon dioxide exist. Ricker's team disclosed details about TESS in its first comprehensive public presentation at the annual American Astronomical Society conference on Jan. 6 in Washington. A mix of science and guesswork: Winn and fellow MIT professor Sara Seager explained the science behind their estimate that TESS could detect as many as 2,700 planets, including several hundred Earth-sized planets. Estimating how many planets TESS would find is a complicated process that Winn compares to counting how many people in a crowded stadium are waving cigarette lighters at the moment you take off a blindfold. The number would depend on how far away your eyes can detect a flame, as well as how many people are actually waving lighters at that moment. \"The first question is a physics question,\" Winn explained. \"The second question is unanswerable unless you happen to know exactly how many people carry lighters and are likely to wave them around.\" Add to that the fact that the flame from each lighter may have a different brightness, just as stars may differ in brightness and planets may differ in size. These factors had to be taken into account to estimate how many planets TESS might find. To reach their estimate, the scientists made an educated guess about how many of these stars actually have planets orbiting them, based on information already known about giant planets, such as orbital distance and size. \"It's a bit more complicated, but we assume in this case that all planets are equally common, and that the abundance is about the same as the abundance of giant planets,\" Winn said of the several hundred giant exoplanets that have been found to date. The scientists then considered certain properties of the stars and of TESS, such as stellar luminosity and the size of the camera lenses, to estimate how many Earth-like planets will transit their host stars from a distance that TESS could probe. Schneider said that although he hasn't examined the numbers in detail, he believes the estimate and methodology are \"a reasonable order of magnitude\" given his experience with other satellites searching for exoplanets. While the overall estimate is not surprising to the MIT team, it is the prospect of finding 100 to 300 Earth-sized planets that tantalizes astronomers. The TESS project began in 2007 when NASA announced its Small Explorer satellite program to provide funding for science missions using small to mid- sized spacecraft. In June 2008, NASA selected Ricker's team, which includes scientists from MIT, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and NASA- Ames Research Center, to receive $750,000 for an initial feasibility study. A year later, NASA elected not to proceed with TESS, but said the MIT-led group and other teams could submit new proposals later this year. Ricker's team is currently working on implementing modifications to the original proposal. \"We are really making the case for NASA and the astronomy community as a whole to establish that this must be the next big leap that will be made in this field,\" Ricker said. TESS is part of a joint effort between the Kavli Institute, the Department of Physics and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT to study exoplanets. The project also involves scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network.

The proposals outline prospective missions to study Earth's atmosphere, the sun, the Milky Way galaxy, and Earth-like planets around nearby stars. The selections were made from responses to Announcements of Opportunity for Explorer Missions and Explorer Missions of Opportunity released by the agency last November. The proposals were judged to have the best science value and feasible development plans. \"NASA continues to seek opportunities to push the cutting edge of science,\" said Paul Hertz, chief scientist for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. \"Innovative proposals like these will help us better understand our solar system and the universe.\" Five Explorer Mission proposals were selected from 22 submitted in February. Each team will receive $1 million to conduct an 11-month mission concept study. Mission costs are capped at $200 million each, excluding the launch vehicle. In addition, one Explorer Mission proposal was selected for technology development and will receive $600,000. Five Mission of Opportunity proposals were selected from 20 submissions. Each will receive $250,000 to conduct an 11-month implementation concept study. Mission costs are capped at $55 million each. Following the detailed mission concept studies, NASA plans to select up to two of the Explorer Mission proposals and one or more of the five Mission of Opportunity proposals in February 2013. The missions would then proceed toward flight and some could launch by 2016. The selected Explorer Mission proposals are: -Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) Thomas Immel, Principal Investigator (PI), University of California, Berkeley -- The mission would fly instruments to understand the extreme variability in our Earth's ionosphere, which can interfere with communications and geopositioning signals. -Fast INfrared Exoplanet Spectroscopy Survey Explorer (FINESSE) Mark Swain, PI, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. -- This proposal would use a space telescope to survey more than 200 planets around other stars. This would be the first mission dedicated to finding out what comprises exoplanet atmospheres, what conditions or processes are responsible for their composition, and how our solar system fits into the larger family of planets. -Observatory for Heteroscale Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (OHMIC) James Burch, PI, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio -- The mission would use a pair of spacecraft flying in formation to study the processes that provide energy to power space weather storms. These storms create auroras and other electromagnetic activity that can impact orbiting spacecraft operations. -Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) George Ricker, PI, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. -- Using an array of telescopes, TESS would perform an all-sky survey to discover transiting exoplanets, ranging from Earth-sized to gas giants, in orbit around the nearest and brightest stars in the sky. The mission's primary goal would be to identify terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. -Atmosphere-Space Transition Region Explorer (ASTRE) Robert Pfaff Jr., PI, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. -- The mission would study the interaction between Earth's atmosphere and the ionized gases of space. By flying excursions deep into Earth's upper atmosphere, its measurements would improve satellite drag models and show how space-induced currents in electric power grids originate and evolve with time. The selected Explorer Mission of Opportunity proposals are: -Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) Richard Eastes, PI, University of Central Florida, Orlando -- This would involve an imaging instrument that would fly on a commercial communications satellite in geostationary orbit to image Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere. -Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) Keith Gendreau, PI, Goddard -- This mission would place an X ray timing instrument on the International Space Station (ISS) to explore the exotic states of matter within neutron stars and reveal their interior and surface compositions. -Coronal Physics Investigator (CPI) John Kohl, PI, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge -- A solar telescope would be mounted on the ISS to investigate the processes that produce the sun's fast and slow solar wind. -Gal/Xgal U/LDB Spectroscopic/Stratospheric THz Observatory (GUSSTO) Christopher Walker, PI, University of Arizona, Tucson -- This mission would launch a high altitude balloon with a one-meter telescope to provide a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of our Milky Way galaxy and one of our galaxy's companion galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud. -Ion Mass Spectrum Analyzer for SCOPE (IMSA), Lynn Kistler PI, University of New Hampshire, Durham -- This partner mission of opportunity would provide a composition instrument to the Japanese cross-Scale Coupling in the Plasma universE (SCOPE) mission. SCOPE will study fundamental space plasma processes including particle acceleration, magnetic reconnection, and plasma turbulence. The proposal selected for technology development funding is: -The Exoplanetary Circumstellar Environments and Disk Explorer (EXCEDE), Glenn Schneider, PI, University of Arizona, Tucson -- The technology development effort will enable studies of the formation, evolution, and architectures of exoplanetary systems through direct imaging. The Explorer program is the oldest continuous program at NASA. It is designed to provide frequent, low-cost access to space using PI-led space science investigations relevant to the agency's astrophysics and heliophysics programs. Initiated with the Explorer 1 launch in 1958 that discovered Earth's radiation belts and including the Cosmic Background Explorer mission that led to Nobel prizes for their investigators, the Explorer program has launched more than 90 missions.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) are the latest missions chosen under NASA's Astrophysics Explorer Program, which caps costs at $200 million for satellites and $55 million for space station experiments, officials announced Friday (April 5). The TESS spacecraft will use an array of wide-field cameras to scan nearby stars for exoplanets, with a focus on Earth-size worlds in their stars' habitable zones - that just-right range of distances where liquid water could exist. \"TESS will carry out the first space-borne all-sky transit survey, covering 400 times as much sky as any previous mission,\" principal investigator George Ricker of MIT said in a statement. \"It will identify thousands of new planets in the solar neighborhood, with a special focus on planets comparable in size to the Earth.\" As its full name suggests, TESS will detect alien planets by noting when they transit, or cross of the face of, their host stars from the instrument's perspective. NASA's Kepler spacecraft has used this strategy with great success, flagging more than 2,700 potential exoplanets since its March 2009 launch. Unlike the free-flying TESS, NICER will be mounted to the space station. From this perch, it will measure the variability of cosmic X-ray sources, potentially allowing scientists to better understand neutron stars, which are the ultradense collapsed remnants of exploded stars. NICER's principal investigator is Keith Gendreau of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Both missions should advance scientists' understanding of the universe, NASA officials said. \"With these missions we will learn about the most extreme states of matter by studying neutron stars, and we will identify many nearby star systems with rocky planets in the habitable zone for further study by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope,\" John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington, said in a statement. NASA's Explorer program aims to provide frequent, low-cost access to space for investigations relevant to the agency's astrophysics and heliophysics programs.

The space agency announced the mission - to be funded by a $200 million grant to the MIT-led team - this afternoon. TESS team partners include the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and MIT Lincoln Laboratory; NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center; Orbital Sciences Corporation; NASA's Ames Research Center; the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; The Aerospace Corporation; and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The project, led by principal investigator George Ricker, a senior research scientist at MKI, will use an array of wide-field cameras to perform an all- sky survey to discover transiting exoplanets, ranging from Earth-sized planets to gas giants, in orbit around the brightest stars in the sun's neighborhood. An exoplanet is a planet orbiting a star other than the sun; a transiting exoplanet is one that periodically eclipses its host star. \"TESS will carry out the first space-borne all-sky transit survey, covering 400 times as much sky as any previous mission,\" Ricker says. \"It will identify thousands of new planets in the solar neighborhood, with a special focus on planets comparable in size to the Earth.\" TESS relies upon a number of innovations developed by the MIT team over the past seven years. \"For TESS, we were able to devise a special new 'Goldilocks' orbit for the spacecraft - one which is not too close, and not too far, from both the Earth and the moon,\" Ricker says. As a result, every two weeks TESS approaches close enough to the Earth for high data-downlink rates, while remaining above the planet's harmful radiation belts. This special orbit will remain stable for decades, keeping TESS's sensitive cameras in a very stable temperature range. With TESS, it will be possible to study the masses, sizes, densities, orbits and atmospheres of a large cohort of small planets, including a sample of rocky worlds in the habitable zones of their host stars. TESS will provide prime targets for further characterization by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future. TESS project members include Ricker; Josh Winn, an associate professor of physics at MIT; and Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science and physics at MIT. \"We're very excited about TESS because it's the natural next step in exoplanetary science,\" Winn says. \"The selection of TESS has just accelerated our chances of finding life on another planet within the next decade,\" Seager adds. MKI research scientists Roland Vanderspek and Joel Villasenor will serve as deputy principal investigator and payload scientist, respectively. Principal research scientist Alan Levine serves as a co-investigator. Tony Smith of Lincoln Lab will manage the TESS payload effort, Lincoln Lab will develop the optical cameras and custom charge-coupled devices required by the mission. \"NASA's Explorer Program gives us a wonderful opportunity to carry out forefront space science with a relatively small university-based group and on a time scale well-matched to the rapidly evolving field of extrasolar planets,\" says Jackie Hewitt, a professor of physics and director of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"At MIT, TESS has the involvement of faculty and research staff of the Kavli Institute, the Department of Physics, and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, so we will be actively engaging students in this exciting work.\" Previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly picked out giant exoplanets. NASA's Kepler spacecraft has recently uncovered the existence of many smaller exoplanets, but the stars Kepler examines are faint and difficult to study. In contrast, TESS will examine a large number of small planets around the very brightest stars in the sky. \"The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest main-sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets, which will forever be the most favorable targets for detailed investigations,\" Ricker said. The other mission selected today by NASA is the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. It will be mounted on the International Space Station and measure the variability of cosmic X-ray sources, a process called X-ray timing, to explore the exotic states of matter within neutron stars and reveal their interior and surface compositions. NICER's principal investigator is Keith Gendreau of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The MKI group, lead by Ricker, is also a partner in the NICER mission. \"The Explorer Program has a long and stellar history of deploying truly innovative missions to study some of the most exciting questions in space science,\" John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science, said in the space agency's statement today. \"With these missions we will learn about the most extreme states of matter by studying neutron stars and we will identify many nearby star systems with rocky planets in the habitable zone for further study by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.\" The Explorer Program is NASA's oldest continuous program and has launched more than 90 missions.

TESS will utilize four wide angle telescopes to get the job done. The effective size of the detectors onboard is 192 megapixels. TESS is slated for a two year mission. Unlike Kepler, which sits in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, TESS will be in an elliptical path in Low Earth Orbit. TESS will examine approximately 2 million stars brighter than 12th magnitude including 1,000 of the nearest red dwarfs. Not only will TESS expand the growing catalog of exoplanets, but it is also expected to find planets with longer orbital periods. One dilemma with the transit method is that it favors the discovery of planets with short orbital periods, which are much more likely to be seen transiting their host star from a given vantage point in space. TESS will also serve as a logical progression from Kepler to later proposed exoplanet search platforms. TESS will also discover candidates for further scrutiny by as the James Webb Space Telescope to be launched in 2018 and the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrometer based at La Silla Observatory in Chile.

The X-ray telescopes are in a configuration utilizing a set of nested glass shells looking like the layers of an onion. Observing pulsars in the X-ray range of the spectrum will offer scientists tremendous insight into their inner workings and structure. The International Space Station offers a unique vantage point to do this sort of science. Like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, the power requirements of NICER dictate that it cannot be a free-flying satellite. X-Ray astronomy must also be done above the hindering effects of the Earth's atmosphere. NICER will be deployed as an exterior payload aboard an ISS ExPRESS Logistics Carrier. These are unpressurized platforms used for experiments that must be directly exposed to space. Another fascinating project working in tandem with NICER is SEXTANT, the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing And Navigation Technology. This project seeks to test the precision of millisecond pulsars for interplanetary navigation. \"They are extremely reliable celestial clocks and can provide high- precision timing just like the atomic signals supplied through the 26-satellite military operated Global Positioning System ,\" said NASA Goddard scientist Zaven Arzoumanian. The chief difficulty with relying on this system for interplanetary journeys is that the signal gets progressively weaker the farther you travel from the Earth. \"Pulsars, on the other hand, are accessible in virtually every conceivable flight regime, from LEO to interplanetary and deepest space,\" said NICER/SEXTANT principle investigator Keith Gendreau. Both NICER and TESS follow the long legacy of NASA's Astrophysics Explorer Program, which can be traced all the way back to the launch Explorer 1. This was the very first U.S. satellite launched in 1958. Explorer 1 discovered the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth. \"The Explorer Program has a long and stellar history of deploying truly innovative missions to study some of the most exciting questions in space science,\" stated NASA associate administrator for science John Grunsfeld. \"With these missions, we will learn about the most extreme states of matter by studying neutron stars and we will identify many nearby star systems with rocky planets in the habitable zones for further study by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.\" Of course, Grunsfeld is referring to planets orbiting red dwarf stars, which will be targeted by TESS. These are expected have a habitable zone much closer to their primary star than our own Sun. It has even been suggested by MIT scientists that the first exoplanets visited by humans on some far off date might be initially discovered by TESS. The spacecraft may also discover future targets for follow up spectroscopic analysis, the best chance of discovering alien life on an exoplanet in the next 50 years. One can imagine the excitement that a positive detection of a chemical exclusive to life as we know it such as chlorophyll in the spectra of a far of world would generate. More ominously, detection of such synthetic elements as plutonium in the atmosphere of an exoplanet might suggest we found them... but alas, too late. But on a happier note, it'll be exciting times for space exploration to see both projects get underway. Perhaps human explorers will indeed one day visit the worlds discovered by TESS... and use navigation techniques pioneered by SEXTANT to do it!

Both NICER and TESS follow the long legacy of NASA's Astrophysics Explorer Program, which can be traced all the way back to the launch Explorer 1. This was the very first U.S. satellite launched in 1958. Explorer 1 discovered the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth. \"The Explorer Program has a long and stellar history of deploying truly innovative missions to study some of the most exciting questions in space science,\" stated NASA associate administrator for science John Grunsfeld. \"With these missions, we will learn about the most extreme states of matter by studying neutron stars and we will identify many nearby star systems with rocky planets in the habitable zones for further study by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.\" Of course, Grunsfeld is referring to planets orbiting red dwarf stars, which will be targeted by TESS. These are expected have a habitable zone much closer to their primary star than our own Sun. It has even been suggested by MIT scientists that the first exoplanets visited by humans on some far off date might be initially discovered by TESS. The spacecraft may also discover future targets for follow up spectroscopic analysis, the best chance of discovering alien life on an exoplanet in the next 50 years. One can imagine the excitement that a positive detection of a chemical exclusive to life as we know it such as chlorophyll in the spectra of a far of world would generate. More ominously, detection of such synthetic elements as plutonium in the atmosphere of an exoplanet might suggest we found them... but alas, too late. But on a happier note, it'll be exciting times for space exploration to see both projects get underway. Perhaps human explorers will indeed one day visit the worlds discovered by TESS... and use navigation techniques pioneered by SEXTANT to do it!

This marks a significant step for the TESS mission, which would search the entire sky for planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. Designed as the first all-sky survey, TESS would spend two years of an overall three-year funded science mission searching both hemispheres of the sky for nearby exoplanets. \"This is an incredibly exciting time for the search of planets outside our solar system,\" said Mark Sistilli, the TESS program executive from NASA Headquarters, Washington. \"We got the green light to start building what is going to be a spacecraft that could change what we think we know about exoplanets.\" \"During its first two years in orbit, the TESS spacecraft will concentrate its gaze on several hundred thousand specially chosen stars, looking for small dips in their light caused by orbiting planets passing between their host star and us,\" said TESS Principal Investigator George Ricker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. During the third year, ground-based astronomical observatories would continue monitoring exoplanets identified earlier by the TESS spacecraft. TESS is expected to find more than 5,000 exoplanet candidates, including 50 Earth-sized planets. It will also find a wide array of exoplanet types, ranging from small, rocky planets to gas giants. Some of these planets could be the right sizes, and orbit at the correct distances from their stars, to potentially support life. \"The most exciting part of the search for planets outside our solar system is the identification of 'earthlike' planets with rocky surfaces and liquid water as well as temperatures and atmospheric constituents that appear hospitable to life,\" said TESS Project Manager Jeff Volosin at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Although these planets are small and harder to detect from so far away, this is exactly the type of world that the TESS mission will focus on identifying.\" Now that NASA has confirmed TESS, the next step is the Critical Design Review in 2015. This would clear the mission to build the necessary flight hardware for launch. \"After spending the past year building the team and honing the design, it is incredibly exciting to be approved to move forward toward implementing NASA's newest exoplanet hunting mission,\"Volosin said. TESS is designed to complement several other critical missions in the search for life on other planets. Once TESS finds nearby exoplanets to study and determines their sizes, ground-based observatories and other NASA missions, like the James Webb Space Telescope, would make follow-up observations on the most promising candidates to determine their density and other key properties. By figuring out a planet's characteristics, like its atmospheric conditions, scientists could determine whether the targeted planet has a habitable environment. \"TESS should discover thousands of new exoplanets within two hundred light years of Earth,\" Ricker said. \"Most of these will be orbiting bright stars, making them ideal targets for characterization observations with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\" \"The Webb telescope and other teams will focus on understanding the atmospheres and surfaces of these distant worlds, and someday, hopefully identify the first signs of life outside of our solar system,\" Volosin said. TESS will use four cameras to study sections of the sky's north and south hemispheres, looking for exoplanets. The cameras would cover about 90 percent of the sky by the end of the mission. This makes TESS an ideal follow-up to the Kepler mission, which searches for exoplanets in a fixed area of the sky. Because the TESS mission surveys the entire sky, TESS is expected to find exoplanets much closer to Earth, making them easier for further study. In addition, Ricker said TESS would provide precision, full-frame images for more than 20 million bright stars and galaxies. \"This unique new data will comprise a treasure trove for astronomers throughout the world for many decades to come,\" Ricker said.

TESS will operate in a unique orbit that takes it between 108,000 and 373,000 kilometers from the Earth. The orbit is particularly stable, thus minimizing the maneuvers the spacecraft has to perform to maintain it. The spacecraft will have a two-year primary mission, and scientists expect it to detect thousands of exoplanets, including dozens the size of the Earth. Astronomers plan to follow up some of the most promising discoveries with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope.

Scheduled for launch in March 2018, TESS will be NASA's next planet-hunting mission, searching for planets orbiting stars outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. TESS will use four wide-field cameras to scan nearly the entire sky, monitoring the nearest and brightest stars for temporary dips in the light they emit that may indicate a planet passing in front - an event known as a transit. Developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and Lincoln Laboratory, the TESS cameras will use their wide field of view to monitor more than 200,000 stars for transits. \"After a number of years of planning and design, it is incredible to stand in the clean room and see a completed instrument from MIT and a completed spacecraft from Orbital ATK, just waiting to be brought together,\" said TESS Project Manager Jeff Volosin at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Now that TESS has completed this critical review, the mission's cameras and science data processing computer are scheduled to begin installation onto the spacecraft at Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia, over the next several weeks. Once successfully integrated, the spacecraft will spend the rest of the year undergoing rigorous testing to ensure the mission can withstand the harsh environment of space. The spacecraft is scheduled to ship in February to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The mission will survey stars up to 100 times brighter than those observed by NASA's Kepler mission, providing ideal targets for follow-up observations with missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is currently undergoing testing prior to its launch. In fact, TESS will spend its two-year mission observing areas of the sky that overlap with JWST's optimal viewing zone, finding the best exoplanet candidates for more detailed characterization. \"We're excited about the discoveries that TESS will make,\" said TESS Project Scientist Stephen Rinehart from Goddard. \"TESS will find thousands of new exoplanets around bright, nearby stars, and these planets are going to be valuable targets for future study for decades to come.\" Like the Kepler telescope, by design there is a range of focus and image quality across the TESS camera's field of view. Recent measurements revealed the TESS cameras to have slightly reduced focus and image quality near the outer edge of the image when placed in the cold temperatures of space, and better camera focus and image quality towards the center of the image. The difference between the designed and measured focus and image quality will not affect the mission's science goals. \"The TESS instrument, as built, is going to achieve all the Level 1 requirement goals it was built for, and it's going to be able to address a wide range of exciting additional science,\" Rinehart said. The launch of TESS will be NASA's next step in the search for life on other worlds, adding to NASA's growing catalog of planets beyond our solar system. \"Our team is incredibly proud of the role we will play in identifying nearby exoplanets that can be studied in detail by JWST and other powerful telescopes,\" said TESS Principal Investigator George Ricker.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is scheduled to blast off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 16 April. TESS is taking up the mantle of the Kepler Space Telescope, which is expected to run out of fuel by the end of this year. Kepler has found more than 5000 exoplanet candidates so far, and confirmed about half of them. TESS will be able to search 350 times more area of the sky than Kepler can, and is expected to find about 20,000 exoplanets in its first two years alone. It will take about two months after launch to manouevre the satellite into its orbit - about half as far from Earth as the moon - and test its cameras. \"After that, there'll just be a flood of information,\" says the mission's principal investigator, George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eyes on the sky: TESS will use the same transit method Kepler used to find planets. This involves watching a star for dips in its light as a planet passes between the star and the telescope. How often the dips repeat indicates how fast the planet circles its host star, and the amount of light that's blocked tells us the size of the distant world. Rather than looking at distant stars in a small area of sky, like Kepler did, TESS will look at closer stars over 85 per cent of the sky. It is optimised to observe smaller, cooler stars that emit mostly red light. \"90 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way emit in those red wavelengths, and they seem to have more planets than stars like the sun, especially smaller Earth-sized planets,\" says Ricker. \"Nature's really saying, 'look here, look here' and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Because those stars are so nearby and rich with planets, they will be ideal targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2020. JWST will examine exoplanet atmospheres for signatures of life, which is only possible when their stars are relatively close.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166357-nasa-has-launched-a-new-space-telescope-to-hunt-for-exoplanets/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Satellite Launches to Seek Out New Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "NASA has a new planet hunter in the heavens. The agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, rising off the pad atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51 p.m. EDT and deploying into Earth orbit 49 minutes later. TESS will hunt for alien worlds around stars in the sun's neighborhood - planets that other missions can then study in detail. And the spacecraft will be incredibly prolific, if all goes according to plan. \"TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\" TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday. \"It's going to more than double the number that have been seen and detected by Kepler,\" Ricker added, referring to NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has spotted 2,650 confirmed exoplanets to date -about 70 percent of all the worlds known beyond our solar system. And the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth less than 9 minutes after liftoff today, touching down softly on a robotic SpaceX \"drone ship\" stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has now pulled off two dozen such landings during Falcon 9 launches - part of the company's push to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets and spacecraft, a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said will revolutionize spaceflight. SpaceX has re-flown 11 of these first stages to date, but the tally didn't increase today: This Falcon 9 was brand-new. Today's launch was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was delayed by two days to give SpaceX time to investigate a potential issue with the rocket's guidance, navigation and control systems. Looking for nearby worlds: Like Kepler, TESS will find alien planets using the \"transit method,\" noting the tiny brightness dips these worlds cause when they cross their host stars' faces. But there are some big differences between the missions. During its prime mission from 2009 through 2013, Kepler stared continuously at a single patch of sky, monitoring about 150,000 stars simultaneously. Most of these stars are far from the sun - from several hundred light-years to 1,000 light-years or more. But TESS will conduct a broad sky survey during its two-year prime mission, covering about 85 percent of the sky. The satellite will focus on the nearest and brightest stars, using its four cameras to look for worlds that may be close enough to be studied in depth by other instruments. Indeed, TESS will rely on a variety of other telescopes on the ground and in space to help determine which of its \"candidates\" are bona fide planets, and to characterize the newly discovered worlds. One such partner will be NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. James Webb should be able to probe the atmospheres of at least a few TESS planets for oxygen, methane and other possible signs of life, NASA officials have said. \"TESS is the first step toward finding habitable planets,\" mission project scientist Stephen Rinehart, who's based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said during Sunday's briefing. The mission will be a big step toward exploring such worlds up-close as well, team members said. In 50 to 100 years, humanity will probably be capable of launching tiny robotic spacecraft to explore a number of nearby exoplanets, perhaps using technology like that being developed by the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot project, MIT's Ricker said. \"We are putting together a catalog of the very best targets for those probes,\" he said. \"That's one thing that I think will be a lasting legacy of TESS.\" A unique orbit: TESS also differs from Kepler in its orbit. Whereas Kepler loops around the sun, TESS will zoom around our planet, on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day orbit that no spacecraft has ever occupied before. This orbit will take TESS as close to Earth as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles. The satellite will be able to beam its onboard data down to Earth quickly and efficiently during the close approaches. The orbit is also incredibly stable and features relatively low radiation exposure and low thermal variation, said Robert Lockwood, TESS spacecraft program manager at Orbital ATK, the Virginia-based company that built the satellite for NASA. \"It really is a Goldilocks orbit,\" Lockwood told Space.com. But TESS won't get there for a while. After a number of engine firings and one dramatic maneuver - a close flyby of the moon on May 17 - TESS will arrive in its final orbit in mid-June, if all goes according to plan. The science campaign will start shortly thereafter. The TESS mission is capped at $200 million, not including launch costs.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40320-spacex-nasa-tess-exoplanet-satellite-launch.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS launches", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "TESS, NASA's planet-hunting satellite, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:51 p.m. ET Wednesday. It had a 30-second launch window. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday, but rescheduled to conduct additional Guidance Navigation and Control analysis, the agency said. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was able to land on the droneship minutes later. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is NASA's next mission in the search for exoplanets, or those that are outside our solar system, and TESS will be on the lookout for planets that could support life. After launch, TESS will use its fuel to reach orbit around the Earth, with a gravity assist from the moon. That will enable it to have a long-term mission beyond its two-year objective. \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance,\" Joel Villasenor, instrument scientist for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\" Over 60 days, TESS will establish an orbit around Earth and test its instruments. Then, the two-year mission will officially begin. What will TESS do? TESS will pick up the search for exoplanets as the Kepler Space Telescope runs out of fuel. Kepler, which has discovered more than 4,500 potential planets and confirmed exoplanets, launched in 2009. After mechanical failure in 2013, it entered a new phase of campaigns to survey other areas of the sky for exoplanets, called the K2 mission. This enabled researchers to discover even more exoplanets, understand the evolution of stars and gain insight about supernovae and black holes. Soon, Kepler's mission will end, and it will be abandoned in space, orbiting the sun and never getting any closer to Earth than the moon. TESS will survey an area 400 times larger than what Kepler observed. This includes 200,000 of the brightest nearby stars. Over the course of two years, the four wide-field cameras on board will stare at different sectors of the sky for days at a time. TESS will begin by looking at the Southern Hemisphere sky for the first year and move to the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. It can accomplish this lofty goal by dividing the sky into 13 sections and looking at each one for 27 days before moving on to the next. The satellite itself is not much bigger than a refrigerator. The cameras sit on top, beneath a cone that will protect them from radiation. TESS will look for exoplanets using the transit method, observing slight dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. Bright stars allow for easier followup study through ground- and space-based telescopes. \"TESS is helping us explore our place in the universe,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"Until 20 years ago, we didn't know of any planets beyond our own solar system. We've expanded our understanding of our place in the universe, and TESS will help us keep expanding.\" The cameras can detect light across a broad range of wavelengths, up to infrared. This means TESS will be able to look at many nearby small, cool red dwarf stars and see whether there are exoplanets around them. Red dwarf stars have been found to host exoplanets within the habitable zone, and many astronomers believe they could be the best candidate for hosting Earth-size exoplanets with conditions suitable for life. What makes TESS different? NASA expects TESS to allow for the cataloging of more than 1,500 exoplanets, but it has the potential to find thousands. Of these, officials anticipate, 300 will be Earth-size exoplanets or double-Earth-size Super Earths. Those could be the best candidates for supporting life outside our solar system. Like Earth, they are small, rocky and usually within the habitable zone of their stars, meaning liquid water can exist on their surface. \"One of the biggest questions in exoplanet exploration is: If an astronomer finds a planet in a star's habitable zone, will it be interesting from a biologist's point of view?\" said George Ricker, TESS principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in Cambridge. \"We expect TESS will discover a number of planets whose atmospheric compositions, which hold potential clues to the presence of life, could be precisely measured by future observers.\" These exoplanets will be studied so that NASA can determine which are the best targets for missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. That telescope, whose launch was just pushed back to 2020, would be able to characterize the details and atmospheres of exoplanets in ways scientists have not been able to do. \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" Hertz said. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" NASA believes that TESS will build on Kepler's momentum and open the study of exoplanets in unprecedented ways. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come. It's the beginning of a new era of exoplanet research. I don't think we know everything TESS is going to accomplish. To me, the most exciting part of any mission is the unexpected result, the one that nobody saw coming.\" The search for life: More than a decade ago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists first proposed the idea of a mission like TESS. They have been instrumental in bringing the mission from idea to reality and will continue to be involved once the mission launches. A science team devoted to TESS at MIT aims to measure the masses of at least 50 small exoplanets that have a radius of less than four times that of Earth - an ideal dimension that could suggest habitability. \"Mass is a defining planetary characteristic,\" said Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science at MIT. \"If you just know that a planet is twice the size of Earth, it could be a lot of things: a rocky world with a thin atmosphere, or what we call a 'mini-Neptune' - a rocky world with a giant gas envelope, where it would be a huge greenhouse blanket, and there would be no life on the surface. So mass and size together give us an average planet density, which tells us a huge amount about what the planet is.\" TESS Objects of Interest, an MIT-led effort, will look for objects in TESS' data that could be exoplanets and catalog them. \"TESS is kind of like a scout,\" said Natalia Guerrero, deputy manager of TESS Objects of Interest. \"We're on this scenic tour of the whole sky, and in some ways we have no idea what we will see. It's like we're making a treasure map: Here are all these cool things. Now, go after them.\" TESS data will also be publicly available so that anyone can download them and search for exoplanets. A data pipeline has been established so that TESS can fulfill its mission. It will collect about 27 gigabytes per day - that's about 6,500 song files - and send data back every two weeks. NASA's Pleiades, an incredibly powerful supercomputer, will be able to keep up and process the 10 billion pixels over three to five days. The more people that look through the data, the better, the scientists believe. This could be how planets that support life are found. \"There's no science that will tell us life is out there right now, except that small rocky planets appear to be incredibly common,\" Seager said. \"They appear to be everywhere we look. So it's got to be there somewhere.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/nasa-tess-satellite-launch/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft TESS is now on its mission to search for new worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "The latest of NASA 's incredible planet-hunting space telescopes was launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Known as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to its friends, this exciting new mission promises to provide the next great leap forward in our understanding of our place in the universe. Over the next two years, TESS is likely to find thousands of new exoplanets - planets orbiting distant stars - and will help to reveal the degree to which our Solar system is unique in the cosmos. In doing so, it will build on the fascinating results of the past few decades, cementing our place in the \"Exoplanet Era\". The Kepler revolution: At the end of 2008, the year before NASA's earlier planet-hunting telescope Kepler launched, about 300 exoplanets had been discovered. Today, the number is an order of magnitude larger: more than 3,700. Kepler discovered more than 2,300 exoplanets, with a further 2,200 or so \"candidate\" planets still awaiting followup. This incredible haul is the result of the spacecraft staring, unblinking, at the night sky, watching for the tiny flickers that reveal planets passing between us and their host stars. In essence, Kepler carried out the first great census of the Exoplanet Era. It taught us that planets are ubiquitous - a standard and natural byproduct of the formation of stars. But the vast majority of the stars around which Kepler found planets were very faint and very distant. This makes it a great challenge for observers on the ground to follow up on those discoveries and learn more about the planets the spacecraft revealed. Along comes TESS: Whereas Kepler focused for four years on just one small patch of the northern sky, TESS will target stars across almost the whole night sky. In doing so, it will survey some of the brightest stars in the sky - making the task of following up on its myriad discoveries far easier. TESS consists of four cameras, configured to give it an observation sector that covers an area slightly larger than a 90\u00b0 arc on the sky. TESS will watch that observation sector continually for just over 27 days, never blinking. The spacecraft will then pivot around, swinging to target its next sector. In this manner, over the course of a year, the spacecraft will target almost the entirety of one hemisphere of the sky. After that, it will flip over, and spend the next year watching the other hemisphere. For the first year TESS will be gazing to the south, scouring skies that are best seen from the southern hemisphere, finding planets orbiting the very stars you see when you step outside and look up at the night sky, right here in Australia. Many stars, many planets? TESS's main mission will involve it observing a total of 200,000 stars, measuring their brightness every single minute that they fall within its field of view. To do this, it will process images before sending them back to Earth, extracting just the data on those stars to send back to the Earth. TESS will also provide full-frame images every half an hour, yielding a trove of tens of millions of objects observed. Put all that together, and the expected planet yield should be enormous. Based on the statistics of planet discoveries to date, it is likely that TESS will find at least a couple of thousand potential planets around its main target stars, while those in the full-frame images might yield tens of thousands of additional candidates. These numbers are incredible, and TESS will revolutionise our understanding of our place in the universe. But such amazing results bring with them a unique problem - and one that we, in Australia, are ideally placed to help solve. Too many planets, too little time: The reason that only half of the Kepler mission's candidate planets have been confirmed is that doing so requires extensive follow-up work from the ground. Astronomers have to rule out other effects that could cause the behaviour seen in the potential planet's host star before we can be certain that we're really seeing evidence of a new planet. Most of the stars observed by Kepler are simply too faint for that kind of work to be carried out from the ground - except, perhaps, with the largest telescopes on the planet. Getting time on those telescopes is challenging - all of the world's other astronomers covet that time too, for their own projects. Quite simply, it is a case of too many planets, too little time. The problem is only going to get worse with TESS. When the first few planets were found, in the late 20th century, the discoveries came in a trickle. Those discoveries were easy for scientists to drink in and follow up, and all was good. With Kepler, the discovery rate went through the roof. From a trickle, it was like someone had turned on a tap - a continual stream of new potential planets to study. If Kepler was a tap, then TESS will be a fire hose, and there are simply too few telescopes available for us to use to study all of the planets TESS finds at once. That is where the Australian connection comes to the fore - in the form of a dedicated new facility being built on the Darling Downs, in southeast Queensland. The Australian connection - MINERVA-Australis: At the University of Southern Queensland, we are constructing MINERVA- Australis - a collection of six telescopes dedicated to nothing but the search for and characterisation of planets around other stars. When TESS turns on the fire hose, finding thousands of planets in the southern sky, we stand ready. Every clear night, we will be observing those stars that TESS suggests could host planets, doing our utmost to confirm whether those planets really exist. Once we confirm TESS's new discoveries, we will be able to use our facility to study the newly found worlds in more detail. By observing the planet's transits, we can measure its physical size, by seeing how much of the light from its host the planet blocks. In addition, we will be examining the light we receive from the star, measuring the telltale wobbles caused by the planet as it orbits its host. With those measurements, we will be able to calculate the planet's mass. Put the mass and the size together, and we can really begin to work out the planet's true nature. Is it rocky, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn? Over the coming years, TESS will push the Exoplanet Era through its next great revolution - finding thousands or tens of thousands of new exoplanets. Here in southeast Queensland, we will be at the forefront of that journey of discovery, helping to reveal the true nature of those alien worlds. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what we'll learn next!

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee, the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth, nearly 170,000 miles in altitude. The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system, and only nudged the satellite's perigee, or orbital low point, slightly higher than the spacecraft's initial perigee less than 200 miles above Earth. TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff. The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit. The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months, with the first major step planned for early Wednesday, when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch, according to Robert Lockwood, TESS program manager at Orbital ATK, which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA. Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments, while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed. The first of three planned \"perigee burns\" Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17, passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth. Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS's second and third orbits for fine-tuning, or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned. Since TESS's launch last week, ground controllers at Orbital ATK's headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, have completed communications system tests, computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy. In concert with preparations for the mission's first major engine burn, engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS's four imaging cameras late Wednesday, followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later, Lockwood said. TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras, each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky. TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars, which are smaller and cooler than the sun, and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Also called red dwarfs, the stars that are TESS's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems. George Ricker, who leads the TESS science team at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said the exoplanet surveyor is a \"finder scope\" for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories. \"TESS is a survey machine, and it's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up, and among that category are these small rocky planets, transiting small red dwarf stars,\" said Sara Seager, deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT. Ricker said he expects TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth. Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS, he said. TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler observatory, which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets. But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect, and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky. The switch-on of TESS's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed. The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June. By June 17, TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt, Lockwood said. TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon's, ranging between 67,000 miles and 233,000 miles from Earth. In that orbit, TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days, about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth. The moon's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon's orbit, pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth, then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet. Thanks to the moon, TESS's \"just right\" orbit is gravitationally stable, requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations. TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years, assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust, Ricker said. \"The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS,\" Ricker said before the launch. \"This is a type of orbit that's normally unstable. If you aren't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit, you're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years. There's a delicate balance that's involved in staying in this orbit, and there's a lot of effort that's gone into it. \"But if you actually manage to do this, this orbit is actually stable for decades. There's no station-keeping required. You don't have to have thrusters or anything ... to maintain the orbit. So it's a very elegant solution to this problem.\" The mission's unique orbit also has other advantages. It stays well above Earth's radiation belts, which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors, but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA's Deep Space Network at high rates. After more than 300 hours of continuous, uninterrupted science observations, TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee, radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second, a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions. TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky, then will switch to the northern sky in 2019. For Lockwood, who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years, last week's launch was a turning point. \"For a while, it didn't really feel real,\" Lockwood said. \"I'd been there so close to the hardware for so long, and then all of a sudden it's not here. \"There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling, it's no longer around. It's like a kid leaving to go to college, and I've had four kids leave to go to college.\" The launch was \"terrific,\" Lockwood said, timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission's orbital dance with the moon. TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite's deployment over the Indian Ocean. The satellite's two power- generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity. \"A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket, but I stayed inside watching on the console,\" Lockwood said. \"For me, it's when it comes off the top of the rocket, and I'm waiting for telemetry to come, and I'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy. That's when I'm sighing a big sigh of relief.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/04/23/after-terrific-launch-tess-nears-first-major-orbit-raising-burn/"}, {"title": "NASA's new planet-hunting satellite begins climb into science orbit", "date": "2018-04-25", "content": "Looping back near Earth for the first time since its launch one week ago, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters early Wednesday to begin boosting its orbit toward the moon for a May 17 gravity assist maneuver that will help catapult the probe into its unique science orbit. The spacecraft's thrusters ignited early Thursday to raise the farthest point of TESS's orbit around Earth closer to the moon. The maneuver was timed as TESS reached its first perigee - the low point of its elongated orbit - since launching April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9 launcher deposited TESS into an elliptical orbit stretching around 170,000 miles from Earth. TESS briefly fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached the farthest point, or apogee, of its initial orbit to raise its perigee from around 150 miles to around 1,400 miles. The next maneuver accomplished early Wednesday positioned TESS's apogee at approximately 220,000 miles, more than 90 percent of the distance of the moon's orbit, according to tracking data published by the U.S. military. Wednesday's thruster firing was the second of six maneuvers planned to send TESS into its final operational orbit. Another burn next week will be timed to occur as TESS reaches its new apogee, followed by two additional perigee maneuvers that will fine-tune the satellite's trajectory and set up for a flyby of the moon May 17.

TESS will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. With the help of a gravitational assist from the Moon, the spacecraft will settle into a 13.7-day orbit around Earth. Sixty days after launch, and following tests of its instruments, the satellite will begin its initial two-year mission. Four wide-field cameras will give TESS a field-of-view that covers 85 percent of our entire sky. Within this vast visual perspective, the sky has been divided into 26 sectors that TESS will observe one by one. The first year of observations will map the 13 sectors encompassing the southern sky, and the second year will map the 13 sectors of the northern sky. The spacecraft will be looking for a phenomenon known as a transit, where a planet passes in front of its star, causing a periodic and regular dip in the star's brightness. NASA's Kepler spacecraft used the same method to spot more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets, most of them orbiting faint stars 300 to 3,000 light-years away \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" TESS will concentrate on stars less than 300 light-years away and 30 to 100 times brighter than Kepler's targets.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is scheduled to blast off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 16 April. TESS is taking up the mantle of the Kepler Space Telescope, which is expected to run out of fuel by the end of this year. Kepler has found more than 5000 exoplanet candidates so far, and confirmed about half of them. TESS will be able to search 350 times more area of the sky than Kepler can, and is expected to find about 20,000 exoplanets in its first two years alone. It will take about two months after launch to manouevre the satellite into its orbit - about half as far from Earth as the moon - and test its cameras. \"After that, there'll just be a flood of information,\" says the mission's principal investigator, George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eyes on the sky: TESS will use the same transit method Kepler used to find planets. This involves watching a star for dips in its light as a planet passes between the star and the telescope. How often the dips repeat indicates how fast the planet circles its host star, and the amount of light that's blocked tells us the size of the distant world. Rather than looking at distant stars in a small area of sky, like Kepler did, TESS will look at closer stars over 85 per cent of the sky. It is optimised to observe smaller, cooler stars that emit mostly red light. \"90 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way emit in those red wavelengths, and they seem to have more planets than stars like the sun, especially smaller Earth-sized planets,\" says Ricker. \"Nature's really saying, 'look here, look here' and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Because those stars are so nearby and rich with planets, they will be ideal targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2020. JWST will examine exoplanet atmospheres for signatures of life, which is only possible when their stars are relatively close.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166357-nasa-has-launched-a-new-space-telescope-to-hunt-for-exoplanets/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Satellite Launches to Seek Out New Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "NASA has a new planet hunter in the heavens. The agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, rising off the pad atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51 p.m. EDT and deploying into Earth orbit 49 minutes later. TESS will hunt for alien worlds around stars in the sun's neighborhood - planets that other missions can then study in detail. And the spacecraft will be incredibly prolific, if all goes according to plan. \"TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\" TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday. \"It's going to more than double the number that have been seen and detected by Kepler,\" Ricker added, referring to NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has spotted 2,650 confirmed exoplanets to date -about 70 percent of all the worlds known beyond our solar system. And the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth less than 9 minutes after liftoff today, touching down softly on a robotic SpaceX \"drone ship\" stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has now pulled off two dozen such landings during Falcon 9 launches - part of the company's push to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets and spacecraft, a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said will revolutionize spaceflight. SpaceX has re-flown 11 of these first stages to date, but the tally didn't increase today: This Falcon 9 was brand-new. Today's launch was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was delayed by two days to give SpaceX time to investigate a potential issue with the rocket's guidance, navigation and control systems. Looking for nearby worlds: Like Kepler, TESS will find alien planets using the \"transit method,\" noting the tiny brightness dips these worlds cause when they cross their host stars' faces. But there are some big differences between the missions. During its prime mission from 2009 through 2013, Kepler stared continuously at a single patch of sky, monitoring about 150,000 stars simultaneously. Most of these stars are far from the sun - from several hundred light-years to 1,000 light-years or more. But TESS will conduct a broad sky survey during its two-year prime mission, covering about 85 percent of the sky. The satellite will focus on the nearest and brightest stars, using its four cameras to look for worlds that may be close enough to be studied in depth by other instruments. Indeed, TESS will rely on a variety of other telescopes on the ground and in space to help determine which of its \"candidates\" are bona fide planets, and to characterize the newly discovered worlds. One such partner will be NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. James Webb should be able to probe the atmospheres of at least a few TESS planets for oxygen, methane and other possible signs of life, NASA officials have said. \"TESS is the first step toward finding habitable planets,\" mission project scientist Stephen Rinehart, who's based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said during Sunday's briefing. The mission will be a big step toward exploring such worlds up-close as well, team members said. In 50 to 100 years, humanity will probably be capable of launching tiny robotic spacecraft to explore a number of nearby exoplanets, perhaps using technology like that being developed by the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot project, MIT's Ricker said. \"We are putting together a catalog of the very best targets for those probes,\" he said. \"That's one thing that I think will be a lasting legacy of TESS.\" A unique orbit: TESS also differs from Kepler in its orbit. Whereas Kepler loops around the sun, TESS will zoom around our planet, on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day orbit that no spacecraft has ever occupied before. This orbit will take TESS as close to Earth as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles. The satellite will be able to beam its onboard data down to Earth quickly and efficiently during the close approaches. The orbit is also incredibly stable and features relatively low radiation exposure and low thermal variation, said Robert Lockwood, TESS spacecraft program manager at Orbital ATK, the Virginia-based company that built the satellite for NASA. \"It really is a Goldilocks orbit,\" Lockwood told Space.com. But TESS won't get there for a while. After a number of engine firings and one dramatic maneuver - a close flyby of the moon on May 17 - TESS will arrive in its final orbit in mid-June, if all goes according to plan. The science campaign will start shortly thereafter. The TESS mission is capped at $200 million, not including launch costs.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40320-spacex-nasa-tess-exoplanet-satellite-launch.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS launches", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "TESS, NASA's planet-hunting satellite, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:51 p.m. ET Wednesday. It had a 30-second launch window. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday, but rescheduled to conduct additional Guidance Navigation and Control analysis, the agency said. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was able to land on the droneship minutes later. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is NASA's next mission in the search for exoplanets, or those that are outside our solar system, and TESS will be on the lookout for planets that could support life. After launch, TESS will use its fuel to reach orbit around the Earth, with a gravity assist from the moon. That will enable it to have a long-term mission beyond its two-year objective. \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance,\" Joel Villasenor, instrument scientist for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\" Over 60 days, TESS will establish an orbit around Earth and test its instruments. Then, the two-year mission will officially begin. What will TESS do? TESS will pick up the search for exoplanets as the Kepler Space Telescope runs out of fuel. Kepler, which has discovered more than 4,500 potential planets and confirmed exoplanets, launched in 2009. After mechanical failure in 2013, it entered a new phase of campaigns to survey other areas of the sky for exoplanets, called the K2 mission. This enabled researchers to discover even more exoplanets, understand the evolution of stars and gain insight about supernovae and black holes. Soon, Kepler's mission will end, and it will be abandoned in space, orbiting the sun and never getting any closer to Earth than the moon. TESS will survey an area 400 times larger than what Kepler observed. This includes 200,000 of the brightest nearby stars. Over the course of two years, the four wide-field cameras on board will stare at different sectors of the sky for days at a time. TESS will begin by looking at the Southern Hemisphere sky for the first year and move to the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. It can accomplish this lofty goal by dividing the sky into 13 sections and looking at each one for 27 days before moving on to the next. The satellite itself is not much bigger than a refrigerator. The cameras sit on top, beneath a cone that will protect them from radiation. TESS will look for exoplanets using the transit method, observing slight dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. Bright stars allow for easier followup study through ground- and space-based telescopes. \"TESS is helping us explore our place in the universe,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"Until 20 years ago, we didn't know of any planets beyond our own solar system. We've expanded our understanding of our place in the universe, and TESS will help us keep expanding.\" The cameras can detect light across a broad range of wavelengths, up to infrared. This means TESS will be able to look at many nearby small, cool red dwarf stars and see whether there are exoplanets around them. Red dwarf stars have been found to host exoplanets within the habitable zone, and many astronomers believe they could be the best candidate for hosting Earth-size exoplanets with conditions suitable for life. What makes TESS different? NASA expects TESS to allow for the cataloging of more than 1,500 exoplanets, but it has the potential to find thousands. Of these, officials anticipate, 300 will be Earth-size exoplanets or double-Earth-size Super Earths. Those could be the best candidates for supporting life outside our solar system. Like Earth, they are small, rocky and usually within the habitable zone of their stars, meaning liquid water can exist on their surface. \"One of the biggest questions in exoplanet exploration is: If an astronomer finds a planet in a star's habitable zone, will it be interesting from a biologist's point of view?\" said George Ricker, TESS principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in Cambridge. \"We expect TESS will discover a number of planets whose atmospheric compositions, which hold potential clues to the presence of life, could be precisely measured by future observers.\" These exoplanets will be studied so that NASA can determine which are the best targets for missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. That telescope, whose launch was just pushed back to 2020, would be able to characterize the details and atmospheres of exoplanets in ways scientists have not been able to do. \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" Hertz said. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" NASA believes that TESS will build on Kepler's momentum and open the study of exoplanets in unprecedented ways. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come. It's the beginning of a new era of exoplanet research. I don't think we know everything TESS is going to accomplish. To me, the most exciting part of any mission is the unexpected result, the one that nobody saw coming.\" The search for life: More than a decade ago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists first proposed the idea of a mission like TESS. They have been instrumental in bringing the mission from idea to reality and will continue to be involved once the mission launches. A science team devoted to TESS at MIT aims to measure the masses of at least 50 small exoplanets that have a radius of less than four times that of Earth - an ideal dimension that could suggest habitability. \"Mass is a defining planetary characteristic,\" said Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science at MIT. \"If you just know that a planet is twice the size of Earth, it could be a lot of things: a rocky world with a thin atmosphere, or what we call a 'mini-Neptune' - a rocky world with a giant gas envelope, where it would be a huge greenhouse blanket, and there would be no life on the surface. So mass and size together give us an average planet density, which tells us a huge amount about what the planet is.\" TESS Objects of Interest, an MIT-led effort, will look for objects in TESS' data that could be exoplanets and catalog them. \"TESS is kind of like a scout,\" said Natalia Guerrero, deputy manager of TESS Objects of Interest. \"We're on this scenic tour of the whole sky, and in some ways we have no idea what we will see. It's like we're making a treasure map: Here are all these cool things. Now, go after them.\" TESS data will also be publicly available so that anyone can download them and search for exoplanets. A data pipeline has been established so that TESS can fulfill its mission. It will collect about 27 gigabytes per day - that's about 6,500 song files - and send data back every two weeks. NASA's Pleiades, an incredibly powerful supercomputer, will be able to keep up and process the 10 billion pixels over three to five days. The more people that look through the data, the better, the scientists believe. This could be how planets that support life are found. \"There's no science that will tell us life is out there right now, except that small rocky planets appear to be incredibly common,\" Seager said. \"They appear to be everywhere we look. So it's got to be there somewhere.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/nasa-tess-satellite-launch/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft TESS is now on its mission to search for new worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "The latest of NASA 's incredible planet-hunting space telescopes was launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Known as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to its friends, this exciting new mission promises to provide the next great leap forward in our understanding of our place in the universe. Over the next two years, TESS is likely to find thousands of new exoplanets - planets orbiting distant stars - and will help to reveal the degree to which our Solar system is unique in the cosmos. In doing so, it will build on the fascinating results of the past few decades, cementing our place in the \"Exoplanet Era\". The Kepler revolution: At the end of 2008, the year before NASA's earlier planet-hunting telescope Kepler launched, about 300 exoplanets had been discovered. Today, the number is an order of magnitude larger: more than 3,700. Kepler discovered more than 2,300 exoplanets, with a further 2,200 or so \"candidate\" planets still awaiting followup. This incredible haul is the result of the spacecraft staring, unblinking, at the night sky, watching for the tiny flickers that reveal planets passing between us and their host stars. In essence, Kepler carried out the first great census of the Exoplanet Era. It taught us that planets are ubiquitous - a standard and natural byproduct of the formation of stars. But the vast majority of the stars around which Kepler found planets were very faint and very distant. This makes it a great challenge for observers on the ground to follow up on those discoveries and learn more about the planets the spacecraft revealed. Along comes TESS: Whereas Kepler focused for four years on just one small patch of the northern sky, TESS will target stars across almost the whole night sky. In doing so, it will survey some of the brightest stars in the sky - making the task of following up on its myriad discoveries far easier. TESS consists of four cameras, configured to give it an observation sector that covers an area slightly larger than a 90\u00b0 arc on the sky. TESS will watch that observation sector continually for just over 27 days, never blinking. The spacecraft will then pivot around, swinging to target its next sector. In this manner, over the course of a year, the spacecraft will target almost the entirety of one hemisphere of the sky. After that, it will flip over, and spend the next year watching the other hemisphere. For the first year TESS will be gazing to the south, scouring skies that are best seen from the southern hemisphere, finding planets orbiting the very stars you see when you step outside and look up at the night sky, right here in Australia. Many stars, many planets? TESS's main mission will involve it observing a total of 200,000 stars, measuring their brightness every single minute that they fall within its field of view. To do this, it will process images before sending them back to Earth, extracting just the data on those stars to send back to the Earth. TESS will also provide full-frame images every half an hour, yielding a trove of tens of millions of objects observed. Put all that together, and the expected planet yield should be enormous. Based on the statistics of planet discoveries to date, it is likely that TESS will find at least a couple of thousand potential planets around its main target stars, while those in the full-frame images might yield tens of thousands of additional candidates. These numbers are incredible, and TESS will revolutionise our understanding of our place in the universe. But such amazing results bring with them a unique problem - and one that we, in Australia, are ideally placed to help solve. Too many planets, too little time: The reason that only half of the Kepler mission's candidate planets have been confirmed is that doing so requires extensive follow-up work from the ground. Astronomers have to rule out other effects that could cause the behaviour seen in the potential planet's host star before we can be certain that we're really seeing evidence of a new planet. Most of the stars observed by Kepler are simply too faint for that kind of work to be carried out from the ground - except, perhaps, with the largest telescopes on the planet. Getting time on those telescopes is challenging - all of the world's other astronomers covet that time too, for their own projects. Quite simply, it is a case of too many planets, too little time. The problem is only going to get worse with TESS. When the first few planets were found, in the late 20th century, the discoveries came in a trickle. Those discoveries were easy for scientists to drink in and follow up, and all was good. With Kepler, the discovery rate went through the roof. From a trickle, it was like someone had turned on a tap - a continual stream of new potential planets to study. If Kepler was a tap, then TESS will be a fire hose, and there are simply too few telescopes available for us to use to study all of the planets TESS finds at once. That is where the Australian connection comes to the fore - in the form of a dedicated new facility being built on the Darling Downs, in southeast Queensland. The Australian connection - MINERVA-Australis: At the University of Southern Queensland, we are constructing MINERVA- Australis - a collection of six telescopes dedicated to nothing but the search for and characterisation of planets around other stars. When TESS turns on the fire hose, finding thousands of planets in the southern sky, we stand ready. Every clear night, we will be observing those stars that TESS suggests could host planets, doing our utmost to confirm whether those planets really exist. Once we confirm TESS's new discoveries, we will be able to use our facility to study the newly found worlds in more detail. By observing the planet's transits, we can measure its physical size, by seeing how much of the light from its host the planet blocks. In addition, we will be examining the light we receive from the star, measuring the telltale wobbles caused by the planet as it orbits its host. With those measurements, we will be able to calculate the planet's mass. Put the mass and the size together, and we can really begin to work out the planet's true nature. Is it rocky, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn? Over the coming years, TESS will push the Exoplanet Era through its next great revolution - finding thousands or tens of thousands of new exoplanets. Here in southeast Queensland, we will be at the forefront of that journey of discovery, helping to reveal the true nature of those alien worlds. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what we'll learn next!

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee, the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth, nearly 170,000 miles in altitude. The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system, and only nudged the satellite's perigee, or orbital low point, slightly higher than the spacecraft's initial perigee less than 200 miles above Earth. TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff. The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit. The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months, with the first major step planned for early Wednesday, when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch, according to Robert Lockwood, TESS program manager at Orbital ATK, which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA. Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments, while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed. The first of three planned \"perigee burns\" Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17, passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth. Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS's second and third orbits for fine-tuning, or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned. Since TESS's launch last week, ground controllers at Orbital ATK's headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, have completed communications system tests, computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy. In concert with preparations for the mission's first major engine burn, engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS's four imaging cameras late Wednesday, followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later, Lockwood said. TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras, each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky. TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars, which are smaller and cooler than the sun, and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Also called red dwarfs, the stars that are TESS's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems. George Ricker, who leads the TESS science team at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said the exoplanet surveyor is a \"finder scope\" for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories. \"TESS is a survey machine, and it's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up, and among that category are these small rocky planets, transiting small red dwarf stars,\" said Sara Seager, deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT. Ricker said he expects TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth. Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS, he said. TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler observatory, which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets. But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect, and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky. The switch-on of TESS's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed. The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June. By June 17, TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt, Lockwood said. TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon's, ranging between 67,000 miles and 233,000 miles from Earth. In that orbit, TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days, about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth. The moon's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon's orbit, pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth, then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet. Thanks to the moon, TESS's \"just right\" orbit is gravitationally stable, requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations. TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years, assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust, Ricker said. \"The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS,\" Ricker said before the launch. \"This is a type of orbit that's normally unstable. If you aren't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit, you're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years. There's a delicate balance that's involved in staying in this orbit, and there's a lot of effort that's gone into it. \"But if you actually manage to do this, this orbit is actually stable for decades. There's no station-keeping required. You don't have to have thrusters or anything ... to maintain the orbit. So it's a very elegant solution to this problem.\" The mission's unique orbit also has other advantages. It stays well above Earth's radiation belts, which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors, but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA's Deep Space Network at high rates. After more than 300 hours of continuous, uninterrupted science observations, TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee, radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second, a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions. TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky, then will switch to the northern sky in 2019. For Lockwood, who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years, last week's launch was a turning point. \"For a while, it didn't really feel real,\" Lockwood said. \"I'd been there so close to the hardware for so long, and then all of a sudden it's not here. \"There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling, it's no longer around. It's like a kid leaving to go to college, and I've had four kids leave to go to college.\" The launch was \"terrific,\" Lockwood said, timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission's orbital dance with the moon. TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite's deployment over the Indian Ocean. The satellite's two power- generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity. \"A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket, but I stayed inside watching on the console,\" Lockwood said. \"For me, it's when it comes off the top of the rocket, and I'm waiting for telemetry to come, and I'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy. That's when I'm sighing a big sigh of relief.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/04/23/after-terrific-launch-tess-nears-first-major-orbit-raising-burn/"}, {"title": "NASA's new planet-hunting satellite begins climb into science orbit", "date": "2018-04-25", "content": "Looping back near Earth for the first time since its launch one week ago, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters early Wednesday to begin boosting its orbit toward the moon for a May 17 gravity assist maneuver that will help catapult the probe into its unique science orbit. The spacecraft's thrusters ignited early Thursday to raise the farthest point of TESS's orbit around Earth closer to the moon. The maneuver was timed as TESS reached its first perigee - the low point of its elongated orbit - since launching April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9 launcher deposited TESS into an elliptical orbit stretching around 170,000 miles from Earth. TESS briefly fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached the farthest point, or apogee, of its initial orbit to raise its perigee from around 150 miles to around 1,400 miles. The next maneuver accomplished early Wednesday positioned TESS's apogee at approximately 220,000 miles, more than 90 percent of the distance of the moon's orbit, according to tracking data published by the U.S. military. Wednesday's thruster firing was the second of six maneuvers planned to send TESS into its final operational orbit. Another burn next week will be timed to occur as TESS reaches its new apogee, followed by two additional perigee maneuvers that will fine-tune the satellite's trajectory and set up for a flyby of the moon May 17. The lunar flyby next month - targeting a distance of around 5,000 miles from the moon - will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond lunar distance, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June.

Since the launch April 18, ground controllers at Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia, which built the spacecraft, have switched on key components on the satellite, including reaction wheels and star trackers used to keep TESS properly pointed in space. On Wednesday, engineers sent commands to turn on the satellite's Ka-band transmitter, which routes signals through a high-gain antenna needed to beam full-frame images back to Earth from TESS's four 16.8-megapixel science cameras. Controllers planned to begin activating the cameras as soon as Thursday, beginning several weeks of calibrations and checkouts to make sure the MIT- built imagers are ready science observations. Each of the four cameras are fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky.

The spacecraft passed about 5,000 miles from the Moon, which provided a gravity assist that helped TESS sail toward its final working orbit. As part of camera commissioning, the science team snapped a two-second test exposure using one of the four TESS cameras. The image, centered on the southern constellation Centaurus, reveals more than 200,000 stars. The edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the right upper corner and the bright star Beta Centauri is visible at the lower left edge. TESS is expected to cover more than 400 times as much sky as shown in this image with its four cameras during its initial two-year search for exoplanets. A science-quality image, also referred to as a \"first light\" image, is expected to be released in June. TESS will undergo one final thruster burn on May 30 to enter its science orbit around Earth. This highly elliptical orbit will maximize the amount of sky the spacecraft can image, allowing it to continuously monitor large swaths of the sky. TESS is expected to begin science operations in mid-June after reaching this orbit and completing camera calibrations. Launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 18, TESS is the next step in NASA's search for planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. The mission will observe nearly the entire sky to monitor nearby, bright stars in search of transits - periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of the star.

The two-second test exposure from one of the four cameras on TESS captures more than 200,000 stars, according to NASA. As Smithsonian.com reported last month, TESS left Earth in April to hunt exoplanets, which it does using what's known as the transit method. This means that TESS' instruments watch great regions of the sky for dips in starlight-a sign that an orbiting planet has crossed the star's face. TESS will focus its sights on stars 300 light years or closer, scanning about 85 percent of the sky over the course of two years. It was estimated that TESS will catalogue 500,000 stars and spot thousands of potential exoplanets. At its center, the image captures the southern constellation Centaurus, which includes the closest active galaxy to Earth known as Centaurus A that lies 11 million light years away. TESS captured the shot on May 17 after successfully completing a flyby of the moon, passing as close as 5,000 miles. That flyby helped push the craft on its way to its final working orbit, the agency says. What's amazing is that this test image isn't even the best quality we're going to get.

For final launch preparations, the spacecraft will be fueled and encapsulated within the payload fairing of its SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. TESS will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. With the help of a gravitational assist from the Moon, the spacecraft will settle into a 13.7-day orbit around Earth. Sixty days after launch, and following tests of its instruments, the satellite will begin its initial two-year mission. Four wide-field cameras will give TESS a field-of-view that covers 85 percent of our entire sky. Within this vast visual perspective, the sky has been divided into 26 sectors that TESS will observe one by one. The first year of observations will map the 13 sectors encompassing the southern sky, and the second year will map the 13 sectors of the northern sky. The spacecraft will be looking for a phenomenon known as a transit, where a planet passes in front of its star, causing a periodic and regular dip in the star's brightness. NASA's Kepler spacecraft used the same method to spot more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets, most of them orbiting faint stars 300 to 3,000 light-years away \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" TESS will concentrate on stars less than 300 light-years away and 30 to 100 times brighter than Kepler's targets. The brightness of these target stars will allow researchers to use spectroscopy, the study of the absorption and emission of light, to determine a planet's mass, density and atmospheric composition. Water, and other key molecules, in its atmosphere can give us hints about a planets' capacity to harbor life. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which manages the mission. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is scheduled to blast off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 16 April. TESS is taking up the mantle of the Kepler Space Telescope, which is expected to run out of fuel by the end of this year. Kepler has found more than 5000 exoplanet candidates so far, and confirmed about half of them. TESS will be able to search 350 times more area of the sky than Kepler can, and is expected to find about 20,000 exoplanets in its first two years alone. It will take about two months after launch to manouevre the satellite into its orbit - about half as far from Earth as the moon - and test its cameras. \"After that, there'll just be a flood of information,\" says the mission's principal investigator, George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eyes on the sky: TESS will use the same transit method Kepler used to find planets. This involves watching a star for dips in its light as a planet passes between the star and the telescope. How often the dips repeat indicates how fast the planet circles its host star, and the amount of light that's blocked tells us the size of the distant world. Rather than looking at distant stars in a small area of sky, like Kepler did, TESS will look at closer stars over 85 per cent of the sky. It is optimised to observe smaller, cooler stars that emit mostly red light. \"90 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way emit in those red wavelengths, and they seem to have more planets than stars like the sun, especially smaller Earth-sized planets,\" says Ricker. \"Nature's really saying, 'look here, look here' and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Because those stars are so nearby and rich with planets, they will be ideal targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2020. JWST will examine exoplanet atmospheres for signatures of life, which is only possible when their stars are relatively close.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166357-nasa-has-launched-a-new-space-telescope-to-hunt-for-exoplanets/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Satellite Launches to Seek Out New Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "NASA has a new planet hunter in the heavens. The agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, rising off the pad atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51 p.m. EDT and deploying into Earth orbit 49 minutes later. TESS will hunt for alien worlds around stars in the sun's neighborhood - planets that other missions can then study in detail. And the spacecraft will be incredibly prolific, if all goes according to plan. \"TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\" TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday. \"It's going to more than double the number that have been seen and detected by Kepler,\" Ricker added, referring to NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has spotted 2,650 confirmed exoplanets to date -about 70 percent of all the worlds known beyond our solar system. And the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth less than 9 minutes after liftoff today, touching down softly on a robotic SpaceX \"drone ship\" stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has now pulled off two dozen such landings during Falcon 9 launches - part of the company's push to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets and spacecraft, a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said will revolutionize spaceflight. SpaceX has re-flown 11 of these first stages to date, but the tally didn't increase today: This Falcon 9 was brand-new. Today's launch was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was delayed by two days to give SpaceX time to investigate a potential issue with the rocket's guidance, navigation and control systems. Looking for nearby worlds: Like Kepler, TESS will find alien planets using the \"transit method,\" noting the tiny brightness dips these worlds cause when they cross their host stars' faces. But there are some big differences between the missions. During its prime mission from 2009 through 2013, Kepler stared continuously at a single patch of sky, monitoring about 150,000 stars simultaneously. Most of these stars are far from the sun - from several hundred light-years to 1,000 light-years or more. But TESS will conduct a broad sky survey during its two-year prime mission, covering about 85 percent of the sky. The satellite will focus on the nearest and brightest stars, using its four cameras to look for worlds that may be close enough to be studied in depth by other instruments. Indeed, TESS will rely on a variety of other telescopes on the ground and in space to help determine which of its \"candidates\" are bona fide planets, and to characterize the newly discovered worlds. One such partner will be NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. James Webb should be able to probe the atmospheres of at least a few TESS planets for oxygen, methane and other possible signs of life, NASA officials have said. \"TESS is the first step toward finding habitable planets,\" mission project scientist Stephen Rinehart, who's based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said during Sunday's briefing. The mission will be a big step toward exploring such worlds up-close as well, team members said. In 50 to 100 years, humanity will probably be capable of launching tiny robotic spacecraft to explore a number of nearby exoplanets, perhaps using technology like that being developed by the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot project, MIT's Ricker said. \"We are putting together a catalog of the very best targets for those probes,\" he said. \"That's one thing that I think will be a lasting legacy of TESS.\" A unique orbit: TESS also differs from Kepler in its orbit. Whereas Kepler loops around the sun, TESS will zoom around our planet, on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day orbit that no spacecraft has ever occupied before. This orbit will take TESS as close to Earth as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles. The satellite will be able to beam its onboard data down to Earth quickly and efficiently during the close approaches. The orbit is also incredibly stable and features relatively low radiation exposure and low thermal variation, said Robert Lockwood, TESS spacecraft program manager at Orbital ATK, the Virginia-based company that built the satellite for NASA. \"It really is a Goldilocks orbit,\" Lockwood told Space.com. But TESS won't get there for a while. After a number of engine firings and one dramatic maneuver - a close flyby of the moon on May 17 - TESS will arrive in its final orbit in mid-June, if all goes according to plan. The science campaign will start shortly thereafter. The TESS mission is capped at $200 million, not including launch costs.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40320-spacex-nasa-tess-exoplanet-satellite-launch.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS launches", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "TESS, NASA's planet-hunting satellite, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:51 p.m. ET Wednesday. It had a 30-second launch window. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday, but rescheduled to conduct additional Guidance Navigation and Control analysis, the agency said. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was able to land on the droneship minutes later. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is NASA's next mission in the search for exoplanets, or those that are outside our solar system, and TESS will be on the lookout for planets that could support life. After launch, TESS will use its fuel to reach orbit around the Earth, with a gravity assist from the moon. That will enable it to have a long-term mission beyond its two-year objective. \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance,\" Joel Villasenor, instrument scientist for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\" Over 60 days, TESS will establish an orbit around Earth and test its instruments. Then, the two-year mission will officially begin. What will TESS do? TESS will pick up the search for exoplanets as the Kepler Space Telescope runs out of fuel. Kepler, which has discovered more than 4,500 potential planets and confirmed exoplanets, launched in 2009. After mechanical failure in 2013, it entered a new phase of campaigns to survey other areas of the sky for exoplanets, called the K2 mission. This enabled researchers to discover even more exoplanets, understand the evolution of stars and gain insight about supernovae and black holes. Soon, Kepler's mission will end, and it will be abandoned in space, orbiting the sun and never getting any closer to Earth than the moon. TESS will survey an area 400 times larger than what Kepler observed. This includes 200,000 of the brightest nearby stars. Over the course of two years, the four wide-field cameras on board will stare at different sectors of the sky for days at a time. TESS will begin by looking at the Southern Hemisphere sky for the first year and move to the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. It can accomplish this lofty goal by dividing the sky into 13 sections and looking at each one for 27 days before moving on to the next. The satellite itself is not much bigger than a refrigerator. The cameras sit on top, beneath a cone that will protect them from radiation. TESS will look for exoplanets using the transit method, observing slight dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. Bright stars allow for easier followup study through ground- and space-based telescopes. \"TESS is helping us explore our place in the universe,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"Until 20 years ago, we didn't know of any planets beyond our own solar system. We've expanded our understanding of our place in the universe, and TESS will help us keep expanding.\" The cameras can detect light across a broad range of wavelengths, up to infrared. This means TESS will be able to look at many nearby small, cool red dwarf stars and see whether there are exoplanets around them. Red dwarf stars have been found to host exoplanets within the habitable zone, and many astronomers believe they could be the best candidate for hosting Earth-size exoplanets with conditions suitable for life. What makes TESS different? NASA expects TESS to allow for the cataloging of more than 1,500 exoplanets, but it has the potential to find thousands. Of these, officials anticipate, 300 will be Earth-size exoplanets or double-Earth-size Super Earths. Those could be the best candidates for supporting life outside our solar system. Like Earth, they are small, rocky and usually within the habitable zone of their stars, meaning liquid water can exist on their surface. \"One of the biggest questions in exoplanet exploration is: If an astronomer finds a planet in a star's habitable zone, will it be interesting from a biologist's point of view?\" said George Ricker, TESS principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in Cambridge. \"We expect TESS will discover a number of planets whose atmospheric compositions, which hold potential clues to the presence of life, could be precisely measured by future observers.\" These exoplanets will be studied so that NASA can determine which are the best targets for missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. That telescope, whose launch was just pushed back to 2020, would be able to characterize the details and atmospheres of exoplanets in ways scientists have not been able to do. \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" Hertz said. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" NASA believes that TESS will build on Kepler's momentum and open the study of exoplanets in unprecedented ways. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come. It's the beginning of a new era of exoplanet research. I don't think we know everything TESS is going to accomplish. To me, the most exciting part of any mission is the unexpected result, the one that nobody saw coming.\" The search for life: More than a decade ago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists first proposed the idea of a mission like TESS. They have been instrumental in bringing the mission from idea to reality and will continue to be involved once the mission launches. A science team devoted to TESS at MIT aims to measure the masses of at least 50 small exoplanets that have a radius of less than four times that of Earth - an ideal dimension that could suggest habitability. \"Mass is a defining planetary characteristic,\" said Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science at MIT. \"If you just know that a planet is twice the size of Earth, it could be a lot of things: a rocky world with a thin atmosphere, or what we call a 'mini-Neptune' - a rocky world with a giant gas envelope, where it would be a huge greenhouse blanket, and there would be no life on the surface. So mass and size together give us an average planet density, which tells us a huge amount about what the planet is.\" TESS Objects of Interest, an MIT-led effort, will look for objects in TESS' data that could be exoplanets and catalog them. \"TESS is kind of like a scout,\" said Natalia Guerrero, deputy manager of TESS Objects of Interest. \"We're on this scenic tour of the whole sky, and in some ways we have no idea what we will see. It's like we're making a treasure map: Here are all these cool things. Now, go after them.\" TESS data will also be publicly available so that anyone can download them and search for exoplanets. A data pipeline has been established so that TESS can fulfill its mission. It will collect about 27 gigabytes per day - that's about 6,500 song files - and send data back every two weeks. NASA's Pleiades, an incredibly powerful supercomputer, will be able to keep up and process the 10 billion pixels over three to five days. The more people that look through the data, the better, the scientists believe. This could be how planets that support life are found. \"There's no science that will tell us life is out there right now, except that small rocky planets appear to be incredibly common,\" Seager said. \"They appear to be everywhere we look. So it's got to be there somewhere.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/nasa-tess-satellite-launch/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft TESS is now on its mission to search for new worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "The latest of NASA 's incredible planet-hunting space telescopes was launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Known as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to its friends, this exciting new mission promises to provide the next great leap forward in our understanding of our place in the universe. Over the next two years, TESS is likely to find thousands of new exoplanets - planets orbiting distant stars - and will help to reveal the degree to which our Solar system is unique in the cosmos. In doing so, it will build on the fascinating results of the past few decades, cementing our place in the \"Exoplanet Era\". The Kepler revolution: At the end of 2008, the year before NASA's earlier planet-hunting telescope Kepler launched, about 300 exoplanets had been discovered. Today, the number is an order of magnitude larger: more than 3,700. Kepler discovered more than 2,300 exoplanets, with a further 2,200 or so \"candidate\" planets still awaiting followup. This incredible haul is the result of the spacecraft staring, unblinking, at the night sky, watching for the tiny flickers that reveal planets passing between us and their host stars. In essence, Kepler carried out the first great census of the Exoplanet Era. It taught us that planets are ubiquitous - a standard and natural byproduct of the formation of stars. But the vast majority of the stars around which Kepler found planets were very faint and very distant. This makes it a great challenge for observers on the ground to follow up on those discoveries and learn more about the planets the spacecraft revealed. Along comes TESS: Whereas Kepler focused for four years on just one small patch of the northern sky, TESS will target stars across almost the whole night sky. In doing so, it will survey some of the brightest stars in the sky - making the task of following up on its myriad discoveries far easier. TESS consists of four cameras, configured to give it an observation sector that covers an area slightly larger than a 90\u00b0 arc on the sky. TESS will watch that observation sector continually for just over 27 days, never blinking. The spacecraft will then pivot around, swinging to target its next sector. In this manner, over the course of a year, the spacecraft will target almost the entirety of one hemisphere of the sky. After that, it will flip over, and spend the next year watching the other hemisphere. For the first year TESS will be gazing to the south, scouring skies that are best seen from the southern hemisphere, finding planets orbiting the very stars you see when you step outside and look up at the night sky, right here in Australia. Many stars, many planets? TESS's main mission will involve it observing a total of 200,000 stars, measuring their brightness every single minute that they fall within its field of view. To do this, it will process images before sending them back to Earth, extracting just the data on those stars to send back to the Earth. TESS will also provide full-frame images every half an hour, yielding a trove of tens of millions of objects observed. Put all that together, and the expected planet yield should be enormous. Based on the statistics of planet discoveries to date, it is likely that TESS will find at least a couple of thousand potential planets around its main target stars, while those in the full-frame images might yield tens of thousands of additional candidates. These numbers are incredible, and TESS will revolutionise our understanding of our place in the universe. But such amazing results bring with them a unique problem - and one that we, in Australia, are ideally placed to help solve. Too many planets, too little time: The reason that only half of the Kepler mission's candidate planets have been confirmed is that doing so requires extensive follow-up work from the ground. Astronomers have to rule out other effects that could cause the behaviour seen in the potential planet's host star before we can be certain that we're really seeing evidence of a new planet. Most of the stars observed by Kepler are simply too faint for that kind of work to be carried out from the ground - except, perhaps, with the largest telescopes on the planet. Getting time on those telescopes is challenging - all of the world's other astronomers covet that time too, for their own projects. Quite simply, it is a case of too many planets, too little time. The problem is only going to get worse with TESS. When the first few planets were found, in the late 20th century, the discoveries came in a trickle. Those discoveries were easy for scientists to drink in and follow up, and all was good. With Kepler, the discovery rate went through the roof. From a trickle, it was like someone had turned on a tap - a continual stream of new potential planets to study. If Kepler was a tap, then TESS will be a fire hose, and there are simply too few telescopes available for us to use to study all of the planets TESS finds at once. That is where the Australian connection comes to the fore - in the form of a dedicated new facility being built on the Darling Downs, in southeast Queensland. The Australian connection - MINERVA-Australis: At the University of Southern Queensland, we are constructing MINERVA- Australis - a collection of six telescopes dedicated to nothing but the search for and characterisation of planets around other stars. When TESS turns on the fire hose, finding thousands of planets in the southern sky, we stand ready. Every clear night, we will be observing those stars that TESS suggests could host planets, doing our utmost to confirm whether those planets really exist. Once we confirm TESS's new discoveries, we will be able to use our facility to study the newly found worlds in more detail. By observing the planet's transits, we can measure its physical size, by seeing how much of the light from its host the planet blocks. In addition, we will be examining the light we receive from the star, measuring the telltale wobbles caused by the planet as it orbits its host. With those measurements, we will be able to calculate the planet's mass. Put the mass and the size together, and we can really begin to work out the planet's true nature. Is it rocky, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn? Over the coming years, TESS will push the Exoplanet Era through its next great revolution - finding thousands or tens of thousands of new exoplanets. Here in southeast Queensland, we will be at the forefront of that journey of discovery, helping to reveal the true nature of those alien worlds. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what we'll learn next!

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee, the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth, nearly 170,000 miles in altitude. The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system, and only nudged the satellite's perigee, or orbital low point, slightly higher than the spacecraft's initial perigee less than 200 miles above Earth. TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff. The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit. The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months, with the first major step planned for early Wednesday, when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch, according to Robert Lockwood, TESS program manager at Orbital ATK, which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA. Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments, while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed. The first of three planned \"perigee burns\" Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17, passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth. Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS's second and third orbits for fine-tuning, or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned. Since TESS's launch last week, ground controllers at Orbital ATK's headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, have completed communications system tests, computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy. In concert with preparations for the mission's first major engine burn, engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS's four imaging cameras late Wednesday, followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later, Lockwood said. TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras, each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky. TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars, which are smaller and cooler than the sun, and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Also called red dwarfs, the stars that are TESS's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems. George Ricker, who leads the TESS science team at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said the exoplanet surveyor is a \"finder scope\" for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories. \"TESS is a survey machine, and it's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up, and among that category are these small rocky planets, transiting small red dwarf stars,\" said Sara Seager, deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT. Ricker said he expects TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth. Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS, he said. TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler observatory, which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets. But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect, and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky. The switch-on of TESS's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed. The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June. By June 17, TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt, Lockwood said. TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon's, ranging between 67,000 miles and 233,000 miles from Earth. In that orbit, TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days, about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth. The moon's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon's orbit, pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth, then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet. Thanks to the moon, TESS's \"just right\" orbit is gravitationally stable, requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations. TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years, assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust, Ricker said. \"The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS,\" Ricker said before the launch. \"This is a type of orbit that's normally unstable. If you aren't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit, you're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years. There's a delicate balance that's involved in staying in this orbit, and there's a lot of effort that's gone into it. \"But if you actually manage to do this, this orbit is actually stable for decades. There's no station-keeping required. You don't have to have thrusters or anything ... to maintain the orbit. So it's a very elegant solution to this problem.\" The mission's unique orbit also has other advantages. It stays well above Earth's radiation belts, which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors, but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA's Deep Space Network at high rates. After more than 300 hours of continuous, uninterrupted science observations, TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee, radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second, a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions. TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky, then will switch to the northern sky in 2019. For Lockwood, who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years, last week's launch was a turning point. \"For a while, it didn't really feel real,\" Lockwood said. \"I'd been there so close to the hardware for so long, and then all of a sudden it's not here. \"There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling, it's no longer around. It's like a kid leaving to go to college, and I've had four kids leave to go to college.\" The launch was \"terrific,\" Lockwood said, timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission's orbital dance with the moon. TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite's deployment over the Indian Ocean. The satellite's two power- generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity. \"A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket, but I stayed inside watching on the console,\" Lockwood said. \"For me, it's when it comes off the top of the rocket, and I'm waiting for telemetry to come, and I'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy. That's when I'm sighing a big sigh of relief.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/04/23/after-terrific-launch-tess-nears-first-major-orbit-raising-burn/"}, {"title": "NASA's new planet-hunting satellite begins climb into science orbit", "date": "2018-04-25", "content": "Looping back near Earth for the first time since its launch one week ago, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters early Wednesday to begin boosting its orbit toward the moon for a May 17 gravity assist maneuver that will help catapult the probe into its unique science orbit. The spacecraft's thrusters ignited early Thursday to raise the farthest point of TESS's orbit around Earth closer to the moon. The maneuver was timed as TESS reached its first perigee - the low point of its elongated orbit - since launching April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9 launcher deposited TESS into an elliptical orbit stretching around 170,000 miles from Earth. TESS briefly fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached the farthest point, or apogee, of its initial orbit to raise its perigee from around 150 miles to around 1,400 miles. The next maneuver accomplished early Wednesday positioned TESS's apogee at approximately 220,000 miles, more than 90 percent of the distance of the moon's orbit, according to tracking data published by the U.S. military. Wednesday's thruster firing was the second of six maneuvers planned to send TESS into its final operational orbit. Another burn next week will be timed to occur as TESS reaches its new apogee, followed by two additional perigee maneuvers that will fine-tune the satellite's trajectory and set up for a flyby of the moon May 17. The lunar flyby next month - targeting a distance of around 5,000 miles from the moon - will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond lunar distance, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June.

The spacecraft passed about 5,000 miles from the Moon, which provided a gravity assist that helped TESS sail toward its final working orbit. As part of camera commissioning, the science team snapped a two-second test exposure using one of the four TESS cameras. The image, centered on the southern constellation Centaurus, reveals more than 200,000 stars. The edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the right upper corner and the bright star Beta Centauri is visible at the lower left edge. TESS is expected to cover more than 400 times as much sky as shown in this image with its four cameras during its initial two-year search for exoplanets. A science-quality image, also referred to as a \"first light\" image, is expected to be released in June. TESS will undergo one final thruster burn on May 30 to enter its science orbit around Earth. This highly elliptical orbit will maximize the amount of sky the spacecraft can image, allowing it to continuously monitor large swaths of the sky. TESS is expected to begin science operations in mid-June after reaching this orbit and completing camera calibrations. Launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 18, TESS is the next step in NASA's search for planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. The mission will observe nearly the entire sky to monitor nearby, bright stars in search of transits - periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of the star. TESS is expected to find thousands of exoplanets.

TESS is taking up the mantle of the Kepler Space Telescope, which is expected to run out of fuel by the end of this year. Kepler has found more than 5000 exoplanet candidates so far, and confirmed about half of them. TESS will be able to search 350 times more area of the sky than Kepler can, and is expected to find about 20,000 exoplanets in its first two years alone. It will take about two months after launch to manouevre the satellite into its orbit - about half as far from Earth as the moon - and test its cameras. \"After that, there'll just be a flood of information,\" says the mission's principal investigator, George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eyes on the sky: TESS will use the same transit method Kepler used to find planets. This involves watching a star for dips in its light as a planet passes between the star and the telescope. How often the dips repeat indicates how fast the planet circles its host star, and the amount of light that's blocked tells us the size of the distant world. Rather than looking at distant stars in a small area of sky, like Kepler did, TESS will look at closer stars over 85 per cent of the sky. It is optimised to observe smaller, cooler stars that emit mostly red light. \"90 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way emit in those red wavelengths, and they seem to have more planets than stars like the sun, especially smaller Earth-sized planets,\" says Ricker. \"Nature's really saying, 'look here, look here' and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Because those stars are so nearby and rich with planets, they will be ideal targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2020. JWST will examine exoplanet atmospheres for signatures of life, which is only possible when their stars are relatively close.", "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166357-nasa-has-launched-a-new-space-telescope-to-hunt-for-exoplanets/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Satellite Launches to Seek Out New Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "NASA has a new planet hunter in the heavens. The agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, rising off the pad atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51 p.m. EDT and deploying into Earth orbit 49 minutes later. TESS will hunt for alien worlds around stars in the sun's neighborhood - planets that other missions can then study in detail. And the spacecraft will be incredibly prolific, if all goes according to plan. \"TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\" TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday. \"It's going to more than double the number that have been seen and detected by Kepler,\" Ricker added, referring to NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has spotted 2,650 confirmed exoplanets to date -about 70 percent of all the worlds known beyond our solar system. And the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth less than 9 minutes after liftoff today, touching down softly on a robotic SpaceX \"drone ship\" stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has now pulled off two dozen such landings during Falcon 9 launches - part of the company's push to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets and spacecraft, a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said will revolutionize spaceflight. SpaceX has re-flown 11 of these first stages to date, but the tally didn't increase today: This Falcon 9 was brand-new. Today's launch was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was delayed by two days to give SpaceX time to investigate a potential issue with the rocket's guidance, navigation and control systems. Looking for nearby worlds: Like Kepler, TESS will find alien planets using the \"transit method,\" noting the tiny brightness dips these worlds cause when they cross their host stars' faces. But there are some big differences between the missions. During its prime mission from 2009 through 2013, Kepler stared continuously at a single patch of sky, monitoring about 150,000 stars simultaneously. Most of these stars are far from the sun - from several hundred light-years to 1,000 light-years or more. But TESS will conduct a broad sky survey during its two-year prime mission, covering about 85 percent of the sky. The satellite will focus on the nearest and brightest stars, using its four cameras to look for worlds that may be close enough to be studied in depth by other instruments. Indeed, TESS will rely on a variety of other telescopes on the ground and in space to help determine which of its \"candidates\" are bona fide planets, and to characterize the newly discovered worlds. One such partner will be NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. James Webb should be able to probe the atmospheres of at least a few TESS planets for oxygen, methane and other possible signs of life, NASA officials have said. \"TESS is the first step toward finding habitable planets,\" mission project scientist Stephen Rinehart, who's based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said during Sunday's briefing. The mission will be a big step toward exploring such worlds up-close as well, team members said. In 50 to 100 years, humanity will probably be capable of launching tiny robotic spacecraft to explore a number of nearby exoplanets, perhaps using technology like that being developed by the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot project, MIT's Ricker said. \"We are putting together a catalog of the very best targets for those probes,\" he said. \"That's one thing that I think will be a lasting legacy of TESS.\" A unique orbit: TESS also differs from Kepler in its orbit. Whereas Kepler loops around the sun, TESS will zoom around our planet, on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day orbit that no spacecraft has ever occupied before. This orbit will take TESS as close to Earth as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles. The satellite will be able to beam its onboard data down to Earth quickly and efficiently during the close approaches. The orbit is also incredibly stable and features relatively low radiation exposure and low thermal variation, said Robert Lockwood, TESS spacecraft program manager at Orbital ATK, the Virginia-based company that built the satellite for NASA. \"It really is a Goldilocks orbit,\" Lockwood told Space.com. But TESS won't get there for a while. After a number of engine firings and one dramatic maneuver - a close flyby of the moon on May 17 - TESS will arrive in its final orbit in mid-June, if all goes according to plan. The science campaign will start shortly thereafter. The TESS mission is capped at $200 million, not including launch costs.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40320-spacex-nasa-tess-exoplanet-satellite-launch.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS launches", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "TESS, NASA's planet-hunting satellite, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:51 p.m. ET Wednesday. It had a 30-second launch window. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday, but rescheduled to conduct additional Guidance Navigation and Control analysis, the agency said. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was able to land on the droneship minutes later. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is NASA's next mission in the search for exoplanets, or those that are outside our solar system, and TESS will be on the lookout for planets that could support life. After launch, TESS will use its fuel to reach orbit around the Earth, with a gravity assist from the moon. That will enable it to have a long-term mission beyond its two-year objective. \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance,\" Joel Villasenor, instrument scientist for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\" Over 60 days, TESS will establish an orbit around Earth and test its instruments. Then, the two-year mission will officially begin. What will TESS do? TESS will pick up the search for exoplanets as the Kepler Space Telescope runs out of fuel. Kepler, which has discovered more than 4,500 potential planets and confirmed exoplanets, launched in 2009. After mechanical failure in 2013, it entered a new phase of campaigns to survey other areas of the sky for exoplanets, called the K2 mission. This enabled researchers to discover even more exoplanets, understand the evolution of stars and gain insight about supernovae and black holes. Soon, Kepler's mission will end, and it will be abandoned in space, orbiting the sun and never getting any closer to Earth than the moon. TESS will survey an area 400 times larger than what Kepler observed. This includes 200,000 of the brightest nearby stars. Over the course of two years, the four wide-field cameras on board will stare at different sectors of the sky for days at a time. TESS will begin by looking at the Southern Hemisphere sky for the first year and move to the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. It can accomplish this lofty goal by dividing the sky into 13 sections and looking at each one for 27 days before moving on to the next. The satellite itself is not much bigger than a refrigerator. The cameras sit on top, beneath a cone that will protect them from radiation. TESS will look for exoplanets using the transit method, observing slight dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. Bright stars allow for easier followup study through ground- and space-based telescopes. \"TESS is helping us explore our place in the universe,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"Until 20 years ago, we didn't know of any planets beyond our own solar system. We've expanded our understanding of our place in the universe, and TESS will help us keep expanding.\" The cameras can detect light across a broad range of wavelengths, up to infrared. This means TESS will be able to look at many nearby small, cool red dwarf stars and see whether there are exoplanets around them. Red dwarf stars have been found to host exoplanets within the habitable zone, and many astronomers believe they could be the best candidate for hosting Earth-size exoplanets with conditions suitable for life. What makes TESS different? NASA expects TESS to allow for the cataloging of more than 1,500 exoplanets, but it has the potential to find thousands. Of these, officials anticipate, 300 will be Earth-size exoplanets or double-Earth-size Super Earths. Those could be the best candidates for supporting life outside our solar system. Like Earth, they are small, rocky and usually within the habitable zone of their stars, meaning liquid water can exist on their surface. \"One of the biggest questions in exoplanet exploration is: If an astronomer finds a planet in a star's habitable zone, will it be interesting from a biologist's point of view?\" said George Ricker, TESS principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in Cambridge. \"We expect TESS will discover a number of planets whose atmospheric compositions, which hold potential clues to the presence of life, could be precisely measured by future observers.\" These exoplanets will be studied so that NASA can determine which are the best targets for missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. That telescope, whose launch was just pushed back to 2020, would be able to characterize the details and atmospheres of exoplanets in ways scientists have not been able to do. \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" Hertz said. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" NASA believes that TESS will build on Kepler's momentum and open the study of exoplanets in unprecedented ways. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come. It's the beginning of a new era of exoplanet research. I don't think we know everything TESS is going to accomplish. To me, the most exciting part of any mission is the unexpected result, the one that nobody saw coming.\" The search for life: More than a decade ago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists first proposed the idea of a mission like TESS. They have been instrumental in bringing the mission from idea to reality and will continue to be involved once the mission launches. A science team devoted to TESS at MIT aims to measure the masses of at least 50 small exoplanets that have a radius of less than four times that of Earth - an ideal dimension that could suggest habitability. \"Mass is a defining planetary characteristic,\" said Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science at MIT. \"If you just know that a planet is twice the size of Earth, it could be a lot of things: a rocky world with a thin atmosphere, or what we call a 'mini-Neptune' - a rocky world with a giant gas envelope, where it would be a huge greenhouse blanket, and there would be no life on the surface. So mass and size together give us an average planet density, which tells us a huge amount about what the planet is.\" TESS Objects of Interest, an MIT-led effort, will look for objects in TESS' data that could be exoplanets and catalog them. \"TESS is kind of like a scout,\" said Natalia Guerrero, deputy manager of TESS Objects of Interest. \"We're on this scenic tour of the whole sky, and in some ways we have no idea what we will see. It's like we're making a treasure map: Here are all these cool things. Now, go after them.\" TESS data will also be publicly available so that anyone can download them and search for exoplanets. A data pipeline has been established so that TESS can fulfill its mission. It will collect about 27 gigabytes per day - that's about 6,500 song files - and send data back every two weeks. NASA's Pleiades, an incredibly powerful supercomputer, will be able to keep up and process the 10 billion pixels over three to five days. The more people that look through the data, the better, the scientists believe. This could be how planets that support life are found. \"There's no science that will tell us life is out there right now, except that small rocky planets appear to be incredibly common,\" Seager said. \"They appear to be everywhere we look. So it's got to be there somewhere.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/nasa-tess-satellite-launch/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft TESS is now on its mission to search for new worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "The latest of NASA 's incredible planet-hunting space telescopes was launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Known as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to its friends, this exciting new mission promises to provide the next great leap forward in our understanding of our place in the universe. Over the next two years, TESS is likely to find thousands of new exoplanets - planets orbiting distant stars - and will help to reveal the degree to which our Solar system is unique in the cosmos. In doing so, it will build on the fascinating results of the past few decades, cementing our place in the \"Exoplanet Era\". The Kepler revolution: At the end of 2008, the year before NASA's earlier planet-hunting telescope Kepler launched, about 300 exoplanets had been discovered. Today, the number is an order of magnitude larger: more than 3,700. Kepler discovered more than 2,300 exoplanets, with a further 2,200 or so \"candidate\" planets still awaiting followup. This incredible haul is the result of the spacecraft staring, unblinking, at the night sky, watching for the tiny flickers that reveal planets passing between us and their host stars. In essence, Kepler carried out the first great census of the Exoplanet Era. It taught us that planets are ubiquitous - a standard and natural byproduct of the formation of stars. But the vast majority of the stars around which Kepler found planets were very faint and very distant. This makes it a great challenge for observers on the ground to follow up on those discoveries and learn more about the planets the spacecraft revealed. Along comes TESS: Whereas Kepler focused for four years on just one small patch of the northern sky, TESS will target stars across almost the whole night sky. In doing so, it will survey some of the brightest stars in the sky - making the task of following up on its myriad discoveries far easier. TESS consists of four cameras, configured to give it an observation sector that covers an area slightly larger than a 90\u00b0 arc on the sky. TESS will watch that observation sector continually for just over 27 days, never blinking. The spacecraft will then pivot around, swinging to target its next sector. In this manner, over the course of a year, the spacecraft will target almost the entirety of one hemisphere of the sky. After that, it will flip over, and spend the next year watching the other hemisphere. For the first year TESS will be gazing to the south, scouring skies that are best seen from the southern hemisphere, finding planets orbiting the very stars you see when you step outside and look up at the night sky, right here in Australia. Many stars, many planets? TESS's main mission will involve it observing a total of 200,000 stars, measuring their brightness every single minute that they fall within its field of view. To do this, it will process images before sending them back to Earth, extracting just the data on those stars to send back to the Earth. TESS will also provide full-frame images every half an hour, yielding a trove of tens of millions of objects observed. Put all that together, and the expected planet yield should be enormous. Based on the statistics of planet discoveries to date, it is likely that TESS will find at least a couple of thousand potential planets around its main target stars, while those in the full-frame images might yield tens of thousands of additional candidates. These numbers are incredible, and TESS will revolutionise our understanding of our place in the universe. But such amazing results bring with them a unique problem - and one that we, in Australia, are ideally placed to help solve. Too many planets, too little time: The reason that only half of the Kepler mission's candidate planets have been confirmed is that doing so requires extensive follow-up work from the ground. Astronomers have to rule out other effects that could cause the behaviour seen in the potential planet's host star before we can be certain that we're really seeing evidence of a new planet. Most of the stars observed by Kepler are simply too faint for that kind of work to be carried out from the ground - except, perhaps, with the largest telescopes on the planet. Getting time on those telescopes is challenging - all of the world's other astronomers covet that time too, for their own projects. Quite simply, it is a case of too many planets, too little time. The problem is only going to get worse with TESS. When the first few planets were found, in the late 20th century, the discoveries came in a trickle. Those discoveries were easy for scientists to drink in and follow up, and all was good. With Kepler, the discovery rate went through the roof. From a trickle, it was like someone had turned on a tap - a continual stream of new potential planets to study. If Kepler was a tap, then TESS will be a fire hose, and there are simply too few telescopes available for us to use to study all of the planets TESS finds at once. That is where the Australian connection comes to the fore - in the form of a dedicated new facility being built on the Darling Downs, in southeast Queensland. The Australian connection - MINERVA-Australis: At the University of Southern Queensland, we are constructing MINERVA- Australis - a collection of six telescopes dedicated to nothing but the search for and characterisation of planets around other stars. When TESS turns on the fire hose, finding thousands of planets in the southern sky, we stand ready. Every clear night, we will be observing those stars that TESS suggests could host planets, doing our utmost to confirm whether those planets really exist. Once we confirm TESS's new discoveries, we will be able to use our facility to study the newly found worlds in more detail. By observing the planet's transits, we can measure its physical size, by seeing how much of the light from its host the planet blocks. In addition, we will be examining the light we receive from the star, measuring the telltale wobbles caused by the planet as it orbits its host. With those measurements, we will be able to calculate the planet's mass. Put the mass and the size together, and we can really begin to work out the planet's true nature. Is it rocky, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn? Over the coming years, TESS will push the Exoplanet Era through its next great revolution - finding thousands or tens of thousands of new exoplanets. Here in southeast Queensland, we will be at the forefront of that journey of discovery, helping to reveal the true nature of those alien worlds. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what we'll learn next!

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee, the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth, nearly 170,000 miles in altitude. The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system, and only nudged the satellite's perigee, or orbital low point, slightly higher than the spacecraft's initial perigee less than 200 miles above Earth. TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff. The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit. The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months, with the first major step planned for early Wednesday, when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch, according to Robert Lockwood, TESS program manager at Orbital ATK, which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA. Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments, while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed. The first of three planned \"perigee burns\" Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17, passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth. Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS's second and third orbits for fine-tuning, or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned. Since TESS's launch last week, ground controllers at Orbital ATK's headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, have completed communications system tests, computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy. In concert with preparations for the mission's first major engine burn, engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS's four imaging cameras late Wednesday, followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later, Lockwood said. TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras, each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky. TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars, which are smaller and cooler than the sun, and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Also called red dwarfs, the stars that are TESS's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems. George Ricker, who leads the TESS science team at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said the exoplanet surveyor is a \"finder scope\" for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories. \"TESS is a survey machine, and it's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up, and among that category are these small rocky planets, transiting small red dwarf stars,\" said Sara Seager, deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT. Ricker said he expects TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth. Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS, he said. TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler observatory, which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets. But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect, and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky. The switch-on of TESS's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed. The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June. By June 17, TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt, Lockwood said. TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon's, ranging between 67,000 miles and 233,000 miles from Earth. In that orbit, TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days, about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth. The moon's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon's orbit, pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth, then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet. Thanks to the moon, TESS's \"just right\" orbit is gravitationally stable, requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations. TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years, assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust, Ricker said. \"The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS,\" Ricker said before the launch. \"This is a type of orbit that's normally unstable. If you aren't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit, you're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years. There's a delicate balance that's involved in staying in this orbit, and there's a lot of effort that's gone into it. \"But if you actually manage to do this, this orbit is actually stable for decades. There's no station-keeping required. You don't have to have thrusters or anything ... to maintain the orbit. So it's a very elegant solution to this problem.\" The mission's unique orbit also has other advantages. It stays well above Earth's radiation belts, which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors, but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA's Deep Space Network at high rates. After more than 300 hours of continuous, uninterrupted science observations, TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee, radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second, a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions. TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky, then will switch to the northern sky in 2019. For Lockwood, who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years, last week's launch was a turning point. \"For a while, it didn't really feel real,\" Lockwood said. \"I'd been there so close to the hardware for so long, and then all of a sudden it's not here. \"There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling, it's no longer around. It's like a kid leaving to go to college, and I've had four kids leave to go to college.\" The launch was \"terrific,\" Lockwood said, timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission's orbital dance with the moon. TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite's deployment over the Indian Ocean. The satellite's two power- generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity. \"A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket, but I stayed inside watching on the console,\" Lockwood said. \"For me, it's when it comes off the top of the rocket, and I'm waiting for telemetry to come, and I'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy. That's when I'm sighing a big sigh of relief.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/04/23/after-terrific-launch-tess-nears-first-major-orbit-raising-burn/"}, {"title": "NASA's new planet-hunting satellite begins climb into science orbit", "date": "2018-04-25", "content": "Looping back near Earth for the first time since its launch one week ago, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters early Wednesday to begin boosting its orbit toward the moon for a May 17 gravity assist maneuver that will help catapult the probe into its unique science orbit. The spacecraft's thrusters ignited early Thursday to raise the farthest point of TESS's orbit around Earth closer to the moon. The maneuver was timed as TESS reached its first perigee - the low point of its elongated orbit - since launching April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9 launcher deposited TESS into an elliptical orbit stretching around 170,000 miles from Earth. TESS briefly fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached the farthest point, or apogee, of its initial orbit to raise its perigee from around 150 miles to around 1,400 miles. The next maneuver accomplished early Wednesday positioned TESS's apogee at approximately 220,000 miles, more than 90 percent of the distance of the moon's orbit, according to tracking data published by the U.S. military. Wednesday's thruster firing was the second of six maneuvers planned to send TESS into its final operational orbit. Another burn next week will be timed to occur as TESS reaches its new apogee, followed by two additional perigee maneuvers that will fine-tune the satellite's trajectory and set up for a flyby of the moon May 17. The lunar flyby next month - targeting a distance of around 5,000 miles from the moon - will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond lunar distance, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June.

Since the launch April 18, ground controllers at Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia, which built the spacecraft, have switched on key components on the satellite, including reaction wheels and star trackers used to keep TESS properly pointed in space. On Wednesday, engineers sent commands to turn on the satellite's Ka-band transmitter, which routes signals through a high-gain antenna needed to beam full-frame images back to Earth from TESS's four 16.8-megapixel science cameras. Controllers planned to begin activating the cameras as soon as Thursday, beginning several weeks of calibrations and checkouts to make sure the MIT- built imagers are ready science observations.

The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky.

The spacecraft passed about 5,000 miles from the Moon, which provided a gravity assist that helped TESS sail toward its final working orbit. As part of camera commissioning, the science team snapped a two-second test exposure using one of the four TESS cameras. The image, centered on the southern constellation Centaurus, reveals more than 200,000 stars. The edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the right upper corner and the bright star Beta Centauri is visible at the lower left edge. TESS is expected to cover more than 400 times as much sky as shown in this image with its four cameras during its initial two-year search for exoplanets. A science-quality image, also referred to as a \"first light\" image, is expected to be released in June. TESS will undergo one final thruster burn on May 30 to enter its science orbit around Earth. This highly elliptical orbit will maximize the amount of sky the spacecraft can image, allowing it to continuously monitor large swaths of the sky. TESS is expected to begin science operations in mid-June after reaching this orbit and completing camera calibrations. Launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 18, TESS is the next step in NASA's search for planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. The mission will observe nearly the entire sky to monitor nearby, bright stars in search of transits - periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of the star. TESS is expected to find thousands of exoplanets. NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2020, will provide important follow-up observations of some of the most promising TESS-discovered exoplanets, allowing scientists to study their atmospheres.

This means that TESS' instruments watch great regions of the sky for dips in starlight-a sign that an orbiting planet has crossed the star's face. TESS will focus its sights on stars 300 light years or closer, scanning about 85 percent of the sky over the course of two years. It was estimated that TESS will catalogue 500,000 stars and spot thousands of potential exoplanets.

But those checkouts should be done relatively soon. \"The TESS team has reported that the spacecraft and cameras are in good health, and the spacecraft has successfully reached its final science orbit,\" NASA officials wrote in an update Wednesday. \"The team continues to conduct tests in order to optimize spacecraft performance, with a goal of beginning science at the end of July.\" That start date would represent a delay of about six weeks; science operations were originally expected to begin in mid-June, NASA officials have said. TESS' work will involve scrutinizing several hundred thousand stars in the sun's neighborhood, looking for tiny brightness dips caused by the passage of orbiting planets across the stars' faces. NASA's famous Kepler space telescope has employed this same \"transit method\" to great effect, discovering about 70 percent of the 3,750 known exoplanets to date.

Taken over the course of 17 hours on July 25, these TESS images helped demonstrate the satellite's ability to collect a prolonged set of stable periodic images covering a broad region of the sky - all critical factors in finding transiting planets orbiting nearby stars. Over the course of these tests, TESS took images of C/2018 N1, a comet discovered by NASA's Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite on June 29. The comet, located about 29 million miles from Earth in the southern constellation Piscis Austrinus, is seen to move across the frame from right to left as it orbits the Sun. The comet's tail, which consists of gases carried away from the comet by an outflow from the Sun called the solar wind, extends to the top of the frame and gradually pivots as the comet glides across the field of view. In addition to the comet, the images reveal a treasure trove of other astronomical activity. The stars appear to shift between white and black as a result of image processing. The shift also highlights variable stars - which change brightness either as a result of pulsation, rapid rotation, or by eclipsing binary neighbors. Asteroids in our solar system appear as small white dots moving across the field of view. Towards the end of the video, one can see a faint broad arc of light moving across the middle section of the frame from left to right. This is stray light from Mars, which is located outside the frame. The images were taken when Mars was at its brightest near opposition, or its closest distance, to Earth. These images were taken during a short period near the end of the mission's commissioning phase, prior to the start of science operations. The movie presents just a small fraction of TESS's active field of view. The team continues to fine-tune the spacecraft's performance as it searches for distant worlds.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is scheduled to blast off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 16 April. TESS is taking up the mantle of the Kepler Space Telescope, which is expected to run out of fuel by the end of this year. Kepler has found more than 5000 exoplanet candidates so far, and confirmed about half of them. TESS will be able to search 350 times more area of the sky than Kepler can, and is expected to find about 20,000 exoplanets in its first two years alone. It will take about two months after launch to manouevre the satellite into its orbit - about half as far from Earth as the moon - and test its cameras. \"After that, there'll just be a flood of information,\" says the mission's principal investigator, George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eyes on the sky: TESS will use the same transit method Kepler used to find planets. This involves watching a star for dips in its light as a planet passes between the star and the telescope. How often the dips repeat indicates how fast the planet circles its host star, and the amount of light that's blocked tells us the size of the distant world. Rather than looking at distant stars in a small area of sky, like Kepler did, TESS will look at closer stars over 85 per cent of the sky. It is optimised to observe smaller, cooler stars that emit mostly red light. \"90 per cent of the stars in the Milky Way emit in those red wavelengths, and they seem to have more planets than stars like the sun, especially smaller Earth-sized planets,\" says Ricker. \"Nature's really saying, 'look here, look here' and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Because those stars are so nearby and rich with planets, they will be ideal targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2020.

The agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, rising off the pad atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 6:51 p.m. EDT and deploying into Earth orbit 49 minutes later. TESS will hunt for alien worlds around stars in the sun's neighborhood - planets that other missions can then study in detail. And the spacecraft will be incredibly prolific, if all goes according to plan. \"TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\" TESS principal investigator George Ricker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said during a pre-launch briefing Sunday. \"It's going to more than double the number that have been seen and detected by Kepler,\" Ricker added, referring to NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has spotted 2,650 confirmed exoplanets to date -about 70 percent of all the worlds known beyond our solar system. And the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth less than 9 minutes after liftoff today, touching down softly on a robotic SpaceX \"drone ship\" stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has now pulled off two dozen such landings during Falcon 9 launches - part of the company's push to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets and spacecraft, a breakthrough that SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said will revolutionize spaceflight. SpaceX has re-flown 11 of these first stages to date, but the tally didn't increase today: This Falcon 9 was brand-new. Today's launch was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but it was delayed by two days to give SpaceX time to investigate a potential issue with the rocket's guidance, navigation and control systems. Looking for nearby worlds: Like Kepler, TESS will find alien planets using the \"transit method,\" noting the tiny brightness dips these worlds cause when they cross their host stars' faces. But there are some big differences between the missions. During its prime mission from 2009 through 2013, Kepler stared continuously at a single patch of sky, monitoring about 150,000 stars simultaneously. Most of these stars are far from the sun - from several hundred light-years to 1,000 light-years or more. But TESS will conduct a broad sky survey during its two-year prime mission, covering about 85 percent of the sky. The satellite will focus on the nearest and brightest stars, using its four cameras to look for worlds that may be close enough to be studied in depth by other instruments. Indeed, TESS will rely on a variety of other telescopes on the ground and in space to help determine which of its \"candidates\" are bona fide planets, and to characterize the newly discovered worlds. One such partner will be NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2020. James Webb should be able to probe the atmospheres of at least a few TESS planets for oxygen, methane and other possible signs of life, NASA officials have said. \"TESS is the first step toward finding habitable planets,\" mission project scientist Stephen Rinehart, who's based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said during Sunday's briefing. The mission will be a big step toward exploring such worlds up-close as well, team members said. In 50 to 100 years, humanity will probably be capable of launching tiny robotic spacecraft to explore a number of nearby exoplanets, perhaps using technology like that being developed by the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot project, MIT's Ricker said. \"We are putting together a catalog of the very best targets for those probes,\" he said. \"That's one thing that I think will be a lasting legacy of TESS.\" A unique orbit: TESS also differs from Kepler in its orbit. Whereas Kepler loops around the sun, TESS will zoom around our planet, on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day orbit that no spacecraft has ever occupied before. This orbit will take TESS as close to Earth as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles. The satellite will be able to beam its onboard data down to Earth quickly and efficiently during the close approaches. The orbit is also incredibly stable and features relatively low radiation exposure and low thermal variation, said Robert Lockwood, TESS spacecraft program manager at Orbital ATK, the Virginia-based company that built the satellite for NASA. \"It really is a Goldilocks orbit,\" Lockwood told Space.com. But TESS won't get there for a while. After a number of engine firings and one dramatic maneuver - a close flyby of the moon on May 17 - TESS will arrive in its final orbit in mid-June, if all goes according to plan. The science campaign will start shortly thereafter. The TESS mission is capped at $200 million, not including launch costs.", "url": "https://www.space.com/40320-spacex-nasa-tess-exoplanet-satellite-launch.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS launches", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "TESS, NASA's planet-hunting satellite, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:51 p.m. ET Wednesday. It had a 30-second launch window. The launch was originally scheduled for Monday, but rescheduled to conduct additional Guidance Navigation and Control analysis, the agency said. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was able to land on the droneship minutes later. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is NASA's next mission in the search for exoplanets, or those that are outside our solar system, and TESS will be on the lookout for planets that could support life. After launch, TESS will use its fuel to reach orbit around the Earth, with a gravity assist from the moon. That will enable it to have a long-term mission beyond its two-year objective. \"The Moon and the satellite are in a sort of dance,\" Joel Villasenor, instrument scientist for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"The Moon pulls the satellite on one side, and by the time TESS completes one orbit, the Moon is on the other side tugging in the opposite direction. The overall effect is the Moon's pull is evened out, and it's a very stable configuration over many years. Nobody's done this before, and I suspect other programs will try to use this orbit later on.\" Over 60 days, TESS will establish an orbit around Earth and test its instruments. Then, the two-year mission will officially begin. What will TESS do? TESS will pick up the search for exoplanets as the Kepler Space Telescope runs out of fuel. Kepler, which has discovered more than 4,500 potential planets and confirmed exoplanets, launched in 2009. After mechanical failure in 2013, it entered a new phase of campaigns to survey other areas of the sky for exoplanets, called the K2 mission. This enabled researchers to discover even more exoplanets, understand the evolution of stars and gain insight about supernovae and black holes. Soon, Kepler's mission will end, and it will be abandoned in space, orbiting the sun and never getting any closer to Earth than the moon. TESS will survey an area 400 times larger than what Kepler observed. This includes 200,000 of the brightest nearby stars. Over the course of two years, the four wide-field cameras on board will stare at different sectors of the sky for days at a time. TESS will begin by looking at the Southern Hemisphere sky for the first year and move to the Northern Hemisphere in the second year. It can accomplish this lofty goal by dividing the sky into 13 sections and looking at each one for 27 days before moving on to the next. The satellite itself is not much bigger than a refrigerator. The cameras sit on top, beneath a cone that will protect them from radiation. TESS will look for exoplanets using the transit method, observing slight dips in the brightness of stars as planets pass in front of them. Bright stars allow for easier followup study through ground- and space-based telescopes. \"TESS is helping us explore our place in the universe,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters. \"Until 20 years ago, we didn't know of any planets beyond our own solar system. We've expanded our understanding of our place in the universe, and TESS will help us keep expanding.\" The cameras can detect light across a broad range of wavelengths, up to infrared. This means TESS will be able to look at many nearby small, cool red dwarf stars and see whether there are exoplanets around them. Red dwarf stars have been found to host exoplanets within the habitable zone, and many astronomers believe they could be the best candidate for hosting Earth-size exoplanets with conditions suitable for life. What makes TESS different? NASA expects TESS to allow for the cataloging of more than 1,500 exoplanets, but it has the potential to find thousands. Of these, officials anticipate, 300 will be Earth-size exoplanets or double-Earth-size Super Earths. Those could be the best candidates for supporting life outside our solar system. Like Earth, they are small, rocky and usually within the habitable zone of their stars, meaning liquid water can exist on their surface. \"One of the biggest questions in exoplanet exploration is: If an astronomer finds a planet in a star's habitable zone, will it be interesting from a biologist's point of view?\" said George Ricker, TESS principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research in Cambridge. \"We expect TESS will discover a number of planets whose atmospheric compositions, which hold potential clues to the presence of life, could be precisely measured by future observers.\" These exoplanets will be studied so that NASA can determine which are the best targets for missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. That telescope, whose launch was just pushed back to 2020, would be able to characterize the details and atmospheres of exoplanets in ways scientists have not been able to do. \"We learned from Kepler that there are more planets than stars in our sky, and now TESS will open our eyes to the variety of planets around some of the closest stars,\" Hertz said. \"TESS will cast a wider net than ever before for enigmatic worlds whose properties can be probed by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and other missions.\" NASA believes that TESS will build on Kepler's momentum and open the study of exoplanets in unprecedented ways. \"TESS is opening a door for a whole new kind of study,\" said Stephen Rinehart, TESS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're going to be able study individual planets and start talking about the differences between planets. The targets TESS finds are going to be fantastic subjects for research for decades to come. It's the beginning of a new era of exoplanet research. I don't think we know everything TESS is going to accomplish. To me, the most exciting part of any mission is the unexpected result, the one that nobody saw coming.\" The search for life: More than a decade ago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists first proposed the idea of a mission like TESS. They have been instrumental in bringing the mission from idea to reality and will continue to be involved once the mission launches. A science team devoted to TESS at MIT aims to measure the masses of at least 50 small exoplanets that have a radius of less than four times that of Earth - an ideal dimension that could suggest habitability. \"Mass is a defining planetary characteristic,\" said Sara Seager, TESS deputy director of science at MIT. \"If you just know that a planet is twice the size of Earth, it could be a lot of things: a rocky world with a thin atmosphere, or what we call a 'mini-Neptune' - a rocky world with a giant gas envelope, where it would be a huge greenhouse blanket, and there would be no life on the surface. So mass and size together give us an average planet density, which tells us a huge amount about what the planet is.\" TESS Objects of Interest, an MIT-led effort, will look for objects in TESS' data that could be exoplanets and catalog them. \"TESS is kind of like a scout,\" said Natalia Guerrero, deputy manager of TESS Objects of Interest. \"We're on this scenic tour of the whole sky, and in some ways we have no idea what we will see. It's like we're making a treasure map: Here are all these cool things. Now, go after them.\" TESS data will also be publicly available so that anyone can download them and search for exoplanets. A data pipeline has been established so that TESS can fulfill its mission. It will collect about 27 gigabytes per day - that's about 6,500 song files - and send data back every two weeks. NASA's Pleiades, an incredibly powerful supercomputer, will be able to keep up and process the 10 billion pixels over three to five days. The more people that look through the data, the better, the scientists believe. This could be how planets that support life are found. \"There's no science that will tell us life is out there right now, except that small rocky planets appear to be incredibly common,\" Seager said. \"They appear to be everywhere we look. So it's got to be there somewhere.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/nasa-tess-satellite-launch/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's planet-hunting spacecraft TESS is now on its mission to search for new worlds", "date": "2018-04-18", "content": "The latest of NASA 's incredible planet-hunting space telescopes was launched today from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The Kepler revolution: At the end of 2008, the year before NASA's earlier planet-hunting telescope Kepler launched, about 300 exoplanets had been discovered. Today, the number is an order of magnitude larger: more than 3,700. Kepler discovered more than 2,300 exoplanets, with a further 2,200 or so \"candidate\" planets still awaiting followup. This incredible haul is the result of the spacecraft staring, unblinking, at the night sky, watching for the tiny flickers that reveal planets passing between us and their host stars. In essence, Kepler carried out the first great census of the Exoplanet Era. It taught us that planets are ubiquitous - a standard and natural byproduct of the formation of stars. But the vast majority of the stars around which Kepler found planets were very faint and very distant. This makes it a great challenge for observers on the ground to follow up on those discoveries and learn more about the planets the spacecraft revealed. Along comes TESS: Whereas Kepler focused for four years on just one small patch of the northern sky, TESS will target stars across almost the whole night sky. In doing so, it will survey some of the brightest stars in the sky - making the task of following up on its myriad discoveries far easier. TESS consists of four cameras, configured to give it an observation sector that covers an area slightly larger than a 90\u00b0 arc on the sky. TESS will watch that observation sector continually for just over 27 days, never blinking. The spacecraft will then pivot around, swinging to target its next sector. In this manner, over the course of a year, the spacecraft will target almost the entirety of one hemisphere of the sky. After that, it will flip over, and spend the next year watching the other hemisphere. For the first year TESS will be gazing to the south, scouring skies that are best seen from the southern hemisphere, finding planets orbiting the very stars you see when you step outside and look up at the night sky, right here in Australia. Many stars, many planets? TESS's main mission will involve it observing a total of 200,000 stars, measuring their brightness every single minute that they fall within its field of view. To do this, it will process images before sending them back to Earth, extracting just the data on those stars to send back to the Earth. TESS will also provide full-frame images every half an hour, yielding a trove of tens of millions of objects observed. Put all that together, and the expected planet yield should be enormous. Based on the statistics of planet discoveries to date, it is likely that TESS will find at least a couple of thousand potential planets around its main target stars, while those in the full-frame images might yield tens of thousands of additional candidates. These numbers are incredible, and TESS will revolutionise our understanding of our place in the universe. But such amazing results bring with them a unique problem - and one that we, in Australia, are ideally placed to help solve. Too many planets, too little time: The reason that only half of the Kepler mission's candidate planets have been confirmed is that doing so requires extensive follow-up work from the ground. Astronomers have to rule out other effects that could cause the behaviour seen in the potential planet's host star before we can be certain that we're really seeing evidence of a new planet. Most of the stars observed by Kepler are simply too faint for that kind of work to be carried out from the ground - except, perhaps, with the largest telescopes on the planet. Getting time on those telescopes is challenging - all of the world's other astronomers covet that time too, for their own projects. Quite simply, it is a case of too many planets, too little time. The problem is only going to get worse with TESS. When the first few planets were found, in the late 20th century, the discoveries came in a trickle. Those discoveries were easy for scientists to drink in and follow up, and all was good. With Kepler, the discovery rate went through the roof. From a trickle, it was like someone had turned on a tap - a continual stream of new potential planets to study. If Kepler was a tap, then TESS will be a fire hose, and there are simply too few telescopes available for us to use to study all of the planets TESS finds at once. That is where the Australian connection comes to the fore - in the form of a dedicated new facility being built on the Darling Downs, in southeast Queensland. The Australian connection - MINERVA-Australis: At the University of Southern Queensland, we are constructing MINERVA- Australis - a collection of six telescopes dedicated to nothing but the search for and characterisation of planets around other stars. When TESS turns on the fire hose, finding thousands of planets in the southern sky, we stand ready. Every clear night, we will be observing those stars that TESS suggests could host planets, doing our utmost to confirm whether those planets really exist. Once we confirm TESS's new discoveries, we will be able to use our facility to study the newly found worlds in more detail. By observing the planet's transits, we can measure its physical size, by seeing how much of the light from its host the planet blocks. In addition, we will be examining the light we receive from the star, measuring the telltale wobbles caused by the planet as it orbits its host. With those measurements, we will be able to calculate the planet's mass. Put the mass and the size together, and we can really begin to work out the planet's true nature. Is it rocky, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn? Over the coming years, TESS will push the Exoplanet Era through its next great revolution - finding thousands or tens of thousands of new exoplanets. Here in southeast Queensland, we will be at the forefront of that journey of discovery, helping to reveal the true nature of those alien worlds. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see what we'll learn next!

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached apogee, the most distant point in its looping elliptical orbit around Earth, nearly 170,000 miles in altitude. The rocket burn was planned as a checkout of TESS's hydrazine-fueled propulsion system, and only nudged the satellite's perigee, or orbital low point, slightly higher than the spacecraft's initial perigee less than 200 miles above Earth. TESS launched Wednesday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9's upper stage accomplished two engine firings before deploying the 798-pound observatory around 50 minutes after liftoff. The launch placed TESS into a preliminary oval-shaped transfer orbit. The satellite will carefully maneuver into its operational perch over the next two months, with the first major step planned for early Wednesday, when TESS swings back near Earth at its first perigee since launch, according to Robert Lockwood, TESS program manager at Orbital ATK, which built and operates the spacecraft for NASA. Five thrusters mounted at the base of the TESS spacecraft are used for major orbital adjustments, while four spinning reaction wheels inside the satellite keep it properly pointed. The first of three planned \"perigee burns\" Wednesday will do most of the lifting to place TESS on a trajectory to encounter the moon May 17, passing by at a distance of roughly 5,000 miles and using lunar gravity to drastically reshape its orbit around Earth. Lockwood said in an interview Thursday that the two additional perigee burns planned at the end of TESS's second and third orbits for fine-tuning, or if the first maneuver is not accomplished as planned. Since TESS's launch last week, ground controllers at Orbital ATK's headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, have completed communications system tests, computer checkouts and other procedures to ensure the spacecraft is healthy. In concert with preparations for the mission's first major engine burn, engineers in Dulles aim to switch on the data processing unit for TESS's four imaging cameras late Wednesday, followed by activation of the cameras themselves a few hours later, Lockwood said. TESS carries four 16.8-megapixel cameras, each fitted with four red-sensitive CCD detectors, designed to detect planets transiting in front of their host stars. The cameras will search for brief dips in starlight to find the planets, and sophisticated software algorithms will allow astronomers to scan wide swaths of the sky once full-frame images are downlinked to Earth. During TESS's two-year, $337 million mission, the MIT-built cameras will survey more than 85 percent of the sky, looking at approximately 200,000 pre- selected bright, nearby stars, including the 6,000 or so stars that are visible to the naked eye in the night sky. TESS will primarily look at M-dwarf stars, which are smaller and cooler than the sun, and make up the majority of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Also called red dwarfs, the stars that are TESS's focus have not been thoroughly investigated to determine whether they harbor their own solar systems. George Ricker, who leads the TESS science team at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said the exoplanet surveyor is a \"finder scope\" for the planned James Webb Space Telescope and huge ground-based observatories. \"TESS is a survey machine, and it's going to find the very best planets for us to follow-up, and among that category are these small rocky planets, transiting small red dwarf stars,\" said Sara Seager, deputy science director on the TESS mission at MIT. Ricker said he expects TESS to find between 500 and 1,000 planets that are between one and three times the size of Earth. Up to 20,000 planets the size of Neptune or Jupiter could be discovered by TESS, he said. TESS will build on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler observatory, which astronomers have used to find more than 2,600 exoplanets. But the worlds found by Kepler are much farther away than the ones that TESS will try to detect, and Kepler only looked at certain blocks of the sky. The switch-on of TESS's cameras this week will kick off steps to begin taking test images to ensure the instrument works as designed. The lunar flyby next month will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond the moon, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June. By June 17, TESS will be in its final science orbit and ready to begin the planet hunt, Lockwood said. TESS will end up in an orbit resonant with the moon's, ranging between 67,000 miles and 233,000 miles from Earth. In that orbit, TESS will make one lap around Earth every 13.7 days, about half the time it takes the moon to circle the Earth. The moon's gravity will tug on TESS at a 90-degree angle each time the satellite passes through the moon's orbit, pulling on the spacecraft from one direction as TESS climbs away from Earth, then the opposite direction as it descends back toward the planet. Thanks to the moon, TESS's \"just right\" orbit is gravitationally stable, requiring no maintenance burns to keep spacecraft in the correct location for scientific observations. TESS has enough fuel to keep up its exoplanet hunt for as long as 20 or 30 years, assuming NASA funding and spacecraft components remain robust, Ricker said. \"The overall effect is it actually stabilizes the orbit for TESS,\" Ricker said before the launch. \"This is a type of orbit that's normally unstable. If you aren't careful about the way that you launch into this orbit, you're almost guaranteed to hit the moon within four years. There's a delicate balance that's involved in staying in this orbit, and there's a lot of effort that's gone into it. \"But if you actually manage to do this, this orbit is actually stable for decades. There's no station-keeping required. You don't have to have thrusters or anything ... to maintain the orbit. So it's a very elegant solution to this problem.\" The mission's unique orbit also has other advantages. It stays well above Earth's radiation belts, which pose hazards to spacecraft electronics and imaging sensors, but it comes close enough to Earth to beam imagery back to scientists through NASA's Deep Space Network at high rates. After more than 300 hours of continuous, uninterrupted science observations, TESS will turn and point its Ka-band high-gain antenna toward Earth at perigee, radioing full-frame images to the ground at up to 109 megabits per second, a blistering pace compared to most NASA science missions. TESS will spend the first year of its mission surveying the southern sky, then will switch to the northern sky in 2019. For Lockwood, who has worked on the TESS mission for eight years, last week's launch was a turning point. \"For a while, it didn't really feel real,\" Lockwood said. \"I'd been there so close to the hardware for so long, and then all of a sudden it's not here. \"There was that brief period where I had a surreal feeling, it's no longer around. It's like a kid leaving to go to college, and I've had four kids leave to go to college.\" The launch was \"terrific,\" Lockwood said, timed perfectly and putting TESS on the right trajectory to begin the mission's orbital dance with the moon. TESS started a pre-programmed sequence after separating from the upper stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, and controllers received telemetry moments after the satellite's deployment over the Indian Ocean. The satellite's two power- generating solar array wings unfurled to start generating electricity. \"A lot of guys ran outside to go watch the rocket, but I stayed inside watching on the console,\" Lockwood said. \"For me, it's when it comes off the top of the rocket, and I'm waiting for telemetry to come, and I'm waiting for the solar arrays to deploy. That's when I'm sighing a big sigh of relief.\" ", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2018/04/23/after-terrific-launch-tess-nears-first-major-orbit-raising-burn/"}, {"title": "NASA's new planet-hunting satellite begins climb into science orbit", "date": "2018-04-25", "content": "Looping back near Earth for the first time since its launch one week ago, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite fired its thrusters early Wednesday to begin boosting its orbit toward the moon for a May 17 gravity assist maneuver that will help catapult the probe into its unique science orbit. The spacecraft's thrusters ignited early Thursday to raise the farthest point of TESS's orbit around Earth closer to the moon. The maneuver was timed as TESS reached its first perigee - the low point of its elongated orbit - since launching April 18 from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9 launcher deposited TESS into an elliptical orbit stretching around 170,000 miles from Earth. TESS briefly fired its thrusters Saturday as it reached the farthest point, or apogee, of its initial orbit to raise its perigee from around 150 miles to around 1,400 miles. The next maneuver accomplished early Wednesday positioned TESS's apogee at approximately 220,000 miles, more than 90 percent of the distance of the moon's orbit, according to tracking data published by the U.S. military. Wednesday's thruster firing was the second of six maneuvers planned to send TESS into its final operational orbit. Another burn next week will be timed to occur as TESS reaches its new apogee, followed by two additional perigee maneuvers that will fine-tune the satellite's trajectory and set up for a flyby of the moon May 17. The lunar flyby next month - targeting a distance of around 5,000 miles from the moon - will loop TESS into an orbit that takes it well beyond lunar distance, and a final major thruster firing will reduce the satellite's apogee altitude in June.

As part of camera commissioning, the science team snapped a two-second test exposure using one of the four TESS cameras. The image, centered on the southern constellation Centaurus, reveals more than 200,000 stars. The edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the right upper corner and the bright star Beta Centauri is visible at the lower left edge. TESS is expected to cover more than 400 times as much sky as shown in this image with its four cameras during its initial two-year search for exoplanets. A science-quality image, also referred to as a \"first light\" image, is expected to be released in June. TESS will undergo one final thruster burn on May 30 to enter its science orbit around Earth. This highly elliptical orbit will maximize the amount of sky the spacecraft can image, allowing it to continuously monitor large swaths of the sky. TESS is expected to begin science operations in mid-June after reaching this orbit and completing camera calibrations. Launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on April 18, TESS is the next step in NASA's search for planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets. The mission will observe nearly the entire sky to monitor nearby, bright stars in search of transits - periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of the star.

In addition to the comet, the images reveal a treasure trove of other astronomical activity. The stars appear to shift between white and black as a result of image processing. The shift also highlights variable stars - which change brightness either as a result of pulsation, rapid rotation, or by eclipsing binary neighbors. Asteroids in our solar system appear as small white dots moving across the field of view. Towards the end of the video, one can see a faint broad arc of light moving across the middle section of the frame from left to right. This is stray light from Mars, which is located outside the frame. The images were taken when Mars was at its brightest near opposition, or its closest distance, to Earth. These images were taken during a short period near the end of the mission's commissioning phase, prior to the start of science operations. The movie presents just a small fraction of TESS's active field of view. The team continues to fine-tune the spacecraft's performance as it searches for distant worlds.

The 'TESS Objects of Interest', released to other scientists for follow-up observations on 5 September, include dozens of planetary candidates. TESS launched in April and began its science operations, which are expected to last for two years, in July. The satellite is currently searching for planets in the southern sky; the latest results come from the first slice of that survey. The spacecraft observed 15,900 stars every two minutes during this initial run, in search of the slight dimming caused when planets orbiting those stars cross their face, blocking a small percentage of the starlight. TESS scientists released the list so that other astronomers could make an initial determination as to whether these candidates are planets. There are 73 objects in this first batch, including some planets previously known from ground-based searches, says George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Perhaps 5 to 20% of the objects on the list will turn out to be false alarms, he says. Others, if confirmed, will join the ranks of newly discovered exoplanets. Researchers expect TESS to find as many as 10,000 large planets. But its main goal is to discover and measure the masses of at least 50 small worlds no more than four times the size of Earth. \"The exciting thing about TESS is that it's an opportunity to meet the neighbours,\" says Zachory Berta-Thompson, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder. Some of the new worlds \"may turn out to be the planets that we'll study for decades or centuries to come\", he says. TESS's predecessor, the Kepler spacecraft, has discovered more than 5,300 planets or planetary candidates since its 2009 launch. Having greatly exceeded its initial mission of four years, it is now running low on fuel and starting to have problems pointing at the sky.

TESS finds planets by watching the dip in light as a planet passes in front of its parent star. It began science observations on July 25 and the first set of information was available to astronomers on September 5, but the first step in examining TESS' data is to eliminate false positives. Sometimes a possible \"planet\" will actually be a binary star blocking its companion's light, or it could be sunspots on the star's surface, no second body needed. While most of these planetary candidates will be discarded upon future analysis, principal investigator George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Astronomy there are likely six new bona-fide planets lurking in this data alone. Ricker says that usually five to 20 percent of planetary candidates turn out to be true planets, once the transit method is followed up by the radial velocity method on the ground (which observes the influence of an orbiting object). And even amateurs can help with the search, he said. \"We make alerts available to astronomers worldwide, and we continue to do that, because there are a lot of amateurs with superb instruments they can use for the initial parts of the screening,\" Ricker said, adding the process will likely take months or years due to the number of planetary candidates - suspected rocky planets and larger ones - to double-check. \"As we become more adept at seeking these things out, we are going to get 100 or 200 more [candidates] per sector. There will be a lot to work through. I expect there are going to be 3,000 or so potential objects of interest,\" he added. The hunt for nearby planets: It's a promising start for TESS, which is supposed to find 50 rocky planets - worlds that are four times Earth's diameter, or smaller - in its primary three-year mission. NASA is on a long-term hunt for planets like Earth, and with the long-running Kepler planet-hunter mission running low on fuel, TESS is billed as a logical successor to Kepler's work. While Kepler's primary mission focused on distant stars in a zone of the constellation Cygnus, TESS is an all-sky survey optimized to look at close-up stars. It travels in a never-before-used lunar-resonant orbit that brings TESS around Earth twice for every time that the Moon circles the Earth once. TESS moves its wide view between different sectors of the sky roughly every month. TESS will study stars that are 30 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by Kepler. Brighter stars are easier to observe from the ground if something interesting is found, they are also likely closer than most of Kepler's stars. So the hope is with TESS observations, there will soon be a network of telescopes doing follow-up work on the planets it finds. All NASA missions go through periodic reviews to determine if they should receive more funding for longer periods of work. So far, indications are positive that TESS will exceed its initial goal of 50 rocky planets; TESS' observations are already cleaner than expected. The spacecraft is also expected to find planets that are larger and gaseous, but its formal goal is more focused on rocky planets. Furthermore the spacecraft's trajectory is so efficient that TESS has enough remaining fuel to do its observations for another century or two; in other words, unlike Kepler, the spacecraft's end of life will not come from running out of gas. TESS has also effectively tripled its storage capacity because the spacecraft is more stable than expected in its orbit; this means it takes fewer bits per pixel to generate an image and store it on the spacecraft. During the extended mission, Ricker said the team will try to send information down to Earth even more quickly to catch more short-term phenomena. TESS has already spied several new near-Earth asteroids, one comet, and a supernova during its short time in orbit, but adding a more rapid response will allow astronomers to see more star explosions - as well as events such as tidal disruptions in stars that are orbiting close to another object, such as another star. What the future holds? While the search for \"Earth 2.0\" is still ongoing, Ricker said it's possible there already are small planets sitting in the TESS dataset. \"We've seen indications that there are several small planets that are in this initial set, and we're just going through the process of looking at them and making sure that we really got the properties set and it isn't a false positive,\" he said. The candidates TESS finds will also serve as prime targets for follow up with the James Webb Space Telescope, currently set to launch in 2021. These worlds, if they possess Earth-like life, would have chemical signatures in their atmosphere visible in the infrared - exactly the wavelength regime in which JWST will operate. TESS' sectors are also perfectly poised in JWST's \"continuous viewing zone,\" which is the area of sky it will be able to observe at any time of the year during its orbit. As TESS observations continue, the planets will come pouring in. And as telescopes on the ground and in space follow up, our galactic neighborhood will grow.", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2018/09/tess-begins-the-hunt-for-rocky-worlds"}, {"title": "NASA's New Planet Hunter Has Already Spotted Two Candidates For Earth-Like Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-09-21", "content": "NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has only been on the job less than two months, and already it's ponying up the planet goods. The exoplanet-hunting space telescope has found two candidate planets, and there are plenty more on the horizon. The two candidate planets are called Pi Mensae c, orbiting bright yellow dwarf star Pi Mensae, just under 60 light-years from Earth; and LHS 3844 b, orbiting red dwarf star LHS 3844, just under 49 light-years away. TESS took its first test observations on July 25, and its first official science observations began on August 7. However, it was observing a large swathe of sky from the moment it opened its eyes - four optical cameras - and both discoveries are based on data from July 25 to August 22. So far, they are only candidate planets, yet to be validated by the final review process. If they pass that test, they'll go down in history as TESS's first two discoveries. Here's what we know so far about them. Both planets appear to be Earth-like and rocky, but neither is habitable according to our guidelines - both are too close to their stars for liquid water. Pi Mensae c, the first planet announced, is a super-Earth, clocking in at just over twice the size of Earth. It's really close to Pi Mensae - it orbits the star in just 6.27 days. A preliminary analysis indicates that the planet has a rocky iron core, and also contains a substantial proportion of lighter materials such as water, methane, hydrogen and helium - although we'll need a more detailed survey to confirm that. It also has a sibling - it's not the first object to be found orbiting Pi Mensae. That honour goes to Pi Mensae b, an enormous planet with 10 times the mass of Jupiter discovered in 2001. It's much farther out than Pi Mensae c, on an orbit of 2,083 days. LHS 3844 b is a little bit smaller, classified as a \"hot Earth\". It's just over 1.3 times the size of Earth, and on an incredibly tight orbit of just 11 hours. Since the two are so close together, it's highly likely the planet is blasted with too much stellar radiation to retain an atmosphere. TESS does need a bit of time to collect enough data for identifying an exoplanet. Like its predecessor Kepler, it uses what is known as the transit method for detection - scanning and photographing a region of the sky multiple times, looking for changes in the brightness of stars in its field of view. When a star dims repeatedly and regularly, that is a good indication that a planet is passing between it and TESS. By using the amount the light dims, and Doppler spectroscopy - that is, changes in the star's light as it moves ever-so-slightly backwards and forwards due to the gravitational tug on the planet - astronomers can infer details about the planet, such as its size and mass. Using this method, Kepler has discovered 2,652 confirmed planets to date between its first and second missions, located between 300 to 3,000 light-years away. Kepler is still operational, but barely; it's only a matter of time until it completely runs out of fuel. TESS's search is happening a lot closer, with targets between 30 and 300 light-years away - stars brighter than those observed by Kepler. Thus, the exoplanets it identifies will be strong candidates to observe using spectroscopy, the analysis of light. When a planet passes in front of a star, it has an effect on the light from the star, changing it based on the composition of its atmosphere. Ground-based observatories and the James Webb Space Telescope will have to make those follow-up observations. TESS, meanwhile, has a long way to go. Its mission is scheduled for a two-year period, during which it will survey 85 percent of the sky, divided into 26 sectors. NASA estimates the mission will monitor over half a million stars. Both Pi Mensae c and LHS 3844 b were discovered in the first sector - a result that bodes well for the rest of the mission. Especially since Kepler, launched in 2009, was only planned for 3.5 years. If we're lucky, TESS will end up chugging along well after 2020. \"The discovery of a terrestrial planet around a nearby M dwarf during the first TESS observing sector suggests that the prospects for future discoveries are bright,\" the researchers wrote in the LHS 3844 b paper. \"It is worth remembering that 90 percent of the sky has not yet been surveyed by either TESS or Kepler.\" Both papers are available on preprint resource arXiv. Pi Mensa c can be found here, and LHS 3844 b can be found here.

Ricker says that usually five to 20 percent of planetary candidates turn out to be true planets, once the transit method is followed up by the radial velocity method on the ground (which observes the influence of an orbiting object). And even amateurs can help with the search, he said. \"We make alerts available to astronomers worldwide, and we continue to do that, because there are a lot of amateurs with superb instruments they can use for the initial parts of the screening,\" Ricker said, adding the process will likely take months or years due to the number of planetary candidates - suspected rocky planets and larger ones - to double-check. \"As we become more adept at seeking these things out, we are going to get 100 or 200 more [candidates] per sector. There will be a lot to work through. I expect there are going to be 3,000 or so potential objects of interest,\" he added. The hunt for nearby planets: It's a promising start for TESS, which is supposed to find 50 rocky planets - worlds that are four times Earth's diameter, or smaller - in its primary three-year mission. NASA is on a long-term hunt for planets like Earth, and with the long-running Kepler planet-hunter mission running low on fuel, TESS is billed as a logical successor to Kepler's work. While Kepler's primary mission focused on distant stars in a zone of the constellation Cygnus, TESS is an all-sky survey optimized to look at close-up stars. It travels in a never-before-used lunar-resonant orbit that brings TESS around Earth twice for every time that the Moon circles the Earth once. TESS moves its wide view between different sectors of the sky roughly every month. TESS will study stars that are 30 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by Kepler. Brighter stars are easier to observe from the ground if something interesting is found, they are also likely closer than most of Kepler's stars. So the hope is with TESS observations, there will soon be a network of telescopes doing follow-up work on the planets it finds. All NASA missions go through periodic reviews to determine if they should receive more funding for longer periods of work. So far, indications are positive that TESS will exceed its initial goal of 50 rocky planets; TESS' observations are already cleaner than expected. The spacecraft is also expected to find planets that are larger and gaseous, but its formal goal is more focused on rocky planets. Furthermore the spacecraft's trajectory is so efficient that TESS has enough remaining fuel to do its observations for another century or two; in other words, unlike Kepler, the spacecraft's end of life will not come from running out of gas. TESS has also effectively tripled its storage capacity because the spacecraft is more stable than expected in its orbit; this means it takes fewer bits per pixel to generate an image and store it on the spacecraft. During the extended mission, Ricker said the team will try to send information down to Earth even more quickly to catch more short-term phenomena. TESS has already spied several new near-Earth asteroids, one comet, and a supernova during its short time in orbit, but adding a more rapid response will allow astronomers to see more star explosions - as well as events such as tidal disruptions in stars that are orbiting close to another object, such as another star. What the future holds? While the search for \"Earth 2.0\" is still ongoing, Ricker said it's possible there already are small planets sitting in the TESS dataset. \"We've seen indications that there are several small planets that are in this initial set, and we're just going through the process of looking at them and making sure that we really got the properties set and it isn't a false positive,\" he said. The candidates TESS finds will also serve as prime targets for follow up with the James Webb Space Telescope, currently set to launch in 2021. These worlds, if they possess Earth-like life, would have chemical signatures in their atmosphere visible in the infrared - exactly the wavelength regime in which JWST will operate. TESS' sectors are also perfectly poised in JWST's \"continuous viewing zone,\" which is the area of sky it will be able to observe at any time of the year during its orbit. As TESS observations continue, the planets will come pouring in. And as telescopes on the ground and in space follow up, our galactic neighborhood will grow.", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2018/09/tess-begins-the-hunt-for-rocky-worlds"}, {"title": "NASA's New Planet Hunter Has Already Spotted Two Candidates For Earth-Like Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-09-21", "content": "NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has only been on the job less than two months, and already it's ponying up the planet goods. The exoplanet-hunting space telescope has found two candidate planets, and there are plenty more on the horizon. The two candidate planets are called Pi Mensae c, orbiting bright yellow dwarf star Pi Mensae, just under 60 light-years from Earth; and LHS 3844 b, orbiting red dwarf star LHS 3844, just under 49 light-years away. TESS took its first test observations on July 25, and its first official science observations began on August 7. However, it was observing a large swathe of sky from the moment it opened its eyes - four optical cameras - and both discoveries are based on data from July 25 to August 22. So far, they are only candidate planets, yet to be validated by the final review process. If they pass that test, they'll go down in history as TESS's first two discoveries. Here's what we know so far about them. Both planets appear to be Earth-like and rocky, but neither is habitable according to our guidelines - both are too close to their stars for liquid water. Pi Mensae c, the first planet announced, is a super-Earth, clocking in at just over twice the size of Earth. It's really close to Pi Mensae - it orbits the star in just 6.27 days. A preliminary analysis indicates that the planet has a rocky iron core, and also contains a substantial proportion of lighter materials such as water, methane, hydrogen and helium - although we'll need a more detailed survey to confirm that. It also has a sibling - it's not the first object to be found orbiting Pi Mensae. That honour goes to Pi Mensae b, an enormous planet with 10 times the mass of Jupiter discovered in 2001. It's much farther out than Pi Mensae c, on an orbit of 2,083 days. LHS 3844 b is a little bit smaller, classified as a \"hot Earth\". It's just over 1.3 times the size of Earth, and on an incredibly tight orbit of just 11 hours. Since the two are so close together, it's highly likely the planet is blasted with too much stellar radiation to retain an atmosphere. TESS does need a bit of time to collect enough data for identifying an exoplanet. Like its predecessor Kepler, it uses what is known as the transit method for detection - scanning and photographing a region of the sky multiple times, looking for changes in the brightness of stars in its field of view. When a star dims repeatedly and regularly, that is a good indication that a planet is passing between it and TESS. By using the amount the light dims, and Doppler spectroscopy - that is, changes in the star's light as it moves ever-so-slightly backwards and forwards due to the gravitational tug on the planet - astronomers can infer details about the planet, such as its size and mass. Using this method, Kepler has discovered 2,652 confirmed planets to date between its first and second missions, located between 300 to 3,000 light-years away. Kepler is still operational, but barely; it's only a matter of time until it completely runs out of fuel. TESS's search is happening a lot closer, with targets between 30 and 300 light-years away - stars brighter than those observed by Kepler. Thus, the exoplanets it identifies will be strong candidates to observe using spectroscopy, the analysis of light. When a planet passes in front of a star, it has an effect on the light from the star, changing it based on the composition of its atmosphere. Ground-based observatories and the James Webb Space Telescope will have to make those follow-up observations. TESS, meanwhile, has a long way to go. Its mission is scheduled for a two-year period, during which it will survey 85 percent of the sky, divided into 26 sectors. NASA estimates the mission will monitor over half a million stars. Both Pi Mensae c and LHS 3844 b were discovered in the first sector - a result that bodes well for the rest of the mission. Especially since Kepler, launched in 2009, was only planned for 3.5 years. If we're lucky, TESS will end up chugging along well after 2020. \"The discovery of a terrestrial planet around a nearby M dwarf during the first TESS observing sector suggests that the prospects for future discoveries are bright,\" the researchers wrote in the LHS 3844 b paper. \"It is worth remembering that 90 percent of the sky has not yet been surveyed by either TESS or Kepler.\" Both papers are available on preprint resource arXiv.

But those checkouts should be done relatively soon. \"The TESS team has reported that the spacecraft and cameras are in good health, and the spacecraft has successfully reached its final science orbit,\" NASA officials wrote in an update Wednesday. \"The team continues to conduct tests in order to optimize spacecraft performance, with a goal of beginning science at the end of July.\" That start date would represent a delay of about six weeks; science operations were originally expected to begin in mid-June, NASA officials have said. TESS' work will involve scrutinizing several hundred thousand stars in the sun's neighborhood, looking for tiny brightness dips caused by the passage of orbiting planets across the stars' faces. NASA's famous Kepler space telescope has employed this same \"transit method\" to great effect, discovering about 70 percent of the 3,750 known exoplanets to date. But TESS could be even more prolific than Kepler when everything is said and done, TESS team members have said. And, because TESS will study relatively nearby stars, it should find at least a few worlds whose atmospheres can be analyzed in depth by other instruments, including NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2021. Such follow-up work could conceivably include the search for methane, oxygen and other gases that might be evidence of alien life. TESS' final science orbit is one that no other spacecraft has ever occupied. TESS is zooming around Earth on a highly elliptical, 13.7-day path that takes it as close to our planet as 67,000 miles and as far away as 232,000 miles.

The comet, located about 29 million miles from Earth in the southern constellation Piscis Austrinus, is seen to move across the frame from right to left as it orbits the Sun. The comet's tail, which consists of gases carried away from the comet by an outflow from the Sun called the solar wind, extends to the top of the frame and gradually pivots as the comet glides across the field of view. In addition to the comet, the images reveal a treasure trove of other astronomical activity. The stars appear to shift between white and black as a result of image processing. The shift also highlights variable stars - which change brightness either as a result of pulsation, rapid rotation, or by eclipsing binary neighbors.

The 'TESS Objects of Interest', released to other scientists for follow-up observations on 5 September, include dozens of planetary candidates. TESS launched in April and began its science operations, which are expected to last for two years, in July. The satellite is currently searching for planets in the southern sky; the latest results come from the first slice of that survey. The spacecraft observed 15,900 stars every two minutes during this initial run, in search of the slight dimming caused when planets orbiting those stars cross their face, blocking a small percentage of the starlight. TESS scientists released the list so that other astronomers could make an initial determination as to whether these candidates are planets. There are 73 objects in this first batch, including some planets previously known from ground-based searches, says George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Perhaps 5 to 20% of the objects on the list will turn out to be false alarms, he says. Others, if confirmed, will join the ranks of newly discovered exoplanets. Researchers expect TESS to find as many as 10,000 large planets. But its main goal is to discover and measure the masses of at least 50 small worlds no more than four times the size of Earth. \"The exciting thing about TESS is that it's an opportunity to meet the neighbours,\" says Zachory Berta-Thompson, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Additional partners include Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, Virginia; NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley; the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts; MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts; and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. More than a dozen universities, research institutes and observatories worldwide are participants in the mission.

The 'TESS Objects of Interest', released to other scientists for follow-up observations on 5 September, include dozens of planetary candidates. TESS launched in April and began its science operations, which are expected to last for two years, in July. The satellite is currently searching for planets in the southern sky; the latest results come from the first slice of that survey. The spacecraft observed 15,900 stars every two minutes during this initial run, in search of the slight dimming caused when planets orbiting those stars cross their face, blocking a small percentage of the starlight. TESS scientists released the list so that other astronomers could make an initial determination as to whether these candidates are planets. There are 73 objects in this first batch, including some planets previously known from ground-based searches, says George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Perhaps 5 to 20% of the objects on the list will turn out to be false alarms, he says. Others, if confirmed, will join the ranks of newly discovered exoplanets. Researchers expect TESS to find as many as 10,000 large planets. But its main goal is to discover and measure the masses of at least 50 small worlds no more than four times the size of Earth. \"The exciting thing about TESS is that it's an opportunity to meet the neighbours,\" says Zachory Berta-Thompson, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder. Some of the new worlds \"may turn out to be the planets that we'll study for decades or centuries to come\", he says. TESS's predecessor, the Kepler spacecraft, has discovered more than 5,300 planets or planetary candidates since its 2009 launch. Having greatly exceeded its initial mission of four years, it is now running low on fuel and starting to have problems pointing at the sky.

TESS finds planets by watching the dip in light as a planet passes in front of its parent star. It began science observations on July 25 and the first set of information was available to astronomers on September 5, but the first step in examining TESS' data is to eliminate false positives. Sometimes a possible \"planet\" will actually be a binary star blocking its companion's light, or it could be sunspots on the star's surface, no second body needed. While most of these planetary candidates will be discarded upon future analysis, principal investigator George Ricker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Astronomy there are likely six new bona-fide planets lurking in this data alone. Ricker says that usually five to 20 percent of planetary candidates turn out to be true planets, once the transit method is followed up by the radial velocity method on the ground (which observes the influence of an orbiting object). And even amateurs can help with the search, he said. \"We make alerts available to astronomers worldwide, and we continue to do that, because there are a lot of amateurs with superb instruments they can use for the initial parts of the screening,\" Ricker said, adding the process will likely take months or years due to the number of planetary candidates - suspected rocky planets and larger ones - to double-check. \"As we become more adept at seeking these things out, we are going to get 100 or 200 more [candidates] per sector. There will be a lot to work through. I expect there are going to be 3,000 or so potential objects of interest,\" he added. The hunt for nearby planets: It's a promising start for TESS, which is supposed to find 50 rocky planets - worlds that are four times Earth's diameter, or smaller - in its primary three-year mission. NASA is on a long-term hunt for planets like Earth, and with the long-running Kepler planet-hunter mission running low on fuel, TESS is billed as a logical successor to Kepler's work. While Kepler's primary mission focused on distant stars in a zone of the constellation Cygnus, TESS is an all-sky survey optimized to look at close-up stars. It travels in a never-before-used lunar-resonant orbit that brings TESS around Earth twice for every time that the Moon circles the Earth once. TESS moves its wide view between different sectors of the sky roughly every month. TESS will study stars that are 30 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by Kepler. Brighter stars are easier to observe from the ground if something interesting is found, they are also likely closer than most of Kepler's stars. So the hope is with TESS observations, there will soon be a network of telescopes doing follow-up work on the planets it finds. All NASA missions go through periodic reviews to determine if they should receive more funding for longer periods of work. So far, indications are positive that TESS will exceed its initial goal of 50 rocky planets; TESS' observations are already cleaner than expected. The spacecraft is also expected to find planets that are larger and gaseous, but its formal goal is more focused on rocky planets. Furthermore the spacecraft's trajectory is so efficient that TESS has enough remaining fuel to do its observations for another century or two; in other words, unlike Kepler, the spacecraft's end of life will not come from running out of gas. TESS has also effectively tripled its storage capacity because the spacecraft is more stable than expected in its orbit; this means it takes fewer bits per pixel to generate an image and store it on the spacecraft. During the extended mission, Ricker said the team will try to send information down to Earth even more quickly to catch more short-term phenomena. TESS has already spied several new near-Earth asteroids, one comet, and a supernova during its short time in orbit, but adding a more rapid response will allow astronomers to see more star explosions - as well as events such as tidal disruptions in stars that are orbiting close to another object, such as another star. What the future holds? While the search for \"Earth 2.0\" is still ongoing, Ricker said it's possible there already are small planets sitting in the TESS dataset. \"We've seen indications that there are several small planets that are in this initial set, and we're just going through the process of looking at them and making sure that we really got the properties set and it isn't a false positive,\" he said. The candidates TESS finds will also serve as prime targets for follow up with the James Webb Space Telescope, currently set to launch in 2021. These worlds, if they possess Earth-like life, would have chemical signatures in their atmosphere visible in the infrared - exactly the wavelength regime in which JWST will operate. TESS' sectors are also perfectly poised in JWST's \"continuous viewing zone,\" which is the area of sky it will be able to observe at any time of the year during its orbit. As TESS observations continue, the planets will come pouring in. And as telescopes on the ground and in space follow up, our galactic neighborhood will grow.", "url": "https://astronomy.com/news/2018/09/tess-begins-the-hunt-for-rocky-worlds"}, {"title": "NASA's New Planet Hunter Has Already Spotted Two Candidates For Earth-Like Alien Worlds", "date": "2018-09-21", "content": "NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has only been on the job less than two months, and already it's ponying up the planet goods. The exoplanet-hunting space telescope has found two candidate planets, and there are plenty more on the horizon. The two candidate planets are called Pi Mensae c, orbiting bright yellow dwarf star Pi Mensae, just under 60 light-years from Earth; and LHS 3844 b, orbiting red dwarf star LHS 3844, just under 49 light-years away. TESS took its first test observations on July 25, and its first official science observations began on August 7. However, it was observing a large swathe of sky from the moment it opened its eyes - four optical cameras - and both discoveries are based on data from July 25 to August 22. So far, they are only candidate planets, yet to be validated by the final review process. If they pass that test, they'll go down in history as TESS's first two discoveries. Here's what we know so far about them. Both planets appear to be Earth-like and rocky, but neither is habitable according to our guidelines - both are too close to their stars for liquid water. Pi Mensae c, the first planet announced, is a super-Earth, clocking in at just over twice the size of Earth. It's really close to Pi Mensae - it orbits the star in just 6.27 days. A preliminary analysis indicates that the planet has a rocky iron core, and also contains a substantial proportion of lighter materials such as water, methane, hydrogen and helium - although we'll need a more detailed survey to confirm that. It also has a sibling - it's not the first object to be found orbiting Pi Mensae. That honour goes to Pi Mensae b, an enormous planet with 10 times the mass of Jupiter discovered in 2001. It's much farther out than Pi Mensae c, on an orbit of 2,083 days. LHS 3844 b is a little bit smaller, classified as a \"hot Earth\". It's just over 1.3 times the size of Earth, and on an incredibly tight orbit of just 11 hours. Since the two are so close together, it's highly likely the planet is blasted with too much stellar radiation to retain an atmosphere. TESS does need a bit of time to collect enough data for identifying an exoplanet. Like its predecessor Kepler, it uses what is known as the transit method for detection - scanning and photographing a region of the sky multiple times, looking for changes in the brightness of stars in its field of view. When a star dims repeatedly and regularly, that is a good indication that a planet is passing between it and TESS. By using the amount the light dims, and Doppler spectroscopy - that is, changes in the star's light as it moves ever-so-slightly backwards and forwards due to the gravitational tug on the planet - astronomers can infer details about the planet, such as its size and mass. Using this method, Kepler has discovered 2,652 confirmed planets to date between its first and second missions, located between 300 to 3,000 light-years away. Kepler is still operational, but barely; it's only a matter of time until it completely runs out of fuel. TESS's search is happening a lot closer, with targets between 30 and 300 light-years away - stars brighter than those observed by Kepler. Thus, the exoplanets it identifies will be strong candidates to observe using spectroscopy, the analysis of light. When a planet passes in front of a star, it has an effect on the light from the star, changing it based on the composition of its atmosphere. Ground-based observatories and the James Webb Space Telescope will have to make those follow-up observations. TESS, meanwhile, has a long way to go. Its mission is scheduled for a two-year period, during which it will survey 85 percent of the sky, divided into 26 sectors. NASA estimates the mission will monitor over half a million stars. Both Pi Mensae c and LHS 3844 b were discovered in the first sector - a result that bodes well for the rest of the mission. Especially since Kepler, launched in 2009, was only planned for 3.5 years. If we're lucky, TESS will end up chugging along well after 2020. \"The discovery of a terrestrial planet around a nearby M dwarf during the first TESS observing sector suggests that the prospects for future discoveries are bright,\" the researchers wrote in the LHS 3844 b paper. \"It is worth remembering that 90 percent of the sky has not yet been surveyed by either TESS or Kepler.\" Both papers are available on preprint resource arXiv. Pi Mensa c can be found here, and LHS 3844 b can be found here.

Even stranger, there are hints that another planet not much bigger than Earth is orbiting closer to the star.

Mission scientists have studied 101 stars that brightened suddenly, probably because they were exploding supernovae, says Michael Fausnaugh, an astronomer at MIT. Because TESS stares non-stop at one slice of the sky for 27 days, then moves to a neighbouring slice, it captures an unprecedented view of these exploding stars as they brighten and then dim. \"Based on the brightness and shape of that flare, there's a lot of science that can be done,\" Fausnaugh says. For instance, astronomers can scrutinize the way in which the light increases for clues to the type of star that exploded to create a particular flash. TESS discovered six supernovae in just its first month of observing; its predecessor, NASA's Kepler space telescope, discovered five over the course of four years, Fausnaugh says. TESS is in the process of scanning the entire southern sky, after which it will turn and canvass the northern sky. The spacecraft could conceivably keep working for decades, Ricker says.

For instance, astronomers can scrutinize the way in which the light increases for clues to the type of star that exploded to create a particular flash. TESS discovered six supernovae in just its first month of observing; its predecessor, NASA's Kepler space telescope, discovered five over the course of four years, Fausnaugh says. TESS is in the process of scanning the entire southern sky, after which it will turn and canvass the northern sky. The spacecraft could conceivably keep working for decades, Ricker says. His team is now writing a proposal to NASA asking that TESS's mission be extended past its initial two years. That deadline for the proposal was 1 February - but the ongoing partial US government shutdown means Ricker isn't sure how that timing could change.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite spotted the planet, as well as a weird \"sub-Neptune\" world, circling the star HD 21749, which lies about 53 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. \"It's so exciting that TESS, which launched just about a year ago, is already a game-changer in the planet-hunting business,\" study co-author Johanna Teske, of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. TESS soared to Earth orbit in April 2018 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to hunt for planets around some of the closest and brightest stars in the sky. This work involves looking for the tiny brightness dips that occur when alien worlds cross their host stars' faces from the spacecraft's perspective. NASA's recently deceased Kepler space telescope also used this \"transit method,\" and to great effect; Kepler has found about 70% of the 4,000 exoplanets discovered to date. But TESS' total tally should end up topping that of Kepler, NASA officials have said. Astronomers hope TESS spots some potentially habitable worlds in systems that are near enough for other instruments - such as NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope - to study in detail. James Webb, which is due to launch in 2021, will probe the atmospheres of such planets, looking for gases that might be signs of life. But the newfound Earth-size world, HD 21749c, doesn't seem to have good life- hosting potential. It circles its host star very tightly, completing one orbit every 7.8 Earth days, and is therefore probably quite hot. TESS' data indicate how much of the stellar disk a planet blocks during a transit, which in turn allows researchers to determine a world's size. But figuring out an exoplanet's mass requires data from other instruments - specifically, ground-based spectrographs that measure the gravitational tug the world exerts on its host star. The study team used data from various spectrographs, including the Planet Finder Spectrograph instrument on the Magellan II telescope at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, to nail down the newfound sub- Neptune's mass. This exoplanet, known as HD 21749b, is about 23 times heftier than Earth and 2.7 times wider than our home world. Those numbers suggest HD 21749b is gaseous rather than rocky, but not as puffy as its closest comparisons in our solar system, Uranus and Neptune. HD 21749b has an orbital period of 36 Earth days - the longest of any TESS planet to date, study team members said. The exoplanet's surface temperature probably hovers around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, the researchers said in January, when they announced the existence of HD 21749b and hints of its smaller neighbor. That newly confirmed neighbor, HD 21749c, appears to be about the same size as Earth, but its mass is tough to nail down at present. \"Measuring the exact mass and composition of such a small planet will be challenging, but important for comparing HD 21749c to Earth,\" study co-author Sharon Wang, also of the DTM, said in the same statement. \"Carnegie's PFS team is continuing to collect data on this object with this goal in mind.\" Though HD 21749c does not seem to be suitable for Earth-like life, other TESS finds may well fit that bill, researchers said. \"For stars that are very close by and very bright, we expected to find up to a couple dozen Earth-sized planets,\" study lead author Diana Dragomir, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said in the same statement.

The planet, called L 98-59b, marks the tiniest discovered by TESS to date. Two other worlds orbit the same star. While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present. The L 98-59 worlds nearly double the number of small exoplanets - that is, planets beyond our solar system - that have the best potential for this kind of follow-up. \"The discovery is a great engineering and scientific accomplishment for TESS,\" said Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"For atmospheric studies of small planets, you need short orbits around bright stars, but such planets are difficult to detect. This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in the June 27 issue of The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans. While L 98-59b is a record for TESS, even smaller planets have been discovered in data collected by NASA's Kepler satellite, including Kepler-37b, which is only 20% larger than the Moon. The two other worlds in the system, L 98-59c and L 98-59d, are respectively around 1.4 and 1.6 times Earth's size. All three were discovered by TESS using transits, periodic dips in the star's brightness caused when each planet passes in front of it. TESS monitors one 24-by-96-degree region of the sky, called a sector, for 27 days at a time. When the satellite finishes its first year of observations in July, the L 98-59 system will have appeared in seven of the 13 sectors that make up the southern sky. Kostov's team hopes this will allow scientists to refine what's known about the three confirmed planets and search for additional worlds. \"If you have more than one planet orbiting in a system, they can gravitationally interact with each other,\" said Jonathan Brande, a co-author and astrophysicist at Goddard and the University of Maryland, College Park. \"TESS will observe L 98-59 in enough sectors that it may be able to detect planets with orbits around 100 days. But if we get really lucky, we might see the gravitational effects of undiscovered planets on the ones we currently know.\" M dwarfs like L 98-59 account for three-quarters of our Milky Way galaxy's stellar population. But they are no larger than about half the Sun's mass and are much cooler, with surface temperatures less than 70% of the Sun's. Other examples include TRAPPIST-1, which hosts a system of seven Earth-size planets, and Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, which has one confirmed planet. Because these small, cool stars are so common, scientists want to learn more about the planetary systems that form around them. L 98-59b, the innermost world, orbits every 2.25 days, staying so close to the star it receives as much as 22 times the amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun. The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \" habitable zone ,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, all of them occupy what scientists call the Venus zone, a range of stellar distances where a planet with an initial Earth-like atmosphere could experience a runaway greenhouse effect that transforms it into a Venus-like atmosphere. Based on its size, the third planet could be either a Venus-like rocky world or one more like Neptune, with a small, rocky core cocooned beneath a deep atmosphere. One of TESS's goals is to build a catalog of small, rocky planets on short orbits around very bright, nearby stars for atmospheric study by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

The planet, called L 98-59b, marks the tiniest discovered by TESS to date. Two other worlds orbit the same star. While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present. The L 98-59 worlds nearly double the number of small exoplanets - that is, planets beyond our solar system - that have the best potential for this kind of follow-up. \"The discovery is a great engineering and scientific accomplishment for TESS,\" said Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"For atmospheric studies of small planets, you need short orbits around bright stars, but such planets are difficult to detect. This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans. While L 98-59b is a record for TESS, even smaller planets have been discovered in data collected by NASA's Kepler satellite, including Kepler-37b, which is only 20% larger than the Moon. The two other worlds in the system, L 98-59c and L 98-59d, are respectively around 1.4 and 1.6 times Earth's size. All three were discovered by TESS using transits, periodic dips in the star's brightness caused when each planet passes in front of it. TESS monitors one 24-by-96-degree region of the sky, called a sector, for 27 days at a time. When the satellite finishes its first year of observations in July, the L 98-59 system will have appeared in seven of the 13 sectors that make up the southern sky. Kostov's team hopes this will allow scientists to refine what's known about the three confirmed planets and search for additional worlds. \"If you have more than one planet orbiting in a system, they can gravitationally interact with each other,\" said Jonathan Brande, a co-author and astrophysicist at Goddard and the University of Maryland, College Park. \"TESS will observe L 98-59 in enough sectors that it may be able to detect planets with orbits around 100 days. But if we get really lucky, we might see the gravitational effects of undiscovered planets on the ones we currently know.\" M dwarfs like L 98-59 account for three-quarters of our Milky Way galaxy's stellar population. But they are no larger than about half the Sun's mass and are much cooler, with surface temperatures less than 70% of the Sun's. Other examples include TRAPPIST-1, which hosts a system of seven Earth-size planets, and Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, which has one confirmed planet. Because these small, cool stars are so common, scientists want to learn more about the planetary systems that form around them. L 98-59b, the innermost world, orbits every 2.25 days, staying so close to the star it receives as much as 22 times the amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun. The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \"habitable zone,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, all of them occupy what scientists call the Venus zone, a range of stellar distances where a planet with an initial Earth-like atmosphere could experience a runaway greenhouse effect that transforms it into a Venus-like atmosphere. Based on its size, the third planet could be either a Venus-like rocky world or one more like Neptune, with a small, rocky core cocooned beneath a deep atmosphere. One of TESS's goals is to build a catalog of small, rocky planets on short orbits around very bright, nearby stars for atmospheric study by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

In fact, asteroseismologists - stellar astronomers who study seismic waves in stars that appear as changes in brightness - often provide critical information for finding the properties of newly discovered planets. This teamwork enabled the discovery and characterization of the first planet identified by TESS for which the oscillations of its host star can be measured. The planet - TOI 197.01 - is described as a \"hot Saturn\" in a recently accepted scientific paper. That's because the planet is about the same size as Saturn and is also very close to its star, completing an orbit in just 14 days, and therefore very hot. The Astronomical Journal will publish the paper written by an international team of 141 astronomers. Daniel Huber, an assistant astronomer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Institute for Astronomy, is the lead author of the paper. Steve Kawaler, a professor of physics and astronomy; and Miles Lucas, an undergraduate student, are co-authors from Iowa State University. \"This is the first bucketful of water from the firehose of data we're getting from TESS,\" Kawaler said. TESS - the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, led by astrophysicists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on April 18, 2018. The spacecraft's primary mission is to find exoplanets, planets beyond our solar system. The spacecraft's four cameras are taking nearly month-long looks at 26 vertical strips of the sky - first over the southern hemisphere and then over the northern. After two years, TESS will have scanned 85 percent of the sky. Astronomers sort through the images, looking for transits, the tiny dips in a star's light caused by an orbiting planet passing in front of it. NASA's Kepler Mission - a predecessor to TESS - looked for planets in the same way, but scanned a narrow slice of the Milky Way galaxy and focused on distant stars. TESS is targeting bright, nearby stars, allowing astronomers to follow up on its discoveries using other space and ground observations to further study and characterize stars and planets. In another paper recently published online by The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, astronomers from the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium identified a target list of sun-like oscillating stars to be studied using TESS data - a list featuring 25,000 stars. Kawaler - who witnessed the launch of Kepler in 2009, and was in Florida for the launch of TESS - is on the seven-member TASC Board. The group is led by J\u00f8rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark. TASC astronomers use asteroseismic modeling to determine a host star's radius, mass and age. That data can be combined with other observations and measurements to determine the properties of orbiting planets. In the case of host star TOI-197, the asteroseismolgists used its oscillations to determine it's about 5 billion years old and is a little heavier and larger than the sun. They also determined that planet TOI-197.01 is a gas planet with a radius about nine times the Earth's, making it roughly the size of Saturn. It's also 1/13th the density of Earth and about 60 times the mass of Earth. Those findings say a lot about the TESS work ahead: \"TOI-197 provides a first glimpse at the strong potential of TESS to characterize exoplanets using asteroseismology,\" the astronomers wrote in their paper. Kawaler is expecting that the flood of data coming from TESS will also contain some scientific surprises. \"The thing that's exciting is that TESS is the only game in town for a while and the data are so good that we're planning to try to do science we hadn't thought about,\" Kawaler said. \"Maybe we can also look at the very faint stars - the white dwarfs - that are my first love and represent the future of our sun and solar system.\" ", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/isu-dff032719.php"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Exoplanet Mission Finds 1st Earth-Size Alien World", "date": "2019-04-16", "content": "NASA's newest planet hunter has discovered its first Earth-size alien world. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite spotted the planet, as well as a weird \"sub-Neptune\" world, circling the star HD 21749, which lies about 53 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. \"It's so exciting that TESS, which launched just about a year ago, is already a game-changer in the planet-hunting business,\" study co-author Johanna Teske, of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. TESS soared to Earth orbit in April 2018 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to hunt for planets around some of the closest and brightest stars in the sky. This work involves looking for the tiny brightness dips that occur when alien worlds cross their host stars' faces from the spacecraft's perspective. NASA's recently deceased Kepler space telescope also used this \"transit method,\" and to great effect; Kepler has found about 70% of the 4,000 exoplanets discovered to date. But TESS' total tally should end up topping that of Kepler, NASA officials have said. Astronomers hope TESS spots some potentially habitable worlds in systems that are near enough for other instruments - such as NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope - to study in detail. James Webb, which is due to launch in 2021, will probe the atmospheres of such planets, looking for gases that might be signs of life. But the newfound Earth-size world, HD 21749c, doesn't seem to have good life- hosting potential. It circles its host star very tightly, completing one orbit every 7.8 Earth days, and is therefore probably quite hot. TESS' data indicate how much of the stellar disk a planet blocks during a transit, which in turn allows researchers to determine a world's size. But figuring out an exoplanet's mass requires data from other instruments - specifically, ground-based spectrographs that measure the gravitational tug the world exerts on its host star. The study team used data from various spectrographs, including the Planet Finder Spectrograph instrument on the Magellan II telescope at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, to nail down the newfound sub- Neptune's mass. This exoplanet, known as HD 21749b, is about 23 times heftier than Earth and 2.7 times wider than our home world. Those numbers suggest HD 21749b is gaseous rather than rocky, but not as puffy as its closest comparisons in our solar system, Uranus and Neptune. HD 21749b has an orbital period of 36 Earth days - the longest of any TESS planet to date, study team members said. The exoplanet's surface temperature probably hovers around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, the researchers said in January, when they announced the existence of HD 21749b and hints of its smaller neighbor. That newly confirmed neighbor, HD 21749c, appears to be about the same size as Earth, but its mass is tough to nail down at present. \"Measuring the exact mass and composition of such a small planet will be challenging, but important for comparing HD 21749c to Earth,\" study co-author Sharon Wang, also of the DTM, said in the same statement. \"Carnegie's PFS team is continuing to collect data on this object with this goal in mind.\" Though HD 21749c does not seem to be suitable for Earth-like life, other TESS finds may well fit that bill, researchers said. \"For stars that are very close by and very bright, we expected to find up to a couple dozen Earth-sized planets,\" study lead author Diana Dragomir, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said in the same statement. HD 21749c \"sets the path for finding smaller planets around even smaller stars, and those planets may potentially be habitable,\" she added.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active.

They showed that the distant solar system - with a diminutive M-type dwarf sun, about one-third the size of our own sun - harbors three planets, with one of those in that system's habitable zone: GJ 357 d. Last February, the TESS satellite observed that the dwarf sun GJ 357 dimmed very slightly every 3.9 days, evidence of a transiting planet moving across the star's face. That planet was GJ 357 b, a so-called \"hot Earth\" about 22% larger than Earth, according to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which guides TESS. Follow-up observations from the ground led to the discovery of two more exoplanetary siblings: GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. The international team of scientists collected Earth-based telescopic data going back two decades - to reveal the newly found exoplanets' tiny gravitational tugs on its host star, according to NASA. Exoplanet GJ 357 c sizzles at 260 degrees Fahrenheit and has at least 3.4 times Earth's mass. However, the system's outermost known sibling planet - GJ 357 d, a super-Earth - could provide Earth-like conditions and orbits the dwarf star every 55.7 days at a distance about one-fifth of Earth's distance from the sun. It is not yet known if this planet transits its sun. Kaltenegger, doctoral candidate Jack Madden and undergraduate student Zifan Lin '20 simulated light fingerprints, climates and remotely detectable spectra for a planet that could range from a rocky composition to a water world. Madden explained that investigating new discoveries provides an opportunity to test theories and models. \"We built the first models of what this new world could be like,\" he said. \"Just knowing that liquid water can exist on the surface of this planet motivates scientists to find ways of detecting signs of life.\" Lin described the work from an undergraduate perspective: \"Working on a newly discovered planet is something of a dream come true.

In fact, asteroseismologists - stellar astronomers who study seismic waves in stars that appear as changes in brightness - often provide critical information for finding the properties of newly discovered planets. This teamwork enabled the discovery and characterization of the first planet identified by TESS for which the oscillations of its host star can be measured. The planet - TOI 197.01 - is described as a \"hot Saturn\" in a recently accepted scientific paper. That's because the planet is about the same size as Saturn and is also very close to its star, completing an orbit in just 14 days, and therefore very hot. The Astronomical Journal will publish the paper written by an international team of 141 astronomers. Daniel Huber, an assistant astronomer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Institute for Astronomy, is the lead author of the paper. Steve Kawaler, a professor of physics and astronomy; and Miles Lucas, an undergraduate student, are co-authors from Iowa State University. \"This is the first bucketful of water from the firehose of data we're getting from TESS,\" Kawaler said. TESS - the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, led by astrophysicists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on April 18, 2018. The spacecraft's primary mission is to find exoplanets, planets beyond our solar system. The spacecraft's four cameras are taking nearly month-long looks at 26 vertical strips of the sky - first over the southern hemisphere and then over the northern. After two years, TESS will have scanned 85 percent of the sky. Astronomers sort through the images, looking for transits, the tiny dips in a star's light caused by an orbiting planet passing in front of it. NASA's Kepler Mission - a predecessor to TESS - looked for planets in the same way, but scanned a narrow slice of the Milky Way galaxy and focused on distant stars. TESS is targeting bright, nearby stars, allowing astronomers to follow up on its discoveries using other space and ground observations to further study and characterize stars and planets. In another paper recently published online by The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, astronomers from the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium identified a target list of sun-like oscillating stars to be studied using TESS data - a list featuring 25,000 stars. Kawaler - who witnessed the launch of Kepler in 2009, and was in Florida for the launch of TESS - is on the seven-member TASC Board. The group is led by J\u00f8rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark. TASC astronomers use asteroseismic modeling to determine a host star's radius, mass and age. That data can be combined with other observations and measurements to determine the properties of orbiting planets. In the case of host star TOI-197, the asteroseismolgists used its oscillations to determine it's about 5 billion years old and is a little heavier and larger than the sun. They also determined that planet TOI-197.01 is a gas planet with a radius about nine times the Earth's, making it roughly the size of Saturn. It's also 1/13th the density of Earth and about 60 times the mass of Earth. Those findings say a lot about the TESS work ahead: \"TOI-197 provides a first glimpse at the strong potential of TESS to characterize exoplanets using asteroseismology,\" the astronomers wrote in their paper. Kawaler is expecting that the flood of data coming from TESS will also contain some scientific surprises. \"The thing that's exciting is that TESS is the only game in town for a while and the data are so good that we're planning to try to do science we hadn't thought about,\" Kawaler said. \"Maybe we can also look at the very faint stars - the white dwarfs - that are my first love and represent the future of our sun and solar system.\" ", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/isu-dff032719.php"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS Exoplanet Mission Finds 1st Earth-Size Alien World", "date": "2019-04-16", "content": "NASA's newest planet hunter has discovered its first Earth-size alien world. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite spotted the planet, as well as a weird \"sub-Neptune\" world, circling the star HD 21749, which lies about 53 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. \"It's so exciting that TESS, which launched just about a year ago, is already a game-changer in the planet-hunting business,\" study co-author Johanna Teske, of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. TESS soared to Earth orbit in April 2018 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to hunt for planets around some of the closest and brightest stars in the sky. This work involves looking for the tiny brightness dips that occur when alien worlds cross their host stars' faces from the spacecraft's perspective. NASA's recently deceased Kepler space telescope also used this \"transit method,\" and to great effect; Kepler has found about 70% of the 4,000 exoplanets discovered to date. But TESS' total tally should end up topping that of Kepler, NASA officials have said. Astronomers hope TESS spots some potentially habitable worlds in systems that are near enough for other instruments - such as NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope - to study in detail. James Webb, which is due to launch in 2021, will probe the atmospheres of such planets, looking for gases that might be signs of life. But the newfound Earth-size world, HD 21749c, doesn't seem to have good life- hosting potential. It circles its host star very tightly, completing one orbit every 7.8 Earth days, and is therefore probably quite hot. TESS' data indicate how much of the stellar disk a planet blocks during a transit, which in turn allows researchers to determine a world's size. But figuring out an exoplanet's mass requires data from other instruments - specifically, ground-based spectrographs that measure the gravitational tug the world exerts on its host star. The study team used data from various spectrographs, including the Planet Finder Spectrograph instrument on the Magellan II telescope at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, to nail down the newfound sub- Neptune's mass. This exoplanet, known as HD 21749b, is about 23 times heftier than Earth and 2.7 times wider than our home world. Those numbers suggest HD 21749b is gaseous rather than rocky, but not as puffy as its closest comparisons in our solar system, Uranus and Neptune. HD 21749b has an orbital period of 36 Earth days - the longest of any TESS planet to date, study team members said. The exoplanet's surface temperature probably hovers around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, the researchers said in January, when they announced the existence of HD 21749b and hints of its smaller neighbor. That newly confirmed neighbor, HD 21749c, appears to be about the same size as Earth, but its mass is tough to nail down at present. \"Measuring the exact mass and composition of such a small planet will be challenging, but important for comparing HD 21749c to Earth,\" study co-author Sharon Wang, also of the DTM, said in the same statement. \"Carnegie's PFS team is continuing to collect data on this object with this goal in mind.\" Though HD 21749c does not seem to be suitable for Earth-like life, other TESS finds may well fit that bill, researchers said. \"For stars that are very close by and very bright, we expected to find up to a couple dozen Earth-sized planets,\" study lead author Diana Dragomir, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said in the same statement. HD 21749c \"sets the path for finding smaller planets around even smaller stars, and those planets may potentially be habitable,\" she added.

While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present. The L 98-59 worlds nearly double the number of small exoplanets - that is, planets beyond our solar system - that have the best potential for this kind of follow-up. \"The discovery is a great engineering and scientific accomplishment for TESS,\" said Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"For atmospheric studies of small planets, you need short orbits around bright stars, but such planets are difficult to detect. This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in the June 27 issue of The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans. While L 98-59b is a record for TESS, even smaller planets have been discovered in data collected by NASA's Kepler satellite, including Kepler-37b, which is only 20% larger than the Moon. The two other worlds in the system, L 98-59c and L 98-59d, are respectively around 1.4 and 1.6 times Earth's size. All three were discovered by TESS using transits, periodic dips in the star's brightness caused when each planet passes in front of it. TESS monitors one 24-by-96-degree region of the sky, called a sector, for 27 days at a time. When the satellite finishes its first year of observations in July, the L 98-59 system will have appeared in seven of the 13 sectors that make up the southern sky. Kostov's team hopes this will allow scientists to refine what's known about the three confirmed planets and search for additional worlds. \"If you have more than one planet orbiting in a system, they can gravitationally interact with each other,\" said Jonathan Brande, a co-author and astrophysicist at Goddard and the University of Maryland, College Park. \"TESS will observe L 98-59 in enough sectors that it may be able to detect planets with orbits around 100 days.

But they are no larger than about half the Sun's mass and are much cooler, with surface temperatures less than 70% of the Sun's. Other examples include TRAPPIST-1, which hosts a system of seven Earth-size planets, and Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, which has one confirmed planet. Because these small, cool stars are so common, scientists want to learn more about the planetary systems that form around them. L 98-59b, the innermost world, orbits every 2.25 days, staying so close to the star it receives as much as 22 times the amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun. The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \" habitable zone ,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, all of them occupy what scientists call the Venus zone, a range of stellar distances where a planet with an initial Earth-like atmosphere could experience a runaway greenhouse effect that transforms it into a Venus-like atmosphere. Based on its size, the third planet could be either a Venus-like rocky world or one more like Neptune, with a small, rocky core cocooned beneath a deep atmosphere. One of TESS's goals is to build a catalog of small, rocky planets on short orbits around very bright, nearby stars for atmospheric study by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active.

TESS team leader Dr Lisa Kaltenegger, from Cornell's Carl Sagan Institute in the US, said: \"This is exciting, as this is humanity's first nearby super- Earth that could harbour* life. \"With a thick atmosphere, the planet GJ 357 d could maintain liquid water on its surface like Earth and we could pick out signs of life with upcoming telescopes soon to be online.\" Signs of habitability* on any planet include a rocky landscape, a size similar to Earth and being within the \"Goldilocks\" zone, a distance from the planet's sun that is not too hot and not too cold but just right. The right temperature allows for the existence of liquid water, a key requirement for life. Given its distance from its star, similar to that of Mars to our Sun, researchers estimate the planet has temperatures of -53C, Mr Luque said. \"That seems a little cold at first,\" he said. But \"if this planet had an atmosphere, it could retain the heat it receives from its star, and water could be liquid.\" Researchers also estimate GJ 357 d could be roughly the same size as Earth or up to twice the size. WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet. That's how scientists discovered Proxima b, another potentially habitable planet, in 2016. This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible. Until technology improves, to measure a planet's size, density and what it is made of, a planet has to pass directly between its star and an observer. This is called the transit* method. In the coming months, Mr Luque and his team will be trying to get lucky and catch GJ 357d in \"transit\" to confirm some more details about it. \"The probability that a planet passes in front of a star from our line of vision on Earth is pretty small,\" he said. Jack Madden, of the Carl Sagan Institute, explained that investigating new discoveries provides an opportunity to test ideas and models. Mr Madden said: \"We built the first models of what this new world could be like.\" He added: \"Just knowing that liquid water can exist on the surface of this planet motivates* scientists to find ways of detecting signs of life.\"", "url": "https://www.kidsnews.com.au/space/astronomers-find-new-solar-system-three-new-planets-and-one-goldilocks-planet-that-could-support-life/news-story/23b091ff790694f4190bb9b07a689228"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS satellite discovers nearby 'super-Earth planet' that could 'harbour life'", "date": "2019-08-07", "content": "Scientists have characterised the first potentially habitable world outside our own solar system located about 31 light-years away.

Astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands and the University of La Laguna, both in Spain, announced the discovery of the GJ 357 system in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. They showed that the distant solar system - with a diminutive M-type dwarf sun, about one-third the size of our own sun - harbours three planets, with one of those in that system's habitable zone: GJ 357 d. Last February, the TESS satellite observed that the dwarf sun GJ 357 dimmed very slightly every 3.9 days, evidence of a transiting planet moving across the star's face. That planet was GJ 357 b, a so-called \"hot Earth\" about 22 per cent larger than Earth, according to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which guides TESS. Follow-up observations from the ground led to the discovery of two more exoplanetary siblings: GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. The international team of scientists collected Earth-based telescopic data going back two decades -- to reveal the newly found exoplanets' tiny gravitational tugs on its host star, according to NASA. Exoplanet GJ 357 c sizzles at 127 degrees Celsius and has at least 3.4 times Earth's mass. However, the system's outermost known sibling planet - GJ 357 d, a super-Earth -- could provide Earth-like conditions and orbits the dwarf star every 55.7 days at a distance about one-fifth of Earth's distance from the sun.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite spotted the planet, as well as a weird \"sub-Neptune\" world, circling the star HD 21749, which lies about 53 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. \"It's so exciting that TESS, which launched just about a year ago, is already a game-changer in the planet-hunting business,\" study co-author Johanna Teske, of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. TESS soared to Earth orbit in April 2018 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to hunt for planets around some of the closest and brightest stars in the sky. This work involves looking for the tiny brightness dips that occur when alien worlds cross their host stars' faces from the spacecraft's perspective. NASA's recently deceased Kepler space telescope also used this \"transit method,\" and to great effect; Kepler has found about 70% of the 4,000 exoplanets discovered to date. But TESS' total tally should end up topping that of Kepler, NASA officials have said. Astronomers hope TESS spots some potentially habitable worlds in systems that are near enough for other instruments - such as NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope - to study in detail. James Webb, which is due to launch in 2021, will probe the atmospheres of such planets, looking for gases that might be signs of life. But the newfound Earth-size world, HD 21749c, doesn't seem to have good life- hosting potential. It circles its host star very tightly, completing one orbit every 7.8 Earth days, and is therefore probably quite hot. TESS' data indicate how much of the stellar disk a planet blocks during a transit, which in turn allows researchers to determine a world's size. But figuring out an exoplanet's mass requires data from other instruments - specifically, ground-based spectrographs that measure the gravitational tug the world exerts on its host star. The study team used data from various spectrographs, including the Planet Finder Spectrograph instrument on the Magellan II telescope at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, to nail down the newfound sub- Neptune's mass. This exoplanet, known as HD 21749b, is about 23 times heftier than Earth and 2.7 times wider than our home world. Those numbers suggest HD 21749b is gaseous rather than rocky, but not as puffy as its closest comparisons in our solar system, Uranus and Neptune. HD 21749b has an orbital period of 36 Earth days - the longest of any TESS planet to date, study team members said. The exoplanet's surface temperature probably hovers around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, the researchers said in January, when they announced the existence of HD 21749b and hints of its smaller neighbor. That newly confirmed neighbor, HD 21749c, appears to be about the same size as Earth, but its mass is tough to nail down at present. \"Measuring the exact mass and composition of such a small planet will be challenging, but important for comparing HD 21749c to Earth,\" study co-author Sharon Wang, also of the DTM, said in the same statement. \"Carnegie's PFS team is continuing to collect data on this object with this goal in mind.\" Though HD 21749c does not seem to be suitable for Earth-like life, other TESS finds may well fit that bill, researchers said. \"For stars that are very close by and very bright, we expected to find up to a couple dozen Earth-sized planets,\" study lead author Diana Dragomir, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said in the same statement. HD 21749c \"sets the path for finding smaller planets around even smaller stars, and those planets may potentially be habitable,\" she added.

The planet, called L 98-59b, marks the tiniest discovered by TESS to date. Two other worlds orbit the same star. While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present. The L 98-59 worlds nearly double the number of small exoplanets - that is, planets beyond our solar system - that have the best potential for this kind of follow-up. \"The discovery is a great engineering and scientific accomplishment for TESS,\" said Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"For atmospheric studies of small planets, you need short orbits around bright stars, but such planets are difficult to detect. This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in the June 27 issue of The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans. While L 98-59b is a record for TESS, even smaller planets have been discovered in data collected by NASA's Kepler satellite, including Kepler-37b, which is only 20% larger than the Moon. The two other worlds in the system, L 98-59c and L 98-59d, are respectively around 1.4 and 1.6 times Earth's size. All three were discovered by TESS using transits, periodic dips in the star's brightness caused when each planet passes in front of it. TESS monitors one 24-by-96-degree region of the sky, called a sector, for 27 days at a time. When the satellite finishes its first year of observations in July, the L 98-59 system will have appeared in seven of the 13 sectors that make up the southern sky. Kostov's team hopes this will allow scientists to refine what's known about the three confirmed planets and search for additional worlds. \"If you have more than one planet orbiting in a system, they can gravitationally interact with each other,\" said Jonathan Brande, a co-author and astrophysicist at Goddard and the University of Maryland, College Park. \"TESS will observe L 98-59 in enough sectors that it may be able to detect planets with orbits around 100 days. But if we get really lucky, we might see the gravitational effects of undiscovered planets on the ones we currently know.\" M dwarfs like L 98-59 account for three-quarters of our Milky Way galaxy's stellar population. But they are no larger than about half the Sun's mass and are much cooler, with surface temperatures less than 70% of the Sun's. Other examples include TRAPPIST-1, which hosts a system of seven Earth-size planets, and Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, which has one confirmed planet. Because these small, cool stars are so common, scientists want to learn more about the planetary systems that form around them. L 98-59b, the innermost world, orbits every 2.25 days, staying so close to the star it receives as much as 22 times the amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun. The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \" habitable zone ,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, all of them occupy what scientists call the Venus zone, a range of stellar distances where a planet with an initial Earth-like atmosphere could experience a runaway greenhouse effect that transforms it into a Venus-like atmosphere. Based on its size, the third planet could be either a Venus-like rocky world or one more like Neptune, with a small, rocky core cocooned beneath a deep atmosphere. One of TESS's goals is to build a catalog of small, rocky planets on short orbits around very bright, nearby stars for atmospheric study by NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. Four of the TRAPPIST-1 worlds are prime candidates, and Kostov's team suggests the L 98-59 planets are as well.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active.

WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet. That's how scientists discovered Proxima b, another potentially habitable planet, in 2016. This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible. Until technology improves, to measure a planet's size, density and what it is made of, a planet has to pass directly between its star and an observer. This is called the transit* method. In the coming months, Mr Luque and his team will be trying to get lucky and catch GJ 357d in \"transit\" to confirm some more details about it. \"The probability that a planet passes in front of a star from our line of vision on Earth is pretty small,\" he said. Jack Madden, of the Carl Sagan Institute, explained that investigating new discoveries provides an opportunity to test ideas and models.

Astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands and the University of La Laguna, both in Spain, announced the discovery of the GJ 357 system in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. They showed that the distant solar system - with a diminutive M-type dwarf sun, about one-third the size of our own sun - harbours three planets, with one of those in that system's habitable zone: GJ 357 d. Last February, the TESS satellite observed that the dwarf sun GJ 357 dimmed very slightly every 3.9 days, evidence of a transiting planet moving across the star's face. That planet was GJ 357 b, a so-called \"hot Earth\" about 22 per cent larger than Earth, according to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which guides TESS. Follow-up observations from the ground led to the discovery of two more exoplanetary siblings: GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. The international team of scientists collected Earth-based telescopic data going back two decades -- to reveal the newly found exoplanets' tiny gravitational tugs on its host star, according to NASA. Exoplanet GJ 357 c sizzles at 127 degrees Celsius and has at least 3.4 times Earth's mass. However, the system's outermost known sibling planet - GJ 357 d, a super-Earth -- could provide Earth-like conditions and orbits the dwarf star every 55.7 days at a distance about one-fifth of Earth's distance from the sun.

The phenomenon, known as a tidal disruption event, was captured in detail by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Researchers published their findings of the event in The Astrophysical Journal on Thursday. Scientists used an international network of 20 robotic telescopes called ASAS-SN to detect the tidal disruption event back in January, before turning to TESS, which caught the beginning of the cosmic showdown. Using its permanent viewing zones, TESS was able to watch the star getting sucked into the black hole and collect necessary data used to study the event. NASA released an animated video illustrating the cataclysmic phenomenon. \"TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before,\" Thomas Holoien from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, said in a statement on NASA's website. \"The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts.\" Chris Kochanek, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, marveled at how fortunate it was to have the event occurring in the systems' lines of sight: \"This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward.\" Tidal disruption events are rare and stars need to be very close to a black hole in order to create one. Researchers said this type of cosmic event happens once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. However, since there are billions of galaxies in the universe, scientists have been able to observe about 40 tidal disruptions over the years. Yet they're still very hard to come by. \"Imagine that you are standing on top of a skyscraper downtown, and you drop a marble off the top, and you are trying to get it to go down a hole in a manhole cover,\" Kochanek said. \"It's harder than that.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-black-hole-star-image-visualization-simulation-swallowing-planet-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "TESS Mission Discovers Smallest Planet to Date", "date": "2019-06-29", "content": "NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered a world between the sizes of Mars and Earth orbiting a bright, cool, nearby star.

While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present.

This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in the June 27 issue of The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans.

The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \" habitable zone ,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active.

The other two planets found in the new solar system are closer to the red dwarf and are thought to be too hot for life. The potentially habitable planet was found using NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS.

The right temperature allows for the existence of liquid water, a key requirement for life. Given its distance from its star, similar to that of Mars to our Sun, researchers estimate the planet has temperatures of -53C, Mr Luque said. \"That seems a little cold at first,\" he said. But \"if this planet had an atmosphere, it could retain the heat it receives from its star, and water could be liquid.\" Researchers also estimate GJ 357 d could be roughly the same size as Earth or up to twice the size. WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet.

This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible.

Astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands and the University of La Laguna, both in Spain, announced the discovery of the GJ 357 system in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. They showed that the distant solar system - with a diminutive M-type dwarf sun, about one-third the size of our own sun - harbours three planets, with one of those in that system's habitable zone: GJ 357 d. Last February, the TESS satellite observed that the dwarf sun GJ 357 dimmed very slightly every 3.9 days, evidence of a transiting planet moving across the star's face. That planet was GJ 357 b, a so-called \"hot Earth\" about 22 per cent larger than Earth, according to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which guides TESS. Follow-up observations from the ground led to the discovery of two more exoplanetary siblings: GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. The international team of scientists collected Earth-based telescopic data going back two decades -- to reveal the newly found exoplanets' tiny gravitational tugs on its host star, according to NASA. Exoplanet GJ 357 c sizzles at 127 degrees Celsius and has at least 3.4 times Earth's mass. However, the system's outermost known sibling planet - GJ 357 d, a super-Earth -- could provide Earth-like conditions and orbits the dwarf star every 55.7 days at a distance about one-fifth of Earth's distance from the sun. It is not yet known if this planet transits its sun. Kaltenegger, doctoral candidate Jack Madden and undergraduate student Zifan Lin simulated light fingerprints, climates and remotely detectable spectra for a planet that could range from a rocky composition to a water world. \"We built the first models of what this new world could be like. Just knowing that liquid water can exist on the surface of this planet motivates scientists to find ways of detecting signs of life,\" Madden said. \"If GJ 357 d were to show signs of life, it would be at the top of everyone's travel list - and we could answer a 1,000-year-old question on whether we are alone in the cosmos,\" Kaltenegger said.

The phenomenon, known as a tidal disruption event, was captured in detail by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Researchers published their findings of the event in The Astrophysical Journal on Thursday. Scientists used an international network of 20 robotic telescopes called ASAS-SN to detect the tidal disruption event back in January, before turning to TESS, which caught the beginning of the cosmic showdown. Using its permanent viewing zones, TESS was able to watch the star getting sucked into the black hole and collect necessary data used to study the event. NASA released an animated video illustrating the cataclysmic phenomenon. \"TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before,\" Thomas Holoien from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, said in a statement on NASA's website. \"The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts.\" Chris Kochanek, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, marveled at how fortunate it was to have the event occurring in the systems' lines of sight: \"This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward.\" Tidal disruption events are rare and stars need to be very close to a black hole in order to create one. Researchers said this type of cosmic event happens once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. However, since there are billions of galaxies in the universe, scientists have been able to observe about 40 tidal disruptions over the years. Yet they're still very hard to come by. \"Imagine that you are standing on top of a skyscraper downtown, and you drop a marble off the top, and you are trying to get it to go down a hole in a manhole cover,\" Kochanek said. \"It's harder than that.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-black-hole-star-image-visualization-simulation-swallowing-planet-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "TESS Mission Discovers Smallest Planet to Date", "date": "2019-06-29", "content": "NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered a world between the sizes of Mars and Earth orbiting a bright, cool, nearby star.

While all three planets' sizes are known, further study with other telescopes will be needed to determine if they have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present. The L 98-59 worlds nearly double the number of small exoplanets - that is, planets beyond our solar system - that have the best potential for this kind of follow-up. \"The discovery is a great engineering and scientific accomplishment for TESS,\" said Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. \"For atmospheric studies of small planets, you need short orbits around bright stars, but such planets are difficult to detect. This system has the potential for fascinating future studies.\" A paper on the findings, led by Kostov, was published in the June 27 issue of The Astronomical Journal and is now available online. L 98-59b is around 80% Earth's size and about 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS. Its host star, L 98-59, is an M dwarf about one-third the mass of the Sun and lies about 35 light-years away in the southern constellation Volans. While L 98-59b is a record for TESS, even smaller planets have been discovered in data collected by NASA's Kepler satellite, including Kepler-37b, which is only 20% larger than the Moon. The two other worlds in the system, L 98-59c and L 98-59d, are respectively around 1.4 and 1.6 times Earth's size. All three were discovered by TESS using transits, periodic dips in the star's brightness caused when each planet passes in front of it. TESS monitors one 24-by-96-degree region of the sky, called a sector, for 27 days at a time. When the satellite finishes its first year of observations in July, the L 98-59 system will have appeared in seven of the 13 sectors that make up the southern sky. Kostov's team hopes this will allow scientists to refine what's known about the three confirmed planets and search for additional worlds. \"If you have more than one planet orbiting in a system, they can gravitationally interact with each other,\" said Jonathan Brande, a co-author and astrophysicist at Goddard and the University of Maryland, College Park. \"TESS will observe L 98-59 in enough sectors that it may be able to detect planets with orbits around 100 days.

But they are no larger than about half the Sun's mass and are much cooler, with surface temperatures less than 70% of the Sun's. Other examples include TRAPPIST-1, which hosts a system of seven Earth-size planets, and Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, which has one confirmed planet. Because these small, cool stars are so common, scientists want to learn more about the planetary systems that form around them. L 98-59b, the innermost world, orbits every 2.25 days, staying so close to the star it receives as much as 22 times the amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun. The middle planet, L 98-59c, orbits every 3.7 days and experiences about 11 times as much radiation as Earth. L 98-59d, the farthest planet identified in the system so far, orbits every 7.5 days and is blasted with around four times the radiant energy as Earth. None of the planets lie within the star's \" habitable zone ,\" the range of distances from the star where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, all of them occupy what scientists call the Venus zone, a range of stellar distances where a planet with an initial Earth-like atmosphere could experience a runaway greenhouse effect that transforms it into a Venus-like atmosphere. Based on its size, the third planet could be either a Venus-like rocky world or one more like Neptune, with a small, rocky core cocooned beneath a deep atmosphere.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active.

The planet is one of three within a new solar system discovered by an international team of astronomers. The three new planets were discovered orbiting GJ 357, a red dwarf. A red dwarf is a small and cooling star. The distance of 31 light years is relatively close in space terms, said lead researcher and astrophysicist* Rafael Luque of Spain's Institute of Astrophysics. The other two planets found in the new solar system are closer to the red dwarf and are thought to be too hot for life. The potentially habitable planet was found using NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS.

The right temperature allows for the existence of liquid water, a key requirement for life. Given its distance from its star, similar to that of Mars to our Sun, researchers estimate the planet has temperatures of -53C, Mr Luque said. \"That seems a little cold at first,\" he said. But \"if this planet had an atmosphere, it could retain the heat it receives from its star, and water could be liquid.\" Researchers also estimate GJ 357 d could be roughly the same size as Earth or up to twice the size. WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet. That's how scientists discovered Proxima b, another potentially habitable planet, in 2016. This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible. Until technology improves, to measure a planet's size, density and what it is made of, a planet has to pass directly between its star and an observer. This is called the transit* method. In the coming months, Mr Luque and his team will be trying to get lucky and catch GJ 357d in \"transit\" to confirm some more details about it. \"The probability that a planet passes in front of a star from our line of vision on Earth is pretty small,\" he said.

The phenomenon, known as a tidal disruption event, was captured in detail by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Researchers published their findings of the event in The Astrophysical Journal on Thursday. Scientists used an international network of 20 robotic telescopes called ASAS-SN to detect the tidal disruption event back in January, before turning to TESS, which caught the beginning of the cosmic showdown. Using its permanent viewing zones, TESS was able to watch the star getting sucked into the black hole and collect necessary data used to study the event.

Researchers said this type of cosmic event happens once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. However, since there are billions of galaxies in the universe, scientists have been able to observe about 40 tidal disruptions over the years. Yet they're still very hard to come by. \"Imagine that you are standing on top of a skyscraper downtown, and you drop a marble off the top, and you are trying to get it to go down a hole in a manhole cover,\" Kochanek said. \"It's harder than that.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-black-hole-star-image-visualization-simulation-swallowing-planet-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS spacecraft is finding hundreds of exoplanets - and is poised to find thousands more", "date": "2019-11-05", "content": "Within just 50 light-years from Earth, there are about 1,560 stars, likely orbited by several thousand planets. About a thousand of these extrasolar planets - known as exoplanets - may be rocky and have a composition similar to Earth's. Some may even harbor life. Over 99% of these alien worlds remain undiscovered - but this is about to change. With NASA's new exoplanet-hunter space telescope TESS, the all-sky search is on for possibly habitable planets close to our solar system. TESS - orbiting Earth every 13.7 days - and ground-based telescopes are poised to find hundreds of planets over the next few years. This could transform astronomers' understanding of alien worlds around us and provide targets to scan with next-generation telescopes for signatures of life. In just over a year, TESS has identified more than 1,200 planetary candidates, 29 of which astronomers have already confirmed as planets. Given TESS's unique ability to simultaneously search tens of thousands of stars for planets, the mission is expected to yield over 10,000 new worlds. These are exciting times for astronomers and, especially, for those of us exploring exoplanets. We are members of the planet-hunting Project EDEN, which also supports TESS's work. We use telescopes on the ground and in space to find exoplanets to understand their properties and potential for harboring life. ## Undiscovered worlds all around us: Worlds around us await discovery. Take, for example, Proxima Centauri, an unassuming, faint red star, invisible without a telescope. It is one of over a hundred billion or so such stars within our galaxy, unremarkable except for its status as our next-door neighbor. Orbiting Proxima is a fascinating but mysterious world, called Proxmia b, discovered only in 2016. Scientists know surprisingly little about Proxima b. Astronomers name the first planet discovered in a system \"b\". This planet has never been seen with human eyes or by a telescope. But we know it exists due to its gravitational pull on its host star, which makes the star wobble ever so slightly. This slight wobble was found in measurements collected by a large, international group of astronomers from data taken with multiple ground-based telescopes. Proxima b very likely has a rocky composition similar to Earth's, but higher mass. It receives about the same amount of heat as Earth receives from the Sun. And that is what makes this planet so exciting: It lies in the \"habitable\" zone and just might have properties similar to Earth's, like a surface, liquid water, and - who knows? - maybe even an atmosphere bearing the telltale chemical signs of life. NASA's TESS mission launched in April 2018 to hunt for other broadly Earth-sized planets, but with a different method. TESS is looking for rare dimming events that happen when planets pass in front of their host stars, blocking some starlight. These transit events indicate not only the presence of the planets, but also their sizes and orbits. Finding a new transiting exoplanet is a big deal for astronomers like us because, unlike those found through stellar wobbles, worlds seen transiting can be studied further to determine their densities and atmospheric compositions. Red dwarf suns: For us, the most exciting exoplanets are the smallest ones, which TESS can detect when they orbit small stars called red dwarfs - stars with masses less than half the mass of our Sun. Each of these systems is unique. For example, LP 791-18 is a red dwarf star 86 light-years from Earth around which TESS found two worlds. The first is a \"super-Earth,\" a planet larger than Earth but probably still mostly rocky, and the second is a \"mini-Neptune,\" a planet smaller than Neptune but gas- and ice-rich. Neither of these planets have counterparts in our solar system. Among astronomers' current favorites of the new broadly Earth-sized planets is LHS 3884b, a scorching \"hot Earth\" that orbits its sun so quickly that on it you could celebrate your birthday every 11 hours. No Earth-like worlds yet: But how Earth-like are Earth-sized planets? The promise of finding nearby worlds for detailed studies is already paying off. A team of astronomers observed the hot super-Earth LHS 3884b with the Hubble Space Telescope and found the planet to be a horrible vacation spot, without even an atmosphere. It is just a bare rock with temperatures ranging from over 700 C at noon to near absolute zero at midnight. The TESS mission was initially funded for two years. But the spacecraft is in excellent shape and NASA recently extended the mission through 2022, doubling the time TESS will have to scan nearby, bright stars for transits. However, finding exoplanets around the coolest stars - those with temperatures less than about 2700 C - will still be a challenge due to their extreme faintness. Since ultracool dwarfs provide our best opportunity to find and study exoplanets with sizes and temperatures similar to Earth's, other focused planet searches are picking up where TESS leaves off. The worlds TESS can't find: In May 2016, a Belgian-led group announced the discovery of a planetary system around the ultracool dwarf they christened TRAPPIST-1. The discovery of the seven transiting Earth-sized exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system was groundbreaking. It also demonstrated how small telescopes - relative to the powerful behemoths of our age - can still make transformational discoveries. With patience and persistence, the TRAPPIST telescope scanned nearby faint, red dwarf stars from its high-mountain perch in the Atacama desert for small, telltale dips in their brightnesses. Eventually, it spotted transits in the data for the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1, which - although just 41 light-years away - is too faint for TESS's four 10-cm diameter lenses. Its Earth-sized worlds would have remained undiscovered had the TRAPPIST team's larger telescope not found them. Two projects have upped up the game in the search for exo-Earth candidates around nearby red dwarfs. The SPECULOOS team installed four robotic telescopes - also in the Atacama desert - and one in the Northern Hemisphere. Our Exoearth Discovery and Exploration Network - Project EDEN - uses nine telescopes in Arizona, Italy, Spain and Taiwan to observe red dwarf stars continuously. The SPECULOOS and EDEN telescopes are much larger than TESS's small lenses and can find planets around stars too faint for TESS to study, including some of the transiting Earth-sized planets closest to us. The decade of new worlds: The next decade is likely to be remembered as the time when we opened our eyes to the incredible diversity of other worlds. TESS is likely to find between 10,000 and 15,000 exoplanet candidates by 2025. By 2030, the European Space Agency's GAIA and PLATO missions are expected to find another 20,000-35,000 planets. GAIA will look for stellar wobbles introduced by planets, while PLATO will search for planetary transits as TESS does. However, even among the thousands of planets that will soon be found, the exoplanets closest to our solar system will remain special. Many of these worlds can be studied in great detail - including the search for signs of life. Discoveries of the nearest worlds also represent major steps in humanity's progress in exploring the universe we live in. After mapping our own planet and then the solar system, we now turn to nearby planetary systems. Perhaps one day Proxima b or another nearby world astronomers have yet to find will be the target for interstellar probes, like Project Starshot, or even crewed starships. But first we've got to put these worlds on the map.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/nasas-tess-spacecraft-is-finding-hundreds-of-exoplanets-and-is-poised-to-find-thousands-more-122104"}, {"title": "Unimaginable View of Milky Way From Year of Observations by NASA TESS - 29 Exoplanets Discovered", "date": "2019-11-06", "content": "The glow of the Milky Way - our galaxy seen edgewise - arcs across a sea of stars in an incredible new mosaic of the southern sky produced from a year of observations by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Constructed from 208 TESS images taken during the mission's first year of science operations, completed on July 18, the southern panorama reveals both the beauty of the cosmic landscape and the reach of TESS's cameras. \"Analysis of TESS data focuses on individual stars and planets one at a time, but I wanted to step back and highlight everything at once, really emphasizing the spectacular view TESS gives us of the entire sky,\" said Ethan Kruse, a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow who assembled the mosaic at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Within this scene, TESS has discovered 29 exoplanets, or worlds beyond our solar system, and more than 1,000 candidate planets astronomers are now investigating. TESS divided the southern sky into 13 sectors and imaged each one of them for nearly a month using four cameras, which carry a total of 16 charge-coupled devices. Remarkably, the TESS cameras capture a full sector of the sky every 30 minutes as part of its search for exoplanet transits. Transits occur when a planet passes in front of its host star from our perspective, briefly and regularly dimming its light. During the satellite's first year of operations, each of its CCDs captured 15,347 30-minute science images. These images are just a part of more than 20 terabytes of southern sky data TESS has returned, comparable to streaming nearly 6,000 high-definition movies. In addition to its planet discoveries, TESS has imaged a comet in our solar system, followed the progress of numerous stellar explosions called supernovae, and even caught the flare from a star ripped apart by a supermassive black hole.

The planet, named L 98-59b, measures between the size of Earth and Mars and is around 10% smaller than the previous record holder discovered by TESS, which is around the same size as Earth, according to a statement by NASA. \"This system has the potential for fascinating future studies,\" Veselin Kostov, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who helped spot the new planet, said in the statement. L 98-59b is orbiting a nearby bright star, which is around one-third the mass of our sun. TESS also found two other planets in the same system, which are around 1.4 and 1.6 times the size of Earth, according to NASA. However, scientists aren't sure yet whether these planets have atmospheres and, if so, which gases are present in them. None of the three planets are likely to host life; they all lie outside their star's habitable zone, the range of distances from a star where liquid water could exist on a world's surface, NASA officials said. Dwarf stars like the one hosting these three planets make up three-quarters of the stars in our galaxy, and therefore scientists want to learn more about the worlds that form around them. TESS launched in April 2018 with a key goal of developing a catalog of small, rocky planets that orbit around nearby stars. Scientists' plan is to then revisit those planets with the James Webb Space Telescope once that instrument launches in 2021 in order to help us better understand our own solar system, as well as its surrounding universe. \"We still have many questions about why Earth became habitable and Venus did not,\" Joshua Schlieder, another astrophysicist at Goddard and researcher on the project, said in the same statement. \"If we can find and study similar examples around other stars, like L 98-59, we can potentially unlock some of those secrets.\" The discovery is described in a paper published on June 27 in The Astronomical Journal.", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-tess-discovers-tiny-alien-planet.html"}, {"title": "NASA TESS telescope finds nearby 'super-Earth' and 2 'sub-Neptunes'", "date": "2019-07-29", "content": "Three newly discovered worlds are among the smallest and nearest we've ever detected. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS - a super-powerful orbiting telescope designed to hunt for alien worlds - found the planets orbiting a star just 73 light-years away. One is a rocky \"super-Earth\" that's more massive than our home planet but lighter than giants like Neptune. The other two are icy \"sub-Neptunes\" that are about half the size of Neptune. The sub-Neptune that's farthest from its star appears to be within its habitable zone, meaning the planet is just the right distance away to hold liquid water. However, scientists think its atmosphere is probably too thick to support life, since it likely traps too much heat. Still, the researchers say the star - named TOI-270, since it's the 270th \"TESS Object of Interest\" - could have other planets in its habitable zone. These could also offer clues about how our own solar system formed. TESS is NASA's most powerful planet-hunting telescope yet: TESS is a car-sized, highly sensitive telescope that launched in April 2018. Two months later, it settled into a unique orbit between Earth and the moon and started scanning the sky up to 300 light-years from our solar system. Specifically, TESS is looking for exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. To hunt for these exoplanets, TESS watches thousands of stars for \"transits,\" tiny dips in a star's brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of it. It observes one patch of the sky for 27 days before moving on to a new patch. Each half of the sky has 13 patches. Once the mission ends a year from now, TESS will have observed over 85% of the sky. Scientists expect that it will have identified thousands of exoplanet candidates, some of which could be habitable. TESS has found over 850 potential new planets since it launched, though only 24 have been confirmed as exoplanets. Ground-based telescopes will help to analyze the rest. The three newly discovered planets are among the 10 closest confirmed planets TESS has identified. Sub-Neptunes and a super-Earth: The newly discovered star system has something ours doesn't: Its two sub- Neptunes are \"intermediate\" planets, with a size and composition somewhere between that of Earth and Neptune. That means rocky super-Earth isn't much smalleir than its neighbors, unlike in our own solar system. \"There are a lot of little pieces of the puzzle that we can solve with this system,\" Maximilian G\u00fcnther, the lead author of a paper about the discovery published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said in a press release. Our own solar system is one of extremes, with huge differences in size and composition between the small, rocky inner planets and the distant ice giants. So astronomers think the two sub-Neptunes could help them figure out whether small, rocky, Earth- like planets form in the same way as massive icy ones, or whether they follow different paths. The new worlds also exhibit a unique mathematical quality that researchers don't fully understand yet. The planets line up, with the ratio of their orbits falling very close to whole numbers: The two inner planets have a ratio of 3:5, since the super-Earth takes three days to orbit its star and the closer sub-Neptune takes five days. The ratio between the middle sub-Neptune and the outer one, which has an 11-day orbit, is about 2:1. \"These planets line up like pearls on a string,\" G\u00fcnther said. \"That's a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical behavior. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.\" Similar math shows up in planets orbiting other stars and in the moons of Jupiter. More distant planets are waiting to be found: The TOI-270 star is ideal for studying these planets' properties because it's relatively close to Earth and therefore bright. Plus, although it's a type of dwarf star that normally has lots of flares and solar storms, TOI-270 is unusually quiet because it's old and has become less active. Researchers plan to continue studying the star system with other tools, including the James Webb Space Telescope, expected to launch in 2021.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-tess-telescope-finds-nearby-super-earth-sub-neptunes-2019-7"}, {"title": "TESS satellite uncovers its 'first nearby super-Earth'", "date": "2019-07-31", "content": "An international team of astronomers led by Cornell's Lisa Kaltenegger has characterized the first potentially habitable world outside of our solar system discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

The planet is one of three within a new solar system discovered by an international team of astronomers. The three new planets were discovered orbiting GJ 357, a red dwarf. A red dwarf is a small and cooling star. The distance of 31 light years is relatively close in space terms, said lead researcher and astrophysicist* Rafael Luque of Spain's Institute of Astrophysics. The other two planets found in the new solar system are closer to the red dwarf and are thought to be too hot for life. The potentially habitable planet was found using NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS.

The right temperature allows for the existence of liquid water, a key requirement for life. Given its distance from its star, similar to that of Mars to our Sun, researchers estimate the planet has temperatures of -53C, Mr Luque said. \"That seems a little cold at first,\" he said. But \"if this planet had an atmosphere, it could retain the heat it receives from its star, and water could be liquid.\" Researchers also estimate GJ 357 d could be roughly the same size as Earth or up to twice the size. WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet. That's how scientists discovered Proxima b, another potentially habitable planet, in 2016. This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible. Until technology improves, to measure a planet's size, density and what it is made of, a planet has to pass directly between its star and an observer. This is called the transit* method. In the coming months, Mr Luque and his team will be trying to get lucky and catch GJ 357d in \"transit\" to confirm some more details about it. \"The probability that a planet passes in front of a star from our line of vision on Earth is pretty small,\" he said.

In just over a year, TESS has identified more than 1,200 planetary candidates, 29 of which astronomers have already confirmed as planets. Given TESS's unique ability to simultaneously search tens of thousands of stars for planets, the mission is expected to yield over 10,000 new worlds. These are exciting times for astronomers and, especially, for those of us exploring exoplanets. We are members of the planet-hunting Project EDEN, which also supports TESS's work. We use telescopes on the ground and in space to find exoplanets to understand their properties and potential for harboring life. ## Undiscovered worlds all around us: Worlds around us await discovery. Take, for example, Proxima Centauri, an unassuming, faint red star, invisible without a telescope. It is one of over a hundred billion or so such stars within our galaxy, unremarkable except for its status as our next-door neighbor. Orbiting Proxima is a fascinating but mysterious world, called Proxmia b, discovered only in 2016. Scientists know surprisingly little about Proxima b. Astronomers name the first planet discovered in a system \"b\". This planet has never been seen with human eyes or by a telescope. But we know it exists due to its gravitational pull on its host star, which makes the star wobble ever so slightly. This slight wobble was found in measurements collected by a large, international group of astronomers from data taken with multiple ground-based telescopes. Proxima b very likely has a rocky composition similar to Earth's, but higher mass. It receives about the same amount of heat as Earth receives from the Sun. And that is what makes this planet so exciting: It lies in the \"habitable\" zone and just might have properties similar to Earth's, like a surface, liquid water, and - who knows? - maybe even an atmosphere bearing the telltale chemical signs of life. NASA's TESS mission launched in April 2018 to hunt for other broadly Earth-sized planets, but with a different method. TESS is looking for rare dimming events that happen when planets pass in front of their host stars, blocking some starlight. These transit events indicate not only the presence of the planets, but also their sizes and orbits. Finding a new transiting exoplanet is a big deal for astronomers like us because, unlike those found through stellar wobbles, worlds seen transiting can be studied further to determine their densities and atmospheric compositions. Red dwarf suns: For us, the most exciting exoplanets are the smallest ones, which TESS can detect when they orbit small stars called red dwarfs - stars with masses less than half the mass of our Sun. Each of these systems is unique. For example, LP 791-18 is a red dwarf star 86 light-years from Earth around which TESS found two worlds. The first is a \"super-Earth,\" a planet larger than Earth but probably still mostly rocky, and the second is a \"mini-Neptune,\" a planet smaller than Neptune but gas- and ice-rich. Neither of these planets have counterparts in our solar system. Among astronomers' current favorites of the new broadly Earth-sized planets is LHS 3884b, a scorching \"hot Earth\" that orbits its sun so quickly that on it you could celebrate your birthday every 11 hours. No Earth-like worlds yet: But how Earth-like are Earth-sized planets? The promise of finding nearby worlds for detailed studies is already paying off. A team of astronomers observed the hot super-Earth LHS 3884b with the Hubble Space Telescope and found the planet to be a horrible vacation spot, without even an atmosphere. It is just a bare rock with temperatures ranging from over 700 C at noon to near absolute zero at midnight. The TESS mission was initially funded for two years. But the spacecraft is in excellent shape and NASA recently extended the mission through 2022, doubling the time TESS will have to scan nearby, bright stars for transits. However, finding exoplanets around the coolest stars - those with temperatures less than about 2700 C - will still be a challenge due to their extreme faintness. Since ultracool dwarfs provide our best opportunity to find and study exoplanets with sizes and temperatures similar to Earth's, other focused planet searches are picking up where TESS leaves off. The worlds TESS can't find: In May 2016, a Belgian-led group announced the discovery of a planetary system around the ultracool dwarf they christened TRAPPIST-1. The discovery of the seven transiting Earth-sized exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system was groundbreaking. It also demonstrated how small telescopes - relative to the powerful behemoths of our age - can still make transformational discoveries. With patience and persistence, the TRAPPIST telescope scanned nearby faint, red dwarf stars from its high-mountain perch in the Atacama desert for small, telltale dips in their brightnesses. Eventually, it spotted transits in the data for the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1, which - although just 41 light-years away - is too faint for TESS's four 10-cm diameter lenses. Its Earth-sized worlds would have remained undiscovered had the TRAPPIST team's larger telescope not found them. Two projects have upped up the game in the search for exo-Earth candidates around nearby red dwarfs. The SPECULOOS team installed four robotic telescopes - also in the Atacama desert - and one in the Northern Hemisphere. Our Exoearth Discovery and Exploration Network - Project EDEN - uses nine telescopes in Arizona, Italy, Spain and Taiwan to observe red dwarf stars continuously. The SPECULOOS and EDEN telescopes are much larger than TESS's small lenses and can find planets around stars too faint for TESS to study, including some of the transiting Earth-sized planets closest to us. The decade of new worlds: The next decade is likely to be remembered as the time when we opened our eyes to the incredible diversity of other worlds. TESS is likely to find between 10,000 and 15,000 exoplanet candidates by 2025. By 2030, the European Space Agency's GAIA and PLATO missions are expected to find another 20,000-35,000 planets. GAIA will look for stellar wobbles introduced by planets, while PLATO will search for planetary transits as TESS does. However, even among the thousands of planets that will soon be found, the exoplanets closest to our solar system will remain special. Many of these worlds can be studied in great detail - including the search for signs of life. Discoveries of the nearest worlds also represent major steps in humanity's progress in exploring the universe we live in. After mapping our own planet and then the solar system, we now turn to nearby planetary systems. Perhaps one day Proxima b or another nearby world astronomers have yet to find will be the target for interstellar probes, like Project Starshot, or even crewed starships.

This is the most complete and detailed observation to date of the formation and dissipation of a naturally-occurring comet outburst. The team members reported their results in the November 22, 2019, issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"TESS spends nearly a month at a time imaging one portion of the sky. With no day or night breaks and no atmospheric interference, we have a very uniform, long-duration set of observations,\" said Tony Farnham, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and the lead author of the research paper. \"As comets orbit the Sun, they can pass through TESS' field of view. Wirtanen was a high priority for us because of its close approach in late 2018, so we decided to use its appearance in the TESS images as a test case to see what we could get out of it. We did so and were very surprised!\" \"While TESS is a powerhouse for discovering planets orbiting nearby, bright stars, its observing strategy enables so much exciting additional science,\" said TESS project scientist Padi Boyd of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Since the TESS data are rapidly made public through NASA's Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, it's exciting to see scientists identifying which data are of interest to them, and then doing all kinds of additional serendipitous science beyond exoplanets .\" Normal comet activity is driven by sunlight vaporizing the ices near the surface of the nucleus, and the outflowing gases drag dust off the nucleus to form the coma. However, many comets are known to experience occasional spontaneous outbursts that can significantly, but temporarily increase the comet's activity. It is not currently known what causes outbursts, but they are related to the conditions on the comet's surface. A number of potential trigger mechanisms have been proposed, including a thermal event, in which a heat wave penetrates into a pocket of highly volatile ices, causing the ice to rapidly vaporize and produce an explosion of activity, and a mechanical event, where a cliff collapses, exposing fresh ice to direct sunlight. Thus, studies of the outburst behavior, especially in the early brightening stages that are difficult to capture, can help us understand the physical and thermal properties of the comet. Although Wirtanen came closest to Earth on December 16, 2018, the outburst occurred earlier in its approach, beginning on September 26, 2018. The initial brightening of the outburst occurred in two distinct phases, with an hour-long flash followed by a more gradual second stage that continued to grow brighter for another 8 hours. This second stage was likely caused by the gradual spreading of comet dust from the outburst, which causes the dust cloud to reflect more sunlight overall. After reaching peak brightness, the comet faded gradually over a period of more than two weeks. Because TESS takes detailed, composite images every 30 minutes, the team was able to view each phase in exquisite detail. \"With 20 days' worth of very frequent images, we were able to assess changes in brightness very easily. That's what TESS was designed for, to perform its primary job as an exoplanet surveyor,\" Farnham said. \"We can't predict when comet outbursts will happen. But even if we somehow had the opportunity to schedule these observations, we couldn't have done any better in terms of timing. The outburst happened mere days after the observations started.\" The team has generated a rough estimate of how much material may have been ejected in the outburst, about one million kilograms, which could have left a crater on the comet of around 20 meters across. Further analysis of the estimated particle sizes in the dust tail may help improve this estimate. Observing more comets will also help to determine whether multi-stage brightening is rare or commonplace in comet outbursts. TESS has also detected for the first time Wirtanen's dust trail. Unlike a comet's tail-the spray of gas and fine dust that follows behind a comet, growing as it approaches the sun-a comet's trail is a field of larger debris that traces the comet's orbital path as it travels around the sun. Unlike a tail, which changes direction as it is blown by the solar wind, the orientation of the trail stays more or less constant over time. \"The trail more closely follows the orbit of the comet, while the tail is offset from it, as it gets pushed around by the sun's radiation pressure. What's significant about the trail is that it contains the largest material,\" said Michael Kelley, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a co-author of the research paper. \"Tail dust is very fine, a lot like smoke. But trail dust is much larger-more like sand and pebbles. We think comets lose most of their mass through their dust trails. When the Earth runs into a comet's dust trail, we get meteor showers.\" While the current study describes initial results, Farnham, Kelley and their colleagues look forward to further analyses of Wirtanen, as well as other comets in TESS' field of view. \"We also don't know what causes natural outbursts and that's ultimately what we want to find,\" Farnham said. \"There are at least four other comets in the same area of the sky where TESS made these observations, with a total of about 50 comets expected in the first two years' worth of TESS data. There's a lot that can come of these data.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

The planet is one of three within a new solar system discovered by an international team of astronomers. The three new planets were discovered orbiting GJ 357, a red dwarf. A red dwarf is a small and cooling star. The distance of 31 light years is relatively close in space terms, said lead researcher and astrophysicist* Rafael Luque of Spain's Institute of Astrophysics. The other two planets found in the new solar system are closer to the red dwarf and are thought to be too hot for life. The potentially habitable planet was found using NASA's planet-hunting satellite TESS. TESS team leader Dr Lisa Kaltenegger, from Cornell's Carl Sagan Institute in the US, said: \"This is exciting, as this is humanity's first nearby super- Earth that could harbour* life. \"With a thick atmosphere, the planet GJ 357 d could maintain liquid water on its surface like Earth and we could pick out signs of life with upcoming telescopes soon to be online.\" Signs of habitability* on any planet include a rocky landscape, a size similar to Earth and being within the \"Goldilocks\" zone, a distance from the planet's sun that is not too hot and not too cold but just right. The right temperature allows for the existence of liquid water, a key requirement for life. Given its distance from its star, similar to that of Mars to our Sun, researchers estimate the planet has temperatures of -53C, Mr Luque said. \"That seems a little cold at first,\" he said. But \"if this planet had an atmosphere, it could retain the heat it receives from its star, and water could be liquid.\" Researchers also estimate GJ 357 d could be roughly the same size as Earth or up to twice the size. WAITING GAME: GJ 357 d was discovered by looking for signs of a wobble in GJ 357, its star, created by the gravitational* tug of an orbiting planet. That's how scientists discovered Proxima b, another potentially habitable planet, in 2016. This technique is not actually accurate enough to know for sure whether a planet is habitable, just that it exists and is in the \"Goldilocks\" zone, so life could be possible. Until technology improves, to measure a planet's size, density and what it is made of, a planet has to pass directly between its star and an observer. This is called the transit* method. In the coming months, Mr Luque and his team will be trying to get lucky and catch GJ 357d in \"transit\" to confirm some more details about it. \"The probability that a planet passes in front of a star from our line of vision on Earth is pretty small,\" he said. Jack Madden, of the Carl Sagan Institute, explained that investigating new discoveries provides an opportunity to test ideas and models. Mr Madden said: \"We built the first models of what this new world could be like.\" He added: \"Just knowing that liquid water can exist on the surface of this planet motivates* scientists to find ways of detecting signs of life.\"", "url": "https://www.kidsnews.com.au/space/astronomers-find-new-solar-system-three-new-planets-and-one-goldilocks-planet-that-could-support-life/news-story/23b091ff790694f4190bb9b07a689228"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS satellite discovers nearby 'super-Earth planet' that could 'harbour life'", "date": "2019-08-07", "content": "Scientists have characterised the first potentially habitable world outside our own solar system located about 31 light-years away. The 'super-Earth planet' - named GJ 357 d - was discovered in early 2019 owing to NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, a mission designed to comb the heavens for exoplanets, according to the research published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"This is exciting, as this is humanity's first nearby super-Earth that could harbour life - uncovered with help from TESS, our small, mighty mission with a huge reach,\" said Lisa Kaltenegger, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell University in the US and a member of the TESS science team. The exoplanet is more massive than our own blue planet, and Kaltenegger said the discovery will provide insight into Earth's heavyweight planetary cousins. \"With a thick atmosphere, the planet GJ 357 d could maintain liquid water on its surface like Earth, and we could pick out signs of life with telescopes that will soon be online,\" she said. Astronomers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands and the University of La Laguna, both in Spain, announced the discovery of the GJ 357 system in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. They showed that the distant solar system - with a diminutive M-type dwarf sun, about one-third the size of our own sun - harbours three planets, with one of those in that system's habitable zone: GJ 357 d. Last February, the TESS satellite observed that the dwarf sun GJ 357 dimmed very slightly every 3.9 days, evidence of a transiting planet moving across the star's face. That planet was GJ 357 b, a so-called \"hot Earth\" about 22 per cent larger than Earth, according to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which guides TESS. Follow-up observations from the ground led to the discovery of two more exoplanetary siblings: GJ 357 c and GJ 357 d. The international team of scientists collected Earth-based telescopic data going back two decades -- to reveal the newly found exoplanets' tiny gravitational tugs on its host star, according to NASA. Exoplanet GJ 357 c sizzles at 127 degrees Celsius and has at least 3.4 times Earth's mass. However, the system's outermost known sibling planet - GJ 357 d, a super-Earth -- could provide Earth-like conditions and orbits the dwarf star every 55.7 days at a distance about one-fifth of Earth's distance from the sun. It is not yet known if this planet transits its sun. Kaltenegger, doctoral candidate Jack Madden and undergraduate student Zifan Lin simulated light fingerprints, climates and remotely detectable spectra for a planet that could range from a rocky composition to a water world. \"We built the first models of what this new world could be like. Just knowing that liquid water can exist on the surface of this planet motivates scientists to find ways of detecting signs of life,\" Madden said. \"If GJ 357 d were to show signs of life, it would be at the top of everyone's travel list - and we could answer a 1,000-year-old question on whether we are alone in the cosmos,\" Kaltenegger said.

The phenomenon, known as a tidal disruption event, was captured in detail by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Researchers published their findings of the event in The Astrophysical Journal on Thursday. Scientists used an international network of 20 robotic telescopes called ASAS-SN to detect the tidal disruption event back in January, before turning to TESS, which caught the beginning of the cosmic showdown. Using its permanent viewing zones, TESS was able to watch the star getting sucked into the black hole and collect necessary data used to study the event. NASA released an animated video illustrating the cataclysmic phenomenon. \"TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before,\" Thomas Holoien from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, said in a statement on NASA's website. \"The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts.\" Chris Kochanek, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, marveled at how fortunate it was to have the event occurring in the systems' lines of sight: \"This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward.\" Tidal disruption events are rare and stars need to be very close to a black hole in order to create one. Researchers said this type of cosmic event happens once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. However, since there are billions of galaxies in the universe, scientists have been able to observe about 40 tidal disruptions over the years. Yet they're still very hard to come by. \"Imagine that you are standing on top of a skyscraper downtown, and you drop a marble off the top, and you are trying to get it to go down a hole in a manhole cover,\" Kochanek said. \"It's harder than that.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-black-hole-star-image-visualization-simulation-swallowing-planet-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS spacecraft is finding hundreds of exoplanets - and is poised to find thousands more", "date": "2019-11-05", "content": "Within just 50 light-years from Earth, there are about 1,560 stars, likely orbited by several thousand planets.

This is the most complete and detailed observation to date of the formation and dissipation of a naturally-occurring comet outburst. The team members reported their results in the November 22, 2019, issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"TESS spends nearly a month at a time imaging one portion of the sky. With no day or night breaks and no atmospheric interference, we have a very uniform, long-duration set of observations,\" said Tony Farnham, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and the lead author of the research paper. \"As comets orbit the Sun, they can pass through TESS' field of view. Wirtanen was a high priority for us because of its close approach in late 2018, so we decided to use its appearance in the TESS images as a test case to see what we could get out of it. We did so and were very surprised!\" \"While TESS is a powerhouse for discovering planets orbiting nearby, bright stars, its observing strategy enables so much exciting additional science,\" said TESS project scientist Padi Boyd of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Since the TESS data are rapidly made public through NASA's Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, it's exciting to see scientists identifying which data are of interest to them, and then doing all kinds of additional serendipitous science beyond exoplanets .\" Normal comet activity is driven by sunlight vaporizing the ices near the surface of the nucleus, and the outflowing gases drag dust off the nucleus to form the coma. However, many comets are known to experience occasional spontaneous outbursts that can significantly, but temporarily increase the comet's activity. It is not currently known what causes outbursts, but they are related to the conditions on the comet's surface. A number of potential trigger mechanisms have been proposed, including a thermal event, in which a heat wave penetrates into a pocket of highly volatile ices, causing the ice to rapidly vaporize and produce an explosion of activity, and a mechanical event, where a cliff collapses, exposing fresh ice to direct sunlight. Thus, studies of the outburst behavior, especially in the early brightening stages that are difficult to capture, can help us understand the physical and thermal properties of the comet. Although Wirtanen came closest to Earth on December 16, 2018, the outburst occurred earlier in its approach, beginning on September 26, 2018. The initial brightening of the outburst occurred in two distinct phases, with an hour-long flash followed by a more gradual second stage that continued to grow brighter for another 8 hours. This second stage was likely caused by the gradual spreading of comet dust from the outburst, which causes the dust cloud to reflect more sunlight overall. After reaching peak brightness, the comet faded gradually over a period of more than two weeks. Because TESS takes detailed, composite images every 30 minutes, the team was able to view each phase in exquisite detail. \"With 20 days' worth of very frequent images, we were able to assess changes in brightness very easily. That's what TESS was designed for, to perform its primary job as an exoplanet surveyor,\" Farnham said. \"We can't predict when comet outbursts will happen. But even if we somehow had the opportunity to schedule these observations, we couldn't have done any better in terms of timing. The outburst happened mere days after the observations started.\" The team has generated a rough estimate of how much material may have been ejected in the outburst, about one million kilograms, which could have left a crater on the comet of around 20 meters across. Further analysis of the estimated particle sizes in the dust tail may help improve this estimate. Observing more comets will also help to determine whether multi-stage brightening is rare or commonplace in comet outbursts. TESS has also detected for the first time Wirtanen's dust trail. Unlike a comet's tail-the spray of gas and fine dust that follows behind a comet, growing as it approaches the sun-a comet's trail is a field of larger debris that traces the comet's orbital path as it travels around the sun. Unlike a tail, which changes direction as it is blown by the solar wind, the orientation of the trail stays more or less constant over time. \"The trail more closely follows the orbit of the comet, while the tail is offset from it, as it gets pushed around by the sun's radiation pressure. What's significant about the trail is that it contains the largest material,\" said Michael Kelley, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a co-author of the research paper. \"Tail dust is very fine, a lot like smoke. But trail dust is much larger-more like sand and pebbles. We think comets lose most of their mass through their dust trails. When the Earth runs into a comet's dust trail, we get meteor showers.\" While the current study describes initial results, Farnham, Kelley and their colleagues look forward to further analyses of Wirtanen, as well as other comets in TESS' field of view. \"We also don't know what causes natural outbursts and that's ultimately what we want to find,\" Farnham said. \"There are at least four other comets in the same area of the sky where TESS made these observations, with a total of about 50 comets expected in the first two years' worth of TESS data.

TOI 700-d is just 20 percent larger than Earth, and it receives close to the same amount of energy from its star that Earth gets from the sun. Such similarities between the two planets may encourage visions of blue skies, salty seas, and earth-like landscapes on TOI 700-d. But a handful of earthly properties don't tell the entire story. The resemblance between our planet and TESS's other-Earth may not extend beyond its size and how much sunlight it receives. Why? For starters, the nature of its atmosphere - if it possesses one- could make TOI 700-d a very alien world. Is its atmosphere thin and cold like Mars', or super-thick and hot like Venus'? Is it made of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a blend of air very unlike our own? Is there oxygen? Without enough atmospheric pressure, water cannot persist in a liquid state, so the presence of rivers, lakes and oceans is not guaranteed, even on a planet in a habitable zone. Another likely aspect of TOI 700-d is that it is tidally locked to its star. That means the same side perpetually faces sunlight, and the other is stuck in eternal night. Tidal locking is the eventual fate of most objects that orbit close to a larger parent object, and TOI 700-d is only 15 million miles from its star, zipping around it once every 37 days. This synchronization of an object's rotation and revolution, caused by gravitational interaction, is what keeps the same face of the moon always aimed at Earth, and what will eventually lock the planet Mercury into a state of permanently light and dark hemispheres. Imagine a world in which you could experience the sun never leaving the sky, or the sunrise never interrupting perpetual night, depending on which part of the planet you live.

Another scenario digitally imagines a cloudless world of dry land with global wind patterns circulating from the night side across the twilight zone to converge at the center of the day side. So, even just throwing in the possibility that TOI 700-d is tidally locked to its star practically guarantees that this \"Earth-like\" exoplanet might be very unlike the world we call home.

The phenomenon, known as a tidal disruption event, was captured in detail by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Researchers published their findings of the event in The Astrophysical Journal on Thursday. Scientists used an international network of 20 robotic telescopes called ASAS-SN to detect the tidal disruption event back in January, before turning to TESS, which caught the beginning of the cosmic showdown. Using its permanent viewing zones, TESS was able to watch the star getting sucked into the black hole and collect necessary data used to study the event. NASA released an animated video illustrating the cataclysmic phenomenon. \"TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before,\" Thomas Holoien from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, said in a statement on NASA's website. \"The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts.\" Chris Kochanek, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, marveled at how fortunate it was to have the event occurring in the systems' lines of sight: \"This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward.\" Tidal disruption events are rare and stars need to be very close to a black hole in order to create one. Researchers said this type of cosmic event happens once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy the size of the Milky Way. However, since there are billions of galaxies in the universe, scientists have been able to observe about 40 tidal disruptions over the years. Yet they're still very hard to come by. \"Imagine that you are standing on top of a skyscraper downtown, and you drop a marble off the top, and you are trying to get it to go down a hole in a manhole cover,\" Kochanek said. \"It's harder than that.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-black-hole-star-image-visualization-simulation-swallowing-planet-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS spacecraft is finding hundreds of exoplanets - and is poised to find thousands more", "date": "2019-11-05", "content": "Within just 50 light-years from Earth, there are about 1,560 stars, likely orbited by several thousand planets. About a thousand of these extrasolar planets - known as exoplanets - may be rocky and have a composition similar to Earth's. Some may even harbor life. Over 99% of these alien worlds remain undiscovered - but this is about to change. With NASA's new exoplanet-hunter space telescope TESS, the all-sky search is on for possibly habitable planets close to our solar system. TESS - orbiting Earth every 13.7 days - and ground-based telescopes are poised to find hundreds of planets over the next few years. This could transform astronomers' understanding of alien worlds around us and provide targets to scan with next-generation telescopes for signatures of life. In just over a year, TESS has identified more than 1,200 planetary candidates, 29 of which astronomers have already confirmed as planets. Given TESS's unique ability to simultaneously search tens of thousands of stars for planets, the mission is expected to yield over 10,000 new worlds. These are exciting times for astronomers and, especially, for those of us exploring exoplanets. We are members of the planet-hunting Project EDEN, which also supports TESS's work. We use telescopes on the ground and in space to find exoplanets to understand their properties and potential for harboring life. ## Undiscovered worlds all around us: Worlds around us await discovery. Take, for example, Proxima Centauri, an unassuming, faint red star, invisible without a telescope. It is one of over a hundred billion or so such stars within our galaxy, unremarkable except for its status as our next-door neighbor. Orbiting Proxima is a fascinating but mysterious world, called Proxmia b, discovered only in 2016. Scientists know surprisingly little about Proxima b. Astronomers name the first planet discovered in a system \"b\". This planet has never been seen with human eyes or by a telescope. But we know it exists due to its gravitational pull on its host star, which makes the star wobble ever so slightly. This slight wobble was found in measurements collected by a large, international group of astronomers from data taken with multiple ground-based telescopes. Proxima b very likely has a rocky composition similar to Earth's, but higher mass. It receives about the same amount of heat as Earth receives from the Sun. And that is what makes this planet so exciting: It lies in the \"habitable\" zone and just might have properties similar to Earth's, like a surface, liquid water, and - who knows? - maybe even an atmosphere bearing the telltale chemical signs of life. NASA's TESS mission launched in April 2018 to hunt for other broadly Earth-sized planets, but with a different method. TESS is looking for rare dimming events that happen when planets pass in front of their host stars, blocking some starlight. These transit events indicate not only the presence of the planets, but also their sizes and orbits. Finding a new transiting exoplanet is a big deal for astronomers like us because, unlike those found through stellar wobbles, worlds seen transiting can be studied further to determine their densities and atmospheric compositions. Red dwarf suns: For us, the most exciting exoplanets are the smallest ones, which TESS can detect when they orbit small stars called red dwarfs - stars with masses less than half the mass of our Sun. Each of these systems is unique. For example, LP 791-18 is a red dwarf star 86 light-years from Earth around which TESS found two worlds. The first is a \"super-Earth,\" a planet larger than Earth but probably still mostly rocky, and the second is a \"mini-Neptune,\" a planet smaller than Neptune but gas- and ice-rich. Neither of these planets have counterparts in our solar system. Among astronomers' current favorites of the new broadly Earth-sized planets is LHS 3884b, a scorching \"hot Earth\" that orbits its sun so quickly that on it you could celebrate your birthday every 11 hours. No Earth-like worlds yet: But how Earth-like are Earth-sized planets? The promise of finding nearby worlds for detailed studies is already paying off. A team of astronomers observed the hot super-Earth LHS 3884b with the Hubble Space Telescope and found the planet to be a horrible vacation spot, without even an atmosphere. It is just a bare rock with temperatures ranging from over 700 C at noon to near absolute zero at midnight. The TESS mission was initially funded for two years. But the spacecraft is in excellent shape and NASA recently extended the mission through 2022, doubling the time TESS will have to scan nearby, bright stars for transits. However, finding exoplanets around the coolest stars - those with temperatures less than about 2700 C - will still be a challenge due to their extreme faintness. Since ultracool dwarfs provide our best opportunity to find and study exoplanets with sizes and temperatures similar to Earth's, other focused planet searches are picking up where TESS leaves off. The worlds TESS can't find: In May 2016, a Belgian-led group announced the discovery of a planetary system around the ultracool dwarf they christened TRAPPIST-1. The discovery of the seven transiting Earth-sized exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system was groundbreaking. It also demonstrated how small telescopes - relative to the powerful behemoths of our age - can still make transformational discoveries. With patience and persistence, the TRAPPIST telescope scanned nearby faint, red dwarf stars from its high-mountain perch in the Atacama desert for small, telltale dips in their brightnesses. Eventually, it spotted transits in the data for the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1, which - although just 41 light-years away - is too faint for TESS's four 10-cm diameter lenses. Its Earth-sized worlds would have remained undiscovered had the TRAPPIST team's larger telescope not found them. Two projects have upped up the game in the search for exo-Earth candidates around nearby red dwarfs. The SPECULOOS team installed four robotic telescopes - also in the Atacama desert - and one in the Northern Hemisphere. Our Exoearth Discovery and Exploration Network - Project EDEN - uses nine telescopes in Arizona, Italy, Spain and Taiwan to observe red dwarf stars continuously. The SPECULOOS and EDEN telescopes are much larger than TESS's small lenses and can find planets around stars too faint for TESS to study, including some of the transiting Earth-sized planets closest to us. The decade of new worlds: The next decade is likely to be remembered as the time when we opened our eyes to the incredible diversity of other worlds. TESS is likely to find between 10,000 and 15,000 exoplanet candidates by 2025. By 2030, the European Space Agency's GAIA and PLATO missions are expected to find another 20,000-35,000 planets. GAIA will look for stellar wobbles introduced by planets, while PLATO will search for planetary transits as TESS does. However, even among the thousands of planets that will soon be found, the exoplanets closest to our solar system will remain special. Many of these worlds can be studied in great detail - including the search for signs of life. Discoveries of the nearest worlds also represent major steps in humanity's progress in exploring the universe we live in. After mapping our own planet and then the solar system, we now turn to nearby planetary systems. Perhaps one day Proxima b or another nearby world astronomers have yet to find will be the target for interstellar probes, like Project Starshot, or even crewed starships. But first we've got to put these worlds on the map.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/nasas-tess-spacecraft-is-finding-hundreds-of-exoplanets-and-is-poised-to-find-thousands-more-122104"}, {"title": "Unimaginable View of Milky Way From Year of Observations by NASA TESS - 29 Exoplanets Discovered", "date": "2019-11-06", "content": "The glow of the Milky Way - our galaxy seen edgewise - arcs across a sea of stars in an incredible new mosaic of the southern sky produced from a year of observations by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

Over 99% of these alien worlds remain undiscovered - but this is about to change. With NASA's new exoplanet-hunter space telescope TESS, the all-sky search is on for possibly habitable planets close to our solar system. TESS - orbiting Earth every 13.7 days - and ground-based telescopes are poised to find hundreds of planets over the next few years. This could transform astronomers' understanding of alien worlds around us and provide targets to scan with next-generation telescopes for signatures of life. In just over a year, TESS has identified more than 1,200 planetary candidates, 29 of which astronomers have already confirmed as planets. Given TESS's unique ability to simultaneously search tens of thousands of stars for planets, the mission is expected to yield over 10,000 new worlds. These are exciting times for astronomers and, especially, for those of us exploring exoplanets. We are members of the planet-hunting Project EDEN, which also supports TESS's work. We use telescopes on the ground and in space to find exoplanets to understand their properties and potential for harboring life. ## Undiscovered worlds all around us: Worlds around us await discovery. Take, for example, Proxima Centauri, an unassuming, faint red star, invisible without a telescope. It is one of over a hundred billion or so such stars within our galaxy, unremarkable except for its status as our next-door neighbor. Orbiting Proxima is a fascinating but mysterious world, called Proxmia b, discovered only in 2016. Scientists know surprisingly little about Proxima b. Astronomers name the first planet discovered in a system \"b\". This planet has never been seen with human eyes or by a telescope. But we know it exists due to its gravitational pull on its host star, which makes the star wobble ever so slightly. This slight wobble was found in measurements collected by a large, international group of astronomers from data taken with multiple ground-based telescopes. Proxima b very likely has a rocky composition similar to Earth's, but higher mass. It receives about the same amount of heat as Earth receives from the Sun. And that is what makes this planet so exciting: It lies in the \"habitable\" zone and just might have properties similar to Earth's, like a surface, liquid water, and - who knows? - maybe even an atmosphere bearing the telltale chemical signs of life. NASA's TESS mission launched in April 2018 to hunt for other broadly Earth-sized planets, but with a different method. TESS is looking for rare dimming events that happen when planets pass in front of their host stars, blocking some starlight. These transit events indicate not only the presence of the planets, but also their sizes and orbits. Finding a new transiting exoplanet is a big deal for astronomers like us because, unlike those found through stellar wobbles, worlds seen transiting can be studied further to determine their densities and atmospheric compositions. Red dwarf suns: For us, the most exciting exoplanets are the smallest ones, which TESS can detect when they orbit small stars called red dwarfs - stars with masses less than half the mass of our Sun. Each of these systems is unique. For example, LP 791-18 is a red dwarf star 86 light-years from Earth around which TESS found two worlds. The first is a \"super-Earth,\" a planet larger than Earth but probably still mostly rocky, and the second is a \"mini-Neptune,\" a planet smaller than Neptune but gas- and ice-rich. Neither of these planets have counterparts in our solar system. Among astronomers' current favorites of the new broadly Earth-sized planets is LHS 3884b, a scorching \"hot Earth\" that orbits its sun so quickly that on it you could celebrate your birthday every 11 hours. No Earth-like worlds yet: But how Earth-like are Earth-sized planets? The promise of finding nearby worlds for detailed studies is already paying off. A team of astronomers observed the hot super-Earth LHS 3884b with the Hubble Space Telescope and found the planet to be a horrible vacation spot, without even an atmosphere. It is just a bare rock with temperatures ranging from over 700 C at noon to near absolute zero at midnight. The TESS mission was initially funded for two years. But the spacecraft is in excellent shape and NASA recently extended the mission through 2022, doubling the time TESS will have to scan nearby, bright stars for transits. However, finding exoplanets around the coolest stars - those with temperatures less than about 2700 C - will still be a challenge due to their extreme faintness. Since ultracool dwarfs provide our best opportunity to find and study exoplanets with sizes and temperatures similar to Earth's, other focused planet searches are picking up where TESS leaves off. The worlds TESS can't find: In May 2016, a Belgian-led group announced the discovery of a planetary system around the ultracool dwarf they christened TRAPPIST-1. The discovery of the seven transiting Earth-sized exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system was groundbreaking. It also demonstrated how small telescopes - relative to the powerful behemoths of our age - can still make transformational discoveries. With patience and persistence, the TRAPPIST telescope scanned nearby faint, red dwarf stars from its high-mountain perch in the Atacama desert for small, telltale dips in their brightnesses. Eventually, it spotted transits in the data for the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1, which - although just 41 light-years away - is too faint for TESS's four 10-cm diameter lenses. Its Earth-sized worlds would have remained undiscovered had the TRAPPIST team's larger telescope not found them. Two projects have upped up the game in the search for exo-Earth candidates around nearby red dwarfs. The SPECULOOS team installed four robotic telescopes - also in the Atacama desert - and one in the Northern Hemisphere. Our Exoearth Discovery and Exploration Network - Project EDEN - uses nine telescopes in Arizona, Italy, Spain and Taiwan to observe red dwarf stars continuously. The SPECULOOS and EDEN telescopes are much larger than TESS's small lenses and can find planets around stars too faint for TESS to study, including some of the transiting Earth-sized planets closest to us. The decade of new worlds: The next decade is likely to be remembered as the time when we opened our eyes to the incredible diversity of other worlds. TESS is likely to find between 10,000 and 15,000 exoplanet candidates by 2025. By 2030, the European Space Agency's GAIA and PLATO missions are expected to find another 20,000-35,000 planets. GAIA will look for stellar wobbles introduced by planets, while PLATO will search for planetary transits as TESS does. However, even among the thousands of planets that will soon be found, the exoplanets closest to our solar system will remain special. Many of these worlds can be studied in great detail - including the search for signs of life. Discoveries of the nearest worlds also represent major steps in humanity's progress in exploring the universe we live in. After mapping our own planet and then the solar system, we now turn to nearby planetary systems. Perhaps one day Proxima b or another nearby world astronomers have yet to find will be the target for interstellar probes, like Project Starshot, or even crewed starships. But first we've got to put these worlds on the map.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/nasas-tess-spacecraft-is-finding-hundreds-of-exoplanets-and-is-poised-to-find-thousands-more-122104"}, {"title": "Unimaginable View of Milky Way From Year of Observations by NASA TESS - 29 Exoplanets Discovered", "date": "2019-11-06", "content": "The glow of the Milky Way - our galaxy seen edgewise - arcs across a sea of stars in an incredible new mosaic of the southern sky produced from a year of observations by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Constructed from 208 TESS images taken during the mission's first year of science operations, completed on July 18, the southern panorama reveals both the beauty of the cosmic landscape and the reach of TESS's cameras. \"Analysis of TESS data focuses on individual stars and planets one at a time, but I wanted to step back and highlight everything at once, really emphasizing the spectacular view TESS gives us of the entire sky,\" said Ethan Kruse, a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow who assembled the mosaic at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Within this scene, TESS has discovered 29 exoplanets, or worlds beyond our solar system, and more than 1,000 candidate planets astronomers are now investigating. TESS divided the southern sky into 13 sectors and imaged each one of them for nearly a month using four cameras, which carry a total of 16 charge-coupled devices. Remarkably, the TESS cameras capture a full sector of the sky every 30 minutes as part of its search for exoplanet transits. Transits occur when a planet passes in front of its host star from our perspective, briefly and regularly dimming its light. During the satellite's first year of operations, each of its CCDs captured 15,347 30-minute science images. These images are just a part of more than 20 terabytes of southern sky data TESS has returned, comparable to streaming nearly 6,000 high-definition movies. In addition to its planet discoveries, TESS has imaged a comet in our solar system, followed the progress of numerous stellar explosions called supernovae, and even caught the flare from a star ripped apart by a supermassive black hole. After completing its southern survey, TESS turned north to begin a year-long study of the northern sky.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/unimaginable-view-of-milky-way-from-year-of-observations-by-nasa-tess-29-exoplanets-discovered/"}, {"title": "\"Very Surprised!\" - NASA's Exoplanet-Hunting Mission Catches an Explosive Comet Outburst", "date": "2019-12-03", "content": "Using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, astronomers at the University of Maryland, in College Park, Maryland, have captured a clear start-to- finish image sequence of an explosive emission of dust, ice and gases during the close approach of comet 46P/Wirtanen in late 2018. This is the most complete and detailed observation to date of the formation and dissipation of a naturally-occurring comet outburst. The team members reported their results in the November 22, 2019, issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"TESS spends nearly a month at a time imaging one portion of the sky. With no day or night breaks and no atmospheric interference, we have a very uniform, long-duration set of observations,\" said Tony Farnham, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and the lead author of the research paper. \"As comets orbit the Sun, they can pass through TESS' field of view. Wirtanen was a high priority for us because of its close approach in late 2018, so we decided to use its appearance in the TESS images as a test case to see what we could get out of it. We did so and were very surprised!\" \"While TESS is a powerhouse for discovering planets orbiting nearby, bright stars, its observing strategy enables so much exciting additional science,\" said TESS project scientist Padi Boyd of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Since the TESS data are rapidly made public through NASA's Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, it's exciting to see scientists identifying which data are of interest to them, and then doing all kinds of additional serendipitous science beyond exoplanets .\" Normal comet activity is driven by sunlight vaporizing the ices near the surface of the nucleus, and the outflowing gases drag dust off the nucleus to form the coma. However, many comets are known to experience occasional spontaneous outbursts that can significantly, but temporarily increase the comet's activity. It is not currently known what causes outbursts, but they are related to the conditions on the comet's surface. A number of potential trigger mechanisms have been proposed, including a thermal event, in which a heat wave penetrates into a pocket of highly volatile ices, causing the ice to rapidly vaporize and produce an explosion of activity, and a mechanical event, where a cliff collapses, exposing fresh ice to direct sunlight. Thus, studies of the outburst behavior, especially in the early brightening stages that are difficult to capture, can help us understand the physical and thermal properties of the comet. Although Wirtanen came closest to Earth on December 16, 2018, the outburst occurred earlier in its approach, beginning on September 26, 2018. The initial brightening of the outburst occurred in two distinct phases, with an hour-long flash followed by a more gradual second stage that continued to grow brighter for another 8 hours. This second stage was likely caused by the gradual spreading of comet dust from the outburst, which causes the dust cloud to reflect more sunlight overall. After reaching peak brightness, the comet faded gradually over a period of more than two weeks. Because TESS takes detailed, composite images every 30 minutes, the team was able to view each phase in exquisite detail. \"With 20 days' worth of very frequent images, we were able to assess changes in brightness very easily. That's what TESS was designed for, to perform its primary job as an exoplanet surveyor,\" Farnham said. \"We can't predict when comet outbursts will happen. But even if we somehow had the opportunity to schedule these observations, we couldn't have done any better in terms of timing. The outburst happened mere days after the observations started.\" The team has generated a rough estimate of how much material may have been ejected in the outburst, about one million kilograms, which could have left a crater on the comet of around 20 meters across. Further analysis of the estimated particle sizes in the dust tail may help improve this estimate. Observing more comets will also help to determine whether multi-stage brightening is rare or commonplace in comet outbursts. TESS has also detected for the first time Wirtanen's dust trail. Unlike a comet's tail-the spray of gas and fine dust that follows behind a comet, growing as it approaches the sun-a comet's trail is a field of larger debris that traces the comet's orbital path as it travels around the sun. Unlike a tail, which changes direction as it is blown by the solar wind, the orientation of the trail stays more or less constant over time. \"The trail more closely follows the orbit of the comet, while the tail is offset from it, as it gets pushed around by the sun's radiation pressure. What's significant about the trail is that it contains the largest material,\" said Michael Kelley, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a co-author of the research paper. \"Tail dust is very fine, a lot like smoke. But trail dust is much larger-more like sand and pebbles. We think comets lose most of their mass through their dust trails. When the Earth runs into a comet's dust trail, we get meteor showers.\" While the current study describes initial results, Farnham, Kelley and their colleagues look forward to further analyses of Wirtanen, as well as other comets in TESS' field of view. \"We also don't know what causes natural outbursts and that's ultimately what we want to find,\" Farnham said. \"There are at least four other comets in the same area of the sky where TESS made these observations, with a total of about 50 comets expected in the first two years' worth of TESS data. There's a lot that can come of these data.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Exoplanet hunters and astrobiologists have searched for so-called \"other-Earths\" like knights of old pursuing the holy grail. They've identified only a small number among the thousands of exoplanets discovered since 1992, but those heavenly bodies have the potential to harbor environments friendly to life as we know it. NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope confirmed TESS's discovery, refining estimates of the exoplanet's size and distance from its star and placing it squarely in the class of potentially Earth-like interstellar destinations. Meet TOI 700-d: The planet, named TOI 700-d, orbits a red dwarf star about 40 percent the size and half the brightness of our sun. TESS also discovered two other planets, TOI 700-b and -c, orbiting closer to the star but not within its habitable zone. Located in the southern constellation Dorado, the star TOI 700 and its potential planetary riches are 100 light years away, well beyond human civilization's ability to reach in the foreseeable future., the fastest and now most-distant interstellar spacecraft we have sent out, would take another 2 million years to get there. TOI 700-d is just 20 percent larger than Earth, and it receives close to the same amount of energy from its star that Earth gets from the sun. Such similarities between the two planets may encourage visions of blue skies, salty seas, and earth-like landscapes on TOI 700-d. But a handful of earthly properties don't tell the entire story. The resemblance between our planet and TESS's other-Earth may not extend beyond its size and how much sunlight it receives. Why? For starters, the nature of its atmosphere - if it possesses one- could make TOI 700-d a very alien world. Is its atmosphere thin and cold like Mars', or super-thick and hot like Venus'? Is it made of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a blend of air very unlike our own? Is there oxygen? Without enough atmospheric pressure, water cannot persist in a liquid state, so the presence of rivers, lakes and oceans is not guaranteed, even on a planet in a habitable zone. Another likely aspect of TOI 700-d is that it is tidally locked to its star. That means the same side perpetually faces sunlight, and the other is stuck in eternal night. Tidal locking is the eventual fate of most objects that orbit close to a larger parent object, and TOI 700-d is only 15 million miles from its star, zipping around it once every 37 days. This synchronization of an object's rotation and revolution, caused by gravitational interaction, is what keeps the same face of the moon always aimed at Earth, and what will eventually lock the planet Mercury into a state of permanently light and dark hemispheres. Imagine a world in which you could experience the sun never leaving the sky, or the sunrise never interrupting perpetual night, depending on which part of the planet you live. In one scenario for TOI 700-d, which scientists have generated with computer models, a planetwide ocean lies under a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with a thick cataract of cloud layers shading the day side from its star. Another scenario digitally imagines a cloudless world of dry land with global wind patterns circulating from the night side across the twilight zone to converge at the center of the day side. So, even just throwing in the possibility that TOI 700-d is tidally locked to its star practically guarantees that this \"Earth-like\" exoplanet might be very unlike the world we call home.

And, to date, all of those exoplanets have something in common: they're located in the relatively flat disc of the galactic plane, the thin disc. Now, a little over a year and a half after it started scanning the sky for alien worlds, NASA's planet-hunting space telescope TESS has identified a new first: an exoplanet orbiting a star that swoops as far as 5,870 light-years above the galactic plane. And that's not all. It's around 1.088 times the size of Earth, which means it's probably a rocky world; and it's also an incredibly dense one. Within that Earth-sized sphere, it packs up to 8.7 times Earth's mass. An international team of astronomers has named the planet LHS 1815b, because it orbits a star called LHS 1815, and described it in a paper accepted by The Astronomical Journal. That paper is currently available on pre-print server arXiv. When you think of spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, you probably think of a flat plane, the stars and gas arranged in spiral arms that orbit the galactic centre, in which sits a supermassive black hole. Although technically these galaxies sit within a spherical halo, most of that space is relatively empty, with the bulk of mass concentrated in a flat disc. This flat shape is the result of some pretty complex physics that involves the cooling of gases as they retain angular momentum. But some of these \"flat\" galaxies - like the Milky Way - are more complex. That thin disc - around few hundred light-years in thickness in the Milky Way - is where you will find most of the stars, and all of the gas. But there's a puffier disc around it, far thicker and more sparsely populated with stars, intermediate between the thin disc and the halo. This is called the thick disc. Thick disc stars are almost all older than about 10 billion years ), poor in metals and rich in alpha- process elements, and moving more quickly than the thin disc stars. They have orbits that pass through the thin disc and into the thick disc, both above and below the galactic plane. Since stars that have planets tend towards higher metallicities, it was thought that these thick disc stars may hinder the planetary formation process in some way compared to thin disc stars. And, since no thick disc planets had been found, any differences there may be in formation and evolution between thin and thick disc stars has remained a mystery. When astronomers spotted the signature of LHS 1815b in the TESS data, the system was just 97 light-years away from Earth, but even still, it was attention-grabbing. Earth-sized, rocky exoplanets are in the minority among the exoplanets we have detected; but new exoplanets of this type are prized, because that's where we most expect to find the conditions suitable for life. LHS 1815 is quiet for a red dwarf, but even so, and the exoplanet is close enough for such a lashing to cop some extremely harsh radiation, on a breakneck orbit of just 3.1843 days. But when the team used data from the Gaia data release to study the motion of the star - an ongoing project to map the Milky Way, including how the stars are moving, in 3D - they realised they were looking at a thick disc star passing through. It's currently on its way above the galactic plane; the team's calculations put its maximum distance from the plane at around 5,870 light-years. Freaking wild. But having LHS 1815 in our neighbourhood presents a really great opportunity. We can take a closer look at the system to see if any other planets can be spotted in orbit around it. It might be possible to try to look for an atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope, launching later this year. And now that one exoplanet has been found orbiting a thick disc star, that gives astronomers some parameters for finding other such planets. There may even be several already in the TESS data. If we can find them, they, too, could be studied to find out how exoplanets evolve in different parts of the galaxy. \"The TESS survey can provide a large sample of solar neighbourhood transiting planets across the whole sky. All planet host stars are bright enough to have their RV radial velocity - the planet-identifying wiggle measured by the Gaia survey,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. \"It will be an excellent opportunity to study the difference in the planet evolution between the thin and thick discs.\" The research has been accepted into The Astronomical Journal, and is available on arXiv.

Exoplanet hunters and astrobiologists have searched for so-called \"other-Earths\" like knights of old pursuing the holy grail. They've identified only a small number among the thousands of exoplanets discovered since 1992, but those heavenly bodies have the potential to harbor environments friendly to life as we know it. NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope confirmed TESS's discovery, refining estimates of the exoplanet's size and distance from its star and placing it squarely in the class of potentially Earth-like interstellar destinations. Meet TOI 700-d: The planet, named TOI 700-d, orbits a red dwarf star about 40 percent the size and half the brightness of our sun. TESS also discovered two other planets, TOI 700-b and -c, orbiting closer to the star but not within its habitable zone. Located in the southern constellation Dorado, the star TOI 700 and its potential planetary riches are 100 light years away, well beyond human civilization's ability to reach in the foreseeable future., the fastest and now most-distant interstellar spacecraft we have sent out, would take another 2 million years to get there. TOI 700-d is just 20 percent larger than Earth, and it receives close to the same amount of energy from its star that Earth gets from the sun. Such similarities between the two planets may encourage visions of blue skies, salty seas, and earth-like landscapes on TOI 700-d. But a handful of earthly properties don't tell the entire story. The resemblance between our planet and TESS's other-Earth may not extend beyond its size and how much sunlight it receives. Why? For starters, the nature of its atmosphere - if it possesses one- could make TOI 700-d a very alien world. Is its atmosphere thin and cold like Mars', or super-thick and hot like Venus'? Is it made of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a blend of air very unlike our own? Is there oxygen? Without enough atmospheric pressure, water cannot persist in a liquid state, so the presence of rivers, lakes and oceans is not guaranteed, even on a planet in a habitable zone. Another likely aspect of TOI 700-d is that it is tidally locked to its star. That means the same side perpetually faces sunlight, and the other is stuck in eternal night.

Located about 670 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, KELT-9 b was discovered in 2017 because the planet passed in front of its star for a part of each orbit, an event called a transit. Transits regularly dim the star's light by a small but detectable amount. The transits of KELT-9 b were first observed by the KELT transit survey, a project that collected observations from two robotic telescopes located in Arizona and South Africa. Between July 18 and Sept. 11, 2019, as part of the mission's yearlong campaign to observe the northern sky, TESS observed 27 transits of KELT-9 b, taking measurements every two minutes. These observations allowed the team to model the system's unusual star and its impact on the planet. KELT-9 b is a gas giant world about 1.8 times bigger than Jupiter, with 2.9 times its mass. Tidal forces have locked its rotation so the same side always faces its star. The planet swings around its star in just 36 hours on an orbit that carries it almost directly above both of the star's poles. KELT-9 b receives 44,000 times more energy from its star than Earth does from the Sun. This makes the planet's dayside temperature around 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the surfaces of some stars. This intense heating also causes the planet's atmosphere to stream away into space. Its host star is an oddity, too. It's about twice the size of the Sun and averages about 56 percent hotter. But it spins 38 times faster than the Sun, completing a full rotation in just 16 hours. Its rapid spin distorts the star's shape, flattening it at the poles and widening its midsection. This causes the star's poles to heat up and brighten while its equatorial region cools and dims - a phenomenon called gravity darkening. The result is a temperature difference across the star's surface of almost 1,500 F. With each orbit, KELT-9 b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures, producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The planet experiences \"summer\" when it swings over each hot pole and \"winter\" when it passes over the star's cooler midsection. So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every year, with each season about nine hours. \"It's really intriguing to think about how the star's temperature gradient impacts the planet,\" said Goddard's Knicole Col\u00f3n, a co-author of the paper. \"The varying levels of energy received from its star likely produce an extremely dynamic atmosphere.\" KELT-9 b's polar orbit around its flattened star produces distinctly lopsided transits. The planet begins its transit near the star's bright poles and then blocks less and less light as it travels over the star's dimmer equator. This asymmetry provides clues to the temperature and brightness changes across the star's surface, and they permitted the team to reconstruct the star's out-of- round shape, how it's oriented in space, its range of surface temperatures, and other factors impacting the planet. \"Of the planetary systems that we've studied via gravity darkening, the effects on KELT-9 b are by far the most spectacular,\" said Jason Barnes, a professor of physics at the University of Idaho and a co-author of the paper. \"This work goes a long way toward unifying gravity darkening with other techniques that measure planetary alignment, which in the end we hope will tease out secrets about the formation and evolutionary history of planets around high-mass stars.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Located about 670 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, KELT-9 b was discovered in 2017 because the planet passed in front of its star for a part of each orbit, an event called a transit. Transits regularly dim the star's light by a small but detectable amount. The transits of KELT-9 b were first observed by the KELT transit survey, a project that collected observations from two robotic telescopes located in Arizona and South Africa. Between July 18 and Sept. 11, 2019, as part of the mission's yearlong campaign to observe the northern sky, TESS observed 27 transits of KELT-9 b, taking measurements every two minutes. These observations allowed the team to model the system's unusual star and its impact on the planet. KELT-9 b is a gas giant world about 1.8 times bigger than Jupiter, with 2.9 times its mass. Tidal forces have locked its rotation so the same side always faces its star. The planet swings around its star in just 36 hours on an orbit that carries it almost directly above both of the star's poles. KELT-9 b receives 44,000 times more energy from its star than Earth does from the Sun. This makes the planet's dayside temperature around 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the surfaces of some stars. This intense heating also causes the planet's atmosphere to stream away into space. Its host star is an oddity, too. It's about twice the size of the Sun and averages about 56 percent hotter. But it spins 38 times faster than the Sun, completing a full rotation in just 16 hours. Its rapid spin distorts the star's shape, flattening it at the poles and widening its midsection. This causes the star's poles to heat up and brighten while its equatorial region cools and dims - a phenomenon called gravity darkening. The result is a temperature difference across the star's surface of almost 1,500 F. With each orbit, KELT-9 b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures, producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The planet experiences \"summer\" when it swings over each hot pole and \"winter\" when it passes over the star's cooler midsection. So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every year, with each season about nine hours. \"It's really intriguing to think about how the star's temperature gradient impacts the planet,\" said Goddard's Knicole Col\u00f3n, a co-author of the paper. \"The varying levels of energy received from its star likely produce an extremely dynamic atmosphere.\" KELT-9 b's polar orbit around its flattened star produces distinctly lopsided transits. The planet begins its transit near the star's bright poles and then blocks less and less light as it travels over the star's dimmer equator. This asymmetry provides clues to the temperature and brightness changes across the star's surface, and they permitted the team to reconstruct the star's out-of- round shape, how it's oriented in space, its range of surface temperatures, and other factors impacting the planet. \"Of the planetary systems that we've studied via gravity darkening, the effects on KELT-9 b are by far the most spectacular,\" said Jason Barnes, a professor of physics at the University of Idaho and a co-author of the paper. \"This work goes a long way toward unifying gravity darkening with other techniques that measure planetary alignment, which in the end we hope will tease out secrets about the formation and evolutionary history of planets around high-mass stars.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Now in its extended mission, TESS has turned around to resume surveying the south, NASA said. The extended mission for TESS will be completed in September 2022. After spending a year imaging the southern sky, TESS will take another 15 months to collect additional observations in the north and to survey areas along the ecliptic -- the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun -- that the satellite has not yet imaged.

Its initial survey of the sky took two years. In this time, TESS helped revolutionize our knowledge about exoplanets, worlds orbiting distant stars, continuing on from where the Kepler space telescope, NASA's first planet-hunter, left off. TESS' primary mission officially finished on July 4, 2020. After this, TESS will continue with its extended mission phase. During the two-year survey, TESS imaged about 75% of the sky, and so far has found 66 new confirmed exoplanets and nearly 2,100 additional candidates that are awaiting confirmation. Patricia Boyd, project scientist for TESS at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement: TESS is producing a torrent of high-quality observations providing valuable data across a wide range of science topics. During the first year, TESS observed 13 different sectors of the sky seen from the Southern Hemisphere, and then turned its attention to the northern sky in the second year. Each sector is a 24-by-96- degree strip of the sky, and TESS spends about a month surveying each sector. Now, TESS has returned to watching the northern sky again as it enters its extended mission. With that shift comes some other changes and improvements as well, according to NASA. TESS is now collecting data faster and more efficiently than it did during the primary mission, NASA said. The telescope's cameras can now capture a full image every 10 minutes, three times faster than they did in the primary mission. Also, by using a new fast mode, TESS can measure the brightness of thousands of stars every 20 seconds. Previously, the telescope would make similar measurements every two minutes. These improvements are not just good for planet-hunting, they also help TESS better resolve brightness changes caused by stellar oscillations and observe explosive flares from active stars in greater detail. This extended mission phase will continue until September 2022. TESS will spend the next year observing the southern sky, then will once again go back to surveying the northern sky for a period of 15 months. Those surveys will include observations along the ecliptic - the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun - that TESS has not yet imaged. How does TESS find exoplanets? Like many other telescopes, TESS uses the transit method of detecting exoplanets. That is, its instruments are geared to detecting slight decreases in the brightnesses of stars as planets pass in front of those stars as seen from Earth. Those temporary dips in brightness are very tiny, but TESS is able to see them, and determine whether they are caused by a planet. Last January, NASA announced that TESS had discovered its first Earth-sized planet, TOI 700 d, in the habitable zone of its red dwarf star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures on a rocky planet could allow liquid water to exist. The planet was later confirmed by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This planetary system is just over 100 light- years away in the constellation Dorado. According to Paul Hertz, astrophysics division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington: TESS was designed and launched specifically to find Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby stars. Planets around nearby stars are easiest to follow up with larger telescopes in space and on Earth. Discovering TOI 700 d is a key science finding for TESS. Confirming the planet's size and habitable zone status with Spitzer is another win for Spitzer as it approaches the end of science operations this January. TOI 700 d is the outermost of three known planets in the system and the only one in the habitable zone. It measures 20% larger than Earth, orbits its red dwarf star every 37 days and receives from its star 86% of the energy that the sun provides to Earth. It is expected that TESS will find many more Earth-sized worlds, including ones that are potentially habitable. In June, scientists reported that TESS found a Neptune-sized planet, AU Mic b, orbiting a very young red dwarf star. Bryson Cale, a doctoral student at George Mason University, said: AU Mic is a young, nearby M dwarf star. It's surrounded by a vast debris disk in which moving clumps of dust have been tracked, and now, thanks to TESS and Spitzer, it has a planet with a direct size measurement. There is no other known system that checks all of these important boxes. The star is only 10 to 20 million years old, and the planet completes an orbit in only 8.5 days. TESS also recently found its first circumbinary planet - one that orbits two stars - called TOI 1338 b. The two stars orbit each other every 15 days. One is about 10% more massive than our sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only 1/3 the sun's mass. The planet is about 6.9 times the size of Earth, between the size of Neptune and Saturn. TESS is good at multi-tasking too, NASA said, and has been studying more than just exoplanets. It has observed the outburst of a comet in our own solar system, as well as numerous exploding stars. It also found surprise eclipses in a well-known binary star system, solved a mystery about a class of pulsating stars, and explored a world experiencing star-modulated seasons. TESS even caught a black hole in a distant galaxy in the act of tearing apart a sun-like star with its enormous gravity! Thomas Holoien, of the Carnegie Observatories, is lead author of a paper that described the findings on September 27, 2019, in The Astrophysical Journal. Holoien said: TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before. Because we identified the tidal disruption quickly with the ground-based All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we were able to trigger multiwavelength follow-up observations in the first few days. The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts. Last November, it was also announced that TESS would be teaming up with Breakthrough Listen in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, aka SETI. Basically, TESS will identify objects of interest, such as potentially habitable exoplanets, for other telescopes to point at and search for radio signals or other signs of advanced technologies, called technosignatures. In only the first couple years of its mission, TESS has not only found thousands of new exoplanets, but has observed and witnessed a wide variety of incredible cosmic objects and phenomena.

They made the discovery using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the retired Spitzer Space Telescope. A white dwarf is the remnant of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel but does not have the mass to become a neutron star. This particular white dwarf is only 40 percent larger than Earth. As per **a statement by NASA**, the Jupiter-sized object, called WD 1856 b, is about seven times larger than the white dwarf, named WD 1856+534. The planet circles the white dwarf every 34 hours, which is more than 60 times faster than Mercury orbiting our Sun. According to the lead author of the study, Andrew Vanderburg, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, WD 1856 b somehow managed to get close to the white dwarf and still managed to stay in one piece. \"The white dwarf creation process destroys nearby planets, and anything that later gets too close is usually torn apart by the star's immense gravity. We still have many questions about how WD 1856 b arrived at its current location without meeting one of those fates,\" Vanderburg said. TESS monitors large areas of the sky for nearly a month at a time, allowing it to find exoplanet by capturing changes in stellar brightness caused when a planet crosses or transits its star. As per the study authors, WD 1856 b is about 80 light-years away in the northern constellation Draco. It orbits a white dwarf around 18,000 kms across which may be up to 10 billion years old and is a distant member of a triple star system.

The planet begins its transit near the star's bright poles and then blocks less and less light as it travels over the star's dimmer equator. This asymmetry provides clues to the temperature and brightness changes across the star's surface, and they permitted the team to reconstruct the star's out-of- round shape, how it's oriented in space, its range of surface temperatures, and other factors impacting the planet. \"Of the planetary systems that we've studied via gravity darkening, the effects on KELT-9 b are by far the most spectacular,\" said Jason Barnes, a professor of physics at the University of Idaho and a co-author of the paper. \"This work goes a long way toward unifying gravity darkening with other techniques that measure planetary alignment, which in the end we hope will tease out secrets about the formation and evolutionary history of planets around high-mass stars.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Additional partners include Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, Virginia; NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley; the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts; MIT's Lincoln Laboratory; and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.

TESS, short for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, scanned about 75 per cent of the starry sky during its primary mission that ended on July 4, NASA said on Tuesday. \"TESS is producing a torrent of high-quality observations providing valuable data across a wide range of science topics,\" said Patricia Boyd, the project scientist for TESS at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"As it enters its extended mission, TESS is already a roaring success.\" TESS monitors 24-by-96-degree strips of the sky called sectors for about a month using its four cameras. The mission spent its first year observing 13 sectors comprising the southern sky and then spent another year imaging the northern sky. Now in its extended mission, TESS has turned around to resume surveying the south, NASA said. The extended mission for TESS will be completed in September 2022. After spending a year imaging the southern sky, TESS will take another 15 months to collect additional observations in the north and to survey areas along the ecliptic -- the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun -- that the satellite has not yet imaged. Among the mission's newest planetary discoveries are its first Earth-size world, named TOI 700 d, which is located in the habitable zone of its star, the range of distances where conditions could be just right to allow liquid water on the surface. TESS revealed a newly minted planet around the young star AU Microscopii and found a Neptune-size world orbiting two suns.

Its initial survey of the sky took two years. In this time, TESS helped revolutionize our knowledge about exoplanets, worlds orbiting distant stars, continuing on from where the Kepler space telescope, NASA's first planet-hunter, left off. TESS' primary mission officially finished on July 4, 2020. After this, TESS will continue with its extended mission phase. During the two-year survey, TESS imaged about 75% of the sky, and so far has found 66 new confirmed exoplanets and nearly 2,100 additional candidates that are awaiting confirmation. Patricia Boyd, project scientist for TESS at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement: TESS is producing a torrent of high-quality observations providing valuable data across a wide range of science topics. During the first year, TESS observed 13 different sectors of the sky seen from the Southern Hemisphere, and then turned its attention to the northern sky in the second year. Each sector is a 24-by-96- degree strip of the sky, and TESS spends about a month surveying each sector. Now, TESS has returned to watching the northern sky again as it enters its extended mission. With that shift comes some other changes and improvements as well, according to NASA. TESS is now collecting data faster and more efficiently than it did during the primary mission, NASA said. The telescope's cameras can now capture a full image every 10 minutes, three times faster than they did in the primary mission. Also, by using a new fast mode, TESS can measure the brightness of thousands of stars every 20 seconds. Previously, the telescope would make similar measurements every two minutes. These improvements are not just good for planet-hunting, they also help TESS better resolve brightness changes caused by stellar oscillations and observe explosive flares from active stars in greater detail. This extended mission phase will continue until September 2022. TESS will spend the next year observing the southern sky, then will once again go back to surveying the northern sky for a period of 15 months. Those surveys will include observations along the ecliptic - the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun - that TESS has not yet imaged. How does TESS find exoplanets? Like many other telescopes, TESS uses the transit method of detecting exoplanets. That is, its instruments are geared to detecting slight decreases in the brightnesses of stars as planets pass in front of those stars as seen from Earth. Those temporary dips in brightness are very tiny, but TESS is able to see them, and determine whether they are caused by a planet. Last January, NASA announced that TESS had discovered its first Earth-sized planet, TOI 700 d, in the habitable zone of its red dwarf star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures on a rocky planet could allow liquid water to exist. The planet was later confirmed by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This planetary system is just over 100 light- years away in the constellation Dorado. According to Paul Hertz, astrophysics division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington: TESS was designed and launched specifically to find Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby stars. Planets around nearby stars are easiest to follow up with larger telescopes in space and on Earth. Discovering TOI 700 d is a key science finding for TESS. Confirming the planet's size and habitable zone status with Spitzer is another win for Spitzer as it approaches the end of science operations this January. TOI 700 d is the outermost of three known planets in the system and the only one in the habitable zone. It measures 20% larger than Earth, orbits its red dwarf star every 37 days and receives from its star 86% of the energy that the sun provides to Earth. It is expected that TESS will find many more Earth-sized worlds, including ones that are potentially habitable. In June, scientists reported that TESS found a Neptune-sized planet, AU Mic b, orbiting a very young red dwarf star. Bryson Cale, a doctoral student at George Mason University, said: AU Mic is a young, nearby M dwarf star. It's surrounded by a vast debris disk in which moving clumps of dust have been tracked, and now, thanks to TESS and Spitzer, it has a planet with a direct size measurement. There is no other known system that checks all of these important boxes. The star is only 10 to 20 million years old, and the planet completes an orbit in only 8.5 days. TESS also recently found its first circumbinary planet - one that orbits two stars - called TOI 1338 b. The two stars orbit each other every 15 days. One is about 10% more massive than our sun, while the other is cooler, dimmer and only 1/3 the sun's mass. The planet is about 6.9 times the size of Earth, between the size of Neptune and Saturn. TESS is good at multi-tasking too, NASA said, and has been studying more than just exoplanets. It has observed the outburst of a comet in our own solar system, as well as numerous exploding stars. It also found surprise eclipses in a well-known binary star system, solved a mystery about a class of pulsating stars, and explored a world experiencing star-modulated seasons. TESS even caught a black hole in a distant galaxy in the act of tearing apart a sun-like star with its enormous gravity! Thomas Holoien, of the Carnegie Observatories, is lead author of a paper that described the findings on September 27, 2019, in The Astrophysical Journal. Holoien said: TESS data let us see exactly when this destructive event, named ASASSN-19bt, started to get brighter, which we've never been able to do before. Because we identified the tidal disruption quickly with the ground-based All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we were able to trigger multiwavelength follow-up observations in the first few days. The early data will be incredibly helpful for modeling the physics of these outbursts. Last November, it was also announced that TESS would be teaming up with Breakthrough Listen in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, aka SETI. Basically, TESS will identify objects of interest, such as potentially habitable exoplanets, for other telescopes to point at and search for radio signals or other signs of advanced technologies, called technosignatures. In only the first couple years of its mission, TESS has not only found thousands of new exoplanets, but has observed and witnessed a wide variety of incredible cosmic objects and phenomena.

Other observations show that TOI 451 likely has two distant stellar companions circling each other far beyond the planets. \"This system checks a lot of boxes for astronomers,\" said Elisabeth Newton, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, who led the research. \"It's only 120 million years old and just 400 light-years away, allowing detailed observations of this young planetary system. And because there are three planets between two and four times Earth's size, they make especially promising targets for testing theories about how planetary atmospheres evolve.\" A paper reporting the findings was published on January 14, 2021, in The Astronomical Journal. Stellar streams form when the gravity of our Milky Way galaxy tears apart star clusters or dwarf galaxies. The individual stars move out along the cluster's original orbit, forming an elongated group that gradually disperses. In 2019, a team led by Stefan Meingast at the University of Vienna used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission to discover the Pisces-Eridanus stream, named for the constellations containing the greatest concentrations of stars. Stretching across 14 constellations, the stream is about 1,300 light-years long. However, the age initially determined for the stream was much older than we now think. Later in 2019, researchers led by Jason Curtis at Columbia University in New York City analyzed TESS data for dozens of stream members. Younger stars spin faster than their older counterparts do, and they also tend to have prominent starspots - darker, cooler regions like sunspots. As these spots rotate in and out of our view, they can produce slight variations in a star's brightness that TESS can measure. The TESS measurements revealed overwhelming evidence of starspots and rapid rotation among the stream's stars. Based on this result, Curtis and his colleagues found that the stream was only 120 million years old - similar to the famous Pleiades cluster and eight times younger than previous estimates. The mass, youth, and proximity of the Pisces-Eridanus stream make it an exciting fundamental laboratory for studying star and planet formation and evolution. \"Thanks to TESS's nearly all-sky coverage, measurements that could support a search for planets orbiting members of this stream were already available to us when the stream was identified,\" said Jessie Christiansen, a co-author of the paper and the deputy science lead at the NASA Exoplanet Archive, a facility for researching worlds beyond our solar system managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. \"TESS data will continue to allow us to push the limits of what we know about exoplanets and their systems for years to come.\" The young star TOI 451, better known to astronomers as CD-38 1467, lies about 400 light-years away in the constellation Eridanus. It has 95% of our Sun's mass, but it is 12% smaller, slightly cooler, and emits 35% less energy. TOI 451 rotates every 5.1 days, which is more than five times faster than the Sun. TESS spots new worlds by looking for transits, the slight, regular dimmings that occur when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. Transits from all three planets are evident in the TESS data. Newton's team obtained measurements from Spitzer that supported the TESS findings and helped to rule out possible alternative explanations. Additional follow-up observations came from Las Cumbres Observatory - a global telescope network headquartered in Goleta, California - and the Perth Exoplanet Survey Telescope in Australia. Even TOI 451's most distant planet orbits three times closer than Mercury ever approaches to the Sun, so all of these worlds are quite hot and inhospitable to life as we know it. Temperature estimates range from about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit for the innermost planet to about 840 F for the outermost one. TOI 451 b orbits every 1.9 days, is about 1.9 times Earth's size, and its estimated mass ranges from two to 12 times Earth's. The next planet out, TOI 451 c, completes an orbit every 9.2 days, is about three times larger than Earth, and holds between three and 16 times Earth's mass. The farthest and largest world, TOI 451 d, circles the star every 16 days, is four times the size of our planet, and weighs between four and 19 Earth masses. Astronomers expect planets as big as these to retain much of their atmospheres despite the intense heat from their nearby star. Different theories of how atmospheres evolve by the time a planetary system reaches TOI 451's age predict a wide range of properties. Observing starlight passing through the atmospheres of these planets provides an opportunity to study this phase of development and could aid in constraining current models. \"By measuring starlight penetrating a planet's atmosphere at different wavelengths, we can infer its chemical composition and the presence of clouds or high-altitude hazes,\" said Elisa Quintana, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"TOI 451's planets offer excellent targets for such studies with Hubble and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\" Observations from WISE show that the system is unusually bright in infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes, at wavelengths of 12 and 24 micrometers. This suggests the presence of a debris disk, where rocky asteroid-like bodies collide and grind themselves to dust. While Newton and her team cannot determine the extent of the disk, they envision it as a diffuse ring of rock and dust centered about as far from the star as Jupiter is from our Sun. The researchers also investigated a faint neighboring star that appears about two pixels away from TOI 451 in TESS images. Based on Gaia data, Newton's team determined this star to be a gravitationally bound companion located so far from TOI 451 that its light takes 27 days to get there. In fact, the researchers think the companion is likely a binary system of two M-type dwarf stars, each with about 45% of the Sun's mass and emitting only 2% of its energy.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/new-worlds-in-a-river-of-young-stars-discovered-by-nasas-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's new project will let you 'patrol' outer space for new planets", "date": "2020-10-01", "content": "You can now help discover new worlds beyond our solar system from the comfort of your home, thanks to a new citizen science platform called Planet Patrol launched by NASA.

TESS uses its four cameras to take full images of one patch of sky, called a sector, every 10 minutes for a month at a time. This long stare allows TESS to see when planets pass in front of their stars, or transit, and dim their light. Over the course of a year, TESS collects hundreds of thousands of snapshots, each containing thousands of possible planets -- too many for scientists to examine without help. On the new website, participants will help astronomers sift through TESS images of potential planets by answering a set of questions for each - like whether it contains multiple bright sources or if it resembles stray light rather than light from a star.

Now, we know thousands of distant planets - known as exoplanets - of the billions thought to exist in our Milky Way galaxy. Most exoplanet discoveries have come from space-based telescopes like Kepler. That mission ended with more than 4,000 exoplanets known, but the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has taken over where Kepler left off, and, as of last month, NASA said that TESS has found over 2,200 additional candidate planets - called TESS Objects of Interest - orbiting bright nearby stars. Hundreds of those may be smaller, rocky worlds like our Earth. Details about this latest haul of exoplanets in TESS's growing catalog were published in a draft version of a new paper on arXiv on March 24. Lead author Natalia Guerrero at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a statement: The exciting thing is to look at the map of TESS exoplanets as a kind of to-do list - with 2,000 things on it. How did TESS scientists find these new worlds? TESS looks for planets as they transit in front of their stars, as seen from Earth. When a planet transits, TESS measures the tiny dip in brightness of the star, as small as 0.1 percent. Jessie Christiansen, a research scientist at NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute, noted: It's an incredible body of work, a rich stockpile of exoplanet candidates for the community to mine and explore for years to come. This is exciting news, and builds on previous discoveries to show that our galaxy is filled with planets of many different kinds. These worlds range from \"super-puffs\" that are as large as Jupiter but only about 1/100th as massive, to \" hot Jupiters \" orbiting very close to their stars, to super-Earths that are a bit larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. Others are small and rocky just like Earth or Mars. It should be noted that many of these are still candidates, and are waiting for further confirmation as to their existence. About 120 have been confirmed so far, with many more to come. As with other telescopic surveys of exoplanets, the vast majority tend to be later confirmed as real planets, with only a small amount of false positives.

Other observations show that TOI 451 likely has two distant stellar companions circling each other far beyond the planets. \"This system checks a lot of boxes for astronomers,\" said Elisabeth Newton, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, who led the research. \"It's only 120 million years old and just 400 light-years away, allowing detailed observations of this young planetary system. And because there are three planets between two and four times Earth's size, they make especially promising targets for testing theories about how planetary atmospheres evolve.\" A paper reporting the findings was published on January 14, 2021, in The Astronomical Journal. Stellar streams form when the gravity of our Milky Way galaxy tears apart star clusters or dwarf galaxies. The individual stars move out along the cluster's original orbit, forming an elongated group that gradually disperses. In 2019, a team led by Stefan Meingast at the University of Vienna used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission to discover the Pisces-Eridanus stream, named for the constellations containing the greatest concentrations of stars. Stretching across 14 constellations, the stream is about 1,300 light-years long. However, the age initially determined for the stream was much older than we now think. Later in 2019, researchers led by Jason Curtis at Columbia University in New York City analyzed TESS data for dozens of stream members. Younger stars spin faster than their older counterparts do, and they also tend to have prominent starspots - darker, cooler regions like sunspots. As these spots rotate in and out of our view, they can produce slight variations in a star's brightness that TESS can measure. The TESS measurements revealed overwhelming evidence of starspots and rapid rotation among the stream's stars. Based on this result, Curtis and his colleagues found that the stream was only 120 million years old - similar to the famous Pleiades cluster and eight times younger than previous estimates. The mass, youth, and proximity of the Pisces-Eridanus stream make it an exciting fundamental laboratory for studying star and planet formation and evolution. \"Thanks to TESS's nearly all-sky coverage, measurements that could support a search for planets orbiting members of this stream were already available to us when the stream was identified,\" said Jessie Christiansen, a co-author of the paper and the deputy science lead at the NASA Exoplanet Archive, a facility for researching worlds beyond our solar system managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. \"TESS data will continue to allow us to push the limits of what we know about exoplanets and their systems for years to come.\" The young star TOI 451, better known to astronomers as CD-38 1467, lies about 400 light-years away in the constellation Eridanus. It has 95% of our Sun's mass, but it is 12% smaller, slightly cooler, and emits 35% less energy. TOI 451 rotates every 5.1 days, which is more than five times faster than the Sun. TESS spots new worlds by looking for transits, the slight, regular dimmings that occur when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. Transits from all three planets are evident in the TESS data. Newton's team obtained measurements from Spitzer that supported the TESS findings and helped to rule out possible alternative explanations. Additional follow-up observations came from Las Cumbres Observatory - a global telescope network headquartered in Goleta, California - and the Perth Exoplanet Survey Telescope in Australia. Even TOI 451's most distant planet orbits three times closer than Mercury ever approaches to the Sun, so all of these worlds are quite hot and inhospitable to life as we know it. Temperature estimates range from about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit for the innermost planet to about 840 F for the outermost one. TOI 451 b orbits every 1.9 days, is about 1.9 times Earth's size, and its estimated mass ranges from two to 12 times Earth's. The next planet out, TOI 451 c, completes an orbit every 9.2 days, is about three times larger than Earth, and holds between three and 16 times Earth's mass. The farthest and largest world, TOI 451 d, circles the star every 16 days, is four times the size of our planet, and weighs between four and 19 Earth masses. Astronomers expect planets as big as these to retain much of their atmospheres despite the intense heat from their nearby star. Different theories of how atmospheres evolve by the time a planetary system reaches TOI 451's age predict a wide range of properties. Observing starlight passing through the atmospheres of these planets provides an opportunity to study this phase of development and could aid in constraining current models. \"By measuring starlight penetrating a planet's atmosphere at different wavelengths, we can infer its chemical composition and the presence of clouds or high-altitude hazes,\" said Elisa Quintana, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"TOI 451's planets offer excellent targets for such studies with Hubble and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\" Observations from WISE show that the system is unusually bright in infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes, at wavelengths of 12 and 24 micrometers. This suggests the presence of a debris disk, where rocky asteroid-like bodies collide and grind themselves to dust. While Newton and her team cannot determine the extent of the disk, they envision it as a diffuse ring of rock and dust centered about as far from the star as Jupiter is from our Sun. The researchers also investigated a faint neighboring star that appears about two pixels away from TOI 451 in TESS images. Based on Gaia data, Newton's team determined this star to be a gravitationally bound companion located so far from TOI 451 that its light takes 27 days to get there. In fact, the researchers think the companion is likely a binary system of two M-type dwarf stars, each with about 45% of the Sun's mass and emitting only 2% of its energy.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/new-worlds-in-a-river-of-young-stars-discovered-by-nasas-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/"}, {"title": "NASA's TESS planet hunter spied 2200 candidate worlds in its first 2 years", "date": "2021-03-26", "content": "A NASA spacecraft built to spot alien worlds has completed its first two years of work, and the tally is in: the mission hauled in 2,241 new exoplanet candidates for scientists to study.

Both stars are around 200 million years old, less than one-twentieth the current age of our own solar system.

These stars, whose rhythms arise from internal sound waves, provide the opening chords of a symphonic exploration of our galactic neighborhood. TESS primarily hunts for worlds beyond our solar system, also known as exoplanets. But its sensitive measurements of stellar brightness make TESS ideal for studying stellar oscillations, an area of research called asteroseismology. \"Our initial result, using stellar measurements across TESS's first two years, shows that we can determine the masses and sizes of these oscillating giants with precision that will only improve as TESS goes on,\" said Marc Hon, a NASA Hubble Fellow at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. \"What's really unparalleled here is that TESS's broad coverage allows us to make these measurements uniformly across almost the entire sky.\" Hon presented the research during the second TESS Science Conference, an event supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge - held virtually from August 2 to 6 - where scientists discuss all aspects of the mission. The Astrophysical Journal has accepted a paper describing the findings, led by Hon. Sound waves traveling through any object - a guitar string, an organ pipe, or the interiors of Earth and the Sun - can reflect and interact, reinforcing some waves and canceling out others. This can result in orderly motion called standing waves, which create the tones in musical instruments. Just below the surfaces of stars like the Sun, hot gas rises, cools, and then sinks, where it heats up again, much like a pan of boiling water on a hot stove. This motion produces waves of changing pressure - sound waves - that interact, ultimately driving stable oscillations with periods of a few minutes that produce subtle brightness changes. For the Sun, these variations amount to a few parts per million. Giant stars with masses similar to the Sun's pulsate much more slowly, and the corresponding brightness changes can be hundreds of times greater. Oscillations in the Sun were first observed in the 1960s. Solar-like oscillations were detected in thousands of stars by the French-led Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) space telescope, which operated from 2006 to 2013. NASA's Kepler and K2 missions, which surveyed the sky from 2009 to 2018, found tens of thousands of oscillating giants. Now TESS extends this number by another 10 times. \"With a sample this large, giants that might occur only 1% of the time become pretty common,\" said co-author Jamie Tayar, a Hubble Fellow at the University of Hawaii. \"Now we can start thinking about finding even rarer examples.\" The physical differences between a cello and a violin produce their distinctive voices. Similarly, the stellar oscillations astronomers observe depend on each star's interior structure, mass, and size. This means asteroseismology can help determine fundamental properties for large numbers of stars with accuracies not achievable in any other way. When stars similar in mass to the Sun evolve into red giants, the penultimate phase of their stellar lives, their outer layers expand by 10 or more times. These vast gaseous envelopes pulsate with longer periods and larger amplitudes, which means their oscillations can be observed in fainter and more numerous stars. TESS monitors large swaths of the sky for about a month at a time using its four cameras. During its two-year primary mission, TESS covered about 75% of the sky, each camera capturing a full image measuring 24-by-24 degrees every 30 minutes. In mid-2020, the cameras began collecting these images at an even faster pace, every 10 minutes. The images were used to develop light curves - graphs of changing brightness - for nearly 24 million stars over 27 days, the length of time TESS stares at each swath of the sky. To sift through this immense accumulation of measurements, Hon and his colleagues taught a computer to recognize pulsating giants. The team used machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that trains computers to make decisions based on general patterns without explicitly programming them. To train the system, the team used Kepler light curves for more than 150,000 stars, of which some 20,000 were oscillating red giants. When the neural network finished processing all of the TESS data, it had identified a chorus of 158,505 pulsating giants. Next, the team found distances for each giant using data from ESA's (the European Space Agency's) Gaia mission, and plotted the masses of these stars across the sky. Stars more massive than the Sun evolve faster, becoming giants at younger ages. A fundamental prediction in galactic astronomy is that younger, higher-mass stars should lie closer to the plane of the galaxy, which is marked by the high density of stars that create the glowing band of the Milky Way in the night sky. \"Our map demonstrates for the first time empirically that this is indeed the case across nearly the whole sky,\" said co-author Daniel Huber, an assistant professor for astronomy at the University of Hawaii. \"With the help of Gaia, TESS has now given us tickets to a red giant concert in the sky.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

How these planets came to be in such extreme configurations is one of the continuing mysteries of exoplanetary science. Now, astronomers have discovered an ultra-short-period planet that is also super light. The planet is named GJ 367 b, and it orbits its star in just eight hours. The planet is about the size of Mars, and half as massive as the Earth, making it one of the lightest planets discovered to date. Orbiting a nearby star that is 31 light years from our own sun, GJ 367 b is close enough that researchers could pin down properties of the planet that were not possible with previously detected USPs. For instance, the team determined that GJ 376 b is a rocky planet and likely contains a solid core of iron and nickel, similar to Mercury's interior. Due to its extreme proximity to its star, the astronomers estimate GJ 376 b is blasted with 500 times more radiation than what the Earth receives from the sun. As a result, the planet's dayside boils at up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. Under such extreme temperatures, any substantial atmosphere would have long vaporized away, along with any signs of life, at least as we know it. But there is a chance that the planet has habitable partners. Its star is a red dwarf, or M dwarf - a type of star that typically hosts multiple planets. The discovery of GJ 367 b around such a star points to the possibility for more planets in this system, which could help scientists understand the origins of GJ 376 b and other ultra-short-period planets. \"For this class of star, the habitable zone would be somewhere near a month-long orbit,\" says team member George Ricker, senior research scientist in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"Since this star is so close by, and so bright, we have a good chance of seeing other planets in this system. It's like there's a sign saying, 'Look here for extra planets!'\" The team's results appear today in the journal Science. The study was led by researchers from the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center, in collaboration with an international group of researchers, including MIT co-authors Ricker, Roland Vanderspek, and Sara Seager. Transit tests: The new planet was discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an MIT-led mission, of which Ricker is principal investigator. TESS monitors the sky for changes in brightness of the nearest stars. Scientists look through TESS data for transits, or periodic dips in starlight that indicate a planet is crossing and briefly blocking a star's light. For about a month in 2019, TESS recorded a patch of the southern sky that included the star GJ 376. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere analyzed the data, and detected a transiting object with an ultra-short, eight-hour orbit. They ran several tests to make sure the signal was not from a \"false positive\" source such as a foreground or background eclipsing binary star. After confirming the object was indeed an ultra-short-period planet, they then observed the planet's star more closely, using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), an instrument installed on the European Southern Observatory's telescope in Chile. From these measurements, they determined the planet to be among the lightest planets discovered to date, with a radius that is 72 percent, and a mass that is 55 percent, that of Earth's. Such dimensions indicate that the planet likely has an iron-rich core. The researchers then whittled down various possibilities for the planet's interior composition and found the scenario that best fit the data showed that an iron core likely makes up 86 percent of the planet's interior, similar to the makeup of Mercury. \"We're finding a Mars-sized planet that has the composition of Mercury,\" says Vanderspek, principal research scientist at MIT. \"It's among the smallest planets detected to date, and it's spinning around an M dwarf on a very tight orbit.\" As scientists continue to study GJ 367 b and its star, they hope to detect signals of other planets in the system. The properties of these planets - such as their spacing and orbital orientation - could provide clues to how GJ 367 b and other ultra-short-period planets came to be. \"Understanding how these planets get so close to their host stars is a bit of a detective story,\" says TESS team member Natalia Guerrero. \"Why is this planet missing its outer atmosphere? How did it move close in? Was this process peaceful or violent? Hopefully this system will give us a little more insight.\"", "url": "https://news.mit.edu/2021/tess-exoplanet-orbit-dwarf-star-1202"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's TESS Tunes Into an Unprecedented All-Sky \"Symphony\" of Pulsating Red Giant Stars", "date": "2021-08-07", "content": "Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), astronomers have identified an unprecedented collection of pulsating red giant stars all across the sky.

Just below the surfaces of stars like the Sun, hot gas rises, cools, and then sinks, where it heats up again, much like a pan of boiling water on a hot stove. This motion produces waves of changing pressure - sound waves - that interact, ultimately driving stable oscillations with periods of a few minutes that produce subtle brightness changes. For the Sun, these variations amount to a few parts per million. Giant stars with masses similar to the Sun's pulsate much more slowly, and the corresponding brightness changes can be hundreds of times greater. Oscillations in the Sun were first observed in the 1960s. Solar-like oscillations were detected in thousands of stars by the French-led Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) space telescope, which operated from 2006 to 2013. NASA's Kepler and K2 missions, which surveyed the sky from 2009 to 2018, found tens of thousands of oscillating giants. Now TESS extends this number by another 10 times. \"With a sample this large, giants that might occur only 1% of the time become pretty common,\" said co-author Jamie Tayar, a Hubble Fellow at the University of Hawaii. \"Now we can start thinking about finding even rarer examples.\" The physical differences between a cello and a violin produce their distinctive voices. Similarly, the stellar oscillations astronomers observe depend on each star's interior structure, mass, and size. This means asteroseismology can help determine fundamental properties for large numbers of stars with accuracies not achievable in any other way. When stars similar in mass to the Sun evolve into red giants, the penultimate phase of their stellar lives, their outer layers expand by 10 or more times. These vast gaseous envelopes pulsate with longer periods and larger amplitudes, which means their oscillations can be observed in fainter and more numerous stars. TESS monitors large swaths of the sky for about a month at a time using its four cameras. During its two-year primary mission, TESS covered about 75% of the sky, each camera capturing a full image measuring 24-by-24 degrees every 30 minutes. In mid-2020, the cameras began collecting these images at an even faster pace, every 10 minutes. The images were used to develop light curves - graphs of changing brightness - for nearly 24 million stars over 27 days, the length of time TESS stares at each swath of the sky. To sift through this immense accumulation of measurements, Hon and his colleagues taught a computer to recognize pulsating giants. The team used machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that trains computers to make decisions based on general patterns without explicitly programming them. To train the system, the team used Kepler light curves for more than 150,000 stars, of which some 20,000 were oscillating red giants. When the neural network finished processing all of the TESS data, it had identified a chorus of 158,505 pulsating giants. Next, the team found distances for each giant using data from ESA's (the European Space Agency's) Gaia mission, and plotted the masses of these stars across the sky. Stars more massive than the Sun evolve faster, becoming giants at younger ages. A fundamental prediction in galactic astronomy is that younger, higher-mass stars should lie closer to the plane of the galaxy, which is marked by the high density of stars that create the glowing band of the Milky Way in the night sky. \"Our map demonstrates for the first time empirically that this is indeed the case across nearly the whole sky,\" said co-author Daniel Huber, an assistant professor for astronomy at the University of Hawaii. \"With the help of Gaia, TESS has now given us tickets to a red giant concert in the sky.\" TESS is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission led and operated by MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

TESS is good at finding exoplanets, but the spacecraft is a powerful scientific platform, and it's made other discoveries, too. Scientists working with TESS recently announced 97 quadruple star candidates, nearly doubling the number of known quadruple systems. TESS's mission is to find exoplanets. More specifically, its mission is to find exoplanets around nearby bright stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite can also study those planets' mass, density, size, and orbit. But TESS's field of view is wide, much wider than its predecessor, the Kepler Space Telescope. Its array of wide-field cameras has surveyed 85% of the sky and gathered an enormous quantity of data. Scientists use machine learning and a cohort of eager citizen scientists to comb through that data. According to a new paper, the latest results from TESS data is a catalogue of 97 \"...uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star systems,\" according to a new paper. The paper is \"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images.\" The paper is available at the pre-press site arxiv.org and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The paper's lead author is Veselin Kostov from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen scientists,\" the authors write. To find these systems, it took a collaboration between some of the usual suspects-the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Astrophysics Science Division and the MIT Kavli Institute. But the professionals at those research institutions needed some help. That help came from seven experienced citizen scientists who assisted in the painstaking effort of pixel-by-pixel analysis of light curves. \"To rule out false positives due to nearby field stars or systematic effects, we evaluate the pixel-by-pixel light curve of the target ...\" the authors write in their paper. The researchers focused their effort on identifying triple and quadruple star systems, but the results go beyond those multiple star systems. They also found \"... the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data,\" the authors explain. Quadruple star systems contain two pairs of eclipsing binary stars. However, they're only EBs if they eclipse one another from our vantage point. All those transits and eclipses can be difficult to entangle, which explains the helping hand from dedicated citizen scientists. The researchers were interested only in specific quadruple star systems, and they deliberately excluded others. \"We note that the targets listed in this catalogue are quadruple candidates that each originate from a single TESS source, i.e. the two-component EBs are unresolved in TESS data,\" they write. These quad systems are in the catalogue because they exhibit changes observable in human timescales. \"The reason is that for the purposes of this work, our interests are in close quadruple systems that can exhibit dynamically-interesting interactions on a human timescale ,\" they explain. That explanation is a bit wordy, but it boils down to this: TESS pixel width can be vast. If TESS locates a pair of EBs separated by two TESS pixels, and if the EBs are 500 parsecs away from us, that means the EBs are separated from each other by up to 20,000 AU. At that vast distance from one another, it could take generations of human observations to notice any interactions between the stars. Systems must be closer to one another to exhibit interesting interactions observable in months or years, so they must be in the same TESS pixel. This is what necessitated the painstaking pixel-by-pixel analysis. The systems in the catalogue survived a stringent vetting process. The team also encountered many false positives. A field star near the target often appeared to be another EB until deeper analysis ruled it out. Other times they detected two EB pairs, but they were not interconnected and were too distant from each other to constitute a quadruple star system. There were also triple star systems whose eclipse pattern mimicked a quadruple star system. All in all, there were five false-positive scenarios. In their summary, the authors write that \"The target stars have been identified through visual inspection and exhibit two sets of eclipses with two distinct periods, each with primary and, in most cases, secondary eclipses. All targets have been uniformly-vetted and passed a series of tests, including pixel-by-pixel and photocenter motion analysis.\" Why are astronomers interested in quadruple systems? Multiple star systems can reveal a lot about stellar evolution pathways. Astronomers and astrophysicists are interested in stellar stages of evolution like short-period binaries, common-envelope events, Type Ia Supernovae, and black hole mergers. The arrangement of the stars in multiple systems is also evidence of how the stars formed. \"For example, the mass ratios between the individual components of a quadruple system, the period ratios between the constituent binary systems and the mutual inclination provide important insight into whether the system formed through a 'top-down' scenario via core or disk fragmentation or 'bottom-up' aggregation via gravitational capture,\" they write. Another exciting aspect of multiple star systems concerns planets. Astronomers have found some planets around multiple star systems, but their origins and fates are unclear. In 2015 astronomers discovered a massive planet in the quadruple star system 30 Arietis. According to that discovery, the system is home to an enormous gas giant ten times more massive than Jupiter. It was the second known planet instance in a quadruple star system. In 2019 researchers found a unique quadruple star system where the stars are at a right angle to the disk of gas and dust surrounding them. Planets will likely form from this protoplanetary disk. How unusual would the view from a planet's surface be in that system? The team of researchers isn't finished yet. They say that they've detected an order of magnitude more false positives than vetted detections and that complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. \"... given the large number of targets inspected and assuming many of the additional candidates turn out to be real, TESS has the potential to increase the number of known eclipsing quadruple systems by more than a factor of two,\" they write.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-tess-finds-almost-100-quadruple-star-systems/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "TESS discovers a planet the size of Mars but with the makeup ", "date": "2021-12-02", "content": "Ultra-short-period planets are small, compact worlds that whip around their stars at close range, completing an orbit - and a single, scorching year - in less than 24 hours.

But TESS's field of view is wide, much wider than its predecessor, the Kepler Space Telescope. Its array of wide-field cameras has surveyed 85% of the sky and gathered an enormous quantity of data. Scientists use machine learning and a cohort of eager citizen scientists to comb through that data. According to a new paper, the latest results from TESS data is a catalogue of 97 \"...uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star systems,\" according to a new paper. The paper is \"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images.\" The paper is available at the pre-press site arxiv.org and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The paper's lead author is Veselin Kostov from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen scientists,\" the authors write. To find these systems, it took a collaboration between some of the usual suspects-the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Astrophysics Science Division and the MIT Kavli Institute. But the professionals at those research institutions needed some help. That help came from seven experienced citizen scientists who assisted in the painstaking effort of pixel-by-pixel analysis of light curves. \"To rule out false positives due to nearby field stars or systematic effects, we evaluate the pixel-by-pixel light curve of the target ...\" the authors write in their paper. The researchers focused their effort on identifying triple and quadruple star systems, but the results go beyond those multiple star systems. They also found \"... the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data,\" the authors explain. Quadruple star systems contain two pairs of eclipsing binary stars. However, they're only EBs if they eclipse one another from our vantage point. All those transits and eclipses can be difficult to entangle, which explains the helping hand from dedicated citizen scientists. The researchers were interested only in specific quadruple star systems, and they deliberately excluded others. \"We note that the targets listed in this catalogue are quadruple candidates that each originate from a single TESS source, i.e. the two-component EBs are unresolved in TESS data,\" they write. These quad systems are in the catalogue because they exhibit changes observable in human timescales. \"The reason is that for the purposes of this work, our interests are in close quadruple systems that can exhibit dynamically-interesting interactions on a human timescale ,\" they explain. That explanation is a bit wordy, but it boils down to this: TESS pixel width can be vast. If TESS locates a pair of EBs separated by two TESS pixels, and if the EBs are 500 parsecs away from us, that means the EBs are separated from each other by up to 20,000 AU. At that vast distance from one another, it could take generations of human observations to notice any interactions between the stars. Systems must be closer to one another to exhibit interesting interactions observable in months or years, so they must be in the same TESS pixel. This is what necessitated the painstaking pixel-by-pixel analysis. The systems in the catalogue survived a stringent vetting process. The team also encountered many false positives. A field star near the target often appeared to be another EB until deeper analysis ruled it out. Other times they detected two EB pairs, but they were not interconnected and were too distant from each other to constitute a quadruple star system. There were also triple star systems whose eclipse pattern mimicked a quadruple star system. All in all, there were five false-positive scenarios. In their summary, the authors write that \"The target stars have been identified through visual inspection and exhibit two sets of eclipses with two distinct periods, each with primary and, in most cases, secondary eclipses. All targets have been uniformly-vetted and passed a series of tests, including pixel-by-pixel and photocenter motion analysis.\" Why are astronomers interested in quadruple systems? Multiple star systems can reveal a lot about stellar evolution pathways. Astronomers and astrophysicists are interested in stellar stages of evolution like short-period binaries, common-envelope events, Type Ia Supernovae, and black hole mergers. The arrangement of the stars in multiple systems is also evidence of how the stars formed. \"For example, the mass ratios between the individual components of a quadruple system, the period ratios between the constituent binary systems and the mutual inclination provide important insight into whether the system formed through a 'top-down' scenario via core or disk fragmentation or 'bottom-up' aggregation via gravitational capture,\" they write. Another exciting aspect of multiple star systems concerns planets. Astronomers have found some planets around multiple star systems, but their origins and fates are unclear. In 2015 astronomers discovered a massive planet in the quadruple star system 30 Arietis. According to that discovery, the system is home to an enormous gas giant ten times more massive than Jupiter. It was the second known planet instance in a quadruple star system. In 2019 researchers found a unique quadruple star system where the stars are at a right angle to the disk of gas and dust surrounding them. Planets will likely form from this protoplanetary disk. How unusual would the view from a planet's surface be in that system? The team of researchers isn't finished yet. They say that they've detected an order of magnitude more false positives than vetted detections and that complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. \"... given the large number of targets inspected and assuming many of the additional candidates turn out to be real, TESS has the potential to increase the number of known eclipsing quadruple systems by more than a factor of two,\" they write.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-tess-finds-almost-100-quadruple-star-systems/"}, {"title": "NASA Will Find 12,519 New Alien Planets By 2024 Including 'Dozens Similar To Earth's Size' Say Scientists", "date": "2022-03-07", "content": "NASA's exoplanet catalogue and you'll see that just shy of 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered and confirmed so far. Expect that figure to grow massively in the next few years as data from NASA's exoplanet-spotting spacecraft reveals a staggering haul of alien worlds, according to a new study. A paper published on the pre-print service arXiv reveals that NASA's $287 million Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered about 5,000 planets and planet candidates in its first three and a half years of observations. An exoplanet is a planet orbiting another star, so beyond our Solar System. Launched in mid-2018 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the TESS spacecraft quickly completed its first mission; to identify exoplanets orbiting bright stars in the northern sky within 300 light years of Earth using its wide-field telescope. In mid-2020 it began its first extended mission-to observe exoplanets around the ecliptic plane of the Solar System-and in September this year it will begin a second extended mission to doo the same for the southern sky. What more it it going to find? Quite a lot, according to the paper's authors, who used simulations of detectable planets to calculate that TESS will gradually reveal many thousands more exoplanets-and not just from observations it's yet to make. That's a staggering total of 12,519 exoplanets! By the end of its second extended mission TESS will be in its seventh year, by which time it will have observed almost the entire sky. The authors calculate that by the end of its three missions its haul of exoplanets will reveal that G-type stars-stars like our Sun-are the most common exoplanet hosts. And while most of the exoplanets it finds will be giant planets, as the mission wears on it will find more and more smaller and smaller planets \"including dozens similar to Earth's size,\" reads the paper. TESS will also find hot Neptunes, giant planets around red dwarf stars and planets that take more than 500 days to orbit their stars, according to the authors. Exactly those types of exoplanets were missing from the data provided by NASA's $600 million Kepler Space Telescope, a keystone mission for exoplanet science that launched in 2009 and observed almost 200,000 stars in a tiny patch of sky between 2009 and 2018. Kepler looked for planets transiting across their hosts stars, identifying a staggering 2,392 exoplanets before suffering a technical defect.

How these planets came to be in such extreme configurations is one of the continuing mysteries of exoplanetary science. Now, astronomers have discovered an ultra-short-period planet that is also super light. The planet is named GJ 367 b, and it orbits its star in just eight hours. The planet is about the size of Mars, and half as massive as the Earth, making it one of the lightest planets discovered to date. Orbiting a nearby star that is 31 light years from our own sun, GJ 367 b is close enough that researchers could pin down properties of the planet that were not possible with previously detected USPs. For instance, the team determined that GJ 376 b is a rocky planet and likely contains a solid core of iron and nickel, similar to Mercury's interior. Due to its extreme proximity to its star, the astronomers estimate GJ 376 b is blasted with 500 times more radiation than what the Earth receives from the sun. As a result, the planet's dayside boils at up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. Under such extreme temperatures, any substantial atmosphere would have long vaporized away, along with any signs of life, at least as we know it. But there is a chance that the planet has habitable partners. Its star is a red dwarf, or M dwarf - a type of star that typically hosts multiple planets. The discovery of GJ 367 b around such a star points to the possibility for more planets in this system, which could help scientists understand the origins of GJ 376 b and other ultra-short-period planets. \"For this class of star, the habitable zone would be somewhere near a month-long orbit,\" says team member George Ricker, senior research scientist in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"Since this star is so close by, and so bright, we have a good chance of seeing other planets in this system. It's like there's a sign saying, 'Look here for extra planets!'\" The team's results appear today in the journal Science. The study was led by researchers from the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center, in collaboration with an international group of researchers, including MIT co-authors Ricker, Roland Vanderspek, and Sara Seager. Transit tests: The new planet was discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an MIT-led mission, of which Ricker is principal investigator. TESS monitors the sky for changes in brightness of the nearest stars. Scientists look through TESS data for transits, or periodic dips in starlight that indicate a planet is crossing and briefly blocking a star's light. For about a month in 2019, TESS recorded a patch of the southern sky that included the star GJ 376. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere analyzed the data, and detected a transiting object with an ultra-short, eight-hour orbit. They ran several tests to make sure the signal was not from a \"false positive\" source such as a foreground or background eclipsing binary star. After confirming the object was indeed an ultra-short-period planet, they then observed the planet's star more closely, using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), an instrument installed on the European Southern Observatory's telescope in Chile. From these measurements, they determined the planet to be among the lightest planets discovered to date, with a radius that is 72 percent, and a mass that is 55 percent, that of Earth's. Such dimensions indicate that the planet likely has an iron-rich core. The researchers then whittled down various possibilities for the planet's interior composition and found the scenario that best fit the data showed that an iron core likely makes up 86 percent of the planet's interior, similar to the makeup of Mercury. \"We're finding a Mars-sized planet that has the composition of Mercury,\" says Vanderspek, principal research scientist at MIT. \"It's among the smallest planets detected to date, and it's spinning around an M dwarf on a very tight orbit.\" As scientists continue to study GJ 367 b and its star, they hope to detect signals of other planets in the system. The properties of these planets - such as their spacing and orbital orientation - could provide clues to how GJ 367 b and other ultra-short-period planets came to be. \"Understanding how these planets get so close to their host stars is a bit of a detective story,\" says TESS team member Natalia Guerrero. \"Why is this planet missing its outer atmosphere? How did it move close in? Was this process peaceful or violent? Hopefully this system will give us a little more insight.\"", "url": "https://news.mit.edu/2021/tess-exoplanet-orbit-dwarf-star-1202"}, {"title": "Doubling Planets: TESS Science Office at MIT Hits Milestone of 5,000 Exoplanet Candidates", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "The catalog of planet candidates found with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite recently passed 5,000 TOIs, or TESS Objects of Interest.

Kunimoto reflects, \"This time last year, TESS had found just over 2,400 TOIs. Today, TESS has reached more than twice that number - a huge testament to the mission and all the teams scouring the data for new planets.

TESS re-observed the sky visible in the Earth's Southern Hemisphere, revisiting stars it had first observed at the mission's start in 2018. TOI manager Katharine Hesse remarks, \"With data from the first year of the extended mission, we have found dozens of additional candidates to TOIs found during the prime mission. I am excited to see how many multi-planet systems we can find during the rest of the extended mission and in upcoming years with TESS.\" Planned extensions of the TESS mission to 2025 and beyond should unveil many more new planet candidates. Discovering more planet candidates and adding them to the TESS Objects of Interest Catalog is the first step.

It's called a \"micronova,\" and it's smaller than a classical nova or dazzling supernova but still powerful enough to burn through entire mountain ranges in a few hours. Researchers led by Simone Scaringi at Durham University's Center for Extragalactic Astronomy spent months puzzled by data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TESS is used to search for planets around other stars by taking a close look at the light from those stars for dips in brightness that could be caused by other worlds passing in front. But at least three stars TESS observed showed unusual bursts in brightness lasting for just a few hours at a time. \"We couldn't explain it until we made, finally, a connection that these may be thermonuclear explosions happening on accreting white dwarfs,\" explains Scaringi, who's lead author on a study published in the latest issue of the journal Nature. A white dwarf is a star that's as powerful as the sun, but only about the size of the Earth. In a two-star system, a white dwarf can often suck up, or accrete, hydrogen and other material from its companion star. This gas can build up around the white dwarf until it triggers an explosion, or nova, that can make the star system shine up to a million times more brightly. The gas could even spur the much more spectacular supernova, which could make the system shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for several weeks. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is.\" Simone Scaringi, astronomer Micronovas appear to start the same way, but are smaller, faster and happen on white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields that push stolen material toward the star's poles. The result is a big blast around the pole that's only one millionth the size of a nova explosion. Hence the name \"micronova.\" While a micronova might seem small on the scale of the cosmos, you still wouldn't want to be caught up in one. Explosions like those the researchers observed in TESS data are still powerful enough to burn through over 124,000 mountains the size and mass of Mount Everest in less than a day. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is,\" Scaringi said in a statement. \"These events may actually be quite common, but because they are so fast they are difficult to catch in action.\" He says micronovas challenge astronomers' understanding of how stellar thermonuclear explosions occur. Next, the team hopes to use more large-scale sky surveys to spot the elusive events and then make quick follow-up observations with powerful telescopes for a more detailed look at the new phenomenon.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/scientists-spot-new-type-of-stellar-explosion-thats-small-but-fierce/"}, {"title": "Largest treasure trove of exocomets to date found in alien solar system", "date": "2022-04-28", "content": "Thirty alien comets have been spotted transiting the young star Beta Pictoris, their long tails lighting up the skies of the fledgling planets forming there. The comet discovery has been made using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which watches for dips in starlight as planetary bodies pass in front of - or transit - their star. Beta Pictoris, which is 63.4 light years away, is home to a dusty planet-forming disk that was discovered back in 1983 by IRAS, the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The disk contains at least two planets, both gas giants, and spectral observations gathered as long ago as 1987 suggested evidence for comets releasing dust and gas into the disk. In 2019, astronomers led by Sebastian Zieba, of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, used TESS to discover three 'exocomets' transiting Beta Pictoris. Now, another team, led by astronomer Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris in France, has observed 30 exocomets in the Beta Pictoris system, including the three previously discovered. \"These additional exocomet detections are very useful because we now see many different comets of different sizes, which means we can begin to compare their size distribution - how many small ones we see compared to the bigger ones,\" Matthew Kenworthy, an astronomer at Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands and a member of both research teams, told Space.com. Although Beta Pictoris is not the first star around which exocomets have been discovered, it is the first star for which it has been possible to measure the size distribution of the comets. Based on the size of their tails and the amount of dust they produce as a model), Lecavelier des Etangs' team was able to measure the diameter of the nucleus or core of each comet, finding them to range between 2 and 8.7 miles across, with more smaller comets than larger comets. In fact, the size distribution of the exocomets closely matches the size distribution of comets in our solar system. This pattern suggests that the processes that formed the exocomets around Beta Pictoris are the same as those that formed our solar system's comets; in turn the way that cometary formation plays into planet formation is also likely the same. Astronomers can learn more about how the planets of the solar system, including Earth, formed by studying exoplanetary systems. The prevailing model of planet formation, at least for rocky planets, is that they are the result of collisions and mergers between smaller bodies - comets, asteroids and planetesimals. If the gravity of the bodies involved in a collision is strong enough, it can mold the resulting debris into a larger body. If the objects colliding are too small, then there won't be enough gravity to merge them, and instead they will fragment and disperse, resulting in more smaller bodies than larger ones. That's exactly what astronomers see in the size distribution of Beta Pictoris' exocomets. \"The size distribution is remarkably similar to that predicted for a population of debris resulting from collision and fragmentation cascades,\" Lecavelier des Etangs told Space.com. For the scientists, it's reassuring to gain more evidence that planets form in the same way around different stars, so that we can draw direct comparisons with our solar system. \"The formation of planets and comets are tied together,\" Kenworthy said. \"So our first measurement of a comet distribution outside of our solar system advances our understanding of these processes.\" Comets are also believed to be important for life, potentially delivering water and biological building blocks to the surfaces of planets. Beta Pictoris is only about 25 million years old, and this process of comet impacts bringing life's ingredients to so-far unseen terrestrial planets may have already begun. For Lecavelier des Etangs, the observations provide a sense of personal justification. Back in 1999, a few months before even the first planet had been discovered by the transit method, he predicted that one day, exocomets would be discovered transiting Beta Pictoris. \"It gives me deep satisfaction to see that the prediction that I made over 20 years ago has been shown to be true,\" he said. \"But the most important thing is that not only was it right, but that it was useful!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/comets-beta-pictoris-most-exocomets-discovered"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "TESS discovers a planet the size of Mars but with the makeup ", "date": "2021-12-02", "content": "Ultra-short-period planets are small, compact worlds that whip around their stars at close range, completing an orbit - and a single, scorching year - in less than 24 hours.

For instance, the team determined that GJ 376 b is a rocky planet and likely contains a solid core of iron and nickel, similar to Mercury's interior. Due to its extreme proximity to its star, the astronomers estimate GJ 376 b is blasted with 500 times more radiation than what the Earth receives from the sun. As a result, the planet's dayside boils at up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. Under such extreme temperatures, any substantial atmosphere would have long vaporized away, along with any signs of life, at least as we know it. But there is a chance that the planet has habitable partners. Its star is a red dwarf, or M dwarf - a type of star that typically hosts multiple planets. The discovery of GJ 367 b around such a star points to the possibility for more planets in this system, which could help scientists understand the origins of GJ 376 b and other ultra-short-period planets. \"For this class of star, the habitable zone would be somewhere near a month-long orbit,\" says team member George Ricker, senior research scientist in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"Since this star is so close by, and so bright, we have a good chance of seeing other planets in this system. It's like there's a sign saying, 'Look here for extra planets!'\" The team's results appear today in the journal Science. The study was led by researchers from the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center, in collaboration with an international group of researchers, including MIT co-authors Ricker, Roland Vanderspek, and Sara Seager. Transit tests: The new planet was discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an MIT-led mission, of which Ricker is principal investigator. TESS monitors the sky for changes in brightness of the nearest stars. Scientists look through TESS data for transits, or periodic dips in starlight that indicate a planet is crossing and briefly blocking a star's light. For about a month in 2019, TESS recorded a patch of the southern sky that included the star GJ 376. Scientists at MIT and elsewhere analyzed the data, and detected a transiting object with an ultra-short, eight-hour orbit. They ran several tests to make sure the signal was not from a \"false positive\" source such as a foreground or background eclipsing binary star. After confirming the object was indeed an ultra-short-period planet, they then observed the planet's star more closely, using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), an instrument installed on the European Southern Observatory's telescope in Chile. From these measurements, they determined the planet to be among the lightest planets discovered to date, with a radius that is 72 percent, and a mass that is 55 percent, that of Earth's. Such dimensions indicate that the planet likely has an iron-rich core. The researchers then whittled down various possibilities for the planet's interior composition and found the scenario that best fit the data showed that an iron core likely makes up 86 percent of the planet's interior, similar to the makeup of Mercury. \"We're finding a Mars-sized planet that has the composition of Mercury,\" says Vanderspek, principal research scientist at MIT. \"It's among the smallest planets detected to date, and it's spinning around an M dwarf on a very tight orbit.\" As scientists continue to study GJ 367 b and its star, they hope to detect signals of other planets in the system. The properties of these planets - such as their spacing and orbital orientation - could provide clues to how GJ 367 b and other ultra-short-period planets came to be. \"Understanding how these planets get so close to their host stars is a bit of a detective story,\" says TESS team member Natalia Guerrero. \"Why is this planet missing its outer atmosphere? How did it move close in? Was this process peaceful or violent? Hopefully this system will give us a little more insight.\"", "url": "https://news.mit.edu/2021/tess-exoplanet-orbit-dwarf-star-1202"}, {"title": "Doubling Planets: TESS Science Office at MIT Hits Milestone of 5,000 Exoplanet Candidates", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "The catalog of planet candidates found with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite recently passed 5,000 TOIs, or TESS Objects of Interest.

Kunimoto reflects, \"This time last year, TESS had found just over 2,400 TOIs. Today, TESS has reached more than twice that number - a huge testament to the mission and all the teams scouring the data for new planets. I'm excited to see thousands more in the years to come!\" Now in its extended mission, TESS is observing the Northern Hemisphere and ecliptic plane, including regions of the sky previously observed by the Kepler and K2 missions. The TOIs added in late December are from the third year of the TESS mission, which ran from July 2020 to June 2021. TESS re-observed the sky visible in the Earth's Southern Hemisphere, revisiting stars it had first observed at the mission's start in 2018. TOI manager Katharine Hesse remarks, \"With data from the first year of the extended mission, we have found dozens of additional candidates to TOIs found during the prime mission.

TESS is good at finding exoplanets, but the spacecraft is a powerful scientific platform, and it's made other discoveries, too. Scientists working with TESS recently announced 97 quadruple star candidates, nearly doubling the number of known quadruple systems. TESS's mission is to find exoplanets. More specifically, its mission is to find exoplanets around nearby bright stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite can also study those planets' mass, density, size, and orbit. But TESS's field of view is wide, much wider than its predecessor, the Kepler Space Telescope. Its array of wide-field cameras has surveyed 85% of the sky and gathered an enormous quantity of data. Scientists use machine learning and a cohort of eager citizen scientists to comb through that data. According to a new paper, the latest results from TESS data is a catalogue of 97 \"...uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star systems,\" according to a new paper. The paper is \"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images.\" The paper is available at the pre-press site arxiv.org and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The paper's lead author is Veselin Kostov from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen scientists,\" the authors write. To find these systems, it took a collaboration between some of the usual suspects-the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Astrophysics Science Division and the MIT Kavli Institute. But the professionals at those research institutions needed some help. That help came from seven experienced citizen scientists who assisted in the painstaking effort of pixel-by-pixel analysis of light curves. \"To rule out false positives due to nearby field stars or systematic effects, we evaluate the pixel-by-pixel light curve of the target ...\" the authors write in their paper. The researchers focused their effort on identifying triple and quadruple star systems, but the results go beyond those multiple star systems. They also found \"... the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data,\" the authors explain. Quadruple star systems contain two pairs of eclipsing binary stars. However, they're only EBs if they eclipse one another from our vantage point. All those transits and eclipses can be difficult to entangle, which explains the helping hand from dedicated citizen scientists. The researchers were interested only in specific quadruple star systems, and they deliberately excluded others. \"We note that the targets listed in this catalogue are quadruple candidates that each originate from a single TESS source, i.e. the two-component EBs are unresolved in TESS data,\" they write. These quad systems are in the catalogue because they exhibit changes observable in human timescales. \"The reason is that for the purposes of this work, our interests are in close quadruple systems that can exhibit dynamically-interesting interactions on a human timescale ,\" they explain. That explanation is a bit wordy, but it boils down to this: TESS pixel width can be vast. If TESS locates a pair of EBs separated by two TESS pixels, and if the EBs are 500 parsecs away from us, that means the EBs are separated from each other by up to 20,000 AU. At that vast distance from one another, it could take generations of human observations to notice any interactions between the stars. Systems must be closer to one another to exhibit interesting interactions observable in months or years, so they must be in the same TESS pixel. This is what necessitated the painstaking pixel-by-pixel analysis. The systems in the catalogue survived a stringent vetting process. The team also encountered many false positives. A field star near the target often appeared to be another EB until deeper analysis ruled it out. Other times they detected two EB pairs, but they were not interconnected and were too distant from each other to constitute a quadruple star system. There were also triple star systems whose eclipse pattern mimicked a quadruple star system. All in all, there were five false-positive scenarios. In their summary, the authors write that \"The target stars have been identified through visual inspection and exhibit two sets of eclipses with two distinct periods, each with primary and, in most cases, secondary eclipses. All targets have been uniformly-vetted and passed a series of tests, including pixel-by-pixel and photocenter motion analysis.\" Why are astronomers interested in quadruple systems? Multiple star systems can reveal a lot about stellar evolution pathways. Astronomers and astrophysicists are interested in stellar stages of evolution like short-period binaries, common-envelope events, Type Ia Supernovae, and black hole mergers. The arrangement of the stars in multiple systems is also evidence of how the stars formed. \"For example, the mass ratios between the individual components of a quadruple system, the period ratios between the constituent binary systems and the mutual inclination provide important insight into whether the system formed through a 'top-down' scenario via core or disk fragmentation or 'bottom-up' aggregation via gravitational capture,\" they write. Another exciting aspect of multiple star systems concerns planets. Astronomers have found some planets around multiple star systems, but their origins and fates are unclear. In 2015 astronomers discovered a massive planet in the quadruple star system 30 Arietis. According to that discovery, the system is home to an enormous gas giant ten times more massive than Jupiter. It was the second known planet instance in a quadruple star system. In 2019 researchers found a unique quadruple star system where the stars are at a right angle to the disk of gas and dust surrounding them. Planets will likely form from this protoplanetary disk. How unusual would the view from a planet's surface be in that system? The team of researchers isn't finished yet. They say that they've detected an order of magnitude more false positives than vetted detections and that complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. \"... given the large number of targets inspected and assuming many of the additional candidates turn out to be real, TESS has the potential to increase the number of known eclipsing quadruple systems by more than a factor of two,\" they write.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-tess-finds-almost-100-quadruple-star-systems/"}, {"title": "NASA Will Find 12,519 New Alien Planets By 2024 Including 'Dozens Similar To Earth's Size' Say Scientists", "date": "2022-03-07", "content": "NASA's exoplanet catalogue and you'll see that just shy of 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered and confirmed so far. Expect that figure to grow massively in the next few years as data from NASA's exoplanet-spotting spacecraft reveals a staggering haul of alien worlds, according to a new study. A paper published on the pre-print service arXiv reveals that NASA's $287 million Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered about 5,000 planets and planet candidates in its first three and a half years of observations. An exoplanet is a planet orbiting another star, so beyond our Solar System. Launched in mid-2018 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the TESS spacecraft quickly completed its first mission; to identify exoplanets orbiting bright stars in the northern sky within 300 light years of Earth using its wide-field telescope. In mid-2020 it began its first extended mission-to observe exoplanets around the ecliptic plane of the Solar System-and in September this year it will begin a second extended mission to doo the same for the southern sky. What more it it going to find? Quite a lot, according to the paper's authors, who used simulations of detectable planets to calculate that TESS will gradually reveal many thousands more exoplanets-and not just from observations it's yet to make. That's a staggering total of 12,519 exoplanets! By the end of its second extended mission TESS will be in its seventh year, by which time it will have observed almost the entire sky. The authors calculate that by the end of its three missions its haul of exoplanets will reveal that G-type stars-stars like our Sun-are the most common exoplanet hosts. And while most of the exoplanets it finds will be giant planets, as the mission wears on it will find more and more smaller and smaller planets \"including dozens similar to Earth's size,\" reads the paper. TESS will also find hot Neptunes, giant planets around red dwarf stars and planets that take more than 500 days to orbit their stars, according to the authors. Exactly those types of exoplanets were missing from the data provided by NASA's $600 million Kepler Space Telescope, a keystone mission for exoplanet science that launched in 2009 and observed almost 200,000 stars in a tiny patch of sky between 2009 and 2018. Kepler looked for planets transiting across their hosts stars, identifying a staggering 2,392 exoplanets before suffering a technical defect. However, Kepler did something incredible-it showed us all that every star in the night sky, on average, has at least one planet. TESS now looks set to further revolutionize how we think about exoplanets-and life-in the galaxy beyond the Solar System.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2022/03/07/nasa-will-find-12519-new-alien-planets-by-2024-say-scientists/"}, {"title": "Scientists Spot New Type of Stellar Explosion That's Small But Fierce", "date": "2022-04-20", "content": "Astronomers have spotted a new type of thermonuclear explosion on the surface of distant stars. It's called a \"micronova,\" and it's smaller than a classical nova or dazzling supernova but still powerful enough to burn through entire mountain ranges in a few hours. Researchers led by Simone Scaringi at Durham University's Center for Extragalactic Astronomy spent months puzzled by data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TESS is used to search for planets around other stars by taking a close look at the light from those stars for dips in brightness that could be caused by other worlds passing in front. But at least three stars TESS observed showed unusual bursts in brightness lasting for just a few hours at a time. \"We couldn't explain it until we made, finally, a connection that these may be thermonuclear explosions happening on accreting white dwarfs,\" explains Scaringi, who's lead author on a study published in the latest issue of the journal Nature. A white dwarf is a star that's as powerful as the sun, but only about the size of the Earth. In a two-star system, a white dwarf can often suck up, or accrete, hydrogen and other material from its companion star. This gas can build up around the white dwarf until it triggers an explosion, or nova, that can make the star system shine up to a million times more brightly. The gas could even spur the much more spectacular supernova, which could make the system shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for several weeks. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is.\" Simone Scaringi, astronomer Micronovas appear to start the same way, but are smaller, faster and happen on white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields that push stolen material toward the star's poles. The result is a big blast around the pole that's only one millionth the size of a nova explosion. Hence the name \"micronova.\" While a micronova might seem small on the scale of the cosmos, you still wouldn't want to be caught up in one. Explosions like those the researchers observed in TESS data are still powerful enough to burn through over 124,000 mountains the size and mass of Mount Everest in less than a day. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is,\" Scaringi said in a statement. \"These events may actually be quite common, but because they are so fast they are difficult to catch in action.\" He says micronovas challenge astronomers' understanding of how stellar thermonuclear explosions occur. Next, the team hopes to use more large-scale sky surveys to spot the elusive events and then make quick follow-up observations with powerful telescopes for a more detailed look at the new phenomenon.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/scientists-spot-new-type-of-stellar-explosion-thats-small-but-fierce/"}, {"title": "Largest treasure trove of exocomets to date found in alien solar system", "date": "2022-04-28", "content": "Thirty alien comets have been spotted transiting the young star Beta Pictoris, their long tails lighting up the skies of the fledgling planets forming there. The comet discovery has been made using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which watches for dips in starlight as planetary bodies pass in front of - or transit - their star. Beta Pictoris, which is 63.4 light years away, is home to a dusty planet-forming disk that was discovered back in 1983 by IRAS, the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The disk contains at least two planets, both gas giants, and spectral observations gathered as long ago as 1987 suggested evidence for comets releasing dust and gas into the disk. In 2019, astronomers led by Sebastian Zieba, of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, used TESS to discover three 'exocomets' transiting Beta Pictoris. Now, another team, led by astronomer Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris in France, has observed 30 exocomets in the Beta Pictoris system, including the three previously discovered. \"These additional exocomet detections are very useful because we now see many different comets of different sizes, which means we can begin to compare their size distribution - how many small ones we see compared to the bigger ones,\" Matthew Kenworthy, an astronomer at Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands and a member of both research teams, told Space.com. Although Beta Pictoris is not the first star around which exocomets have been discovered, it is the first star for which it has been possible to measure the size distribution of the comets. Based on the size of their tails and the amount of dust they produce as a model), Lecavelier des Etangs' team was able to measure the diameter of the nucleus or core of each comet, finding them to range between 2 and 8.7 miles across, with more smaller comets than larger comets. In fact, the size distribution of the exocomets closely matches the size distribution of comets in our solar system. This pattern suggests that the processes that formed the exocomets around Beta Pictoris are the same as those that formed our solar system's comets; in turn the way that cometary formation plays into planet formation is also likely the same. Astronomers can learn more about how the planets of the solar system, including Earth, formed by studying exoplanetary systems. The prevailing model of planet formation, at least for rocky planets, is that they are the result of collisions and mergers between smaller bodies - comets, asteroids and planetesimals. If the gravity of the bodies involved in a collision is strong enough, it can mold the resulting debris into a larger body. If the objects colliding are too small, then there won't be enough gravity to merge them, and instead they will fragment and disperse, resulting in more smaller bodies than larger ones. That's exactly what astronomers see in the size distribution of Beta Pictoris' exocomets. \"The size distribution is remarkably similar to that predicted for a population of debris resulting from collision and fragmentation cascades,\" Lecavelier des Etangs told Space.com. For the scientists, it's reassuring to gain more evidence that planets form in the same way around different stars, so that we can draw direct comparisons with our solar system. \"The formation of planets and comets are tied together,\" Kenworthy said. \"So our first measurement of a comet distribution outside of our solar system advances our understanding of these processes.\" Comets are also believed to be important for life, potentially delivering water and biological building blocks to the surfaces of planets. Beta Pictoris is only about 25 million years old, and this process of comet impacts bringing life's ingredients to so-far unseen terrestrial planets may have already begun. For Lecavelier des Etangs, the observations provide a sense of personal justification. Back in 1999, a few months before even the first planet had been discovered by the transit method, he predicted that one day, exocomets would be discovered transiting Beta Pictoris. \"It gives me deep satisfaction to see that the prediction that I made over 20 years ago has been shown to be true,\" he said. \"But the most important thing is that not only was it right, but that it was useful!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/comets-beta-pictoris-most-exocomets-discovered"}, {"title": "Puzzling Triple Star System Found by Citizen Scientists Working on Planet Hunters TESS", "date": "2022-05-24", "content": " The Planet Hunters TESS citizen science project asks volunteers to help discover new planets orbiting other stars.

TESS is good at finding exoplanets, but the spacecraft is a powerful scientific platform, and it's made other discoveries, too. Scientists working with TESS recently announced 97 quadruple star candidates, nearly doubling the number of known quadruple systems. TESS's mission is to find exoplanets. More specifically, its mission is to find exoplanets around nearby bright stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite can also study those planets' mass, density, size, and orbit. But TESS's field of view is wide, much wider than its predecessor, the Kepler Space Telescope. Its array of wide-field cameras has surveyed 85% of the sky and gathered an enormous quantity of data. Scientists use machine learning and a cohort of eager citizen scientists to comb through that data. According to a new paper, the latest results from TESS data is a catalogue of 97 \"...uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star systems,\" according to a new paper. The paper is \"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images.\" The paper is available at the pre-press site arxiv.org and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The paper's lead author is Veselin Kostov from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen scientists,\" the authors write. To find these systems, it took a collaboration between some of the usual suspects-the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Astrophysics Science Division and the MIT Kavli Institute. But the professionals at those research institutions needed some help. That help came from seven experienced citizen scientists who assisted in the painstaking effort of pixel-by-pixel analysis of light curves. \"To rule out false positives due to nearby field stars or systematic effects, we evaluate the pixel-by-pixel light curve of the target ...\" the authors write in their paper. The researchers focused their effort on identifying triple and quadruple star systems, but the results go beyond those multiple star systems. They also found \"... the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data,\" the authors explain. Quadruple star systems contain two pairs of eclipsing binary stars. However, they're only EBs if they eclipse one another from our vantage point. All those transits and eclipses can be difficult to entangle, which explains the helping hand from dedicated citizen scientists. The researchers were interested only in specific quadruple star systems, and they deliberately excluded others. \"We note that the targets listed in this catalogue are quadruple candidates that each originate from a single TESS source, i.e. the two-component EBs are unresolved in TESS data,\" they write. These quad systems are in the catalogue because they exhibit changes observable in human timescales. \"The reason is that for the purposes of this work, our interests are in close quadruple systems that can exhibit dynamically-interesting interactions on a human timescale ,\" they explain. That explanation is a bit wordy, but it boils down to this: TESS pixel width can be vast. If TESS locates a pair of EBs separated by two TESS pixels, and if the EBs are 500 parsecs away from us, that means the EBs are separated from each other by up to 20,000 AU. At that vast distance from one another, it could take generations of human observations to notice any interactions between the stars. Systems must be closer to one another to exhibit interesting interactions observable in months or years, so they must be in the same TESS pixel. This is what necessitated the painstaking pixel-by-pixel analysis. The systems in the catalogue survived a stringent vetting process. The team also encountered many false positives. A field star near the target often appeared to be another EB until deeper analysis ruled it out. Other times they detected two EB pairs, but they were not interconnected and were too distant from each other to constitute a quadruple star system. There were also triple star systems whose eclipse pattern mimicked a quadruple star system. All in all, there were five false-positive scenarios. In their summary, the authors write that \"The target stars have been identified through visual inspection and exhibit two sets of eclipses with two distinct periods, each with primary and, in most cases, secondary eclipses. All targets have been uniformly-vetted and passed a series of tests, including pixel-by-pixel and photocenter motion analysis.\" Why are astronomers interested in quadruple systems? Multiple star systems can reveal a lot about stellar evolution pathways. Astronomers and astrophysicists are interested in stellar stages of evolution like short-period binaries, common-envelope events, Type Ia Supernovae, and black hole mergers. The arrangement of the stars in multiple systems is also evidence of how the stars formed. \"For example, the mass ratios between the individual components of a quadruple system, the period ratios between the constituent binary systems and the mutual inclination provide important insight into whether the system formed through a 'top-down' scenario via core or disk fragmentation or 'bottom-up' aggregation via gravitational capture,\" they write. Another exciting aspect of multiple star systems concerns planets. Astronomers have found some planets around multiple star systems, but their origins and fates are unclear. In 2015 astronomers discovered a massive planet in the quadruple star system 30 Arietis. According to that discovery, the system is home to an enormous gas giant ten times more massive than Jupiter. It was the second known planet instance in a quadruple star system. In 2019 researchers found a unique quadruple star system where the stars are at a right angle to the disk of gas and dust surrounding them. Planets will likely form from this protoplanetary disk.

An exoplanet is a planet orbiting another star, so beyond our Solar System.

Researchers led by Simone Scaringi at Durham University's Center for Extragalactic Astronomy spent months puzzled by data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TESS is used to search for planets around other stars by taking a close look at the light from those stars for dips in brightness that could be caused by other worlds passing in front.

A white dwarf is a star that's as powerful as the sun, but only about the size of the Earth. In a two-star system, a white dwarf can often suck up, or accrete, hydrogen and other material from its companion star. This gas can build up around the white dwarf until it triggers an explosion, or nova, that can make the star system shine up to a million times more brightly. The gas could even spur the much more spectacular supernova, which could make the system shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for several weeks. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is.\" Simone Scaringi, astronomer Micronovas appear to start the same way, but are smaller, faster and happen on white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields that push stolen material toward the star's poles.

The comet discovery has been made using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which watches for dips in starlight as planetary bodies pass in front of - or transit - their star. Beta Pictoris, which is 63.4 light years away, is home to a dusty planet-forming disk that was discovered back in 1983 by IRAS, the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The disk contains at least two planets, both gas giants, and spectral observations gathered as long ago as 1987 suggested evidence for comets releasing dust and gas into the disk. In 2019, astronomers led by Sebastian Zieba, of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, used TESS to discover three 'exocomets' transiting Beta Pictoris. Now, another team, led by astronomer Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris in France, has observed 30 exocomets in the Beta Pictoris system, including the three previously discovered. \"These additional exocomet detections are very useful because we now see many different comets of different sizes, which means we can begin to compare their size distribution - how many small ones we see compared to the bigger ones,\" Matthew Kenworthy, an astronomer at Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands and a member of both research teams, told Space.com. Although Beta Pictoris is not the first star around which exocomets have been discovered, it is the first star for which it has been possible to measure the size distribution of the comets. Based on the size of their tails and the amount of dust they produce as a model), Lecavelier des Etangs' team was able to measure the diameter of the nucleus or core of each comet, finding them to range between 2 and 8.7 miles across, with more smaller comets than larger comets. In fact, the size distribution of the exocomets closely matches the size distribution of comets in our solar system. This pattern suggests that the processes that formed the exocomets around Beta Pictoris are the same as those that formed our solar system's comets; in turn the way that cometary formation plays into planet formation is also likely the same. Astronomers can learn more about how the planets of the solar system, including Earth, formed by studying exoplanetary systems. The prevailing model of planet formation, at least for rocky planets, is that they are the result of collisions and mergers between smaller bodies - comets, asteroids and planetesimals. If the gravity of the bodies involved in a collision is strong enough, it can mold the resulting debris into a larger body. If the objects colliding are too small, then there won't be enough gravity to merge them, and instead they will fragment and disperse, resulting in more smaller bodies than larger ones. That's exactly what astronomers see in the size distribution of Beta Pictoris' exocomets. \"The size distribution is remarkably similar to that predicted for a population of debris resulting from collision and fragmentation cascades,\" Lecavelier des Etangs told Space.com. For the scientists, it's reassuring to gain more evidence that planets form in the same way around different stars, so that we can draw direct comparisons with our solar system. \"The formation of planets and comets are tied together,\" Kenworthy said. \"So our first measurement of a comet distribution outside of our solar system advances our understanding of these processes.\" Comets are also believed to be important for life, potentially delivering water and biological building blocks to the surfaces of planets. Beta Pictoris is only about 25 million years old, and this process of comet impacts bringing life's ingredients to so-far unseen terrestrial planets may have already begun. For Lecavelier des Etangs, the observations provide a sense of personal justification.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey, better known as TESS, has spotted a buzzing galactic neighborhood only 33 light-years away from our planet. It has a central star, a couple of planets circling that star, and according to the scientists behind this alternate reality discovery, there are at least two terrestrial, Earth-size worlds in the pack. If you could travel at a tenth the speed of light, it would take you something like 330 years to get to this solar system-like place in the galaxy. Obviously, though, that isn't possible, for several reasons. But by using special Earth-borne equipment like telescopes and space-borne spectrometers -- maybe even the James Webb Space Telescope once it's booted up and online -- we can paint a pretty clear picture of what this neighborhood looks like. With that in mind, the researchers are presenting comprehensive details about this multiplanet system on Wednesday at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Pasadena, California, so the astronomy world can shortlist these new exoplanets for important exoplanet studies. And they've already provided a sneak peek into their findings, in a press release from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What we know so far is that the system's host star is dubbed HD 260655 and is relatively small, cool and categorized as an M-dwarf. M-dwarves are significantly less massive than our sun, a G-type main sequence star, yet are 10 times as numerous throughout the universe. The inner planet orbits its star every 2.8 Earth days and is about 1.2 times the size of Earth and twice as massive. The other foreign world orbits every 5.7 Earth days and is 1.5 times the size of Earth and three times as massive. They're both considered \"rocky.\" Say hello to your next-door exoplanet neighbors. \"Both planets in this system are each considered among the best targets for atmospheric study because of the brightness of their star,\" Michelle Kunimoto of MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and one of the discovery's lead scientists, said in a statement. That includes studies that aim to answer questions like, \"Is there a volatile- rich atmosphere around these planets? And are there signs of water or carbon- based species?\" Kunimoto said -- in other words, a protective layer like the Earth's ozone layer, and living beings like ... humans. \"These planets are fantastic test beds for those explorations.\" OK, but before you get too excited, the team emphasized that the newly unveiled rocky worlds of interest probably aren't habitable -- they tread really close to their host star, so they're likely too hot to host water. The inner planet, per the study, roasts at an estimated 818 degrees Fahrenheit, and the other runs a balmy temperature of 548 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We consider that range outside the habitable zone,\" Kunimoto said. Still, these worlds could prove invaluable for the overall quest to find habitable exoplanets. In short, they could inform how scientists conduct future studies that might come across planets which are in a habitable zone. How to find an exoplanet? NASA's TESS has been steadily discovering exoplanets across the universe since its launch in 2018, having already listed an unbelievable number of such extraterrestrial worlds. It essentially works by detecting periodic dips in the luminescence of stars around the universe, because such variations in light could signal that a planet is passing in front of those stars. Imagine looking at a lamp, then seeing a person walk by the lamp to block your view. If you were really far away from the lamp, you might not be able to tell who exactly blocked your view, but you might deduce that someone did, because the light definitely fell for a second. It's kind of like that. So, in October 2021, Kunimoto found one of these dips while monitoring the satellite's incoming data. They were coming from the star, HD 260655. After lots of other tests, one of which is a well-known gravitational wobble test that looks at whether the light dips are accompanied by a sort of gravitational pull on the star itself, the researchers concluded that, yes, there are two planets orbiting the star at hand. \"We knew we had something very exciting,\" MIT's Avi Shporer, a member of the discovery team, said in a statement. \"But there might be more planets in the system,\" Shporer added. \"There are many multiplanet systems hosting five or six planets, especially around small stars like this one. Hopefully we will find more.\" And if the team does find more, \"maybe one might be in the habitable zone. \"That's optimistic thinking.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-tess-finds-buzzing-cosmic-neighborhood-with-two-super-earths/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's TESS Finds Almost 100 Quadruple Star Systems", "date": "2022-02-27", "content": " NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has found over 5000 candidate exoplanet candidates, and 197 confirmed exoplanets since its mission began in late 2018. TESS is good at finding exoplanets, but the spacecraft is a powerful scientific platform, and it's made other discoveries, too. Scientists working with TESS recently announced 97 quadruple star candidates, nearly doubling the number of known quadruple systems. TESS's mission is to find exoplanets. More specifically, its mission is to find exoplanets around nearby bright stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite can also study those planets' mass, density, size, and orbit. But TESS's field of view is wide, much wider than its predecessor, the Kepler Space Telescope. Its array of wide-field cameras has surveyed 85% of the sky and gathered an enormous quantity of data. Scientists use machine learning and a cohort of eager citizen scientists to comb through that data. According to a new paper, the latest results from TESS data is a catalogue of 97 \"...uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star systems,\" according to a new paper. The paper is \"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images.\" The paper is available at the pre-press site arxiv.org and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement. The paper's lead author is Veselin Kostov from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen scientists,\" the authors write. To find these systems, it took a collaboration between some of the usual suspects-the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Astrophysics Science Division and the MIT Kavli Institute. But the professionals at those research institutions needed some help. That help came from seven experienced citizen scientists who assisted in the painstaking effort of pixel-by-pixel analysis of light curves. \"To rule out false positives due to nearby field stars or systematic effects, we evaluate the pixel-by-pixel light curve of the target ...\" the authors write in their paper. The researchers focused their effort on identifying triple and quadruple star systems, but the results go beyond those multiple star systems. They also found \"... the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data,\" the authors explain. Quadruple star systems contain two pairs of eclipsing binary stars. However, they're only EBs if they eclipse one another from our vantage point. All those transits and eclipses can be difficult to entangle, which explains the helping hand from dedicated citizen scientists. The researchers were interested only in specific quadruple star systems, and they deliberately excluded others. \"We note that the targets listed in this catalogue are quadruple candidates that each originate from a single TESS source, i.e. the two-component EBs are unresolved in TESS data,\" they write. These quad systems are in the catalogue because they exhibit changes observable in human timescales. \"The reason is that for the purposes of this work, our interests are in close quadruple systems that can exhibit dynamically-interesting interactions on a human timescale ,\" they explain. That explanation is a bit wordy, but it boils down to this: TESS pixel width can be vast. If TESS locates a pair of EBs separated by two TESS pixels, and if the EBs are 500 parsecs away from us, that means the EBs are separated from each other by up to 20,000 AU. At that vast distance from one another, it could take generations of human observations to notice any interactions between the stars. Systems must be closer to one another to exhibit interesting interactions observable in months or years, so they must be in the same TESS pixel. This is what necessitated the painstaking pixel-by-pixel analysis. The systems in the catalogue survived a stringent vetting process. The team also encountered many false positives. A field star near the target often appeared to be another EB until deeper analysis ruled it out. Other times they detected two EB pairs, but they were not interconnected and were too distant from each other to constitute a quadruple star system. There were also triple star systems whose eclipse pattern mimicked a quadruple star system. All in all, there were five false-positive scenarios. In their summary, the authors write that \"The target stars have been identified through visual inspection and exhibit two sets of eclipses with two distinct periods, each with primary and, in most cases, secondary eclipses. All targets have been uniformly-vetted and passed a series of tests, including pixel-by-pixel and photocenter motion analysis.\" Why are astronomers interested in quadruple systems? Multiple star systems can reveal a lot about stellar evolution pathways. Astronomers and astrophysicists are interested in stellar stages of evolution like short-period binaries, common-envelope events, Type Ia Supernovae, and black hole mergers. The arrangement of the stars in multiple systems is also evidence of how the stars formed. \"For example, the mass ratios between the individual components of a quadruple system, the period ratios between the constituent binary systems and the mutual inclination provide important insight into whether the system formed through a 'top-down' scenario via core or disk fragmentation or 'bottom-up' aggregation via gravitational capture,\" they write. Another exciting aspect of multiple star systems concerns planets. Astronomers have found some planets around multiple star systems, but their origins and fates are unclear. In 2015 astronomers discovered a massive planet in the quadruple star system 30 Arietis. According to that discovery, the system is home to an enormous gas giant ten times more massive than Jupiter. It was the second known planet instance in a quadruple star system. In 2019 researchers found a unique quadruple star system where the stars are at a right angle to the disk of gas and dust surrounding them. Planets will likely form from this protoplanetary disk. How unusual would the view from a planet's surface be in that system? The team of researchers isn't finished yet. They say that they've detected an order of magnitude more false positives than vetted detections and that complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. \"... given the large number of targets inspected and assuming many of the additional candidates turn out to be real, TESS has the potential to increase the number of known eclipsing quadruple systems by more than a factor of two,\" they write.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-tess-finds-almost-100-quadruple-star-systems/"}, {"title": "NASA Will Find 12,519 New Alien Planets By 2024 Including 'Dozens Similar To Earth's Size' Say Scientists", "date": "2022-03-07", "content": "NASA's exoplanet catalogue and you'll see that just shy of 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered and confirmed so far.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey, better known as TESS, has spotted a buzzing galactic neighborhood only 33 light-years away from our planet. It has a central star, a couple of planets circling that star, and according to the scientists behind this alternate reality discovery, there are at least two terrestrial, Earth-size worlds in the pack. If you could travel at a tenth the speed of light, it would take you something like 330 years to get to this solar system-like place in the galaxy. Obviously, though, that isn't possible, for several reasons. But by using special Earth-borne equipment like telescopes and space-borne spectrometers -- maybe even the James Webb Space Telescope once it's booted up and online -- we can paint a pretty clear picture of what this neighborhood looks like. With that in mind, the researchers are presenting comprehensive details about this multiplanet system on Wednesday at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Pasadena, California, so the astronomy world can shortlist these new exoplanets for important exoplanet studies. And they've already provided a sneak peek into their findings, in a press release from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What we know so far is that the system's host star is dubbed HD 260655 and is relatively small, cool and categorized as an M-dwarf. M-dwarves are significantly less massive than our sun, a G-type main sequence star, yet are 10 times as numerous throughout the universe. The inner planet orbits its star every 2.8 Earth days and is about 1.2 times the size of Earth and twice as massive. The other foreign world orbits every 5.7 Earth days and is 1.5 times the size of Earth and three times as massive. They're both considered \"rocky.\" Say hello to your next-door exoplanet neighbors. \"Both planets in this system are each considered among the best targets for atmospheric study because of the brightness of their star,\" Michelle Kunimoto of MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and one of the discovery's lead scientists, said in a statement. That includes studies that aim to answer questions like, \"Is there a volatile- rich atmosphere around these planets? And are there signs of water or carbon- based species?\" Kunimoto said -- in other words, a protective layer like the Earth's ozone layer, and living beings like ... humans. \"These planets are fantastic test beds for those explorations.\" OK, but before you get too excited, the team emphasized that the newly unveiled rocky worlds of interest probably aren't habitable -- they tread really close to their host star, so they're likely too hot to host water. The inner planet, per the study, roasts at an estimated 818 degrees Fahrenheit, and the other runs a balmy temperature of 548 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We consider that range outside the habitable zone,\" Kunimoto said. Still, these worlds could prove invaluable for the overall quest to find habitable exoplanets. In short, they could inform how scientists conduct future studies that might come across planets which are in a habitable zone. How to find an exoplanet? NASA's TESS has been steadily discovering exoplanets across the universe since its launch in 2018, having already listed an unbelievable number of such extraterrestrial worlds. It essentially works by detecting periodic dips in the luminescence of stars around the universe, because such variations in light could signal that a planet is passing in front of those stars. Imagine looking at a lamp, then seeing a person walk by the lamp to block your view. If you were really far away from the lamp, you might not be able to tell who exactly blocked your view, but you might deduce that someone did, because the light definitely fell for a second. It's kind of like that. So, in October 2021, Kunimoto found one of these dips while monitoring the satellite's incoming data. They were coming from the star, HD 260655. After lots of other tests, one of which is a well-known gravitational wobble test that looks at whether the light dips are accompanied by a sort of gravitational pull on the star itself, the researchers concluded that, yes, there are two planets orbiting the star at hand. \"We knew we had something very exciting,\" MIT's Avi Shporer, a member of the discovery team, said in a statement. \"But there might be more planets in the system,\" Shporer added. \"There are many multiplanet systems hosting five or six planets, especially around small stars like this one. Hopefully we will find more.\" And if the team does find more, \"maybe one might be in the habitable zone. \"That's optimistic thinking.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-tess-finds-buzzing-cosmic-neighborhood-with-two-super-earths/"}, {"title": "Astronomers discover 'first of its kind' star system with three Suns using NASA's TESS", "date": "2022-07-24", "content": "In a 'first-of-its-kind' discovery, a team of amateur astronomers has found a star system that has not one, not two but three suns.

Expect that figure to grow massively in the next few years as data from NASA's exoplanet-spotting spacecraft reveals a staggering haul of alien worlds, according to a new study. A paper published on the pre-print service arXiv reveals that NASA's $287 million Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered about 5,000 planets and planet candidates in its first three and a half years of observations. An exoplanet is a planet orbiting another star, so beyond our Solar System. Launched in mid-2018 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the TESS spacecraft quickly completed its first mission; to identify exoplanets orbiting bright stars in the northern sky within 300 light years of Earth using its wide-field telescope. In mid-2020 it began its first extended mission-to observe exoplanets around the ecliptic plane of the Solar System-and in September this year it will begin a second extended mission to doo the same for the southern sky. What more it it going to find? Quite a lot, according to the paper's authors, who used simulations of detectable planets to calculate that TESS will gradually reveal many thousands more exoplanets-and not just from observations it's yet to make. That's a staggering total of 12,519 exoplanets! By the end of its second extended mission TESS will be in its seventh year, by which time it will have observed almost the entire sky. The authors calculate that by the end of its three missions its haul of exoplanets will reveal that G-type stars-stars like our Sun-are the most common exoplanet hosts. And while most of the exoplanets it finds will be giant planets, as the mission wears on it will find more and more smaller and smaller planets \"including dozens similar to Earth's size,\" reads the paper. TESS will also find hot Neptunes, giant planets around red dwarf stars and planets that take more than 500 days to orbit their stars, according to the authors. Exactly those types of exoplanets were missing from the data provided by NASA's $600 million Kepler Space Telescope, a keystone mission for exoplanet science that launched in 2009 and observed almost 200,000 stars in a tiny patch of sky between 2009 and 2018. Kepler looked for planets transiting across their hosts stars, identifying a staggering 2,392 exoplanets before suffering a technical defect. However, Kepler did something incredible-it showed us all that every star in the night sky, on average, has at least one planet. TESS now looks set to further revolutionize how we think about exoplanets-and life-in the galaxy beyond the Solar System.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2022/03/07/nasa-will-find-12519-new-alien-planets-by-2024-say-scientists/"}, {"title": "Scientists Spot New Type of Stellar Explosion That's Small But Fierce", "date": "2022-04-20", "content": "Astronomers have spotted a new type of thermonuclear explosion on the surface of distant stars. It's called a \"micronova,\" and it's smaller than a classical nova or dazzling supernova but still powerful enough to burn through entire mountain ranges in a few hours. Researchers led by Simone Scaringi at Durham University's Center for Extragalactic Astronomy spent months puzzled by data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TESS is used to search for planets around other stars by taking a close look at the light from those stars for dips in brightness that could be caused by other worlds passing in front. But at least three stars TESS observed showed unusual bursts in brightness lasting for just a few hours at a time. \"We couldn't explain it until we made, finally, a connection that these may be thermonuclear explosions happening on accreting white dwarfs,\" explains Scaringi, who's lead author on a study published in the latest issue of the journal Nature. A white dwarf is a star that's as powerful as the sun, but only about the size of the Earth. In a two-star system, a white dwarf can often suck up, or accrete, hydrogen and other material from its companion star. This gas can build up around the white dwarf until it triggers an explosion, or nova, that can make the star system shine up to a million times more brightly. The gas could even spur the much more spectacular supernova, which could make the system shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for several weeks. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is.\" Simone Scaringi, astronomer Micronovas appear to start the same way, but are smaller, faster and happen on white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields that push stolen material toward the star's poles. The result is a big blast around the pole that's only one millionth the size of a nova explosion. Hence the name \"micronova.\" While a micronova might seem small on the scale of the cosmos, you still wouldn't want to be caught up in one. Explosions like those the researchers observed in TESS data are still powerful enough to burn through over 124,000 mountains the size and mass of Mount Everest in less than a day. \"It just goes to show how dynamic the universe is,\" Scaringi said in a statement. \"These events may actually be quite common, but because they are so fast they are difficult to catch in action.\" He says micronovas challenge astronomers' understanding of how stellar thermonuclear explosions occur. Next, the team hopes to use more large-scale sky surveys to spot the elusive events and then make quick follow-up observations with powerful telescopes for a more detailed look at the new phenomenon.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/scientists-spot-new-type-of-stellar-explosion-thats-small-but-fierce/"}, {"title": "Largest treasure trove of exocomets to date found in alien solar system", "date": "2022-04-28", "content": "Thirty alien comets have been spotted transiting the young star Beta Pictoris, their long tails lighting up the skies of the fledgling planets forming there. The comet discovery has been made using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which watches for dips in starlight as planetary bodies pass in front of - or transit - their star. Beta Pictoris, which is 63.4 light years away, is home to a dusty planet-forming disk that was discovered back in 1983 by IRAS, the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The disk contains at least two planets, both gas giants, and spectral observations gathered as long ago as 1987 suggested evidence for comets releasing dust and gas into the disk. In 2019, astronomers led by Sebastian Zieba, of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, used TESS to discover three 'exocomets' transiting Beta Pictoris. Now, another team, led by astronomer Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris in France, has observed 30 exocomets in the Beta Pictoris system, including the three previously discovered. \"These additional exocomet detections are very useful because we now see many different comets of different sizes, which means we can begin to compare their size distribution - how many small ones we see compared to the bigger ones,\" Matthew Kenworthy, an astronomer at Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands and a member of both research teams, told Space.com. Although Beta Pictoris is not the first star around which exocomets have been discovered, it is the first star for which it has been possible to measure the size distribution of the comets. Based on the size of their tails and the amount of dust they produce as a model), Lecavelier des Etangs' team was able to measure the diameter of the nucleus or core of each comet, finding them to range between 2 and 8.7 miles across, with more smaller comets than larger comets. In fact, the size distribution of the exocomets closely matches the size distribution of comets in our solar system. This pattern suggests that the processes that formed the exocomets around Beta Pictoris are the same as those that formed our solar system's comets; in turn the way that cometary formation plays into planet formation is also likely the same. Astronomers can learn more about how the planets of the solar system, including Earth, formed by studying exoplanetary systems. The prevailing model of planet formation, at least for rocky planets, is that they are the result of collisions and mergers between smaller bodies - comets, asteroids and planetesimals. If the gravity of the bodies involved in a collision is strong enough, it can mold the resulting debris into a larger body. If the objects colliding are too small, then there won't be enough gravity to merge them, and instead they will fragment and disperse, resulting in more smaller bodies than larger ones. That's exactly what astronomers see in the size distribution of Beta Pictoris' exocomets. \"The size distribution is remarkably similar to that predicted for a population of debris resulting from collision and fragmentation cascades,\" Lecavelier des Etangs told Space.com. For the scientists, it's reassuring to gain more evidence that planets form in the same way around different stars, so that we can draw direct comparisons with our solar system. \"The formation of planets and comets are tied together,\" Kenworthy said. \"So our first measurement of a comet distribution outside of our solar system advances our understanding of these processes.\" Comets are also believed to be important for life, potentially delivering water and biological building blocks to the surfaces of planets. Beta Pictoris is only about 25 million years old, and this process of comet impacts bringing life's ingredients to so-far unseen terrestrial planets may have already begun. For Lecavelier des Etangs, the observations provide a sense of personal justification. Back in 1999, a few months before even the first planet had been discovered by the transit method, he predicted that one day, exocomets would be discovered transiting Beta Pictoris. \"It gives me deep satisfaction to see that the prediction that I made over 20 years ago has been shown to be true,\" he said. \"But the most important thing is that not only was it right, but that it was useful!\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/comets-beta-pictoris-most-exocomets-discovered"}, {"title": "Puzzling Triple Star System Found by Citizen Scientists Working on Planet Hunters TESS", "date": "2022-05-24", "content": " The Planet Hunters TESS citizen science project asks volunteers to help discover new planets orbiting other stars.

If you could travel at a tenth the speed of light, it would take you something like 330 years to get to this solar system-like place in the galaxy. Obviously, though, that isn't possible, for several reasons. But by using special Earth-borne equipment like telescopes and space-borne spectrometers -- maybe even the James Webb Space Telescope once it's booted up and online -- we can paint a pretty clear picture of what this neighborhood looks like. With that in mind, the researchers are presenting comprehensive details about this multiplanet system on Wednesday at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Pasadena, California, so the astronomy world can shortlist these new exoplanets for important exoplanet studies. And they've already provided a sneak peek into their findings, in a press release from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What we know so far is that the system's host star is dubbed HD 260655 and is relatively small, cool and categorized as an M-dwarf. M-dwarves are significantly less massive than our sun, a G-type main sequence star, yet are 10 times as numerous throughout the universe. The inner planet orbits its star every 2.8 Earth days and is about 1.2 times the size of Earth and twice as massive. The other foreign world orbits every 5.7 Earth days and is 1.5 times the size of Earth and three times as massive. They're both considered \"rocky.\" Say hello to your next-door exoplanet neighbors. \"Both planets in this system are each considered among the best targets for atmospheric study because of the brightness of their star,\" Michelle Kunimoto of MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and one of the discovery's lead scientists, said in a statement. That includes studies that aim to answer questions like, \"Is there a volatile- rich atmosphere around these planets? And are there signs of water or carbon- based species?\" Kunimoto said -- in other words, a protective layer like the Earth's ozone layer, and living beings like ... humans. \"These planets are fantastic test beds for those explorations.\" OK, but before you get too excited, the team emphasized that the newly unveiled rocky worlds of interest probably aren't habitable -- they tread really close to their host star, so they're likely too hot to host water. The inner planet, per the study, roasts at an estimated 818 degrees Fahrenheit, and the other runs a balmy temperature of 548 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We consider that range outside the habitable zone,\" Kunimoto said. Still, these worlds could prove invaluable for the overall quest to find habitable exoplanets. In short, they could inform how scientists conduct future studies that might come across planets which are in a habitable zone. How to find an exoplanet? NASA's TESS has been steadily discovering exoplanets across the universe since its launch in 2018, having already listed an unbelievable number of such extraterrestrial worlds. It essentially works by detecting periodic dips in the luminescence of stars around the universe, because such variations in light could signal that a planet is passing in front of those stars. Imagine looking at a lamp, then seeing a person walk by the lamp to block your view. If you were really far away from the lamp, you might not be able to tell who exactly blocked your view, but you might deduce that someone did, because the light definitely fell for a second. It's kind of like that. So, in October 2021, Kunimoto found one of these dips while monitoring the satellite's incoming data. They were coming from the star, HD 260655. After lots of other tests, one of which is a well-known gravitational wobble test that looks at whether the light dips are accompanied by a sort of gravitational pull on the star itself, the researchers concluded that, yes, there are two planets orbiting the star at hand. \"We knew we had something very exciting,\" MIT's Avi Shporer, a member of the discovery team, said in a statement. \"But there might be more planets in the system,\" Shporer added. \"There are many multiplanet systems hosting five or six planets, especially around small stars like this one. Hopefully we will find more.\" And if the team does find more, \"maybe one might be in the habitable zone. \"That's optimistic thinking.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-tess-finds-buzzing-cosmic-neighborhood-with-two-super-earths/"}, {"title": "Astronomers discover 'first of its kind' star system with three Suns using NASA's TESS", "date": "2022-07-24", "content": "In a 'first-of-its-kind' discovery, a team of amateur astronomers has found a star system that has not one, not two but three suns.

The James Webb Space Telescope is on a mission to understand the origins of our universe, but researchers say it could take some time on the side to observe TOI-1452 b, which, \"in a stroke of good fortune,\" appears in the constellation Draco, a part of the sky that Webb can see during most times of the year. \"Our observations with the Webb Telescope will be essential to better understanding TOI-1452 b,\" said researcher Ren\u00e9 Doyon, who also works with one of the four science instruments of the James Webb Space Telescope. \"As soon as we can, we will book time on the Webb to observe this strange and wonderful world.\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/water-world-exoplanet-toi-1452-b-tess-james-webb-space-telescope/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Astronomers discover potential \"water world\" exoplanet nearby Earth that could support life", "date": "2022-09-30", "content": "Scientists announced this week the discovery of a nearby \" super- Earth \" that could potentially support life, calling it a \"water world.\" The team, led by the University of Montreal, used observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ), as well as telescopes on the ground, to detect the exoplanet, which is described as potentially rocky like Earth, but larger. Named TOI-1452 b, it orbits a red dwarf star about 100 light years away from our planet, which scientists say is \"fairly close.\" Scientists have long theorized the possibility of other ocean planets, but they have been difficult to confirm. TOI-1452 b is roughly 70% larger than Earth and about five times as massive, which would be consistent with having a very deep ocean - but more research is still needed. NASA says the planet could also potentially be an enormous rock with little or no atmosphere - or even a rocky planet with an atmosphere made up of hydrogen or helium. A year on TOI-1452 b takes just 11 days, but it gets a similar amount of light from its smaller, cooler star as Venus does from the sun. Despite its close orbit, it's located in the \"habitable zone,\" meaning it could have highly- coveted liquid water on its surface.
