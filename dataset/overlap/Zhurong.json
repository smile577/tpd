Authorities approved the mission in January, said National Space Administration director Xu Dazhe told a press conference in Beijing, according to a transcript. The aim was to launch around 2020, he said, calling the timing \"a challenge\" that would be \"a giant leap\" for the country's space capabilities. \"What we want to achieve is to orbit Mars, land, and deploy the rover in one mission, which will be quite difficult to achieve.\" China is pouring billions into its space programme and working to catch up with the US and Europe, but has already been beaten to Mars by Asian neighbour India, which put a low-cost probe into orbit around the Red Planet in September 2014. Once on the Martian surface, Xu said, the Chinese rover could study the planet's soil, atmosphere, environment, and look for traces of water. \"Researching these matters is really researching humanity itself and the origins of life,\" he said, adding: \"Only by completing this Mars probe mission can China say it has truly embarked on the exploration of deep space.\" China has an ambitious, military-run, multi-billion-dollar space programme that Beijing sees as symbolising the country's progress and a marker of its rising global stature. China's recent space efforts have been focused on exploring the moon. The nation's first lunar rover-the Yutu, or Jade Rabbit-was launched in late 2013, but it has since been beset by mechanical troubles. By 2018, the country aims to land its Chang'e-4 probe-named for the moon goddess in Chinese mythology-on the dark side of the moon. But for the most part it has so far replicated activities that the US and Soviet Union pioneered decades ago. The US has landed two rovers on Mars and the former Soviet Union and the European Space Agency have also sent missions to Mars. China's first attempt to send a satellite into Mars orbit floundered in 2011 when the Russian rocket carrying the payload failed to make it out of the Earth's orbit.", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2016-04-china-mars-mission.html"}, {"title": "China unveils the rover it's sending to Mars in 2020", "date": "2016-08-24", "content": "China has unveiled concept pictures of the rover it plans to send to Mars in 2020.

The lander will tough down the northern hemisphere of Mars where the rover will explore the surface after a journey of around seven months, and send the collected data back in 2021, said Wan, also chief scientist of China's Mars exploration program. The designed life expectancy of the probe is one Martian year, or nearly two years on Earth, he disclosed when reviewing the government work report at the ongoing \"two sessions\", namely the annual meetings of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The task is now proceeding smoothly, the chief scientist said, explaining that feasibility studies, scientific goals, basic working plans have been completed before the mission plan was officially approved in early 2016. So far, preparation works on satellite probes, ground data application, rocket launches, monitoring and control systems have been started, and some solutions have been primarily confirmed after initial design, optimization and rounds of tests, he continued. China's first Mars mission is poised to achieve breakthroughs in key technologies like orbiting, landing and deploying a rover. The mission plans to, by making an all-round exploration and high-precision scientific probes in limited area, study the inner structure, surface, atmosphere, and ambient space environment of the red planet, and as a result give insight into the origin and evolution of the solar system, information about extraterrestrial life and other big scientific challenges. Mars is always the human being's first destination chosen for deep-space exploration, with a shorter distance to Earth than its peers in solar system, shares similar national environment with the plant the human beings are now living. The orbits of Earth and Mars only align for an optimal launch every 26 months, and the window only lasts a few weeks, which means that there are only three launch windows before the arrival of the expected timetable of 2020.", "url": "https://www.alwihdainfo.com/China-to-send-Mars-probe-into-space-in-2020_a51410.html"}, {"title": "China Publishes Research Paper Containing Details of Mars Exploration Mission", "date": "2017-03-27", "content": "Written by researchers from the China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, and the Institute of Space System Engineering, Beijing, the paper states that China aims to launch a Mars exploration mission by the year 2020, with the aim of \"orbiting, landing, and roving\". The paper \"introduces the development process of the Mars exploration missions, provides a description of the general design, the mission difficulties and characteristics, as well as the key technologies of the mission, and gives an overview of the expected outcomes.\" According to the paper, the Mars probe that China is designing will be launched from Wenchang Satellite Launch Centre on a Changzheng-5, with an orbiter comprising a landing and roving module. The probe is expected to have an orbital period of 10 days, before the landing/roving probe detaches itself from the orbiter. China has highlighted five scientific objectives for its Mars mission - to investigate \" characteristics of Mars' morphology and its geological structure\", \"soil characteristics and water-ice distribution on the Martian surface\", \"material composition on the Martian surface\", \"Mars' ionosphere and the characteristics of its surface climate and environment\", and to \"detect and measure the Martian magnetic field characteristics.\" For China, the Mars mission is especially important because it will mark a number of firsts for the nation's space program. Aside from being China's first mission to an extraterrestrial planet, it also aims for the mission to be the first time China lands and roves an extraterrestrial planet. Therefore, it will expand China's deep space technology capabilities and test new, high-precision technologies such as an autonomous obstacle-avoidance landing technology. So far, China has ventured only as far as the Moon. Currently, the other space agencies working towards future Mars missions are NASA, India's ISRO, the UAE Space Program, and a joint ESA-Roscosmos mission.", "url": "https://www.spacetechasia.com/china-publishes-research-paper-containing-details-of-mars-exploration-mission/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China's Mars mission 'going smoothly', chief designer says", "date": "2017-09-20", "content": "China is on track to launch its first Mars probe around 2020, with the plan to retrieve soil and rock samples before 2030, according to the mission's chief designer, Zhang Rongqiao.

The mission ambitiously involves a combined orbiter and rover and is set to launch in summer 2020 with a fleet of vehicles from other nations that includes NASA's Mars 2020 rover, the United Arab Emirates' Hope Mars Mission and ExoMars 2020. The colorized topographic map showing two candidate areas is based on data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), an instrument on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft launched in 1996. The first area targets Chryse Planitia, close to the landing sites of Viking 1 and Pathfinder, while the second covers Isidis Planitia and stretches to the western edge of the Elysium Mons region. The final landing site has yet to be selected, with several teams likely involved in providing candidate sites-a process similar to China's lunar missions. The map recently appeared in a presentation at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) in June, and again in a presentation by mission engineers at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Germany last month. As this is China's first independent interplanetary mission, teams will need to succeed on a range of technological challenges including orbital insertion and landing. The country recently made progress on that front with successful supersonic parachute tests and tests of a subsurface detection radar from a hot air balloon in October (link in Chinese). Chinese media reports from early September said Tianying-6 sounding rockets were launched in western China to send a full-scale supersonic parachute to altitudes between 44 and 54 kilometers, simulating travel through the tenuous Martian atmosphere.

Launching in 2020, China's Mars mission will attempt to put a probe in orbit around Mars and, separately, land a rover on the red planet. The mission was approved in early 2016 but updates have few and far between. Last week, a terse update from the Xi'an Aerospace Propulsion Institute, a subsidiary of CASC, China's main space contractor, revealed that the spacecraft's propulsion system had passed all necessary tests. According to the report, the Shanghai Institute of Space Propulsion has completed tests of the spacecraft's propulsion system for the hovering, hazard avoidance, slow-down, and landing stages of a Mars landing attempt. The successful tests verified the performance and control of the propulsion system, in which one engine producing 7,500 Newtons of thrust will provide the majority of force required to decelerate the spacecraft for landing. Having previously completed tests of supersonic parachutes needed to slow the craft's entry into the Martian atmosphere, this means China's Mars spacecraft is close to ready for its mission. China was initially considering several sites within two broad landing areas near Chryse Planitia, close to the landing sites of Viking 1 and Pathfinder, and another covering Isidis Planitia and stretching to the western edge of the Elysium Mons region. According to a presentation at the European Planetary Science Congress- Division for Planetary Sciences Joint Meeting in Geneva in September, China has now chosen two preliminary sites near Utopia Planitia. The mission will have landing ellipses-the areas in which the spacecraft is statistically likely to land-of around 100 x 40 kilometers. China's solar-powered Mars rover will, at 240 kilograms, be twice the mass of China's two lunar rovers. It will carry navigation, topography, and multispectral cameras, a subsurface detection radar, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument similar to Curiosity's LIBS instrument, a Martian surface magnetic field detector, and a climate detector. The orbiter will be equipped with a suite of science instruments including moderate- and high-resolution imagers. The pair of cameras will be used once in Mars orbit to image the preselected landing sites ahead of separation of the orbiter and rover. The main barrier to China launching its mission is the status of the Long March 5 rocket required to get the 5-metric-ton spacecraft on its way to Mars. The Long March 5 is China's largest launch vehicle, which had its first flight in 2016. However the second launch, in July 2017, failed to achieve orbit. Following at least two redesigns of the engines which power the rocket's first stage, the Long March 5 is now ready to return to flight. The rocket is currently being assembled at the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan island in southern China, with launch expected in late December. The mission will aim to send a large satellite into geostationary orbit, and in doing so prove the rocket is ready for the later Mars mission launch. If all goes well, China will join NASA's Mars 2020 mission, the United Arab Emirates' Hope Mars Mission and, if parachute issues can be overcome, the ExoMars 2020 mission, in launching during a roughly three-week window from late July to early August 2020. With the advantage of favorable relative positions of Earth and Mars at that time-creating an efficient path known as the Hohmann transfer-the spacecraft would arrive at the red planet around February 2021. If the Long March 5 does not come through its big test in late December, China will need to wait 26 months before the next Hohmann transfer window opens for Mars, in late 2022. Getting to Mars is only part of the job. China has already landed spacecraft on the near and far sides of the moon, and members of the successful 2013 Chang'e-3 lunar mission team were assigned to the Mars project. However, landing on Mars presents extra challenges. The surface gravity of Mars is just 38 percent that of Earth. Simulating the Martian gravitational field adds complexity to terrestrial testing of entry, descent, and landing sequences. Mars has an atmosphere which is too thin to properly aid descent, but thick enough to threaten fast-moving spacecraft with extreme heat from atmospheric friction and compression. This requires a spacecraft to have a heat shield and complex parachute systems which need to be deployed and jettisoned at precisely the right moments. When the spacecraft arrives at Mars, it will be around 150 million kilometers from Earth, meaning commands traveling at the speed of light will take around 8 minutes to reach their target. This means the entire landing process must be automated. For NASA's 2012 landing of the Curiosity rover, the team called this period the \"7 minutes of terror.\" Several Mars missions have failed during that critical stage, including a 2016 effort by the European Space Agency and Roscosmos of Russia to plant the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander, as well as numerous Soviet missions and NASA's attempt with its 1999 Mars Polar Lander.

China is on track to launch its Mars mission, Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said on Thursday, speaking to foreign diplomats and the media before the test. The Mars lander underwent a hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test at a sprawling site in Huailai, northwest of Beijing. The site was littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate the uneven terrain on Mars which the lander would have to navigate on its descent to the planet's surface. \"In 2016, China officially began the Mars exploration mission work, and currently all of the different development work is progressing smoothly,\" Zhang said. \"The hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test for the Mars lander being carried out today makes up a crucial part of the development process.

The journey through space will take about seven months, while landing will take seven minutes, said Zhang Rongqiao, chief architect of the Mars exploration program. The landing will be the toughest and most challenging stage, he said. The same Long March 5 rocket is meant to deliver the Chang'e-5 probe to the moon by the end of 2019 or early next year to bring back samples of lunar rocks.

China made its first lunar landing in 2013. China expects to complete a modular space station around 2022, around the time when NASA is said to start building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, as a pit stop for missions to other parts of the solar system. In 2003, China became the third nation to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States. Since then, it has been racing to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030. \"China is currently actively planning and preparing a number of major space programs including a Mars sample return mission, asteroid exploration missions and many more lunar missions,\" the head of the space administration said.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-china-mars-idUSKBN1XO0IQ"}, {"title": "China tests Mars lander in international cooperation push", "date": "2019-11-15", "content": "China showed off its Mars spacecraft during a landing test Thursday as the country pushes for inclusion in more global space projects.

China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet, one of four scheduled missions. The U.S. and Europe are also sending rovers to Mars next year, and the United Arab Emirates plans to launch an orbiter. China's burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a spacecraft on the mysterious far side of the moon. It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003, and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere. The U.S., however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station. Despite that, China's ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power. It is gradually constructing its own larger, more permanent space station in which it has invited foreign participation. The lander on Thursday successfully avoided ground obstacles during a simulated low-gravity descent, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Chinese space program's main contractor. The refrigerator-sized craft was lowered gently on 36 cables through the air for about a minute and used onboard jets spraying rust-colored fumes to alter its downward course. \"After the probe is launched, it will take about seven months to reach Mars, and the final procedure of landing will only last about seven minutes, which is the most difficult and the most risky part of the whole mission,\" said the Mars mission's chief designer, Zhang Rongqiao, standing before the 140-meter (460-foot) -tall testing facility.

According to a presentation at the European Planetary Science Congress- Division for Planetary Sciences Joint Meeting in Geneva in September, China has now chosen two preliminary sites near Utopia Planitia. The mission will have landing ellipses-the areas in which the spacecraft is statistically likely to land-of around 100 x 40 kilometers. China's solar-powered Mars rover will, at 240 kilograms, be twice the mass of China's two lunar rovers. It will carry navigation, topography, and multispectral cameras, a subsurface detection radar, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument similar to Curiosity's LIBS instrument, a Martian surface magnetic field detector, and a climate detector. The orbiter will be equipped with a suite of science instruments including moderate- and high-resolution imagers. The pair of cameras will be used once in Mars orbit to image the preselected landing sites ahead of separation of the orbiter and rover. The main barrier to China launching its mission is the status of the Long March 5 rocket required to get the 5-metric-ton spacecraft on its way to Mars. The Long March 5 is China's largest launch vehicle, which had its first flight in 2016. However the second launch, in July 2017, failed to achieve orbit. Following at least two redesigns of the engines which power the rocket's first stage, the Long March 5 is now ready to return to flight. The rocket is currently being assembled at the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan island in southern China, with launch expected in late December. The mission will aim to send a large satellite into geostationary orbit, and in doing so prove the rocket is ready for the later Mars mission launch. If all goes well, China will join NASA's Mars 2020 mission, the United Arab Emirates' Hope Mars Mission and, if parachute issues can be overcome, the ExoMars 2020 mission, in launching during a roughly three-week window from late July to early August 2020. With the advantage of favorable relative positions of Earth and Mars at that time-creating an efficient path known as the Hohmann transfer-the spacecraft would arrive at the red planet around February 2021. If the Long March 5 does not come through its big test in late December, China will need to wait 26 months before the next Hohmann transfer window opens for Mars, in late 2022. Getting to Mars is only part of the job. China has already landed spacecraft on the near and far sides of the moon, and members of the successful 2013 Chang'e-3 lunar mission team were assigned to the Mars project. However, landing on Mars presents extra challenges. The surface gravity of Mars is just 38 percent that of Earth. Simulating the Martian gravitational field adds complexity to terrestrial testing of entry, descent, and landing sequences. Mars has an atmosphere which is too thin to properly aid descent, but thick enough to threaten fast-moving spacecraft with extreme heat from atmospheric friction and compression. This requires a spacecraft to have a heat shield and complex parachute systems which need to be deployed and jettisoned at precisely the right moments. When the spacecraft arrives at Mars, it will be around 150 million kilometers from Earth, meaning commands traveling at the speed of light will take around 8 minutes to reach their target. This means the entire landing process must be automated. For NASA's 2012 landing of the Curiosity rover, the team called this period the \"7 minutes of terror.\" Several Mars missions have failed during that critical stage, including a 2016 effort by the European Space Agency and Roscosmos of Russia to plant the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander, as well as numerous Soviet missions and NASA's attempt with its 1999 Mars Polar Lander.

China is on track to launch its Mars mission, Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said on Thursday, speaking to foreign diplomats and the media before the test. The Mars lander underwent a hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test at a sprawling site in Huailai, northwest of Beijing. The site was littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate the uneven terrain on Mars which the lander would have to navigate on its descent to the planet's surface. \"In 2016, China officially began the Mars exploration mission work, and currently all of the different development work is progressing smoothly,\" Zhang said. \"The hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test for the Mars lander being carried out today makes up a crucial part of the development process. As scheduled, China's first Mars exploration mission will take place in 2020.\" China has developed the powerful Long March 5 rocket to transport the probe to Mars in 2020. The journey through space will take about seven months, while landing will take seven minutes, said Zhang Rongqiao, chief architect of the Mars exploration program. The landing will be the toughest and most challenging stage, he said. The same Long March 5 rocket is meant to deliver the Chang'e-5 probe to the moon by the end of 2019 or early next year to bring back samples of lunar rocks. The Chang'e-4 probe successfully touched down on the far side of the moon in January this year, a historic first and major achievement for China's space program. China made its first lunar landing in 2013. China expects to complete a modular space station around 2022, around the time when NASA is said to start building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, as a pit stop for missions to other parts of the solar system. In 2003, China became the third nation to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States. Since then, it has been racing to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030. \"China is currently actively planning and preparing a number of major space programs including a Mars sample return mission, asteroid exploration missions and many more lunar missions,\" the head of the space administration said.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-china-mars-idUSKBN1XO0IQ"}, {"title": "China tests Mars lander in international cooperation push", "date": "2019-11-15", "content": "China showed off its Mars spacecraft during a landing test Thursday as the country pushes for inclusion in more global space projects. The demonstration of hovering, obstacle avoidance and deceleration capabilities was conducted at a site outside Beijing simulating conditions on the red planet, where the pull of gravity is about one-third that of Earth. China plans to launch a lander and rover to Mars next year to explore parts of the planet, one of four scheduled missions. The U.S. and Europe are also sending rovers to Mars next year, and the United Arab Emirates plans to launch an orbiter. China's burgeoning space program achieved a lunar milestone earlier this year by landing a spacecraft on the mysterious far side of the moon. It has developed rapidly, especially since it conducted its first crewed mission in 2003, and has sought cooperation with space agencies from Europe and elsewhere. The U.S., however, has banned most space cooperation with China out of national security concerns, keeping China from participating in the International Space Station. Despite that, China's ambitions continue to grow as it seeks to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space and cement its position as a regional and global power. It is gradually constructing its own larger, more permanent space station in which it has invited foreign participation. The lander on Thursday successfully avoided ground obstacles during a simulated low-gravity descent, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Chinese space program's main contractor. The refrigerator-sized craft was lowered gently on 36 cables through the air for about a minute and used onboard jets spraying rust-colored fumes to alter its downward course. \"After the probe is launched, it will take about seven months to reach Mars, and the final procedure of landing will only last about seven minutes, which is the most difficult and the most risky part of the whole mission,\" said the Mars mission's chief designer, Zhang Rongqiao, standing before the 140-meter (460-foot) -tall testing facility. Many Mars-bound spacecraft launched by the U.S., Russia and other countries have been lost or destroyed over the years. Only the U.S. has pulled it off and has made eight successful landings. The remote test site lies an hour north of the Great Wall from Beijing. Guests at Thursday's event came from 19 countries and included the ambassadors of Brazil, France and Italy. \"This event is the first public appearance of China's Mars exploration mission, also an important measure for China to pragmatically carry out space international exchanges and cooperation,\" the China National Space Administration said in a statement.", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-ap-top-news-mars-planets-china-7e91aba9e0504a7bbc694f68664a5732"}, {"title": "Mars probe test succeeds for China's 2020 mission", "date": "2020-03-10", "content": "Scientists and engineers in Beijing have completed the first wireless communication and connection test of a Mars project on Tuesday, setting the path for the journey to the red planet this year.

Tianwen-1 (China), Mars 2020 (U.S.) and the Hope Probe (UAE) have all taken their positions, hoping to take advantage of the narrow \"launch window\" once every 26 months. Space agencies from all three nations plan to send probes to the planet to look for additional signs of past life and potentially pave the way to - someday - step foot on its surface. The journey will take about six to seven months. China's Tianwen-1: China plans to launch its first Mars probe between July 20 and 25, aiming to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission. After the launch via the country's largest carrier rocket Long March-5, the probe is expected to reach within the gravitational field of Mars next February and it will be captured into orbit around the planet. The lander and rover will make a soft landing on the surface. The rover, which is expected to work on Mars for at least 90 Mars days (more than three months on Earth), will carry out a patrol exploration and research on geomorphic landforms of Mars. The UAE's Hope Probe: The UAE will only launch an orbiter. The Hope Probe - the first interplanetary mission by an Arab country - is scheduled to blast off July 15. The 1,350-kilogram probe, about the size of an SUV, is to take off from a Japanese space center, marking the next step in the UAE's ambitious space program. The probe will remain in orbit for a whole Martian year totaling 687 days, and will mainly track the changing Martian atmosphere. The oil-rich Gulf nation is thinking even longer term. It plans to establish a \"science city\" on Earth that will reproduce Mars' atmospheric conditions, with the goal of establishing a human colony on the Red Planet around 2117. The U.S.'s Mars 2020: By far the most ambitious project, the U.S.'s Mars 2020, has a planned launch date of July 30. The probe - called Perseverance - is expected to spend one Mars year on the planet's surface, collecting rock and soil samples that scientists hope will shed light on past life forms that may have inhabited the faraway planet. It will explore an entirely uncharted environment, the Jezero crater - a 28-mile-wide area that is believed to have been the site of an ancient river delta. It will collect around 40 of these samples, 30 of which will be brought back to Earth to be studied. Why Mars? The drive to explore Mars flagged until the confirmation less than 10 years ago that water once flowed on its surface. \"It's the only planet where we've been able to detect past signs of life, and the more we learn about it more hope there is,\" said Michel Viso, an astrobiologist at CNES, France's space agency. \"It feels like something exciting is happening, and people want to be a part of it.\" Today's Mars is basically an immense, icy desert. About 3.5 billion years ago, it lost the dense atmospheric pressure that protected it from cosmic radiation. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the planet was ever inhabited by metabolic life forms. \"Four billion years ago, the conditions on the planet's surface were very close to those which we had on Earth when life first appeared,\" including liquid water and a dense atmosphere, said Jorge Vago, the spokesperson for the European Space Agency's ExoMars initiative. A fourth planned launch, the EU-Russian ExoMars, was postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 public health crisis. Several dozen probes - most of them American - have set off for the red planet since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land. India and the European Union are also setting their sights on a Mars landing. In 2024, Japan plans to send a probe to explore the Martian moon Phobos.

Tianwen-1, which consists of an orbiter, lander and rover, is scheduled to lift off in late July or early August, according to the China National Space Administration. Speculation is that the launch is targeted for July 23, the opening of the window. Last Friday, the fourth Long March-5 rocket - coded as Long March-5 Y4 - was vertically transported to the launching area at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China's Hainan Province. China's bid to explore Mars involves several other nations for tracking, orbital relay of data and science instrument support. Ready for launch: In a recent interview with China Central Television, Tianwen-1 deputy director Zhang Yu said that scientists have conducted joint tests on multiple systems of the Mars mission at all levels and are ready for the launch. \"We have carried out multiple coordinated maneuvers over flight and control together with launching site system, the rocket system and the probe system, which have verified the validity of interfaces between different systems and the flight program, and also indicated that we are capable of conducting the first Mars probe of our country,\" said Zhang. \"We formatted an orbit kinetic model that has the same orbit with the rover, as well as the corresponding measurement model,\" Zhang added. \"Then we established the corresponding control algorithm to ensure that the probe lands on the designated location of Mars at the designated time, and can automatically capture information, to ensure it can conduct flight and control its mission across Mars.\" Control center: To cope with the challenges ahead, the Beijing Aerospace Control Center set up a Mars exploration flight control team at the start of 2018. CCTV reported that, despite the coronavirus pandemic this year, the team has been actively adjusting personnel allocation, coordinating the test and control network and mapping out switching schemes for different sites, in order to meet the needs of the Mars probe. The center will also adopt the new software and hardware of the flight and control system to assure the correct performance of China's domestically manufactured hardware system. China's Mars mission is ambitious, aiming to pull off orbiting, landing and roving - a historic all-in-one mission. To do so, the country has beefed up its deep-space monitoring network capability to support the Tianwen-1 mission. Once the probe has entered Earth- Mars transfer orbit, the control center's two monitoring stations, in Kashgar of northwestern Xinjiang's Uygur Autonomous Region, and Jiamusi, in northeastern Heilongjiang Province, will swing into action. Tracking support: At the Long March-5 rollout, the booster's protective payload fairing was seen to be adorned with European, French, Argentine and Austrian space agency logos, in addition to that of the CNSA. Tianwen-1 will use ESA's Estrack communications network, and in several ways. Estrack's Kourou ground station, in French Guiana, South America, will follow the mission on departure from China. Extremely precise navigation/trajectory determination, via ESA's stations in Australia and Spain, will also be provided as Tianwen-1 makes its way to Mars. Pooling resources: \"Successful space travel often means pooling resources, and at ESA we are happy to support the new Martian mission with our Estrack network of antennas as well as with our Mars Express spacecraft, currently in orbit at the Red Planet,\" ESA's Beatriz Arias told Space.com. ESA's Kourou ground station will catch signals from the spacecraft as it separates from the launcher after liftoff, providing information on the probe's distance and movements and enabling communications. After liftoff and until Tianwen-1 enters Martian orbit, ESA's New Norcia and Cebreros stations will make a total of eight communication linkups with the spacecraft to support a highly precise navigation/trajectory determination technique known as Delta-DOR. Once at the Red Planet, the Mars Express orbiter will provide data relay support, acting as a go-between, alongside the Chinese orbiter, for the data gathered by China's rover on the Martian surface and ground stations on Earth, ESA officials have said. However, this is backup only, as China's own orbiter will provide the prime relay service. Argentina, France, Austria: Argentina's Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales is thought to be tied to Tianwen-1 by way of a Chinese-run tracking station installed in Las Lajas, Argentina. The facility played a role in China's landing of the Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the moon in January 2019. The Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France is collaborating with China on the Tianwen-1 rover. CNES is the program manager of this collaboration, Sylvestre Maurice of IRAP told Space.com. \"For their Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy instrument, we have delivered a calibration target that is a French duplicate of a target which is on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The idea is to see how the two datasets compare,\" Maurice said. Meanwhile, the Austrian space sector, under the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, has been reported to aid in the development of a magnetometer installed on the Chinese Mars orbiter. The Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz has confirmed the group's contribution to the Tianwen-1 magnetometer and helped with the calibration of the flight instrument, explained Andreas Geisler, head of the FFG Aeronautics and Space Agency. \"The Aeronautics and Space Agency of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency has framed the cooperation on the basis of an agency to agency memorandum of understanding with CNSA,\" Geisler told Space.com.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-mission-tianwen-1-international-partners.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Mars probe test succeeds for China's 2020 mission", "date": "2020-03-10", "content": "Scientists and engineers in Beijing have completed the first wireless communication and connection test of a Mars project on Tuesday, setting the path for the journey to the red planet this year.

The country's strongest carrier rocket, the Long March-5 will send the probe into the geosynchronous orbit. \"The journey through space will take about seven months, while landing will take seven minutes,\" said Zhang Rongqiao, chief architect of the Mars exploration program. The mission will examine the red planet's atmosphere, landscape, geological and magnetic characteristics, which could provide clues to the origin and evolution of Mars and the solar system, Ye Jianpei, chief scientist of Space Science and Deep-space Exploration with the Chinese Space Technology Academy explained. Why 2020? 2020 is set to be a big year for Mars exploration. Countries around the world are racing to carry out their launching plans. NASA's Mars 2020 rover was just assigned an official name by a seventh grade boy: 'Perseverance,' ready to join the current family of probes operating on Mars. So why is everyone launching in 2020? Scientists explained that because everyone wants to make it most cost-effective. Therefore they need to perform the mission at the prime launch windows, when the red planet is particularly close to Earth so that the probe can travel the shortest distance with the lowest fuel consumption. 2020 just happened to be the perfect timing to line up with countries' development timelines.

The U.S.'s Mars 2020: By far the most ambitious project, the U.S.'s Mars 2020, has a planned launch date of July 30. The probe - called Perseverance - is expected to spend one Mars year on the planet's surface, collecting rock and soil samples that scientists hope will shed light on past life forms that may have inhabited the faraway planet. It will explore an entirely uncharted environment, the Jezero crater - a 28-mile-wide area that is believed to have been the site of an ancient river delta. It will collect around 40 of these samples, 30 of which will be brought back to Earth to be studied. Why Mars? The drive to explore Mars flagged until the confirmation less than 10 years ago that water once flowed on its surface. \"It's the only planet where we've been able to detect past signs of life, and the more we learn about it more hope there is,\" said Michel Viso, an astrobiologist at CNES, France's space agency. \"It feels like something exciting is happening, and people want to be a part of it.\" Today's Mars is basically an immense, icy desert.

Tianwen-1, which consists of an orbiter, lander and rover, is scheduled to lift off in late July or early August, according to the China National Space Administration. Speculation is that the launch is targeted for July 23, the opening of the window. Last Friday, the fourth Long March-5 rocket - coded as Long March-5 Y4 - was vertically transported to the launching area at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China's Hainan Province. China's bid to explore Mars involves several other nations for tracking, orbital relay of data and science instrument support. Ready for launch: In a recent interview with China Central Television, Tianwen-1 deputy director Zhang Yu said that scientists have conducted joint tests on multiple systems of the Mars mission at all levels and are ready for the launch. \"We have carried out multiple coordinated maneuvers over flight and control together with launching site system, the rocket system and the probe system, which have verified the validity of interfaces between different systems and the flight program, and also indicated that we are capable of conducting the first Mars probe of our country,\" said Zhang. \"We formatted an orbit kinetic model that has the same orbit with the rover, as well as the corresponding measurement model,\" Zhang added. \"Then we established the corresponding control algorithm to ensure that the probe lands on the designated location of Mars at the designated time, and can automatically capture information, to ensure it can conduct flight and control its mission across Mars.\" Control center: To cope with the challenges ahead, the Beijing Aerospace Control Center set up a Mars exploration flight control team at the start of 2018. CCTV reported that, despite the coronavirus pandemic this year, the team has been actively adjusting personnel allocation, coordinating the test and control network and mapping out switching schemes for different sites, in order to meet the needs of the Mars probe. The center will also adopt the new software and hardware of the flight and control system to assure the correct performance of China's domestically manufactured hardware system. China's Mars mission is ambitious, aiming to pull off orbiting, landing and roving - a historic all-in-one mission. To do so, the country has beefed up its deep-space monitoring network capability to support the Tianwen-1 mission. Once the probe has entered Earth- Mars transfer orbit, the control center's two monitoring stations, in Kashgar of northwestern Xinjiang's Uygur Autonomous Region, and Jiamusi, in northeastern Heilongjiang Province, will swing into action. Tracking support: At the Long March-5 rollout, the booster's protective payload fairing was seen to be adorned with European, French, Argentine and Austrian space agency logos, in addition to that of the CNSA. Tianwen-1 will use ESA's Estrack communications network, and in several ways. Estrack's Kourou ground station, in French Guiana, South America, will follow the mission on departure from China. Extremely precise navigation/trajectory determination, via ESA's stations in Australia and Spain, will also be provided as Tianwen-1 makes its way to Mars. Pooling resources: \"Successful space travel often means pooling resources, and at ESA we are happy to support the new Martian mission with our Estrack network of antennas as well as with our Mars Express spacecraft, currently in orbit at the Red Planet,\" ESA's Beatriz Arias told Space.com. ESA's Kourou ground station will catch signals from the spacecraft as it separates from the launcher after liftoff, providing information on the probe's distance and movements and enabling communications. After liftoff and until Tianwen-1 enters Martian orbit, ESA's New Norcia and Cebreros stations will make a total of eight communication linkups with the spacecraft to support a highly precise navigation/trajectory determination technique known as Delta-DOR. Once at the Red Planet, the Mars Express orbiter will provide data relay support, acting as a go-between, alongside the Chinese orbiter, for the data gathered by China's rover on the Martian surface and ground stations on Earth, ESA officials have said. However, this is backup only, as China's own orbiter will provide the prime relay service. Argentina, France, Austria: Argentina's Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales is thought to be tied to Tianwen-1 by way of a Chinese-run tracking station installed in Las Lajas, Argentina. The facility played a role in China's landing of the Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the moon in January 2019. The Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France is collaborating with China on the Tianwen-1 rover. CNES is the program manager of this collaboration, Sylvestre Maurice of IRAP told Space.com. \"For their Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy instrument, we have delivered a calibration target that is a French duplicate of a target which is on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The idea is to see how the two datasets compare,\" Maurice said. Meanwhile, the Austrian space sector, under the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, has been reported to aid in the development of a magnetometer installed on the Chinese Mars orbiter. The Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz has confirmed the group's contribution to the Tianwen-1 magnetometer and helped with the calibration of the flight instrument, explained Andreas Geisler, head of the FFG Aeronautics and Space Agency. \"The Aeronautics and Space Agency of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency has framed the cooperation on the basis of an agency to agency memorandum of understanding with CNSA,\" Geisler told Space.com.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-mission-tianwen-1-international-partners.html"}, {"title": "China's Mars probe completes first orbital correction", "date": "2020-08-02", "content": "The probe of China's first Mars mission, Tianwen-1, successfully carried out its first orbital correction Sunday morning, according to the China National Space Administration. The probe completed the orbital correction at 7 a.m. Beijing time after its 3000N engine worked for 20 seconds. It had flown for about 230 hours in space, traveling 3 million kilometers away from the Earth by the time of the first orbital correction. \"This is the first real demonstration of the propelling system's performance in space. And it did well,\" said Rao Wei of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. \"The result of the first correction sets an anchor and starting point for the rest of other orbit adjustments,\" he added. Tianwen-1 will adjust courses for around four times during its seven-month journey to Mars, according to Rao. Geng Yan from the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at CNSA said all of the systems have been in good condition. \"The adjustment was very minor. That's because the rocket launch had been accurate,\" Geng told CGTN. \"This mid-course correction is also significant in that this is the first time we have the on-orbit calibration engine, the 3000N engine, activated in space,\" he added China launched its first Mars mission Tianwen-1, which means \"Questions to Heaven,\" on July 23, marking the country's first step in planetary exploration of the solar system. The probe took a photo of the Earth and the Moon at a distance of 1.2 million kilometers away on Monday. Why conduct orbital correction? Similar to the lane keeping aid, known as LKA, for vehicles, orbital correction ensures the Mars probe travels along the planned orbit. But the Mars probe has to correct not only the flight direction but also other variables, such as its flight speed. The probe also has no road markings as a reference in space, making the process much more difficult. During the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, the probe will be affected by the deviation of orbit entry and control accuracy. As the flight is mostly unpowered and lasts a long time, the tiny inaccuracies in position and velocity will gradually accumulate, and cause the probe to miss the red planet if not corrected. Therefore, a control strategy for mid-course orbital correction is indispensable, as it sets the time, speed increment and the direction of each correction. Researchers for the flight mission need to conduct the corresponding attitude and orbital control of the probe according to the strategy to ensure that the probe always flies in the predetermined orbit. The correction strategy will also be continually optimized according to the flight status of the probe.

The mission consists of an orbiter, entry vehicle and rover. The spacecraft will begin orbiting the Red Planet in February 2021, and then prepare for the rover's landing attempt, which is expected in April or May. Tianwen-1 launched on July 23 on a Long March 5 rocket and completed the final burn to send it on a trajectory to Mars 36 minutes later. On July 27, while the spacecraft was about 750,000 miles away from Earth, an optical navigation sensor imaged the crescent-shaped Earth and the smaller, more distant moon. The black-and-white image reveals a few apparent features of Earth, against the stark background of an otherwise vast, black ocean. At 7:00 p.m. EDT on August 1, Tianwen-1 fired its engine for 20 seconds to optimize the spacecraft's trajectory. When the maneuver occured, Tianwen-1 was roughly 1,860,000 miles away from Earth after 230 hours of flight. The burn was a vital test of the vehicle's propulsion system, which it will rely on to correct its trajectory and slow the spacecraft to allow it to enter Mars orbit. The spacecraft will make four or five such adjustments before reaching Mars, Geng Yan, an official with the China National Space Administration, told Chinese media. The second such correction will be made before October. Tianwen-1 is in good condition, communicating well with the ground, according to the update from the China Lunar Exploration Project. The orbiter carries high- and medium-resolution cameras designed for studying and mapping Mars. The image of the Earth and moon, however, was taken by an optical navigation sensor that is normally pointing toward Mars. In the days following launch, a NASA asteroid camera picked up the spacecraft moving against the star field. Other Chinese spacecraft have imaged the Earth and moon together previously. Chang'e-5 T1, an experimental mission launched in 2014 to test lunar sample- return technologies, took a stunning image of the far side of the moon and a distant Earth. The Queqiao relay satellite for the Chang'e-4 lunar far-side mission has also imaged the pair from the second Earth-moon Lagrange point beyond the moon, as did the Longjiang-2 microsatellite that launched with Queqiao.

Once the probe has entered Earth- Mars transfer orbit, the control center's two monitoring stations, in Kashgar of northwestern Xinjiang's Uygur Autonomous Region, and Jiamusi, in northeastern Heilongjiang Province, will swing into action. Tracking support: At the Long March-5 rollout, the booster's protective payload fairing was seen to be adorned with European, French, Argentine and Austrian space agency logos, in addition to that of the CNSA. Tianwen-1 will use ESA's Estrack communications network, and in several ways. Estrack's Kourou ground station, in French Guiana, South America, will follow the mission on departure from China. Extremely precise navigation/trajectory determination, via ESA's stations in Australia and Spain, will also be provided as Tianwen-1 makes its way to Mars. Pooling resources: \"Successful space travel often means pooling resources, and at ESA we are happy to support the new Martian mission with our Estrack network of antennas as well as with our Mars Express spacecraft, currently in orbit at the Red Planet,\" ESA's Beatriz Arias told Space.com. ESA's Kourou ground station will catch signals from the spacecraft as it separates from the launcher after liftoff, providing information on the probe's distance and movements and enabling communications. After liftoff and until Tianwen-1 enters Martian orbit, ESA's New Norcia and Cebreros stations will make a total of eight communication linkups with the spacecraft to support a highly precise navigation/trajectory determination technique known as Delta-DOR. Once at the Red Planet, the Mars Express orbiter will provide data relay support, acting as a go-between, alongside the Chinese orbiter, for the data gathered by China's rover on the Martian surface and ground stations on Earth, ESA officials have said. However, this is backup only, as China's own orbiter will provide the prime relay service. Argentina, France, Austria: Argentina's Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales is thought to be tied to Tianwen-1 by way of a Chinese-run tracking station installed in Las Lajas, Argentina. The facility played a role in China's landing of the Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the moon in January 2019.

The probe completed the orbital correction at 7 a.m. Beijing time after its 3000N engine worked for 20 seconds. It had flown for about 230 hours in space, traveling 3 million kilometers away from the Earth by the time of the first orbital correction. \"This is the first real demonstration of the propelling system's performance in space.

Tianwen-1 will adjust courses for around four times during its seven-month journey to Mars, according to Rao. Geng Yan from the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at CNSA said all of the systems have been in good condition. \"The adjustment was very minor. That's because the rocket launch had been accurate,\" Geng told CGTN. \"This mid-course correction is also significant in that this is the first time we have the on-orbit calibration engine, the 3000N engine, activated in space,\" he added China launched its first Mars mission Tianwen-1, which means \"Questions to Heaven,\" on July 23, marking the country's first step in planetary exploration of the solar system. The probe took a photo of the Earth and the Moon at a distance of 1.2 million kilometers away on Monday. Why conduct orbital correction? Similar to the lane keeping aid, known as LKA, for vehicles, orbital correction ensures the Mars probe travels along the planned orbit. But the Mars probe has to correct not only the flight direction but also other variables, such as its flight speed. The probe also has no road markings as a reference in space, making the process much more difficult. During the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, the probe will be affected by the deviation of orbit entry and control accuracy. As the flight is mostly unpowered and lasts a long time, the tiny inaccuracies in position and velocity will gradually accumulate, and cause the probe to miss the red planet if not corrected. Therefore, a control strategy for mid-course orbital correction is indispensable, as it sets the time, speed increment and the direction of each correction. Researchers for the flight mission need to conduct the corresponding attitude and orbital control of the probe according to the strategy to ensure that the probe always flies in the predetermined orbit. The correction strategy will also be continually optimized according to the flight status of the probe.

The robotic spacecraft ran its four 120-Newton thrusters for 20 seconds at around 11 pm after receiving control signals from its ground controllers, the administration said in a statement on Monday morning. By Monday morning, Tianwen 1 had traveled 160 million kilometers in an Earth- Mars transfer trajectory toward the red planet and was nearly 19 million km from Earth, it added. China launched Tianwen 1, the country's first independent Mars mission, on July 23 at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province, opening the nation's planetary exploration program. On July 27, the probe sent back a photo of Earth and the moon, which was taken by its optical navigation sensor when it was about 1.2 million km from Earth. The photo was the only image from the spacecraft that has so far been made public. The probe made its first midcourse correction on Aug 2 when it was about 3 million km from Earth. Next, it will conduct three more midcourse corrections and one deep-space maneuver to ensure it is precisely aimed at Mars. If everything goes according to schedule, the 5-metric-ton Tianwen 1, which consists of an orbiter and the landing capsule, will travel more than 470 million km before being captured by the Martian gravitational field in February. The mission's ultimate goal is to land a rover around May 2021 on the southern part of Mars' Utopia Planitia - a large plain within Utopia, the largest recognized impact basin on Mars and in the solar system - to make scientific surveys, the space administration said. In another development, China launched its latest oceanographic research satellite, the HY-2C, on a Long March 4B carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on Monday afternoon, the administration said. Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, HY-2C is the third in the HY-2 series marine satellite fleet, and, like its two predecessors, is tasked with studying the marine dynamic environment. In 2021, the next satellite in the series, HY-2D, will be launched to join those already in orbit to form a network monitoring the marine dynamic environment around the clock, according to the administration.

Tianwen-1 (China), Mars 2020 (U.S.) and the Hope Probe (UAE) have all taken their positions, hoping to take advantage of the narrow \"launch window\" once every 26 months. Space agencies from all three nations plan to send probes to the planet to look for additional signs of past life and potentially pave the way to - someday - step foot on its surface. The journey will take about six to seven months. China's Tianwen-1: China plans to launch its first Mars probe between July 20 and 25, aiming to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission. After the launch via the country's largest carrier rocket Long March-5, the probe is expected to reach within the gravitational field of Mars next February and it will be captured into orbit around the planet. The lander and rover will make a soft landing on the surface. The rover, which is expected to work on Mars for at least 90 Mars days (more than three months on Earth), will carry out a patrol exploration and research on geomorphic landforms of Mars. The UAE's Hope Probe: The UAE will only launch an orbiter. The Hope Probe - the first interplanetary mission by an Arab country - is scheduled to blast off July 15. The 1,350-kilogram probe, about the size of an SUV, is to take off from a Japanese space center, marking the next step in the UAE's ambitious space program. The probe will remain in orbit for a whole Martian year totaling 687 days, and will mainly track the changing Martian atmosphere. The oil-rich Gulf nation is thinking even longer term. It plans to establish a \"science city\" on Earth that will reproduce Mars' atmospheric conditions, with the goal of establishing a human colony on the Red Planet around 2117. The U.S.'s Mars 2020: By far the most ambitious project, the U.S.'s Mars 2020, has a planned launch date of July 30. The probe - called Perseverance - is expected to spend one Mars year on the planet's surface, collecting rock and soil samples that scientists hope will shed light on past life forms that may have inhabited the faraway planet. It will explore an entirely uncharted environment, the Jezero crater - a 28-mile-wide area that is believed to have been the site of an ancient river delta. It will collect around 40 of these samples, 30 of which will be brought back to Earth to be studied. Why Mars? The drive to explore Mars flagged until the confirmation less than 10 years ago that water once flowed on its surface. \"It's the only planet where we've been able to detect past signs of life, and the more we learn about it more hope there is,\" said Michel Viso, an astrobiologist at CNES, France's space agency. \"It feels like something exciting is happening, and people want to be a part of it.\" Today's Mars is basically an immense, icy desert. About 3.5 billion years ago, it lost the dense atmospheric pressure that protected it from cosmic radiation. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the planet was ever inhabited by metabolic life forms. \"Four billion years ago, the conditions on the planet's surface were very close to those which we had on Earth when life first appeared,\" including liquid water and a dense atmosphere, said Jorge Vago, the spokesperson for the European Space Agency's ExoMars initiative. A fourth planned launch, the EU-Russian ExoMars, was postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 public health crisis. Several dozen probes - most of them American - have set off for the red planet since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land. India and the European Union are also setting their sights on a Mars landing. In 2024, Japan plans to send a probe to explore the Martian moon Phobos.

China's bid to explore Mars involves several other nations for tracking, orbital relay of data and science instrument support. Ready for launch: In a recent interview with China Central Television, Tianwen-1 deputy director Zhang Yu said that scientists have conducted joint tests on multiple systems of the Mars mission at all levels and are ready for the launch. \"We have carried out multiple coordinated maneuvers over flight and control together with launching site system, the rocket system and the probe system, which have verified the validity of interfaces between different systems and the flight program, and also indicated that we are capable of conducting the first Mars probe of our country,\" said Zhang. \"We formatted an orbit kinetic model that has the same orbit with the rover, as well as the corresponding measurement model,\" Zhang added. \"Then we established the corresponding control algorithm to ensure that the probe lands on the designated location of Mars at the designated time, and can automatically capture information, to ensure it can conduct flight and control its mission across Mars.\" Control center: To cope with the challenges ahead, the Beijing Aerospace Control Center set up a Mars exploration flight control team at the start of 2018. CCTV reported that, despite the coronavirus pandemic this year, the team has been actively adjusting personnel allocation, coordinating the test and control network and mapping out switching schemes for different sites, in order to meet the needs of the Mars probe.

Tianwen-1, consisting of an orbiter and a lander-rover duo, is currently on its way to Mars following launch on a Long March 5 rocket on July 23. Mission team members have already tested its science instruments. The latest official update from China stated that Tianwen-1 had traveled a total of 85.12 million miles as of Sept. 11 and was 9.5 million straight-line miles from Earth at the time. China has already stated that the rover will attempt to land in a designated area of Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The area is to the south of NASA's Viking 2 landing site and northwest of the spot where the American space agency's Mars InSight lander touched down in November 2018. However information published in an article ) in the official China Space News publication following launch in July provides a specific primary landing site. The article reported landing coordinates of 110.318 degrees east longitude and 24.748 degrees north latitude, within the southern portion of Utopia Planitia. Online versions of the article have since been edited to remove the coordinates; however, these remain published by sources citing the article. The area appears to provide a relatively safe place for a landing attempt but is also of great scientific interest, according to Alfred McEwen, director of the Planetary Image Research Laboratory at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of the powerful HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. McEwen described the site as typical southern Utopia Planitia, adding that it is \"mostly flat and smooth but with craters, aeolian wind-sculpted ridges, and a few boulders.\" The area has been \"interpreted as covered by mud flows by some scientists, so ancient deep groundwater may have existed, and this could be an interesting location to study with a rover,\" McEwen told Space.com. McEwen added that he's not aware of any evidence suggesting that there may be water ice at or near the surface of the Tianwen-1 landing site. The yet-to-be-named, roughly 530-lb. solar-powered Tianwen-1 rover will investigate the surface soil characteristics and potential water-ice distribution with its Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument. China's Chang'e 4 rover uses a similar instrument to peer beneath the surface of the far side of the moon. The Mars rover will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface. China has twice landed on the moon, with Chang'e 3 in 2013 and Chang'e 4 on the far side in 2019. However Tianwen-1 is China's first independent interplanetary mission, and landing on Mars, with its thin atmosphere, remoteness and different gravity field, presents new and greater challenges. After arrival in Mars orbit in February next year, Tianwen-1 will spend two to three months preparing for the rover's landing attempt, using high- and medium-resolution cameras to assess the site and the conditions. It will then attempt entry, descent and landing. The spacecraft will separate from the orbiter and enter the atmosphere, being slowed by a conical aeroshell. Next, a parachute will further slow the craft before retropropulsion rockets provide the final deceleration for the descent onto the Martian surface. The low elevation of Utopia Planitia means there will be more time and atmosphere for the entry spacecraft to slow down and safely descend to the surface. If it lands successfully, the Tianwen-1 rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian days, or sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-tianwen-1-landing-site"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Countdown to Mars: China, U.S., UAE to launch missions this month", "date": "2020-07-10", "content": "Three countries - China, the United States and the United Arab Emirates - are set to launch their missions to Mars in the following weeks as the red planet gets its closest to the Earth at a distance of only 55 million kilometers. Tianwen-1 (China), Mars 2020 (U.S.) and the Hope Probe (UAE) have all taken their positions, hoping to take advantage of the narrow \"launch window\" once every 26 months. Space agencies from all three nations plan to send probes to the planet to look for additional signs of past life and potentially pave the way to - someday - step foot on its surface. The journey will take about six to seven months. China's Tianwen-1: China plans to launch its first Mars probe between July 20 and 25, aiming to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission. After the launch via the country's largest carrier rocket Long March-5, the probe is expected to reach within the gravitational field of Mars next February and it will be captured into orbit around the planet. The lander and rover will make a soft landing on the surface. The rover, which is expected to work on Mars for at least 90 Mars days (more than three months on Earth), will carry out a patrol exploration and research on geomorphic landforms of Mars. The UAE's Hope Probe: The UAE will only launch an orbiter. The Hope Probe - the first interplanetary mission by an Arab country - is scheduled to blast off July 15. The 1,350-kilogram probe, about the size of an SUV, is to take off from a Japanese space center, marking the next step in the UAE's ambitious space program. The probe will remain in orbit for a whole Martian year totaling 687 days, and will mainly track the changing Martian atmosphere. The oil-rich Gulf nation is thinking even longer term. It plans to establish a \"science city\" on Earth that will reproduce Mars' atmospheric conditions, with the goal of establishing a human colony on the Red Planet around 2117. The U.S.'s Mars 2020: By far the most ambitious project, the U.S.'s Mars 2020, has a planned launch date of July 30. The probe - called Perseverance - is expected to spend one Mars year on the planet's surface, collecting rock and soil samples that scientists hope will shed light on past life forms that may have inhabited the faraway planet. It will explore an entirely uncharted environment, the Jezero crater - a 28-mile-wide area that is believed to have been the site of an ancient river delta. It will collect around 40 of these samples, 30 of which will be brought back to Earth to be studied. Why Mars? The drive to explore Mars flagged until the confirmation less than 10 years ago that water once flowed on its surface. \"It's the only planet where we've been able to detect past signs of life, and the more we learn about it more hope there is,\" said Michel Viso, an astrobiologist at CNES, France's space agency. \"It feels like something exciting is happening, and people want to be a part of it.\" Today's Mars is basically an immense, icy desert. About 3.5 billion years ago, it lost the dense atmospheric pressure that protected it from cosmic radiation. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the planet was ever inhabited by metabolic life forms. \"Four billion years ago, the conditions on the planet's surface were very close to those which we had on Earth when life first appeared,\" including liquid water and a dense atmosphere, said Jorge Vago, the spokesperson for the European Space Agency's ExoMars initiative. A fourth planned launch, the EU-Russian ExoMars, was postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 public health crisis. Several dozen probes - most of them American - have set off for the red planet since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land. India and the European Union are also setting their sights on a Mars landing. In 2024, Japan plans to send a probe to explore the Martian moon Phobos.

Tianwen-1, which consists of an orbiter, lander and rover, is scheduled to lift off in late July or early August, according to the China National Space Administration. Speculation is that the launch is targeted for July 23, the opening of the window. Last Friday, the fourth Long March-5 rocket - coded as Long March-5 Y4 - was vertically transported to the launching area at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China's Hainan Province. China's bid to explore Mars involves several other nations for tracking, orbital relay of data and science instrument support. Ready for launch: In a recent interview with China Central Television, Tianwen-1 deputy director Zhang Yu said that scientists have conducted joint tests on multiple systems of the Mars mission at all levels and are ready for the launch. \"We have carried out multiple coordinated maneuvers over flight and control together with launching site system, the rocket system and the probe system, which have verified the validity of interfaces between different systems and the flight program, and also indicated that we are capable of conducting the first Mars probe of our country,\" said Zhang. \"We formatted an orbit kinetic model that has the same orbit with the rover, as well as the corresponding measurement model,\" Zhang added. \"Then we established the corresponding control algorithm to ensure that the probe lands on the designated location of Mars at the designated time, and can automatically capture information, to ensure it can conduct flight and control its mission across Mars.\" Control center: To cope with the challenges ahead, the Beijing Aerospace Control Center set up a Mars exploration flight control team at the start of 2018. CCTV reported that, despite the coronavirus pandemic this year, the team has been actively adjusting personnel allocation, coordinating the test and control network and mapping out switching schemes for different sites, in order to meet the needs of the Mars probe. The center will also adopt the new software and hardware of the flight and control system to assure the correct performance of China's domestically manufactured hardware system. China's Mars mission is ambitious, aiming to pull off orbiting, landing and roving - a historic all-in-one mission. To do so, the country has beefed up its deep-space monitoring network capability to support the Tianwen-1 mission. Once the probe has entered Earth- Mars transfer orbit, the control center's two monitoring stations, in Kashgar of northwestern Xinjiang's Uygur Autonomous Region, and Jiamusi, in northeastern Heilongjiang Province, will swing into action. Tracking support: At the Long March-5 rollout, the booster's protective payload fairing was seen to be adorned with European, French, Argentine and Austrian space agency logos, in addition to that of the CNSA. Tianwen-1 will use ESA's Estrack communications network, and in several ways. Estrack's Kourou ground station, in French Guiana, South America, will follow the mission on departure from China. Extremely precise navigation/trajectory determination, via ESA's stations in Australia and Spain, will also be provided as Tianwen-1 makes its way to Mars. Pooling resources: \"Successful space travel often means pooling resources, and at ESA we are happy to support the new Martian mission with our Estrack network of antennas as well as with our Mars Express spacecraft, currently in orbit at the Red Planet,\" ESA's Beatriz Arias told Space.com. ESA's Kourou ground station will catch signals from the spacecraft as it separates from the launcher after liftoff, providing information on the probe's distance and movements and enabling communications. After liftoff and until Tianwen-1 enters Martian orbit, ESA's New Norcia and Cebreros stations will make a total of eight communication linkups with the spacecraft to support a highly precise navigation/trajectory determination technique known as Delta-DOR. Once at the Red Planet, the Mars Express orbiter will provide data relay support, acting as a go-between, alongside the Chinese orbiter, for the data gathered by China's rover on the Martian surface and ground stations on Earth, ESA officials have said. However, this is backup only, as China's own orbiter will provide the prime relay service. Argentina, France, Austria: Argentina's Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales is thought to be tied to Tianwen-1 by way of a Chinese-run tracking station installed in Las Lajas, Argentina. The facility played a role in China's landing of the Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the moon in January 2019. The Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France is collaborating with China on the Tianwen-1 rover. CNES is the program manager of this collaboration, Sylvestre Maurice of IRAP told Space.com. \"For their Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy instrument, we have delivered a calibration target that is a French duplicate of a target which is on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The idea is to see how the two datasets compare,\" Maurice said. Meanwhile, the Austrian space sector, under the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, has been reported to aid in the development of a magnetometer installed on the Chinese Mars orbiter. The Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz has confirmed the group's contribution to the Tianwen-1 magnetometer and helped with the calibration of the flight instrument, explained Andreas Geisler, head of the FFG Aeronautics and Space Agency. \"The Aeronautics and Space Agency of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency has framed the cooperation on the basis of an agency to agency memorandum of understanding with CNSA,\" Geisler told Space.com.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-mission-tianwen-1-international-partners.html"}, {"title": "China's Mars probe completes first orbital correction", "date": "2020-08-02", "content": "The probe of China's first Mars mission, Tianwen-1, successfully carried out its first orbital correction Sunday morning, according to the China National Space Administration. The probe completed the orbital correction at 7 a.m. Beijing time after its 3000N engine worked for 20 seconds. It had flown for about 230 hours in space, traveling 3 million kilometers away from the Earth by the time of the first orbital correction. \"This is the first real demonstration of the propelling system's performance in space. And it did well,\" said Rao Wei of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. \"The result of the first correction sets an anchor and starting point for the rest of other orbit adjustments,\" he added. Tianwen-1 will adjust courses for around four times during its seven-month journey to Mars, according to Rao. Geng Yan from the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at CNSA said all of the systems have been in good condition. \"The adjustment was very minor. That's because the rocket launch had been accurate,\" Geng told CGTN. \"This mid-course correction is also significant in that this is the first time we have the on-orbit calibration engine, the 3000N engine, activated in space,\" he added China launched its first Mars mission Tianwen-1, which means \"Questions to Heaven,\" on July 23, marking the country's first step in planetary exploration of the solar system. The probe took a photo of the Earth and the Moon at a distance of 1.2 million kilometers away on Monday. Why conduct orbital correction? Similar to the lane keeping aid, known as LKA, for vehicles, orbital correction ensures the Mars probe travels along the planned orbit. But the Mars probe has to correct not only the flight direction but also other variables, such as its flight speed. The probe also has no road markings as a reference in space, making the process much more difficult. During the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, the probe will be affected by the deviation of orbit entry and control accuracy. As the flight is mostly unpowered and lasts a long time, the tiny inaccuracies in position and velocity will gradually accumulate, and cause the probe to miss the red planet if not corrected. Therefore, a control strategy for mid-course orbital correction is indispensable, as it sets the time, speed increment and the direction of each correction. Researchers for the flight mission need to conduct the corresponding attitude and orbital control of the probe according to the strategy to ensure that the probe always flies in the predetermined orbit. The correction strategy will also be continually optimized according to the flight status of the probe.

Tianwen-1 launched on July 23 on a Long March 5 rocket and completed the final burn to send it on a trajectory to Mars 36 minutes later. On July 27, while the spacecraft was about 750,000 miles away from Earth, an optical navigation sensor imaged the crescent-shaped Earth and the smaller, more distant moon. The black-and-white image reveals a few apparent features of Earth, against the stark background of an otherwise vast, black ocean. At 7:00 p.m. EDT on August 1, Tianwen-1 fired its engine for 20 seconds to optimize the spacecraft's trajectory. When the maneuver occured, Tianwen-1 was roughly 1,860,000 miles away from Earth after 230 hours of flight. The burn was a vital test of the vehicle's propulsion system, which it will rely on to correct its trajectory and slow the spacecraft to allow it to enter Mars orbit.

The second such correction will be made before October. Tianwen-1 is in good condition, communicating well with the ground, according to the update from the China Lunar Exploration Project. The orbiter carries high- and medium-resolution cameras designed for studying and mapping Mars. The image of the Earth and moon, however, was taken by an optical navigation sensor that is normally pointing toward Mars. In the days following launch, a NASA asteroid camera picked up the spacecraft moving against the star field. Other Chinese spacecraft have imaged the Earth and moon together previously. Chang'e-5 T1, an experimental mission launched in 2014 to test lunar sample- return technologies, took a stunning image of the far side of the moon and a distant Earth.

The Mars rover will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface. China has twice landed on the moon, with Chang'e 3 in 2013 and Chang'e 4 on the far side in 2019. However Tianwen-1 is China's first independent interplanetary mission, and landing on Mars, with its thin atmosphere, remoteness and different gravity field, presents new and greater challenges. After arrival in Mars orbit in February next year, Tianwen-1 will spend two to three months preparing for the rover's landing attempt, using high- and medium-resolution cameras to assess the site and the conditions. It will then attempt entry, descent and landing. The spacecraft will separate from the orbiter and enter the atmosphere, being slowed by a conical aeroshell. Next, a parachute will further slow the craft before retropropulsion rockets provide the final deceleration for the descent onto the Martian surface. The low elevation of Utopia Planitia means there will be more time and atmosphere for the entry spacecraft to slow down and safely descend to the surface. If it lands successfully, the Tianwen-1 rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian days, or sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-tianwen-1-landing-site"}, {"title": "Mars spacecraft now 12m kilometers from red planet", "date": "2020-12-16", "content": "China's Tianwen 1 Mars probe was 100 million kilometers from Earth on Monday evening after traveling nearly 360 million km, the China National Space Administration said. By 9 pm Monday, the robotic probe had flown for 144 days on an Earth-Mars transfer trajectory and was around 12 million km from the red planet, the administration said, adding that it was in good condition. The spacecraft has made three midcourse corrections and a deep-space orbital maneuver, and will make several orbital corrections before approaching Mars in mid-February, it said in a statement issued on Tuesday morning. Tianwen 1, China's first independent Mars mission, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on July 23 from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province, opening the nation's planetary exploration program. If everything goes according to schedule, the 5-metric ton probe - which consists of two major parts, an orbiter and a landing capsule - will travel more than 470 million km before getting captured by the Martian gravitational field in February, when it will be 193 million km from Earth. Depending on the two planets' orbits, Mars is from 55 million km to 400 million km distant from Earth. After the probe enters Mars orbit, it will revolve around the planet for two and a half months to investigate the landing capsule's preset landing site before descending to release the landing capsule, which will gradually fall through Mars' atmosphere. At the start of the entry, descent and landing process, the capsule will use a heat shield to decelerate, relying on aerodynamic drag to slow down. It will then deploy a parachute to further reduce speed and drop the heat shield. In the next step, the capsule will drop the parachute and its back shell and ignite its retrorockets. When the spacecraft is about 100 meters above the surface, it will suspend the descent and spend some time observing and analyzing the selected landing site to check for obstacles like rocks. With a positive result, the craft will continue descending until the last moment, when the retrorockets will be shut down and the capsule will touch down on Martian soil. If, however, the landing site looks unsuitable, the spacecraft will make slight adjustments to touch down on a suitable adjacent site. The mission's ultimate goal is to deploy a rover in May on the southern part of Mars' Utopia Planitia - a large plain within Utopia, the largest recognized impact basin in the solar system - to make scientific surveys. If Tianwen 1 can fulfill its three objectives - orbiting Mars for comprehensive observation, landing on the planet's surface and deploying a rover to conduct scientific operations - \"it will become the world's first Mars expedition to accomplish all three goals with one probe,\" said Ye Peijian, a leading deep-space exploration scientist at the China Academy of Space Technology. Tianwen 1 is the world's 46th Mars exploration mission since October 1960, when the former Soviet Union launched the world's first Mars-bound spacecraft. Only 17 of those missions were successful. In the second step in China's Mars exploration program, a larger probe will set off for Mars around 2030 to collect samples and return them to Earth, space officials have said.

The probe completed the orbital correction at 7 a.m. Beijing time after its 3000N engine worked for 20 seconds. It had flown for about 230 hours in space, traveling 3 million kilometers away from the Earth by the time of the first orbital correction. \"This is the first real demonstration of the propelling system's performance in space. And it did well,\" said Rao Wei of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. \"The result of the first correction sets an anchor and starting point for the rest of other orbit adjustments,\" he added. Tianwen-1 will adjust courses for around four times during its seven-month journey to Mars, according to Rao. Geng Yan from the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center at CNSA said all of the systems have been in good condition. \"The adjustment was very minor. That's because the rocket launch had been accurate,\" Geng told CGTN. \"This mid-course correction is also significant in that this is the first time we have the on-orbit calibration engine, the 3000N engine, activated in space,\" he added China launched its first Mars mission Tianwen-1, which means \"Questions to Heaven,\" on July 23, marking the country's first step in planetary exploration of the solar system. The probe took a photo of the Earth and the Moon at a distance of 1.2 million kilometers away on Monday. Why conduct orbital correction? Similar to the lane keeping aid, known as LKA, for vehicles, orbital correction ensures the Mars probe travels along the planned orbit. But the Mars probe has to correct not only the flight direction but also other variables, such as its flight speed. The probe also has no road markings as a reference in space, making the process much more difficult. During the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, the probe will be affected by the deviation of orbit entry and control accuracy. As the flight is mostly unpowered and lasts a long time, the tiny inaccuracies in position and velocity will gradually accumulate, and cause the probe to miss the red planet if not corrected. Therefore, a control strategy for mid-course orbital correction is indispensable, as it sets the time, speed increment and the direction of each correction. Researchers for the flight mission need to conduct the corresponding attitude and orbital control of the probe according to the strategy to ensure that the probe always flies in the predetermined orbit. The correction strategy will also be continually optimized according to the flight status of the probe.

Tianwen-1 launched on July 23 on a Long March 5 rocket and completed the final burn to send it on a trajectory to Mars 36 minutes later. On July 27, while the spacecraft was about 750,000 miles away from Earth, an optical navigation sensor imaged the crescent-shaped Earth and the smaller, more distant moon. The black-and-white image reveals a few apparent features of Earth, against the stark background of an otherwise vast, black ocean. At 7:00 p.m. EDT on August 1, Tianwen-1 fired its engine for 20 seconds to optimize the spacecraft's trajectory. When the maneuver occured, Tianwen-1 was roughly 1,860,000 miles away from Earth after 230 hours of flight. The burn was a vital test of the vehicle's propulsion system, which it will rely on to correct its trajectory and slow the spacecraft to allow it to enter Mars orbit. The spacecraft will make four or five such adjustments before reaching Mars, Geng Yan, an official with the China National Space Administration, told Chinese media. The second such correction will be made before October. Tianwen-1 is in good condition, communicating well with the ground, according to the update from the China Lunar Exploration Project. The orbiter carries high- and medium-resolution cameras designed for studying and mapping Mars. The image of the Earth and moon, however, was taken by an optical navigation sensor that is normally pointing toward Mars. In the days following launch, a NASA asteroid camera picked up the spacecraft moving against the star field. Other Chinese spacecraft have imaged the Earth and moon together previously. Chang'e-5 T1, an experimental mission launched in 2014 to test lunar sample- return technologies, took a stunning image of the far side of the moon and a distant Earth. The Queqiao relay satellite for the Chang'e-4 lunar far-side mission has also imaged the pair from the second Earth-moon Lagrange point beyond the moon, as did the Longjiang-2 microsatellite that launched with Queqiao.

Tianwen-1, consisting of an orbiter and a lander-rover duo, is currently on its way to Mars following launch on a Long March 5 rocket on July 23. Mission team members have already tested its science instruments. The latest official update from China stated that Tianwen-1 had traveled a total of 85.12 million miles as of Sept. 11 and was 9.5 million straight-line miles from Earth at the time. China has already stated that the rover will attempt to land in a designated area of Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The area is to the south of NASA's Viking 2 landing site and northwest of the spot where the American space agency's Mars InSight lander touched down in November 2018. However information published in an article ) in the official China Space News publication following launch in July provides a specific primary landing site. The article reported landing coordinates of 110.318 degrees east longitude and 24.748 degrees north latitude, within the southern portion of Utopia Planitia. Online versions of the article have since been edited to remove the coordinates; however, these remain published by sources citing the article. The area appears to provide a relatively safe place for a landing attempt but is also of great scientific interest, according to Alfred McEwen, director of the Planetary Image Research Laboratory at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of the powerful HiRISE camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. McEwen described the site as typical southern Utopia Planitia, adding that it is \"mostly flat and smooth but with craters, aeolian wind-sculpted ridges, and a few boulders.\" The area has been \"interpreted as covered by mud flows by some scientists, so ancient deep groundwater may have existed, and this could be an interesting location to study with a rover,\" McEwen told Space.com. McEwen added that he's not aware of any evidence suggesting that there may be water ice at or near the surface of the Tianwen-1 landing site. The yet-to-be-named, roughly 530-lb. solar-powered Tianwen-1 rover will investigate the surface soil characteristics and potential water-ice distribution with its Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument. China's Chang'e 4 rover uses a similar instrument to peer beneath the surface of the far side of the moon. The Mars rover will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface. China has twice landed on the moon, with Chang'e 3 in 2013 and Chang'e 4 on the far side in 2019. However Tianwen-1 is China's first independent interplanetary mission, and landing on Mars, with its thin atmosphere, remoteness and different gravity field, presents new and greater challenges. After arrival in Mars orbit in February next year, Tianwen-1 will spend two to three months preparing for the rover's landing attempt, using high- and medium-resolution cameras to assess the site and the conditions. It will then attempt entry, descent and landing. The spacecraft will separate from the orbiter and enter the atmosphere, being slowed by a conical aeroshell. Next, a parachute will further slow the craft before retropropulsion rockets provide the final deceleration for the descent onto the Martian surface. The low elevation of Utopia Planitia means there will be more time and atmosphere for the entry spacecraft to slow down and safely descend to the surface. If it lands successfully, the Tianwen-1 rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian days, or sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-tianwen-1-landing-site"}, {"title": "Mars spacecraft now 12m kilometers from red planet", "date": "2020-12-16", "content": "China's Tianwen 1 Mars probe was 100 million kilometers from Earth on Monday evening after traveling nearly 360 million km, the China National Space Administration said.

In February, both the UAE Space Agency's Hope probe and China's Tianwen-1 entered Mars' orbit. On February 19, NASA landed the Perseverance rover with its companion, the Ingenuity helicopter, both of which have been setting new milestones since. The next visitor to the planet will be Tianwen-1 mission's rover Zhurong, which will attempt to reach the surface of Mars in mid-May. To enter the Martian atmosphere, it will use a slightly different technique from previous missions. Landing on Mars is notoriously dangerous. More missions have failed than succeeded. A successful Mars landing requires entering the atmosphere at very high speeds, then slowing the spacecraft down just the right way as it approaches its landing location. This phase of the mission, known as entry-descent-landing, is the most critical. Previous missions have used several different ways of Martian atmospheric entry. Perfecting entry to Mars's atmosphere has been helped by the experience of returning spacecraft to Earth. Earth may have a significantly different atmosphere from Mars, but the principles remain the same. A spacecraft orbiting a planet will be moving very fast, to keep itself bound to that orbit. But if the spacecraft entered an atmosphere at such high speed, even one as thin as Mars's, it would burn up. Anything entering the atmosphere needs to be slowed down significantly and to get rid of the heat generated during this brief journey. There are several ways to go about it. Spacecraft are protected from the heat generated during atmospheric entry using heat shields. Various missions in the past have used techniques such as absorbing heat, an insulating coating, reflecting the heat back into atmosphere or by ablation, burning up the shield material. From Apollo missions of 1960s to the more recent SpaceX's Dragon, these techniques have been used successfully, and they work really well for Earth. But when it comes to Mars, engineers need to employ some additional measures. Landing on Mars: Orbiters are designed to monitor a planet's surface from the orbit and act as a communications relay station. When approaching a planet, the spacecraft is usually directed along successively smaller elliptical orbits, slowing down each time, until it reaches its target orbit. This technique can also be used to lower the orbit of a spacecraft ahead of a lander's atmospheric entry. The entire maneuver occurs over a few months and doesn't need any additional equipment: an efficient way to conserve fuel. Since it uses the planet's upper atmosphere to apply brakes, it's called as aerobraking. Aerobraking has been used for various Mars missions including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Aerobraking can significantly slow down the spacecraft, but for missions with rovers to land it gets more complicated. On Mars, the atmospheric density is just 1% of Earth's and there are no oceans for the spacecraft to safely splash into. The blunt shape of the spacecraft alone is not enough to reduce the speed. Previously, successful missions have used extra measures. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft used parachutes to decelerate, while relying on a unique airbag system that sprang into action in the final few seconds to absorb the landing shock. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed successfully on Mars with the same technique. A few years later, Curiosity rover used a new landing system. In the final few seconds, rockets were fired, allowing the spacecraft to hover while a tether - a skycrane - lowered the rover to the dusty Martian surface. This new system demonstrated delivery of a heavy payload to Mars and paved the way for bigger missions. More recently, the Perseverance rover, which landed in early 2021, used the the reliable skycrane as well as two more advanced technologies. These new features, which used live images taken from its cameras, enabled a more accurate, reliable and safer landing. Zhurong: the 'fire-god': The Chinese Tianwen-1 rover landing is the next Mars mission. The ambitious mission has orbiting, landing and roving components - the first mission to include all three on its first attempt. It has already been circling the red planet since it entered Mars' orbit on February 24 and will attempt to land its rover Zhurong - which means \"fire god\" - in mid May. In size, Zhurong falls between Spirit and Perseverance and it is carrying six pieces of scientific equipment. After landing, Zhurong will survey the surroundings to study Martian soil, geomorphology and atmosphere, and will look for signs of subsurface water ice. Traditionally, the Chinese authorities don't reveal a lot of information before the event. However, based on an early overview of the mission by some Chinese researchers, we know the landing sequence the spacecraft will attempt to follow. On May 17, Zhurong - protected by an aeroshell - will enter the atmosphere at a speed of 4 km/s about 9,000 mph. When it slows down enough, parachutes will be deployed. In the last phase of the sequence, rockets with variable thrust engines will be used for further deceleration. In contrast with its American counterpart, Tianwen-1 will employ two reliable technologies: a laser range finder to work out where it is relative to Martian terrain and a microwave sensor to determine its speed more accurately. These will be used for navigational correction during its parachuted descent phase. During the powered descent phase at the end, optical and Lidar imaging will assist in hazard detection. Just before touchdown, an automated obstacle avoidance sequence will begin for soft landing. If the mission is successful, China will be the first country to land a rover on Mars in its first attempt. A few days after that, Zhurong will be ready to explore the surface.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/chinese-mars-spacecraf-zhurong-may2021-land-attempt/"}, {"title": "China's Zhurong Mars rover touches down on the red planet", "date": "2021-05-14", "content": "China's space program took a major leap today when it successfully landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, **** marking the country's first landing on another planet. Teams will now prepare to roll the rover off its landing platform and onto the dusty Martian surface to begin a mission to search for evidence of water and hints of past life. The touchdown makes China the second country in history to deposit a rover on the surface of Mars. After months in orbit around the red planet, the Tianwen-1 spacecraft released the Zhurong rover for a landing in Utopia Planitia, a vast plain that may once have been covered by an ancient Martian ocean. The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet's surface conditions. China's rover could make additional important discoveries concerning water and past habitability on the planet, paving the way for future human missions to Mars. \"Landing safely on Mars is a huge challenge, especially for China's first soft landing attempt,\" Long Xiao, a planetary scientist at the China University of Geosciences, said before the safe touchdown. \"But it is a necessary step for Mars and deep-space exploration.\" ## **A harrowing descent** Successfully descending to the surface of Mars is an extraordinary challenge. Before today, only NASA had safely landed and operated spacecraft on the Martian surface; in 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander transmitted half of a photo before falling silent about 100 seconds into the mission. By landing and roving on Mars, China jumps ahead of a number of spacefaring peers. The Zhurong rover made it through the so-called \"seven minutes of terror,\" the time from atmospheric entry to landing on the surface. The China National Space Administration could only watch the autonomous landing unfold from nearly 200 million miles away-so far away that it takes 18 minutes to receive a signal from Mars-and hope everything went to plan. Zhurong sat attached to its orbiter companion, encased in an aeroshell designed to protect the vehicle on its way through the Martian atmosphere. After it was released and endured a fiery atmospheric entry, a huge parachute deployed to further slow the rover's descent. Then a landing platform holding the rover fired up rocket engines to make the final descent to the surface. A laser range \ufb01nder and 3D scanner provided altitude and terrain data while cameras were used to autonomously choose a place to land. China successfully set down a robotic lander and deployed its first lunar rover in 2013 as part of its Chang'e-3 mission to the moon.

Unauthorized use is prohibited. Mars is significantly harder to land on than the moon, says Michel Blanc at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France. But China has had a series of successful lunar missions that prepared it for a Mars landing. Chang'e-4, history's first landing on the lunar far side in 2019, required \"high technological capacity\" in artificial intelligence and autonomous hazard avoidance, Blanc notes. As well, the rocket engines on Zhurong are similar to those China used to safely land three spacecraft on the moon. Those technologies, along with the supersonic parachutes China has used to return astronauts from Earth orbit in space capsules, set up CNSA to pull off a Martian touchdown. A new rover on Mars: Once Zhurong's six wheels roll off the landing platform and onto the Martian dust, the rover will expand its foldable, butterfly-like solar panels and explore the area for a primary mission lasting three months. The vehicle could work well beyond this conservative goal however-the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers had primary missions of about 90 days, and they each ended up exploring Mars for years. Utopia Planitia, thought to be the site of an ancient sea, has sedimentary layers that could contain evidence of past water. Even more exciting, these layers of rock could contain traces of any past life on Mars, says James Head III, a planetary scientist at Brown University. \"Because the pre-selected landing site is close to an ancient ocean shoreline, and distinct from others, the science data will uncover more secrets of Mars,\" Long says. The site complements the research being carried out by NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in the ancient lakes of Gale and Jezero craters, respectively, Head adds. The Zhurong rover carries a suite of six instruments. A pair of panoramic cameras and a multispectral imager will provide information about the terrain and its composition, while an instrument with a laser will vaporize rocks to analyze their makeup, similar to the laser spectrometers aboard Curiosity and Perseverance. A magnetometer will measure magnetic fields in tandem with an instrument on the orbiter, and a climate station will measure the local atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, and sound on Mars. One of the most exciting instruments aboard the rover, however, is a ground- penetrating radar, which will be used to search for pockets of water or ice below the surface. Head notes that NASA's Viking 2 lander, which set down in a region slightly north of Zhurong's landing site in 1975, imaged fascinating phenomena, including ice contractions and frosts on the surface of Mars, and polygon patterned terrain which may have been created by contractions of subsurface ice with changing seasons. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar will ping the surface with two different frequencies and pick up echo data from layers below, peering down to 33 feet to search for ices or briny waters underground. \"Tianwen-1 is likely to be able to explore and detect any subsurface snow and ice using its payload,\" Head says. Such pockets of ice could prove valuable for future crewed missions, and any pockets of water or brine, shielded from radiation on the surface, may provide habitats for simple lifeforms. The next chapter of Chinese space exploration: China will openly share the data from Tianwen-1 and Zhurong the same way it has shared data from its lunar exploration missions, Long says, benefiting planetary scientists around the world. The mission will also set the stage for China's next planned voyage to Mars-an audacious sample-return attempt scheduled to launch around 2028. Beyond Mars, the country has plans to launch a Jupiter probe, including a possible landing on the moon Callisto, to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, and to send a pair of Voyager-like spacecraft toward the edges of the solar system. \"In the age of ocean exploration, China has a history of Zheng He's voyages to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" says Zhang Xiaoping, associate professor at the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences of the Macau University of Science and Technology, referring to early 15th-century expeditions. Zhang views China's Mars mission as a continuation of these Ming Dynasty journeys. Tianwen-1 and Zhurong, he says, are \"of great significance for studying the unknown universe, stimulating the scientific enthusiasm of young people, stimulating the creativity of the whole country, enhancing the ability to explore the unknown, and expanding the living space of humanity.\"", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/china-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission"}, {"title": "China confirms probe lands on Mars, Zhurong rover to begin exploration", "date": "2021-05-15", "content": "China confirmed the Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars and Zhurong rover began its exploration to the red planet early Saturday.

The orbiter is serving as a data relay station for communications between Zhurong and mission controllers on Earth. On Wednesday, Zhurong sent back the first images it took on Mars via the orbiter.

The rover is 1.85 meters high and weighs about 240 kilograms, with a designed life span of three Martian months - equivalent to about 92 Earth days.

In February, both the UAE Space Agency's Hope probe and China's Tianwen-1 entered Mars' orbit. On February 19, NASA landed the Perseverance rover with its companion, the Ingenuity helicopter, both of which have been setting new milestones since. The next visitor to the planet will be Tianwen-1 mission's rover Zhurong, which will attempt to reach the surface of Mars in mid-May. To enter the Martian atmosphere, it will use a slightly different technique from previous missions. Landing on Mars is notoriously dangerous. More missions have failed than succeeded. A successful Mars landing requires entering the atmosphere at very high speeds, then slowing the spacecraft down just the right way as it approaches its landing location. This phase of the mission, known as entry-descent-landing, is the most critical. Previous missions have used several different ways of Martian atmospheric entry. Perfecting entry to Mars's atmosphere has been helped by the experience of returning spacecraft to Earth. Earth may have a significantly different atmosphere from Mars, but the principles remain the same. A spacecraft orbiting a planet will be moving very fast, to keep itself bound to that orbit. But if the spacecraft entered an atmosphere at such high speed, even one as thin as Mars's, it would burn up. Anything entering the atmosphere needs to be slowed down significantly and to get rid of the heat generated during this brief journey. There are several ways to go about it. Spacecraft are protected from the heat generated during atmospheric entry using heat shields. Various missions in the past have used techniques such as absorbing heat, an insulating coating, reflecting the heat back into atmosphere or by ablation, burning up the shield material. From Apollo missions of 1960s to the more recent SpaceX's Dragon, these techniques have been used successfully, and they work really well for Earth. But when it comes to Mars, engineers need to employ some additional measures. Landing on Mars: Orbiters are designed to monitor a planet's surface from the orbit and act as a communications relay station. When approaching a planet, the spacecraft is usually directed along successively smaller elliptical orbits, slowing down each time, until it reaches its target orbit. This technique can also be used to lower the orbit of a spacecraft ahead of a lander's atmospheric entry. The entire maneuver occurs over a few months and doesn't need any additional equipment: an efficient way to conserve fuel. Since it uses the planet's upper atmosphere to apply brakes, it's called as aerobraking. Aerobraking has been used for various Mars missions including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Aerobraking can significantly slow down the spacecraft, but for missions with rovers to land it gets more complicated. On Mars, the atmospheric density is just 1% of Earth's and there are no oceans for the spacecraft to safely splash into. The blunt shape of the spacecraft alone is not enough to reduce the speed. Previously, successful missions have used extra measures. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft used parachutes to decelerate, while relying on a unique airbag system that sprang into action in the final few seconds to absorb the landing shock. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed successfully on Mars with the same technique. A few years later, Curiosity rover used a new landing system. In the final few seconds, rockets were fired, allowing the spacecraft to hover while a tether - a skycrane - lowered the rover to the dusty Martian surface. This new system demonstrated delivery of a heavy payload to Mars and paved the way for bigger missions. More recently, the Perseverance rover, which landed in early 2021, used the the reliable skycrane as well as two more advanced technologies. These new features, which used live images taken from its cameras, enabled a more accurate, reliable and safer landing. Zhurong: the 'fire-god': The Chinese Tianwen-1 rover landing is the next Mars mission. The ambitious mission has orbiting, landing and roving components - the first mission to include all three on its first attempt. It has already been circling the red planet since it entered Mars' orbit on February 24 and will attempt to land its rover Zhurong - which means \"fire god\" - in mid May. In size, Zhurong falls between Spirit and Perseverance and it is carrying six pieces of scientific equipment. After landing, Zhurong will survey the surroundings to study Martian soil, geomorphology and atmosphere, and will look for signs of subsurface water ice. Traditionally, the Chinese authorities don't reveal a lot of information before the event. However, based on an early overview of the mission by some Chinese researchers, we know the landing sequence the spacecraft will attempt to follow. On May 17, Zhurong - protected by an aeroshell - will enter the atmosphere at a speed of 4 km/s about 9,000 mph. When it slows down enough, parachutes will be deployed. In the last phase of the sequence, rockets with variable thrust engines will be used for further deceleration. In contrast with its American counterpart, Tianwen-1 will employ two reliable technologies: a laser range finder to work out where it is relative to Martian terrain and a microwave sensor to determine its speed more accurately. These will be used for navigational correction during its parachuted descent phase. During the powered descent phase at the end, optical and Lidar imaging will assist in hazard detection. Just before touchdown, an automated obstacle avoidance sequence will begin for soft landing. If the mission is successful, China will be the first country to land a rover on Mars in its first attempt. A few days after that, Zhurong will be ready to explore the surface.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/chinese-mars-spacecraf-zhurong-may2021-land-attempt/"}, {"title": "China's Zhurong Mars rover touches down on the red planet", "date": "2021-05-14", "content": "China's space program took a major leap today when it successfully landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, **** marking the country's first landing on another planet. Teams will now prepare to roll the rover off its landing platform and onto the dusty Martian surface to begin a mission to search for evidence of water and hints of past life. The touchdown makes China the second country in history to deposit a rover on the surface of Mars. After months in orbit around the red planet, the Tianwen-1 spacecraft released the Zhurong rover for a landing in Utopia Planitia, a vast plain that may once have been covered by an ancient Martian ocean. The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet's surface conditions. China's rover could make additional important discoveries concerning water and past habitability on the planet, paving the way for future human missions to Mars. \"Landing safely on Mars is a huge challenge, especially for China's first soft landing attempt,\" Long Xiao, a planetary scientist at the China University of Geosciences, said before the safe touchdown. \"But it is a necessary step for Mars and deep-space exploration.\" ## **A harrowing descent** Successfully descending to the surface of Mars is an extraordinary challenge. Before today, only NASA had safely landed and operated spacecraft on the Martian surface; in 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander transmitted half of a photo before falling silent about 100 seconds into the mission. By landing and roving on Mars, China jumps ahead of a number of spacefaring peers. The Zhurong rover made it through the so-called \"seven minutes of terror,\" the time from atmospheric entry to landing on the surface. The China National Space Administration could only watch the autonomous landing unfold from nearly 200 million miles away-so far away that it takes 18 minutes to receive a signal from Mars-and hope everything went to plan. Zhurong sat attached to its orbiter companion, encased in an aeroshell designed to protect the vehicle on its way through the Martian atmosphere. After it was released and endured a fiery atmospheric entry, a huge parachute deployed to further slow the rover's descent. Then a landing platform holding the rover fired up rocket engines to make the final descent to the surface. A laser range \ufb01nder and 3D scanner provided altitude and terrain data while cameras were used to autonomously choose a place to land. China successfully set down a robotic lander and deployed its first lunar rover in 2013 as part of its Chang'e-3 mission to the moon. Mosaic of 61 images by Andrew Bodrov, 360pano, with photographs from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Space Administration, The Science and Application Center for Moon and Deepspace Exploration Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Mars is significantly harder to land on than the moon, says Michel Blanc at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France. But China has had a series of successful lunar missions that prepared it for a Mars landing. Chang'e-4, history's first landing on the lunar far side in 2019, required \"high technological capacity\" in artificial intelligence and autonomous hazard avoidance, Blanc notes. As well, the rocket engines on Zhurong are similar to those China used to safely land three spacecraft on the moon. Those technologies, along with the supersonic parachutes China has used to return astronauts from Earth orbit in space capsules, set up CNSA to pull off a Martian touchdown. A new rover on Mars: Once Zhurong's six wheels roll off the landing platform and onto the Martian dust, the rover will expand its foldable, butterfly-like solar panels and explore the area for a primary mission lasting three months. The vehicle could work well beyond this conservative goal however-the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers had primary missions of about 90 days, and they each ended up exploring Mars for years. Utopia Planitia, thought to be the site of an ancient sea, has sedimentary layers that could contain evidence of past water. Even more exciting, these layers of rock could contain traces of any past life on Mars, says James Head III, a planetary scientist at Brown University. \"Because the pre-selected landing site is close to an ancient ocean shoreline, and distinct from others, the science data will uncover more secrets of Mars,\" Long says. The site complements the research being carried out by NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in the ancient lakes of Gale and Jezero craters, respectively, Head adds. The Zhurong rover carries a suite of six instruments. A pair of panoramic cameras and a multispectral imager will provide information about the terrain and its composition, while an instrument with a laser will vaporize rocks to analyze their makeup, similar to the laser spectrometers aboard Curiosity and Perseverance. A magnetometer will measure magnetic fields in tandem with an instrument on the orbiter, and a climate station will measure the local atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, and sound on Mars. One of the most exciting instruments aboard the rover, however, is a ground- penetrating radar, which will be used to search for pockets of water or ice below the surface. Head notes that NASA's Viking 2 lander, which set down in a region slightly north of Zhurong's landing site in 1975, imaged fascinating phenomena, including ice contractions and frosts on the surface of Mars, and polygon patterned terrain which may have been created by contractions of subsurface ice with changing seasons. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar will ping the surface with two different frequencies and pick up echo data from layers below, peering down to 33 feet to search for ices or briny waters underground. \"Tianwen-1 is likely to be able to explore and detect any subsurface snow and ice using its payload,\" Head says. Such pockets of ice could prove valuable for future crewed missions, and any pockets of water or brine, shielded from radiation on the surface, may provide habitats for simple lifeforms. The next chapter of Chinese space exploration: China will openly share the data from Tianwen-1 and Zhurong the same way it has shared data from its lunar exploration missions, Long says, benefiting planetary scientists around the world. The mission will also set the stage for China's next planned voyage to Mars-an audacious sample-return attempt scheduled to launch around 2028. Beyond Mars, the country has plans to launch a Jupiter probe, including a possible landing on the moon Callisto, to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, and to send a pair of Voyager-like spacecraft toward the edges of the solar system. \"In the age of ocean exploration, China has a history of Zheng He's voyages to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" says Zhang Xiaoping, associate professor at the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences of the Macau University of Science and Technology, referring to early 15th-century expeditions. Zhang views China's Mars mission as a continuation of these Ming Dynasty journeys. Tianwen-1 and Zhurong, he says, are \"of great significance for studying the unknown universe, stimulating the scientific enthusiasm of young people, stimulating the creativity of the whole country, enhancing the ability to explore the unknown, and expanding the living space of humanity.\"", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/china-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission"}, {"title": "China confirms probe lands on Mars, Zhurong rover to begin exploration", "date": "2021-05-15", "content": "China confirmed the Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars and Zhurong rover began its exploration to the red planet early Saturday.

Released by CNSA on Sunday, June 27, the footage shows the parachute deployment, descent, and landing, the deployment of the Zhurong rover to the surface, as well as a sweet shot of the six-wheeled vehicle backing away from its wireless camera. Launched in July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission - China's first to the Red Planet - arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021. The first video chronicles the landing on May 15 and presents views taken from three different cameras. Similar to NASA's footage of the Perseverance landing earlier this year, the video shows the parachute deployment and the backshell separation. The rover's obstacle avoidance camera was used to record the landing itself. Media captured during the mission are relayed to Earth using the Tianwen-1 satellite, currently in orbit around Mars. The second video is neat in that it includes both visuals and audio. The rover can be seen - and heard - driving down a ramp as it exits the landing platform to reach the Martian surface, which it did on May 22. The footage was captured by the rover's front and rear avoidance cameras, and the audio was recorded by a microphone that will be used to study the Martian \"environment and condition, such as atmospheric density and other parameters on the planet,\" explained Liu Jizhong, deputy commander of the Mars exploration program, in the South China Morning Post. The sound of Zhurong \"moving away mainly comes from the driving mechanism, the friction between the wheels and the ramp, and the friction between the wheels and the ground,\" according to a CNSA statement. The sound is quite muted, reminiscent of audio captured during flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter. Sound waves have barely any atmosphere to work with on Mars, hence the muffled audio. The third video was taken just prior to a neat selfie that shows both Zhurong and the landing platform. After depositing the wireless camera onto the surface, the rover can be seen retreating as it heads back toward the lander in preparation for the selfie.

Recently, the China National Space Administration has landed its first rover on Mars, and begun to explore the surface of the red planet. It's a huge step, and something only previously achieved successfully by NASA. Let's take a look at the Chinese project, its goals, and see how it compares to the American rovers that have also roamed so far away. Wheelin' on Mars: China's first Mars rover goes by the name of Zhurong, named after a figure in Chinese mythology that is typically associated with fire. Given that Mars is known as the \"Planet of Fire\" in China, it's a fitting name selected by a public vote held earlier this year. The rover comes in at a size of 2.6 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.85 meters high, with its size placing it in between NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers which landed in 2004, and the later Curiosity rover which is a touch larger. The Zhurong rover weighs 240 kilograms, again placing it in between the two recent generations of NASA Mars rovers. Zhurong was launched as part of the Tianwen-1 mission which launched on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft entered Martian orbit on February 10, 2021, with the lander touching down on 14 May 2021 in the Utopia Planitia. The area on Mars was chosen as an ideal spot to investigate the possibility of the planet being host to an ancient ocean. The descent was controlled by parachutes and retro- rockets which slowed the lander as it approached the surface. What Lies Beneath: The rover sports a sensor package designed to perform a variety of science missions. Chief among those is the ground-penetrating radar, designed to collect geological data and capable of imaging up to 100 meters below the Martian surface. This goes far deeper than the 10 meter depth capability of the instrument fitted to the Perseverance rover which landed earlier this year. There's also a magnetometer onboard for determining the finer details of Mars's magnetic field. Atmospheric data is captured by measuring temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction in the Martian atmosphere. There's also a microphone which captures sound, which tends to have a different quality to that on Earth due to the different atmospheric conditions. Analysis and Imaging Hardware: Similarly to other rovers, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument is included. For those who aren't deeply involved in the spectroscopy subculture, this is a device which blasts rock and other samples with a laser and measures the emitted light. This can be used to determine the chemical makeup of samples. Camera-wise, a multi-spectral camera is fitted which aims to research the details around the existence of water on Mars. There are also extra cameras specifically intended for navigational purposes and for mapping out the topography of the surrounding area. These are key to the rover's mission, as communication time delays from Earth to Mars make direct teleoperation of the rover impossible. Cameras are instead used to enable the rover to take some level of autonomy in getting around its immediate area. Some of the rover's science hardware is eclipsed by that present on Perseverance, such as the fancier spectrometers on board, but overall it's a very complete science package. Zhurong's primary goals of studying Martian geology and soil, as well as the atmosphere, should reveal useful insights into the makeup of Mars as well as its history. One unique feature of the rover is its active suspension system. Unlike the passive rocker-bogie suspension system used on NASA rovers, Zhurong has fully independent control of each wheel's suspension. It can adjust the weight placed on each wheel, which could be particularly useful if the rover finds itself encountering softer soils, and could also assist in navigating obstacles or steeper slopes. The Mission Thus Far: China has recently released images of the rover on Mars, taken by a selfie camera that was dropped for that very purpose. The images document Zhurong rolling away from the camera as it begins to explore its landing site. Thus far, the rover has spent over a month on Mars, and has travelled 236 meters since landing. It is expected to spend 90 days studying the Martian surface, though it's common for rover missions to be extended if the hardware continues functioning past the original timeline. As an example, NASA's Opportunity rover ended up exploring the planet for 14 years despite originally being intended to operate for just 90 days. The video released of the rover and its lander don't show a lot of action yet, but we look forward to more images and more science coming out of the project. More rovers on Mars can only mean more learning, though we're a touch disappointed that thus far, they've all landed far apart and don't get to hang out. Perhaps one day, two rovers will meet; for now, with only six on the Martian surface, that's likely quite some time away!

The Tianwen-1 mission is China's first step in independent planetary exploration of the solar system. It aims to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission. The space administration launched a global naming campaign for the Mars rover last July, inviting netizens at home and abroad to vote for their favorite.", "url": "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-04-24/China-s-first-Mars-rover-named-Zhurong--ZIiGQ5pcSQ/index.html"}, {"title": "Chinese rover Zhurong to attempt to land on Mars this month", "date": "2021-05-06", "content": "For the first few months of 2021, the Martian atmosphere was buzzing with new visitors from Earth. In February, both the UAE Space Agency's Hope probe and China's Tianwen-1 entered Mars' orbit. On February 19, NASA landed the Perseverance rover with its companion, the Ingenuity helicopter, both of which have been setting new milestones since. The next visitor to the planet will be Tianwen-1 mission's rover Zhurong, which will attempt to reach the surface of Mars in mid-May. To enter the Martian atmosphere, it will use a slightly different technique from previous missions. Landing on Mars is notoriously dangerous. More missions have failed than succeeded. A successful Mars landing requires entering the atmosphere at very high speeds, then slowing the spacecraft down just the right way as it approaches its landing location. This phase of the mission, known as entry-descent-landing, is the most critical. Previous missions have used several different ways of Martian atmospheric entry. Perfecting entry to Mars's atmosphere has been helped by the experience of returning spacecraft to Earth. Earth may have a significantly different atmosphere from Mars, but the principles remain the same. A spacecraft orbiting a planet will be moving very fast, to keep itself bound to that orbit. But if the spacecraft entered an atmosphere at such high speed, even one as thin as Mars's, it would burn up. Anything entering the atmosphere needs to be slowed down significantly and to get rid of the heat generated during this brief journey. There are several ways to go about it. Spacecraft are protected from the heat generated during atmospheric entry using heat shields. Various missions in the past have used techniques such as absorbing heat, an insulating coating, reflecting the heat back into atmosphere or by ablation, burning up the shield material. From Apollo missions of 1960s to the more recent SpaceX's Dragon, these techniques have been used successfully, and they work really well for Earth. But when it comes to Mars, engineers need to employ some additional measures. Landing on Mars: Orbiters are designed to monitor a planet's surface from the orbit and act as a communications relay station. When approaching a planet, the spacecraft is usually directed along successively smaller elliptical orbits, slowing down each time, until it reaches its target orbit. This technique can also be used to lower the orbit of a spacecraft ahead of a lander's atmospheric entry. The entire maneuver occurs over a few months and doesn't need any additional equipment: an efficient way to conserve fuel. Since it uses the planet's upper atmosphere to apply brakes, it's called as aerobraking. Aerobraking has been used for various Mars missions including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Aerobraking can significantly slow down the spacecraft, but for missions with rovers to land it gets more complicated. On Mars, the atmospheric density is just 1% of Earth's and there are no oceans for the spacecraft to safely splash into. The blunt shape of the spacecraft alone is not enough to reduce the speed. Previously, successful missions have used extra measures. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft used parachutes to decelerate, while relying on a unique airbag system that sprang into action in the final few seconds to absorb the landing shock. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed successfully on Mars with the same technique. A few years later, Curiosity rover used a new landing system. In the final few seconds, rockets were fired, allowing the spacecraft to hover while a tether - a skycrane - lowered the rover to the dusty Martian surface. This new system demonstrated delivery of a heavy payload to Mars and paved the way for bigger missions. More recently, the Perseverance rover, which landed in early 2021, used the the reliable skycrane as well as two more advanced technologies. These new features, which used live images taken from its cameras, enabled a more accurate, reliable and safer landing. Zhurong: the 'fire-god': The Chinese Tianwen-1 rover landing is the next Mars mission. The ambitious mission has orbiting, landing and roving components - the first mission to include all three on its first attempt. It has already been circling the red planet since it entered Mars' orbit on February 24 and will attempt to land its rover Zhurong - which means \"fire god\" - in mid May. In size, Zhurong falls between Spirit and Perseverance and it is carrying six pieces of scientific equipment. After landing, Zhurong will survey the surroundings to study Martian soil, geomorphology and atmosphere, and will look for signs of subsurface water ice. Traditionally, the Chinese authorities don't reveal a lot of information before the event. However, based on an early overview of the mission by some Chinese researchers, we know the landing sequence the spacecraft will attempt to follow. On May 17, Zhurong - protected by an aeroshell - will enter the atmosphere at a speed of 4 km/s about 9,000 mph. When it slows down enough, parachutes will be deployed. In the last phase of the sequence, rockets with variable thrust engines will be used for further deceleration. In contrast with its American counterpart, Tianwen-1 will employ two reliable technologies: a laser range finder to work out where it is relative to Martian terrain and a microwave sensor to determine its speed more accurately. These will be used for navigational correction during its parachuted descent phase. During the powered descent phase at the end, optical and Lidar imaging will assist in hazard detection. Just before touchdown, an automated obstacle avoidance sequence will begin for soft landing. If the mission is successful, China will be the first country to land a rover on Mars in its first attempt. A few days after that, Zhurong will be ready to explore the surface.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/chinese-mars-spacecraf-zhurong-may2021-land-attempt/"}, {"title": "China's Zhurong Mars rover touches down on the red planet", "date": "2021-05-14", "content": "China's space program took a major leap today when it successfully landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, **** marking the country's first landing on another planet. Teams will now prepare to roll the rover off its landing platform and onto the dusty Martian surface to begin a mission to search for evidence of water and hints of past life. The touchdown makes China the second country in history to deposit a rover on the surface of Mars. After months in orbit around the red planet, the Tianwen-1 spacecraft released the Zhurong rover for a landing in Utopia Planitia, a vast plain that may once have been covered by an ancient Martian ocean. The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet's surface conditions. China's rover could make additional important discoveries concerning water and past habitability on the planet, paving the way for future human missions to Mars. \"Landing safely on Mars is a huge challenge, especially for China's first soft landing attempt,\" Long Xiao, a planetary scientist at the China University of Geosciences, said before the safe touchdown. \"But it is a necessary step for Mars and deep-space exploration.\" ## **A harrowing descent** Successfully descending to the surface of Mars is an extraordinary challenge. Before today, only NASA had safely landed and operated spacecraft on the Martian surface; in 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander transmitted half of a photo before falling silent about 100 seconds into the mission. By landing and roving on Mars, China jumps ahead of a number of spacefaring peers. The Zhurong rover made it through the so-called \"seven minutes of terror,\" the time from atmospheric entry to landing on the surface. The China National Space Administration could only watch the autonomous landing unfold from nearly 200 million miles away-so far away that it takes 18 minutes to receive a signal from Mars-and hope everything went to plan. Zhurong sat attached to its orbiter companion, encased in an aeroshell designed to protect the vehicle on its way through the Martian atmosphere. After it was released and endured a fiery atmospheric entry, a huge parachute deployed to further slow the rover's descent. Then a landing platform holding the rover fired up rocket engines to make the final descent to the surface. A laser range \ufb01nder and 3D scanner provided altitude and terrain data while cameras were used to autonomously choose a place to land. China successfully set down a robotic lander and deployed its first lunar rover in 2013 as part of its Chang'e-3 mission to the moon. Mosaic of 61 images by Andrew Bodrov, 360pano, with photographs from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Space Administration, The Science and Application Center for Moon and Deepspace Exploration Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Mars is significantly harder to land on than the moon, says Michel Blanc at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France. But China has had a series of successful lunar missions that prepared it for a Mars landing. Chang'e-4, history's first landing on the lunar far side in 2019, required \"high technological capacity\" in artificial intelligence and autonomous hazard avoidance, Blanc notes. As well, the rocket engines on Zhurong are similar to those China used to safely land three spacecraft on the moon. Those technologies, along with the supersonic parachutes China has used to return astronauts from Earth orbit in space capsules, set up CNSA to pull off a Martian touchdown. A new rover on Mars: Once Zhurong's six wheels roll off the landing platform and onto the Martian dust, the rover will expand its foldable, butterfly-like solar panels and explore the area for a primary mission lasting three months. The vehicle could work well beyond this conservative goal however-the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers had primary missions of about 90 days, and they each ended up exploring Mars for years. Utopia Planitia, thought to be the site of an ancient sea, has sedimentary layers that could contain evidence of past water. Even more exciting, these layers of rock could contain traces of any past life on Mars, says James Head III, a planetary scientist at Brown University. \"Because the pre-selected landing site is close to an ancient ocean shoreline, and distinct from others, the science data will uncover more secrets of Mars,\" Long says. The site complements the research being carried out by NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in the ancient lakes of Gale and Jezero craters, respectively, Head adds. The Zhurong rover carries a suite of six instruments. A pair of panoramic cameras and a multispectral imager will provide information about the terrain and its composition, while an instrument with a laser will vaporize rocks to analyze their makeup, similar to the laser spectrometers aboard Curiosity and Perseverance. A magnetometer will measure magnetic fields in tandem with an instrument on the orbiter, and a climate station will measure the local atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, and sound on Mars. One of the most exciting instruments aboard the rover, however, is a ground- penetrating radar, which will be used to search for pockets of water or ice below the surface. Head notes that NASA's Viking 2 lander, which set down in a region slightly north of Zhurong's landing site in 1975, imaged fascinating phenomena, including ice contractions and frosts on the surface of Mars, and polygon patterned terrain which may have been created by contractions of subsurface ice with changing seasons. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar will ping the surface with two different frequencies and pick up echo data from layers below, peering down to 33 feet to search for ices or briny waters underground. \"Tianwen-1 is likely to be able to explore and detect any subsurface snow and ice using its payload,\" Head says. Such pockets of ice could prove valuable for future crewed missions, and any pockets of water or brine, shielded from radiation on the surface, may provide habitats for simple lifeforms. The next chapter of Chinese space exploration: China will openly share the data from Tianwen-1 and Zhurong the same way it has shared data from its lunar exploration missions, Long says, benefiting planetary scientists around the world. The mission will also set the stage for China's next planned voyage to Mars-an audacious sample-return attempt scheduled to launch around 2028. Beyond Mars, the country has plans to launch a Jupiter probe, including a possible landing on the moon Callisto, to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, and to send a pair of Voyager-like spacecraft toward the edges of the solar system. \"In the age of ocean exploration, China has a history of Zheng He's voyages to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" says Zhang Xiaoping, associate professor at the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences of the Macau University of Science and Technology, referring to early 15th-century expeditions. Zhang views China's Mars mission as a continuation of these Ming Dynasty journeys. Tianwen-1 and Zhurong, he says, are \"of great significance for studying the unknown universe, stimulating the scientific enthusiasm of young people, stimulating the creativity of the whole country, enhancing the ability to explore the unknown, and expanding the living space of humanity.\"", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/china-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission"}, {"title": "China confirms probe lands on Mars, Zhurong rover to begin exploration", "date": "2021-05-15", "content": "China confirmed the Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars and Zhurong rover began its exploration to the red planet early Saturday.

Released by CNSA on Sunday, June 27, the footage shows the parachute deployment, descent, and landing, the deployment of the Zhurong rover to the surface, as well as a sweet shot of the six-wheeled vehicle backing away from its wireless camera. Launched in July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission - China's first to the Red Planet - arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021. The first video chronicles the landing on May 15 and presents views taken from three different cameras. Similar to NASA's footage of the Perseverance landing earlier this year, the video shows the parachute deployment and the backshell separation. The rover's obstacle avoidance camera was used to record the landing itself. Media captured during the mission are relayed to Earth using the Tianwen-1 satellite, currently in orbit around Mars. The second video is neat in that it includes both visuals and audio. The rover can be seen - and heard - driving down a ramp as it exits the landing platform to reach the Martian surface, which it did on May 22. The footage was captured by the rover's front and rear avoidance cameras, and the audio was recorded by a microphone that will be used to study the Martian \"environment and condition, such as atmospheric density and other parameters on the planet,\" explained Liu Jizhong, deputy commander of the Mars exploration program, in the South China Morning Post. The sound of Zhurong \"moving away mainly comes from the driving mechanism, the friction between the wheels and the ramp, and the friction between the wheels and the ground,\" according to a CNSA statement. The sound is quite muted, reminiscent of audio captured during flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter. Sound waves have barely any atmosphere to work with on Mars, hence the muffled audio. The third video was taken just prior to a neat selfie that shows both Zhurong and the landing platform. After depositing the wireless camera onto the surface, the rover can be seen retreating as it heads back toward the lander in preparation for the selfie. As of today, Zhurong has been working on Mars for 42 Martian days and has travelled a total of 236 metres. Both the orbiter and Zhurong are in \"good working condition,\" according to CNSA.

Recently, the China National Space Administration has landed its first rover on Mars, and begun to explore the surface of the red planet. It's a huge step, and something only previously achieved successfully by NASA. Let's take a look at the Chinese project, its goals, and see how it compares to the American rovers that have also roamed so far away. Wheelin' on Mars: China's first Mars rover goes by the name of Zhurong, named after a figure in Chinese mythology that is typically associated with fire. Given that Mars is known as the \"Planet of Fire\" in China, it's a fitting name selected by a public vote held earlier this year. The rover comes in at a size of 2.6 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.85 meters high, with its size placing it in between NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers which landed in 2004, and the later Curiosity rover which is a touch larger. The Zhurong rover weighs 240 kilograms, again placing it in between the two recent generations of NASA Mars rovers. Zhurong was launched as part of the Tianwen-1 mission which launched on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft entered Martian orbit on February 10, 2021, with the lander touching down on 14 May 2021 in the Utopia Planitia. The area on Mars was chosen as an ideal spot to investigate the possibility of the planet being host to an ancient ocean. The descent was controlled by parachutes and retro- rockets which slowed the lander as it approached the surface. What Lies Beneath: The rover sports a sensor package designed to perform a variety of science missions. Chief among those is the ground-penetrating radar, designed to collect geological data and capable of imaging up to 100 meters below the Martian surface. This goes far deeper than the 10 meter depth capability of the instrument fitted to the Perseverance rover which landed earlier this year. There's also a magnetometer onboard for determining the finer details of Mars's magnetic field. Atmospheric data is captured by measuring temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction in the Martian atmosphere. There's also a microphone which captures sound, which tends to have a different quality to that on Earth due to the different atmospheric conditions. Analysis and Imaging Hardware: Similarly to other rovers, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument is included. For those who aren't deeply involved in the spectroscopy subculture, this is a device which blasts rock and other samples with a laser and measures the emitted light. This can be used to determine the chemical makeup of samples. Camera-wise, a multi-spectral camera is fitted which aims to research the details around the existence of water on Mars. There are also extra cameras specifically intended for navigational purposes and for mapping out the topography of the surrounding area. These are key to the rover's mission, as communication time delays from Earth to Mars make direct teleoperation of the rover impossible. Cameras are instead used to enable the rover to take some level of autonomy in getting around its immediate area. Some of the rover's science hardware is eclipsed by that present on Perseverance, such as the fancier spectrometers on board, but overall it's a very complete science package. Zhurong's primary goals of studying Martian geology and soil, as well as the atmosphere, should reveal useful insights into the makeup of Mars as well as its history. One unique feature of the rover is its active suspension system. Unlike the passive rocker-bogie suspension system used on NASA rovers, Zhurong has fully independent control of each wheel's suspension. It can adjust the weight placed on each wheel, which could be particularly useful if the rover finds itself encountering softer soils, and could also assist in navigating obstacles or steeper slopes. The Mission Thus Far: China has recently released images of the rover on Mars, taken by a selfie camera that was dropped for that very purpose. The images document Zhurong rolling away from the camera as it begins to explore its landing site. Thus far, the rover has spent over a month on Mars, and has travelled 236 meters since landing. It is expected to spend 90 days studying the Martian surface, though it's common for rover missions to be extended if the hardware continues functioning past the original timeline. As an example, NASA's Opportunity rover ended up exploring the planet for 14 years despite originally being intended to operate for just 90 days. The video released of the rover and its lander don't show a lot of action yet, but we look forward to more images and more science coming out of the project. More rovers on Mars can only mean more learning, though we're a touch disappointed that thus far, they've all landed far apart and don't get to hang out. Perhaps one day, two rovers will meet; for now, with only six on the Martian surface, that's likely quite some time away!

China's Tianwen-1 mission, consisting of an orbiter, a lander, and a rover, was launched on July 23, 2020. The lander carrying the rover landed in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a vast plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars, on May 15 this year.

The name indicates Chinese people's blessing for the rover to ignite the flame of China's planetary exploration. The rover is 1.85 meters high and weighs about 240 kilograms, with a designed life span of three Martian months - equivalent to about 92 Earth days. It will probe the composition of the Martian surface, the distribution of materials, the geological structure and the meteorological environment. China launched Tianwen-1 probe on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, entered the parking orbit of Mars after performing an orbital maneuver on February 24. The probe has acquired high-definition image data of the pre-selected landing area through multiple imaging. It will carry out follow-up work as scheduled, which includes the analysis of the topography and meteorological environment of the landing area, as part of the preparations for its landing on the Mars surface in mid-to-late May. The Tianwen-1 mission is China's first step in independent planetary exploration of the solar system. It aims to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission.

In February, both the UAE Space Agency's Hope probe and China's Tianwen-1 entered Mars' orbit. On February 19, NASA landed the Perseverance rover with its companion, the Ingenuity helicopter, both of which have been setting new milestones since. The next visitor to the planet will be Tianwen-1 mission's rover Zhurong, which will attempt to reach the surface of Mars in mid-May. To enter the Martian atmosphere, it will use a slightly different technique from previous missions. Landing on Mars is notoriously dangerous. More missions have failed than succeeded. A successful Mars landing requires entering the atmosphere at very high speeds, then slowing the spacecraft down just the right way as it approaches its landing location. This phase of the mission, known as entry-descent-landing, is the most critical. Previous missions have used several different ways of Martian atmospheric entry. Perfecting entry to Mars's atmosphere has been helped by the experience of returning spacecraft to Earth. Earth may have a significantly different atmosphere from Mars, but the principles remain the same. A spacecraft orbiting a planet will be moving very fast, to keep itself bound to that orbit. But if the spacecraft entered an atmosphere at such high speed, even one as thin as Mars's, it would burn up. Anything entering the atmosphere needs to be slowed down significantly and to get rid of the heat generated during this brief journey. There are several ways to go about it. Spacecraft are protected from the heat generated during atmospheric entry using heat shields. Various missions in the past have used techniques such as absorbing heat, an insulating coating, reflecting the heat back into atmosphere or by ablation, burning up the shield material. From Apollo missions of 1960s to the more recent SpaceX's Dragon, these techniques have been used successfully, and they work really well for Earth. But when it comes to Mars, engineers need to employ some additional measures. Landing on Mars: Orbiters are designed to monitor a planet's surface from the orbit and act as a communications relay station. When approaching a planet, the spacecraft is usually directed along successively smaller elliptical orbits, slowing down each time, until it reaches its target orbit. This technique can also be used to lower the orbit of a spacecraft ahead of a lander's atmospheric entry. The entire maneuver occurs over a few months and doesn't need any additional equipment: an efficient way to conserve fuel. Since it uses the planet's upper atmosphere to apply brakes, it's called as aerobraking. Aerobraking has been used for various Mars missions including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Aerobraking can significantly slow down the spacecraft, but for missions with rovers to land it gets more complicated. On Mars, the atmospheric density is just 1% of Earth's and there are no oceans for the spacecraft to safely splash into. The blunt shape of the spacecraft alone is not enough to reduce the speed. Previously, successful missions have used extra measures. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft used parachutes to decelerate, while relying on a unique airbag system that sprang into action in the final few seconds to absorb the landing shock. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed successfully on Mars with the same technique. A few years later, Curiosity rover used a new landing system. In the final few seconds, rockets were fired, allowing the spacecraft to hover while a tether - a skycrane - lowered the rover to the dusty Martian surface. This new system demonstrated delivery of a heavy payload to Mars and paved the way for bigger missions. More recently, the Perseverance rover, which landed in early 2021, used the the reliable skycrane as well as two more advanced technologies. These new features, which used live images taken from its cameras, enabled a more accurate, reliable and safer landing. Zhurong: the 'fire-god': The Chinese Tianwen-1 rover landing is the next Mars mission. The ambitious mission has orbiting, landing and roving components - the first mission to include all three on its first attempt. It has already been circling the red planet since it entered Mars' orbit on February 24 and will attempt to land its rover Zhurong - which means \"fire god\" - in mid May. In size, Zhurong falls between Spirit and Perseverance and it is carrying six pieces of scientific equipment. After landing, Zhurong will survey the surroundings to study Martian soil, geomorphology and atmosphere, and will look for signs of subsurface water ice. Traditionally, the Chinese authorities don't reveal a lot of information before the event. However, based on an early overview of the mission by some Chinese researchers, we know the landing sequence the spacecraft will attempt to follow. On May 17, Zhurong - protected by an aeroshell - will enter the atmosphere at a speed of 4 km/s about 9,000 mph. When it slows down enough, parachutes will be deployed. In the last phase of the sequence, rockets with variable thrust engines will be used for further deceleration. In contrast with its American counterpart, Tianwen-1 will employ two reliable technologies: a laser range finder to work out where it is relative to Martian terrain and a microwave sensor to determine its speed more accurately. These will be used for navigational correction during its parachuted descent phase. During the powered descent phase at the end, optical and Lidar imaging will assist in hazard detection. Just before touchdown, an automated obstacle avoidance sequence will begin for soft landing. If the mission is successful, China will be the first country to land a rover on Mars in its first attempt. A few days after that, Zhurong will be ready to explore the surface.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/chinese-mars-spacecraf-zhurong-may2021-land-attempt/"}, {"title": "China's Zhurong Mars rover touches down on the red planet", "date": "2021-05-14", "content": "China's space program took a major leap today when it successfully landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, **** marking the country's first landing on another planet. Teams will now prepare to roll the rover off its landing platform and onto the dusty Martian surface to begin a mission to search for evidence of water and hints of past life. The touchdown makes China the second country in history to deposit a rover on the surface of Mars. After months in orbit around the red planet, the Tianwen-1 spacecraft released the Zhurong rover for a landing in Utopia Planitia, a vast plain that may once have been covered by an ancient Martian ocean. The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet's surface conditions. China's rover could make additional important discoveries concerning water and past habitability on the planet, paving the way for future human missions to Mars. \"Landing safely on Mars is a huge challenge, especially for China's first soft landing attempt,\" Long Xiao, a planetary scientist at the China University of Geosciences, said before the safe touchdown. \"But it is a necessary step for Mars and deep-space exploration.\" ## **A harrowing descent** Successfully descending to the surface of Mars is an extraordinary challenge. Before today, only NASA had safely landed and operated spacecraft on the Martian surface; in 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander transmitted half of a photo before falling silent about 100 seconds into the mission. By landing and roving on Mars, China jumps ahead of a number of spacefaring peers. The Zhurong rover made it through the so-called \"seven minutes of terror,\" the time from atmospheric entry to landing on the surface. The China National Space Administration could only watch the autonomous landing unfold from nearly 200 million miles away-so far away that it takes 18 minutes to receive a signal from Mars-and hope everything went to plan. Zhurong sat attached to its orbiter companion, encased in an aeroshell designed to protect the vehicle on its way through the Martian atmosphere. After it was released and endured a fiery atmospheric entry, a huge parachute deployed to further slow the rover's descent. Then a landing platform holding the rover fired up rocket engines to make the final descent to the surface. A laser range \ufb01nder and 3D scanner provided altitude and terrain data while cameras were used to autonomously choose a place to land. China successfully set down a robotic lander and deployed its first lunar rover in 2013 as part of its Chang'e-3 mission to the moon. Mosaic of 61 images by Andrew Bodrov, 360pano, with photographs from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Space Administration, The Science and Application Center for Moon and Deepspace Exploration Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Mars is significantly harder to land on than the moon, says Michel Blanc at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France. But China has had a series of successful lunar missions that prepared it for a Mars landing. Chang'e-4, history's first landing on the lunar far side in 2019, required \"high technological capacity\" in artificial intelligence and autonomous hazard avoidance, Blanc notes. As well, the rocket engines on Zhurong are similar to those China used to safely land three spacecraft on the moon. Those technologies, along with the supersonic parachutes China has used to return astronauts from Earth orbit in space capsules, set up CNSA to pull off a Martian touchdown. A new rover on Mars: Once Zhurong's six wheels roll off the landing platform and onto the Martian dust, the rover will expand its foldable, butterfly-like solar panels and explore the area for a primary mission lasting three months. The vehicle could work well beyond this conservative goal however-the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers had primary missions of about 90 days, and they each ended up exploring Mars for years. Utopia Planitia, thought to be the site of an ancient sea, has sedimentary layers that could contain evidence of past water. Even more exciting, these layers of rock could contain traces of any past life on Mars, says James Head III, a planetary scientist at Brown University. \"Because the pre-selected landing site is close to an ancient ocean shoreline, and distinct from others, the science data will uncover more secrets of Mars,\" Long says. The site complements the research being carried out by NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in the ancient lakes of Gale and Jezero craters, respectively, Head adds. The Zhurong rover carries a suite of six instruments. A pair of panoramic cameras and a multispectral imager will provide information about the terrain and its composition, while an instrument with a laser will vaporize rocks to analyze their makeup, similar to the laser spectrometers aboard Curiosity and Perseverance. A magnetometer will measure magnetic fields in tandem with an instrument on the orbiter, and a climate station will measure the local atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, and sound on Mars. One of the most exciting instruments aboard the rover, however, is a ground- penetrating radar, which will be used to search for pockets of water or ice below the surface. Head notes that NASA's Viking 2 lander, which set down in a region slightly north of Zhurong's landing site in 1975, imaged fascinating phenomena, including ice contractions and frosts on the surface of Mars, and polygon patterned terrain which may have been created by contractions of subsurface ice with changing seasons. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar will ping the surface with two different frequencies and pick up echo data from layers below, peering down to 33 feet to search for ices or briny waters underground. \"Tianwen-1 is likely to be able to explore and detect any subsurface snow and ice using its payload,\" Head says. Such pockets of ice could prove valuable for future crewed missions, and any pockets of water or brine, shielded from radiation on the surface, may provide habitats for simple lifeforms. The next chapter of Chinese space exploration: China will openly share the data from Tianwen-1 and Zhurong the same way it has shared data from its lunar exploration missions, Long says, benefiting planetary scientists around the world. The mission will also set the stage for China's next planned voyage to Mars-an audacious sample-return attempt scheduled to launch around 2028. Beyond Mars, the country has plans to launch a Jupiter probe, including a possible landing on the moon Callisto, to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, and to send a pair of Voyager-like spacecraft toward the edges of the solar system. \"In the age of ocean exploration, China has a history of Zheng He's voyages to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" says Zhang Xiaoping, associate professor at the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences of the Macau University of Science and Technology, referring to early 15th-century expeditions. Zhang views China's Mars mission as a continuation of these Ming Dynasty journeys. Tianwen-1 and Zhurong, he says, are \"of great significance for studying the unknown universe, stimulating the scientific enthusiasm of young people, stimulating the creativity of the whole country, enhancing the ability to explore the unknown, and expanding the living space of humanity.\"", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/china-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission"}, {"title": "China confirms probe lands on Mars, Zhurong rover to begin exploration", "date": "2021-05-15", "content": "China confirmed the Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars and Zhurong rover began its exploration to the red planet early Saturday.

Released by CNSA on Sunday, June 27, the footage shows the parachute deployment, descent, and landing, the deployment of the Zhurong rover to the surface, as well as a sweet shot of the six-wheeled vehicle backing away from its wireless camera. Launched in July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission - China's first to the Red Planet - arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021. The first video chronicles the landing on May 15 and presents views taken from three different cameras. Similar to NASA's footage of the Perseverance landing earlier this year, the video shows the parachute deployment and the backshell separation. The rover's obstacle avoidance camera was used to record the landing itself. Media captured during the mission are relayed to Earth using the Tianwen-1 satellite, currently in orbit around Mars. The second video is neat in that it includes both visuals and audio. The rover can be seen - and heard - driving down a ramp as it exits the landing platform to reach the Martian surface, which it did on May 22. The footage was captured by the rover's front and rear avoidance cameras, and the audio was recorded by a microphone that will be used to study the Martian \"environment and condition, such as atmospheric density and other parameters on the planet,\" explained Liu Jizhong, deputy commander of the Mars exploration program, in the South China Morning Post. The sound of Zhurong \"moving away mainly comes from the driving mechanism, the friction between the wheels and the ramp, and the friction between the wheels and the ground,\" according to a CNSA statement. The sound is quite muted, reminiscent of audio captured during flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter. Sound waves have barely any atmosphere to work with on Mars, hence the muffled audio. The third video was taken just prior to a neat selfie that shows both Zhurong and the landing platform. After depositing the wireless camera onto the surface, the rover can be seen retreating as it heads back toward the lander in preparation for the selfie.

Recently, the China National Space Administration has landed its first rover on Mars, and begun to explore the surface of the red planet. It's a huge step, and something only previously achieved successfully by NASA. Let's take a look at the Chinese project, its goals, and see how it compares to the American rovers that have also roamed so far away. Wheelin' on Mars: China's first Mars rover goes by the name of Zhurong, named after a figure in Chinese mythology that is typically associated with fire. Given that Mars is known as the \"Planet of Fire\" in China, it's a fitting name selected by a public vote held earlier this year. The rover comes in at a size of 2.6 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.85 meters high, with its size placing it in between NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers which landed in 2004, and the later Curiosity rover which is a touch larger. The Zhurong rover weighs 240 kilograms, again placing it in between the two recent generations of NASA Mars rovers. Zhurong was launched as part of the Tianwen-1 mission which launched on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft entered Martian orbit on February 10, 2021, with the lander touching down on 14 May 2021 in the Utopia Planitia. The area on Mars was chosen as an ideal spot to investigate the possibility of the planet being host to an ancient ocean. The descent was controlled by parachutes and retro- rockets which slowed the lander as it approached the surface. What Lies Beneath: The rover sports a sensor package designed to perform a variety of science missions. Chief among those is the ground-penetrating radar, designed to collect geological data and capable of imaging up to 100 meters below the Martian surface. This goes far deeper than the 10 meter depth capability of the instrument fitted to the Perseverance rover which landed earlier this year. There's also a magnetometer onboard for determining the finer details of Mars's magnetic field. Atmospheric data is captured by measuring temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction in the Martian atmosphere. There's also a microphone which captures sound, which tends to have a different quality to that on Earth due to the different atmospheric conditions. Analysis and Imaging Hardware: Similarly to other rovers, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument is included. For those who aren't deeply involved in the spectroscopy subculture, this is a device which blasts rock and other samples with a laser and measures the emitted light. This can be used to determine the chemical makeup of samples. Camera-wise, a multi-spectral camera is fitted which aims to research the details around the existence of water on Mars. There are also extra cameras specifically intended for navigational purposes and for mapping out the topography of the surrounding area. These are key to the rover's mission, as communication time delays from Earth to Mars make direct teleoperation of the rover impossible. Cameras are instead used to enable the rover to take some level of autonomy in getting around its immediate area. Some of the rover's science hardware is eclipsed by that present on Perseverance, such as the fancier spectrometers on board, but overall it's a very complete science package. Zhurong's primary goals of studying Martian geology and soil, as well as the atmosphere, should reveal useful insights into the makeup of Mars as well as its history. One unique feature of the rover is its active suspension system. Unlike the passive rocker-bogie suspension system used on NASA rovers, Zhurong has fully independent control of each wheel's suspension. It can adjust the weight placed on each wheel, which could be particularly useful if the rover finds itself encountering softer soils, and could also assist in navigating obstacles or steeper slopes. The Mission Thus Far: China has recently released images of the rover on Mars, taken by a selfie camera that was dropped for that very purpose. The images document Zhurong rolling away from the camera as it begins to explore its landing site. Thus far, the rover has spent over a month on Mars, and has travelled 236 meters since landing. It is expected to spend 90 days studying the Martian surface, though it's common for rover missions to be extended if the hardware continues functioning past the original timeline. As an example, NASA's Opportunity rover ended up exploring the planet for 14 years despite originally being intended to operate for just 90 days. The video released of the rover and its lander don't show a lot of action yet, but we look forward to more images and more science coming out of the project. More rovers on Mars can only mean more learning, though we're a touch disappointed that thus far, they've all landed far apart and don't get to hang out. Perhaps one day, two rovers will meet; for now, with only six on the Martian surface, that's likely quite some time away!

Zhurong completed its 90-sol mission in Mars' Utopia Planitia on Aug. 15, according to the China National Space Administration. Since landing on May 14, the rover has taken selfies with its landing platform and driven 2,917 feet across the surface, visiting its own discarded landing equipment and analyzing different rocks, dunes and other features as it went. New images from the rover show the terrain that it most recently reached. Zhurong will continue to cross this area, which is thought to be below the shoreline of an ancient ocean in southern Utopia Planitia. CNSA says Zhurong's six scientific instruments are working well and that the rover has, with the help of the Tianwen 1 orbiter acting as a relay, sent back 10 gigabytes of raw science data. That information could help scientists better understand Mars and its history, Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the Tianwen 1 ground application system, told CCTV. \"Hopefully, by providing these data to our scientists, we can get a deeper understanding of the geology of Mars, and then even see if we can find evidence of the existence of an ancient ocean in Utopia Planitia,\" Liu said. The Tianwen 1 orbiter has been passing over Zhurong's position once a day to relay data back home. Both spacecraft will go into safe mode from mid- September through late October, however, because of a solar conjunction preventing communications between Earth and Mars. With Mars on the far side of the sun from Earth, our view of the Red Planet is obscured by the sun. Charged particles given off by the star interfere with radio communications between the planets, meaning Zhurong will need to operate autonomously, and in a limited capacity, for safety reasons. NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers will also be operating on their own between Oct. 2 and Oct.14 for the same reason. When fully active again, Zhurong will continue toward a feature described as a \"groove\" just over 1 mile away. \"If it is possible for us to see from the top to the bottom of the groove, or if there are disparities of rock types and compositions, we could learn about what has happened in its geological history. So, this is what we're going to focus on in the near future,\" Liu said. TIanwen 1, meanwhile, will sometime after the conjunction switch its orbit to allow it to begin a global survey of Mars with its own seven science payloads. Teams are devising an orbit that will allow the orbiter to begin its own detections while still assisting Zhurong, which has only limited data transmission capabilities. Tianwen 1 launched in July 2020 and is China's first independent interplanetary mission. The spacecraft entered Mars orbit in February of this year, and Zhurong separated from the orbiter and made its successful landing in May.

Since its arrival on the surface, the Zhurong rover has obtained about 10 gigabytes of primary data and has moved close to a kilometre. It first touched down cocooned inside the lander on May 15 and separated from its landing platform a week later. \"The rover will suspend its operations from mid-September to late-October due to the anticipated disruption of its communications with Earth caused by solar electromagnetic radiation, and will then resume its mission,\" Sun Zezhou, head designer of the Tianwen 1 probe said in a statement.

In February, both the UAE Space Agency's Hope probe and China's Tianwen-1 entered Mars' orbit. On February 19, NASA landed the Perseverance rover with its companion, the Ingenuity helicopter, both of which have been setting new milestones since. The next visitor to the planet will be Tianwen-1 mission's rover Zhurong, which will attempt to reach the surface of Mars in mid-May. To enter the Martian atmosphere, it will use a slightly different technique from previous missions. Landing on Mars is notoriously dangerous. More missions have failed than succeeded. A successful Mars landing requires entering the atmosphere at very high speeds, then slowing the spacecraft down just the right way as it approaches its landing location. This phase of the mission, known as entry-descent-landing, is the most critical. Previous missions have used several different ways of Martian atmospheric entry. Perfecting entry to Mars's atmosphere has been helped by the experience of returning spacecraft to Earth. Earth may have a significantly different atmosphere from Mars, but the principles remain the same. A spacecraft orbiting a planet will be moving very fast, to keep itself bound to that orbit. But if the spacecraft entered an atmosphere at such high speed, even one as thin as Mars's, it would burn up. Anything entering the atmosphere needs to be slowed down significantly and to get rid of the heat generated during this brief journey. There are several ways to go about it. Spacecraft are protected from the heat generated during atmospheric entry using heat shields. Various missions in the past have used techniques such as absorbing heat, an insulating coating, reflecting the heat back into atmosphere or by ablation, burning up the shield material. From Apollo missions of 1960s to the more recent SpaceX's Dragon, these techniques have been used successfully, and they work really well for Earth. But when it comes to Mars, engineers need to employ some additional measures. Landing on Mars: Orbiters are designed to monitor a planet's surface from the orbit and act as a communications relay station. When approaching a planet, the spacecraft is usually directed along successively smaller elliptical orbits, slowing down each time, until it reaches its target orbit. This technique can also be used to lower the orbit of a spacecraft ahead of a lander's atmospheric entry. The entire maneuver occurs over a few months and doesn't need any additional equipment: an efficient way to conserve fuel. Since it uses the planet's upper atmosphere to apply brakes, it's called as aerobraking. Aerobraking has been used for various Mars missions including ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Aerobraking can significantly slow down the spacecraft, but for missions with rovers to land it gets more complicated. On Mars, the atmospheric density is just 1% of Earth's and there are no oceans for the spacecraft to safely splash into. The blunt shape of the spacecraft alone is not enough to reduce the speed. Previously, successful missions have used extra measures. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft used parachutes to decelerate, while relying on a unique airbag system that sprang into action in the final few seconds to absorb the landing shock. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed successfully on Mars with the same technique. A few years later, Curiosity rover used a new landing system. In the final few seconds, rockets were fired, allowing the spacecraft to hover while a tether - a skycrane - lowered the rover to the dusty Martian surface. This new system demonstrated delivery of a heavy payload to Mars and paved the way for bigger missions. More recently, the Perseverance rover, which landed in early 2021, used the the reliable skycrane as well as two more advanced technologies. These new features, which used live images taken from its cameras, enabled a more accurate, reliable and safer landing. Zhurong: the 'fire-god': The Chinese Tianwen-1 rover landing is the next Mars mission. The ambitious mission has orbiting, landing and roving components - the first mission to include all three on its first attempt. It has already been circling the red planet since it entered Mars' orbit on February 24 and will attempt to land its rover Zhurong - which means \"fire god\" - in mid May. In size, Zhurong falls between Spirit and Perseverance and it is carrying six pieces of scientific equipment. After landing, Zhurong will survey the surroundings to study Martian soil, geomorphology and atmosphere, and will look for signs of subsurface water ice. Traditionally, the Chinese authorities don't reveal a lot of information before the event. However, based on an early overview of the mission by some Chinese researchers, we know the landing sequence the spacecraft will attempt to follow. On May 17, Zhurong - protected by an aeroshell - will enter the atmosphere at a speed of 4 km/s about 9,000 mph. When it slows down enough, parachutes will be deployed. In the last phase of the sequence, rockets with variable thrust engines will be used for further deceleration. In contrast with its American counterpart, Tianwen-1 will employ two reliable technologies: a laser range finder to work out where it is relative to Martian terrain and a microwave sensor to determine its speed more accurately. These will be used for navigational correction during its parachuted descent phase. During the powered descent phase at the end, optical and Lidar imaging will assist in hazard detection. Just before touchdown, an automated obstacle avoidance sequence will begin for soft landing. If the mission is successful, China will be the first country to land a rover on Mars in its first attempt. A few days after that, Zhurong will be ready to explore the surface.", "url": "https://earthsky.org/space/chinese-mars-spacecraf-zhurong-may2021-land-attempt/"}, {"title": "China's Zhurong Mars rover touches down on the red planet", "date": "2021-05-14", "content": "China's space program took a major leap today when it successfully landed the Zhurong rover on Mars, **** marking the country's first landing on another planet. Teams will now prepare to roll the rover off its landing platform and onto the dusty Martian surface to begin a mission to search for evidence of water and hints of past life. The touchdown makes China the second country in history to deposit a rover on the surface of Mars. After months in orbit around the red planet, the Tianwen-1 spacecraft released the Zhurong rover for a landing in Utopia Planitia, a vast plain that may once have been covered by an ancient Martian ocean. The 529-pound rover survived a perilous descent to the surface, including atmospheric entry, slowing from supersonic speeds with a parachute, and finally using retrorockets to safely alight on the ground. Named for an ancient Chinese fire god, the 529-pound Zhurong rover is similar in size to NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on the red planet in 2004 and sent back exciting images and data about the planet's surface conditions. China's rover could make additional important discoveries concerning water and past habitability on the planet, paving the way for future human missions to Mars. \"Landing safely on Mars is a huge challenge, especially for China's first soft landing attempt,\" Long Xiao, a planetary scientist at the China University of Geosciences, said before the safe touchdown. \"But it is a necessary step for Mars and deep-space exploration.\" ## **A harrowing descent** Successfully descending to the surface of Mars is an extraordinary challenge. Before today, only NASA had safely landed and operated spacecraft on the Martian surface; in 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 lander transmitted half of a photo before falling silent about 100 seconds into the mission. By landing and roving on Mars, China jumps ahead of a number of spacefaring peers. The Zhurong rover made it through the so-called \"seven minutes of terror,\" the time from atmospheric entry to landing on the surface. The China National Space Administration could only watch the autonomous landing unfold from nearly 200 million miles away-so far away that it takes 18 minutes to receive a signal from Mars-and hope everything went to plan. Zhurong sat attached to its orbiter companion, encased in an aeroshell designed to protect the vehicle on its way through the Martian atmosphere. After it was released and endured a fiery atmospheric entry, a huge parachute deployed to further slow the rover's descent. Then a landing platform holding the rover fired up rocket engines to make the final descent to the surface. A laser range \ufb01nder and 3D scanner provided altitude and terrain data while cameras were used to autonomously choose a place to land. China successfully set down a robotic lander and deployed its first lunar rover in 2013 as part of its Chang'e-3 mission to the moon.

Unauthorized use is prohibited. Mars is significantly harder to land on than the moon, says Michel Blanc at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France. But China has had a series of successful lunar missions that prepared it for a Mars landing. Chang'e-4, history's first landing on the lunar far side in 2019, required \"high technological capacity\" in artificial intelligence and autonomous hazard avoidance, Blanc notes. As well, the rocket engines on Zhurong are similar to those China used to safely land three spacecraft on the moon. Those technologies, along with the supersonic parachutes China has used to return astronauts from Earth orbit in space capsules, set up CNSA to pull off a Martian touchdown. A new rover on Mars: Once Zhurong's six wheels roll off the landing platform and onto the Martian dust, the rover will expand its foldable, butterfly-like solar panels and explore the area for a primary mission lasting three months. The vehicle could work well beyond this conservative goal however-the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity rovers had primary missions of about 90 days, and they each ended up exploring Mars for years. Utopia Planitia, thought to be the site of an ancient sea, has sedimentary layers that could contain evidence of past water. Even more exciting, these layers of rock could contain traces of any past life on Mars, says James Head III, a planetary scientist at Brown University. \"Because the pre-selected landing site is close to an ancient ocean shoreline, and distinct from others, the science data will uncover more secrets of Mars,\" Long says. The site complements the research being carried out by NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in the ancient lakes of Gale and Jezero craters, respectively, Head adds. The Zhurong rover carries a suite of six instruments. A pair of panoramic cameras and a multispectral imager will provide information about the terrain and its composition, while an instrument with a laser will vaporize rocks to analyze their makeup, similar to the laser spectrometers aboard Curiosity and Perseverance. A magnetometer will measure magnetic fields in tandem with an instrument on the orbiter, and a climate station will measure the local atmosphere, temperature, pressure, wind, and sound on Mars. One of the most exciting instruments aboard the rover, however, is a ground- penetrating radar, which will be used to search for pockets of water or ice below the surface. Head notes that NASA's Viking 2 lander, which set down in a region slightly north of Zhurong's landing site in 1975, imaged fascinating phenomena, including ice contractions and frosts on the surface of Mars, and polygon patterned terrain which may have been created by contractions of subsurface ice with changing seasons. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar will ping the surface with two different frequencies and pick up echo data from layers below, peering down to 33 feet to search for ices or briny waters underground. \"Tianwen-1 is likely to be able to explore and detect any subsurface snow and ice using its payload,\" Head says. Such pockets of ice could prove valuable for future crewed missions, and any pockets of water or brine, shielded from radiation on the surface, may provide habitats for simple lifeforms. The next chapter of Chinese space exploration: China will openly share the data from Tianwen-1 and Zhurong the same way it has shared data from its lunar exploration missions, Long says, benefiting planetary scientists around the world. The mission will also set the stage for China's next planned voyage to Mars-an audacious sample-return attempt scheduled to launch around 2028. Beyond Mars, the country has plans to launch a Jupiter probe, including a possible landing on the moon Callisto, to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, and to send a pair of Voyager-like spacecraft toward the edges of the solar system. \"In the age of ocean exploration, China has a history of Zheng He's voyages to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" says Zhang Xiaoping, associate professor at the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences of the Macau University of Science and Technology, referring to early 15th-century expeditions. Zhang views China's Mars mission as a continuation of these Ming Dynasty journeys. Tianwen-1 and Zhurong, he says, are \"of great significance for studying the unknown universe, stimulating the scientific enthusiasm of young people, stimulating the creativity of the whole country, enhancing the ability to explore the unknown, and expanding the living space of humanity.\"", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/china-landing-rover-on-mars-in-high-stakes-mission"}, {"title": "China confirms probe lands on Mars, Zhurong rover to begin exploration", "date": "2021-05-15", "content": "China confirmed the Tianwen-1 probe landed on Mars and Zhurong rover began its exploration to the red planet early Saturday.

Released by CNSA on Sunday, June 27, the footage shows the parachute deployment, descent, and landing, the deployment of the Zhurong rover to the surface, as well as a sweet shot of the six-wheeled vehicle backing away from its wireless camera. Launched in July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission - China's first to the Red Planet - arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021. The first video chronicles the landing on May 15 and presents views taken from three different cameras. Similar to NASA's footage of the Perseverance landing earlier this year, the video shows the parachute deployment and the backshell separation. The rover's obstacle avoidance camera was used to record the landing itself. Media captured during the mission are relayed to Earth using the Tianwen-1 satellite, currently in orbit around Mars. The second video is neat in that it includes both visuals and audio. The rover can be seen - and heard - driving down a ramp as it exits the landing platform to reach the Martian surface, which it did on May 22. The footage was captured by the rover's front and rear avoidance cameras, and the audio was recorded by a microphone that will be used to study the Martian \"environment and condition, such as atmospheric density and other parameters on the planet,\" explained Liu Jizhong, deputy commander of the Mars exploration program, in the South China Morning Post. The sound of Zhurong \"moving away mainly comes from the driving mechanism, the friction between the wheels and the ramp, and the friction between the wheels and the ground,\" according to a CNSA statement. The sound is quite muted, reminiscent of audio captured during flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter. Sound waves have barely any atmosphere to work with on Mars, hence the muffled audio. The third video was taken just prior to a neat selfie that shows both Zhurong and the landing platform. After depositing the wireless camera onto the surface, the rover can be seen retreating as it heads back toward the lander in preparation for the selfie. As of today, Zhurong has been working on Mars for 42 Martian days and has travelled a total of 236 metres. Both the orbiter and Zhurong are in \"good working condition,\" according to CNSA. The mission is expected to last 90 days, during which time the rover will study the Red Planet's geology, climate, regolith, and internal structure, in addition to searching for signs of subsurface water ice.

Recently, the China National Space Administration has landed its first rover on Mars, and begun to explore the surface of the red planet. It's a huge step, and something only previously achieved successfully by NASA. Let's take a look at the Chinese project, its goals, and see how it compares to the American rovers that have also roamed so far away. Wheelin' on Mars: China's first Mars rover goes by the name of Zhurong, named after a figure in Chinese mythology that is typically associated with fire. Given that Mars is known as the \"Planet of Fire\" in China, it's a fitting name selected by a public vote held earlier this year. The rover comes in at a size of 2.6 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.85 meters high, with its size placing it in between NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers which landed in 2004, and the later Curiosity rover which is a touch larger. The Zhurong rover weighs 240 kilograms, again placing it in between the two recent generations of NASA Mars rovers. Zhurong was launched as part of the Tianwen-1 mission which launched on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft entered Martian orbit on February 10, 2021, with the lander touching down on 14 May 2021 in the Utopia Planitia. The area on Mars was chosen as an ideal spot to investigate the possibility of the planet being host to an ancient ocean. The descent was controlled by parachutes and retro- rockets which slowed the lander as it approached the surface. What Lies Beneath: The rover sports a sensor package designed to perform a variety of science missions. Chief among those is the ground-penetrating radar, designed to collect geological data and capable of imaging up to 100 meters below the Martian surface. This goes far deeper than the 10 meter depth capability of the instrument fitted to the Perseverance rover which landed earlier this year. There's also a magnetometer onboard for determining the finer details of Mars's magnetic field. Atmospheric data is captured by measuring temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction in the Martian atmosphere. There's also a microphone which captures sound, which tends to have a different quality to that on Earth due to the different atmospheric conditions. Analysis and Imaging Hardware: Similarly to other rovers, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument is included. For those who aren't deeply involved in the spectroscopy subculture, this is a device which blasts rock and other samples with a laser and measures the emitted light. This can be used to determine the chemical makeup of samples. Camera-wise, a multi-spectral camera is fitted which aims to research the details around the existence of water on Mars. There are also extra cameras specifically intended for navigational purposes and for mapping out the topography of the surrounding area. These are key to the rover's mission, as communication time delays from Earth to Mars make direct teleoperation of the rover impossible. Cameras are instead used to enable the rover to take some level of autonomy in getting around its immediate area. Some of the rover's science hardware is eclipsed by that present on Perseverance, such as the fancier spectrometers on board, but overall it's a very complete science package. Zhurong's primary goals of studying Martian geology and soil, as well as the atmosphere, should reveal useful insights into the makeup of Mars as well as its history. One unique feature of the rover is its active suspension system. Unlike the passive rocker-bogie suspension system used on NASA rovers, Zhurong has fully independent control of each wheel's suspension. It can adjust the weight placed on each wheel, which could be particularly useful if the rover finds itself encountering softer soils, and could also assist in navigating obstacles or steeper slopes. The Mission Thus Far: China has recently released images of the rover on Mars, taken by a selfie camera that was dropped for that very purpose. The images document Zhurong rolling away from the camera as it begins to explore its landing site. Thus far, the rover has spent over a month on Mars, and has travelled 236 meters since landing. It is expected to spend 90 days studying the Martian surface, though it's common for rover missions to be extended if the hardware continues functioning past the original timeline. As an example, NASA's Opportunity rover ended up exploring the planet for 14 years despite originally being intended to operate for just 90 days. The video released of the rover and its lander don't show a lot of action yet, but we look forward to more images and more science coming out of the project. More rovers on Mars can only mean more learning, though we're a touch disappointed that thus far, they've all landed far apart and don't get to hang out. Perhaps one day, two rovers will meet; for now, with only six on the Martian surface, that's likely quite some time away!

Its navigation camera has captured the images of the landform along the way. During its journey, the surface-search radar, meteorology monitor and magnetic field detector all work to conduct survey. When it encounters special landforms such as rocks and sand dunes, the surface composition detector and multispectral camera on it will carry out fixed-point detection. China's Tianwen-1 Mars probe was launched on July 23, 2020.

The pictures - one color and two black-and-white - were shot by Zhurong's navigation camera on Monday as the rover was traveling southward for its scientific exploration, the administration said in a statement released with the photos. The parachute and back shell can be clearly seen in the pictures. They were about 30 meters from the rover and 350 meters from the landing site, according to the statement. As of Thursday afternoon, Zhurong, named after the Chinese god of fire in ancient mythology, had operated 60 days on Mars and traveled 450 meters to survey the barren planet. Meanwhile, the mission's orbiter has continued traveling around the Red Planet for orbital exploration. With an expected life span of three months, the 240-kilogram Zhurong is tasked with surveying Mars' landforms, geological structures, soil characteristics, potential locations of water and ice, and atmospheric and environmental characteristics, as well as magnetic and gravitational fields and other physical properties. The 1.85-meter-high rover is the core component of the Tianwen 1 mission, the country's first interplanetary adventure, and is the sixth rover on the extraterrestrial planet, following five from the United States. Tianwen 1, named after an ancient Chinese poem, was launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket on July 23, 2020, from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in South China's Hainan province, beginning the nation's first mission to another planet.

A Martian day is approximately 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth. Last week, the rover traveled to a dune and conducted scientific detection there. After completing the exploration of the topography, it will continue to move southwards and is expected to reach a complex terrain this week with rocks, impact craters and dunes densely distributed. The ground crew will use the daily images of the navigation terrain they've got to complete the rover's visual positioning and route planning, and steer the rover to safely traverse the complex terrain.

Zhurong completed its 90-sol mission in Mars' Utopia Planitia on Aug. 15, according to the China National Space Administration. Since landing on May 14, the rover has taken selfies with its landing platform and driven 2,917 feet across the surface, visiting its own discarded landing equipment and analyzing different rocks, dunes and other features as it went. New images from the rover show the terrain that it most recently reached. Zhurong will continue to cross this area, which is thought to be below the shoreline of an ancient ocean in southern Utopia Planitia. CNSA says Zhurong's six scientific instruments are working well and that the rover has, with the help of the Tianwen 1 orbiter acting as a relay, sent back 10 gigabytes of raw science data. That information could help scientists better understand Mars and its history, Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the Tianwen 1 ground application system, told CCTV. \"Hopefully, by providing these data to our scientists, we can get a deeper understanding of the geology of Mars, and then even see if we can find evidence of the existence of an ancient ocean in Utopia Planitia,\" Liu said. The Tianwen 1 orbiter has been passing over Zhurong's position once a day to relay data back home. Both spacecraft will go into safe mode from mid- September through late October, however, because of a solar conjunction preventing communications between Earth and Mars. With Mars on the far side of the sun from Earth, our view of the Red Planet is obscured by the sun. Charged particles given off by the star interfere with radio communications between the planets, meaning Zhurong will need to operate autonomously, and in a limited capacity, for safety reasons. NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers will also be operating on their own between Oct. 2 and Oct.14 for the same reason. When fully active again, Zhurong will continue toward a feature described as a \"groove\" just over 1 mile away. \"If it is possible for us to see from the top to the bottom of the groove, or if there are disparities of rock types and compositions, we could learn about what has happened in its geological history. So, this is what we're going to focus on in the near future,\" Liu said. TIanwen 1, meanwhile, will sometime after the conjunction switch its orbit to allow it to begin a global survey of Mars with its own seven science payloads. Teams are devising an orbit that will allow the orbiter to begin its own detections while still assisting Zhurong, which has only limited data transmission capabilities. Tianwen 1 launched in July 2020 and is China's first independent interplanetary mission. The spacecraft entered Mars orbit in February of this year, and Zhurong separated from the orbiter and made its successful landing in May.

The administration announced that the 1.85-meter-tall robot completed its three-month life expectancy, \"with all of its predetermined tasks completed,\" and that it will continue carrying out an extended expedition toward an ancient coastal area of Utopia Planitia. advertisement The rover is in the large plain area within the largest known impact basin in the solar system. Zhurong is the sixth rover to move on the Martian surface after five from the United States. It is currently joined by Nasa's Perseverance rover and the Curiosity rover that are exploring the uninhabitable world looking for signs of ancient microbial life within the surface. The three rovers are separated by thousands of kilometres on the Red Planet. The 240-kilogram robot is the core component of the Tianwen-1 mission, the country's first interplanetary adventure that created history by orbiting, landing and roving on Mars, all in its maiden attempt. Since its arrival on the surface, the Zhurong rover has obtained about 10 gigabytes of primary data and has moved close to a kilometre. It first touched down cocooned inside the lander on May 15 and separated from its landing platform a week later. \"The rover will suspend its operations from mid-September to late-October due to the anticipated disruption of its communications with Earth caused by solar electromagnetic radiation, and will then resume its mission,\" Sun Zezhou, head designer of the Tianwen 1 probe said in a statement.

The panoramic image is a 360-degree circular picture taken by the navigation terrain camera on the mast of the rover before it left the landing platform, Global Times reported. Astrobiologists had selected the Utopia Planitia as the landing site since they determined that it has suitable terrain and weather for a landing and is also highly likely to have been part of an ancient Martian ocean.

The successful \"survival\" of Zhurong, as well as the valuable data acquired during this period, which has been a first in China's aerospace history, is invaluable experience for future deep-space missions, including that to Jupiter and the Mars sample retrieving mission, experts noted. The good news came on Friday from China National Space Administration's China Lunar Exploration Project, announcing that Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and Zhurong rover will continue with its scientific exploration after a safe passage through a period of solar outage. In late September, the communication between the probe and the Earth began experiencing blackouts due to disturbances caused by the Sun's radiation, which was caused by a phenomenon known as solar outage when the Earth and Mars fall on either side of the Sun in alomost a straight line. The loss of contact with the remote voyager worried many Chinese netizens, whose fears and anticipations struggled just like any parents seeing off their children to a faraway land - concerned by the unknown while also having faith in its capabilities. To ensure the probe's safety during the \"blackout,\" ground control team has suspended its exploration tasks and prepared a slew of measures, such as setting up in advance an autonomous working state and laying out possible conditions that it may encounter and their solutions, so that it can scrape off risks beforehand. The probe also has the ability to control its own operating system, and can remain self-guiding during any solar outage period, resuming communication with the ground once the period is over. While communication links are blocked, Chinese research fellows were able to track and observe the orbiter and rover's status, and acquired some valuable first-hand data with the help of many international institutions from Europe, Australia, Russia, and South Africa. Jiao Weixin, a space science professor at Peking University, believed the experience has tested China's deep-space exploration capabilities in both maintaining the probe's safety while also continuing its observation when ground control is unable to support the expedition. \"Solar outage is a common phenomenon when we explore celestial bodies in the solar system, especially with Mars and other celestial bodies close to the Sun. The successful experience on our country's first try has fully demonstrated our extensive preparation work, which will further help China's future deep-space missions, including that to Jupiter,\" Jiao told the Global Times on Friday. Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based space expert and retired researcher from the China Academy of Space Technology, told the Global Times on Friday that with the successful Moon sample retrieving mission of Chang'e-5 and the Tianwen-1 mission which withstood multiple challenges in one go, a Mars sample retrieving mission can be expected in the next few years, around 2028 to 2030. During its next chapter, Zhurong will continue on its adventure on the Red Planet and travel south of the landing site to an area of suspected mud volcanoes detected by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The area has not been closely examined before by any other country with many believing it could contain evidence of the existence of water or life, which could have been brought out of the ground through eruptions of the mud volcanoes, Jiao said. Launched on July 23, 2020 and landing on the Martian surface on May 15 this year, China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has been in orbit for over 450 days.

Tianwen 1 and Zhurong had been in standby mode for about a month, since mid-September. With the Earth and Mars orbiting at opposite sides of the sun and all three bodies almost perfectly aligned, communications with the Red Planet were effectively blocked by interference from our star's charged particles. The China Lunar Exploration announced on Thursday that the orbiter and rover had reestablished communications and resumed science and exploration activities. Both Tianwen 1 and Zhurong are active sooner than first anticipated, as the spacecraft were expected to be beyond the reach of communications until the end of October. This estimate was likely conservative as this was the first time China has operated Mars spacecraft during a once- every-26-month solar conjunction. Zhurong had covered a total of 3,878 feet before going on standby for the solar conjunction, Sun Zezhou, Tianwen 1 chief designer with the China Academy of Space Technology, told Chinese media earlier this month. Zhurong landed in Utopia Planitia on May 14 and rolled onto the surface a week later, having remained in orbit since February after Tianwen 1 arrived at Mars. Zhurong also returned a panoramic view of its surroundings ahead of going on standby, showing the area it will be exploring. Things will be changing for both Tianwen 1 and Zhurong in the coming weeks. In early November, the orbiter will end its role as a dedicated relay satellite for Zhurong, since the rover has completed its primary mission. Tianwen 1 has been passing over Zhurong's position once every Martian day, or sol, to relay data from the rover to Earth, but it will now shift its orbit to begin global mapping and analysis of the Martian surface and subsurface with its suite of seven science instruments. While Tianwen 1 will still provide relay services, a European satellite could also step in to help transmit Zhurong's data across hundreds of millions of miles of space. The European Space Agency's Mars Express, which launched in 2003, is planning to perform a set of five tests with Zhurong in November. Mars Express will attempt to receive data from Zhurong and then retransmit the information to Earth, James Godfrey, Mars Express spacecraft operations manager at ESA, told Space.com. However, Mars Express won't be able to send commands to Zhurong, as the rover's message-sending capabilities are limited to channels that Mars Express can't monitor. In the meantime, Zhurong will continue its journey south from the landing platform that safely delivered it to the surface. A new paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters on geomorphologic exploration targets led by Ye Binlong of the University of Hong Kong) and Qian Yuqi of the China University of Geosciences identifies fascinating targets for analysis by Zhurong. These include mud volcanoes and features that may have been formed by movements of subsurface water and ice. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar is expected to provide \"fundamentally new perspectives\" on potential subsurface Martian water ice, the authors claim. Underground water would not only have implications for potential life, but would also be a strategic natural resource for future crewed Mars exploration. NASA's Perseverance rover is also looking for water reserves under the Martian surface using its own ground-penetrating radar. A preprint science paper about Zhurong's progress so far reveals that the rover has been covering covering on average about 33 ft and up to 66 ft per sol for the first 60 sols, depending on terrain and science tasks, also detailing the route planning and autonomous drive aspects of Zhurong's operations. The paper also reveals some of the features in the landing area and rocks showing evidence of being weathered.

During five tests, Zhurong will send a signal blindly into space, and the Mars Express will listen for that signal and any potential data. \"If Mars Express detects the magic signal, the radio will lock on to it and begin recording any data,\" ESA's Josh Tapley writes. \"At the end of the communication window, the spacecraft will turn to face Earth and relay these data across space the same way it does for other scientific Mars missions. When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.\" It's not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter - that's commonly been seen as a smart backup method - but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That'll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.

ESA Operations announced on Wednesday that its Mars Express team is planning a series of five communication tests with the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover in November. Zhurong will transmit data 'blind' as part of a technique designed over a decade ago but not tested in orbit until now. ESA will pass any received data on to the Zhurong team for analysis. The China Lunar Exploration Project of the China National Space Administration, announced on October 22 that the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and the Zhurong rover will continue with their scientific exploration after safely passing through a period of solar outage, during which the probe lost contact with Earth and relied on its own smart autonomous systems. The Mars orbiter will enter remote sensing orbit in early November and carry out a remote exploration of the Mars. Landers and rovers like Zhurong need to get the large volumes of science data they collect back to Earth for analysis. But the equipment they would need to transmit these data directly to Earth from the Martian surface would take up valuable space and mass. To solve this issue, landers and rovers are instead equipped with small, short-range radios. Similar radios are carried by the spacecrafts orbiting the Mars like the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and ESA's Mars Express. This allows a lander or rover to send its data up to an orbiter which then uses its larger and more powerful transmitter to forward the data across the vast interplanetary distance to Earth. This data relay approach has become the standard for operating rovers and landers on Mars. Since landing in May, Zhurong has relayed data back to its team using the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter. However, it is often useful to explore alternative ways to get its data back to Earth. One common solution is to use the Mars orbiters of other space agencies to provide data relay support such as ESA's Mars Express. In November, Zhurong will perform a series of five tests to relay data to the Mars Express which will further relay it to ESA's ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, and then to the Zhurong team. This is also a chance for the Mars Express team to test a backup method for communicating with Mars landers designed over a decade ago but never before tested live in orbit. However, due to an incompatibility between the two radio systems, the Zhurong rover cannot receive the frequencies used by Mars Express nor respond to a traditional signal from the spacecraft. Fortunately, it can transmit a frequency compatible with Mars Express. Zhang Kejian, head of CNSA, said that \"China is willing to cooperate with developed countries and major space powers, as well as some developing countries, on international cooperation in space missions,\" adding that China is willing to share space technologies with other countries to promote global cooperation and development.

Released by CNSA on Sunday, June 27, the footage shows the parachute deployment, descent, and landing, the deployment of the Zhurong rover to the surface, as well as a sweet shot of the six-wheeled vehicle backing away from its wireless camera. Launched in July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission - China's first to the Red Planet - arrived in orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021. The first video chronicles the landing on May 15 and presents views taken from three different cameras. Similar to NASA's footage of the Perseverance landing earlier this year, the video shows the parachute deployment and the backshell separation. The rover's obstacle avoidance camera was used to record the landing itself. Media captured during the mission are relayed to Earth using the Tianwen-1 satellite, currently in orbit around Mars. The second video is neat in that it includes both visuals and audio. The rover can be seen - and heard - driving down a ramp as it exits the landing platform to reach the Martian surface, which it did on May 22. The footage was captured by the rover's front and rear avoidance cameras, and the audio was recorded by a microphone that will be used to study the Martian \"environment and condition, such as atmospheric density and other parameters on the planet,\" explained Liu Jizhong, deputy commander of the Mars exploration program, in the South China Morning Post. The sound of Zhurong \"moving away mainly comes from the driving mechanism, the friction between the wheels and the ramp, and the friction between the wheels and the ground,\" according to a CNSA statement. The sound is quite muted, reminiscent of audio captured during flights of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter. Sound waves have barely any atmosphere to work with on Mars, hence the muffled audio. The third video was taken just prior to a neat selfie that shows both Zhurong and the landing platform. After depositing the wireless camera onto the surface, the rover can be seen retreating as it heads back toward the lander in preparation for the selfie. As of today, Zhurong has been working on Mars for 42 Martian days and has travelled a total of 236 metres. Both the orbiter and Zhurong are in \"good working condition,\" according to CNSA. The mission is expected to last 90 days, during which time the rover will study the Red Planet's geology, climate, regolith, and internal structure, in addition to searching for signs of subsurface water ice.

Recently, the China National Space Administration has landed its first rover on Mars, and begun to explore the surface of the red planet. It's a huge step, and something only previously achieved successfully by NASA. Let's take a look at the Chinese project, its goals, and see how it compares to the American rovers that have also roamed so far away. Wheelin' on Mars: China's first Mars rover goes by the name of Zhurong, named after a figure in Chinese mythology that is typically associated with fire. Given that Mars is known as the \"Planet of Fire\" in China, it's a fitting name selected by a public vote held earlier this year. The rover comes in at a size of 2.6 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 1.85 meters high, with its size placing it in between NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers which landed in 2004, and the later Curiosity rover which is a touch larger. The Zhurong rover weighs 240 kilograms, again placing it in between the two recent generations of NASA Mars rovers. Zhurong was launched as part of the Tianwen-1 mission which launched on July 23, 2020. The spacecraft entered Martian orbit on February 10, 2021, with the lander touching down on 14 May 2021 in the Utopia Planitia. The area on Mars was chosen as an ideal spot to investigate the possibility of the planet being host to an ancient ocean. The descent was controlled by parachutes and retro- rockets which slowed the lander as it approached the surface. What Lies Beneath: The rover sports a sensor package designed to perform a variety of science missions. Chief among those is the ground-penetrating radar, designed to collect geological data and capable of imaging up to 100 meters below the Martian surface. This goes far deeper than the 10 meter depth capability of the instrument fitted to the Perseverance rover which landed earlier this year. There's also a magnetometer onboard for determining the finer details of Mars's magnetic field. Atmospheric data is captured by measuring temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction in the Martian atmosphere. There's also a microphone which captures sound, which tends to have a different quality to that on Earth due to the different atmospheric conditions. Analysis and Imaging Hardware: Similarly to other rovers, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument is included. For those who aren't deeply involved in the spectroscopy subculture, this is a device which blasts rock and other samples with a laser and measures the emitted light. This can be used to determine the chemical makeup of samples. Camera-wise, a multi-spectral camera is fitted which aims to research the details around the existence of water on Mars. There are also extra cameras specifically intended for navigational purposes and for mapping out the topography of the surrounding area. These are key to the rover's mission, as communication time delays from Earth to Mars make direct teleoperation of the rover impossible. Cameras are instead used to enable the rover to take some level of autonomy in getting around its immediate area. Some of the rover's science hardware is eclipsed by that present on Perseverance, such as the fancier spectrometers on board, but overall it's a very complete science package. Zhurong's primary goals of studying Martian geology and soil, as well as the atmosphere, should reveal useful insights into the makeup of Mars as well as its history. One unique feature of the rover is its active suspension system. Unlike the passive rocker-bogie suspension system used on NASA rovers, Zhurong has fully independent control of each wheel's suspension. It can adjust the weight placed on each wheel, which could be particularly useful if the rover finds itself encountering softer soils, and could also assist in navigating obstacles or steeper slopes. The Mission Thus Far: China has recently released images of the rover on Mars, taken by a selfie camera that was dropped for that very purpose. The images document Zhurong rolling away from the camera as it begins to explore its landing site. Thus far, the rover has spent over a month on Mars, and has travelled 236 meters since landing. It is expected to spend 90 days studying the Martian surface, though it's common for rover missions to be extended if the hardware continues functioning past the original timeline. As an example, NASA's Opportunity rover ended up exploring the planet for 14 years despite originally being intended to operate for just 90 days. The video released of the rover and its lander don't show a lot of action yet, but we look forward to more images and more science coming out of the project. More rovers on Mars can only mean more learning, though we're a touch disappointed that thus far, they've all landed far apart and don't get to hang out. Perhaps one day, two rovers will meet; for now, with only six on the Martian surface, that's likely quite some time away!

Zhurong completed its 90-sol mission in Mars' Utopia Planitia on Aug. 15, according to the China National Space Administration. Since landing on May 14, the rover has taken selfies with its landing platform and driven 2,917 feet across the surface, visiting its own discarded landing equipment and analyzing different rocks, dunes and other features as it went. New images from the rover show the terrain that it most recently reached. Zhurong will continue to cross this area, which is thought to be below the shoreline of an ancient ocean in southern Utopia Planitia. CNSA says Zhurong's six scientific instruments are working well and that the rover has, with the help of the Tianwen 1 orbiter acting as a relay, sent back 10 gigabytes of raw science data. That information could help scientists better understand Mars and its history, Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the Tianwen 1 ground application system, told CCTV. \"Hopefully, by providing these data to our scientists, we can get a deeper understanding of the geology of Mars, and then even see if we can find evidence of the existence of an ancient ocean in Utopia Planitia,\" Liu said. The Tianwen 1 orbiter has been passing over Zhurong's position once a day to relay data back home. Both spacecraft will go into safe mode from mid- September through late October, however, because of a solar conjunction preventing communications between Earth and Mars. With Mars on the far side of the sun from Earth, our view of the Red Planet is obscured by the sun. Charged particles given off by the star interfere with radio communications between the planets, meaning Zhurong will need to operate autonomously, and in a limited capacity, for safety reasons. NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers will also be operating on their own between Oct. 2 and Oct.14 for the same reason. When fully active again, Zhurong will continue toward a feature described as a \"groove\" just over 1 mile away. \"If it is possible for us to see from the top to the bottom of the groove, or if there are disparities of rock types and compositions, we could learn about what has happened in its geological history. So, this is what we're going to focus on in the near future,\" Liu said. TIanwen 1, meanwhile, will sometime after the conjunction switch its orbit to allow it to begin a global survey of Mars with its own seven science payloads. Teams are devising an orbit that will allow the orbiter to begin its own detections while still assisting Zhurong, which has only limited data transmission capabilities. Tianwen 1 launched in July 2020 and is China's first independent interplanetary mission.

While communication links are blocked, Chinese research fellows were able to track and observe the orbiter and rover's status, and acquired some valuable first-hand data with the help of many international institutions from Europe, Australia, Russia, and South Africa. Jiao Weixin, a space science professor at Peking University, believed the experience has tested China's deep-space exploration capabilities in both maintaining the probe's safety while also continuing its observation when ground control is unable to support the expedition. \"Solar outage is a common phenomenon when we explore celestial bodies in the solar system, especially with Mars and other celestial bodies close to the Sun. The successful experience on our country's first try has fully demonstrated our extensive preparation work, which will further help China's future deep-space missions, including that to Jupiter,\" Jiao told the Global Times on Friday. Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based space expert and retired researcher from the China Academy of Space Technology, told the Global Times on Friday that with the successful Moon sample retrieving mission of Chang'e-5 and the Tianwen-1 mission which withstood multiple challenges in one go, a Mars sample retrieving mission can be expected in the next few years, around 2028 to 2030. During its next chapter, Zhurong will continue on its adventure on the Red Planet and travel south of the landing site to an area of suspected mud volcanoes detected by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The area has not been closely examined before by any other country with many believing it could contain evidence of the existence of water or life, which could have been brought out of the ground through eruptions of the mud volcanoes, Jiao said. Launched on July 23, 2020 and landing on the Martian surface on May 15 this year, China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has been in orbit for over 450 days. The Zhurong rover has also worked for more than 150 days, greatly exceeding its expected lifespan of 90 days.", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202110/1237041.shtml"}, {"title": "At Mars, China's Tianwen 1 orbiter and Zhurong rover are back in action after a radio blackout", "date": "2021-10-22", "content": "China's Tianwen 1 orbiter and Zhurong rover are once again active at Mars following a communications blackout caused by the sun interfering with radio signals sent from Earth. Tianwen 1 and Zhurong had been in standby mode for about a month, since mid-September. With the Earth and Mars orbiting at opposite sides of the sun and all three bodies almost perfectly aligned, communications with the Red Planet were effectively blocked by interference from our star's charged particles. The China Lunar Exploration announced on Thursday that the orbiter and rover had reestablished communications and resumed science and exploration activities. Both Tianwen 1 and Zhurong are active sooner than first anticipated, as the spacecraft were expected to be beyond the reach of communications until the end of October. This estimate was likely conservative as this was the first time China has operated Mars spacecraft during a once- every-26-month solar conjunction. Zhurong had covered a total of 3,878 feet before going on standby for the solar conjunction, Sun Zezhou, Tianwen 1 chief designer with the China Academy of Space Technology, told Chinese media earlier this month. Zhurong landed in Utopia Planitia on May 14 and rolled onto the surface a week later, having remained in orbit since February after Tianwen 1 arrived at Mars. Zhurong also returned a panoramic view of its surroundings ahead of going on standby, showing the area it will be exploring. Things will be changing for both Tianwen 1 and Zhurong in the coming weeks. In early November, the orbiter will end its role as a dedicated relay satellite for Zhurong, since the rover has completed its primary mission. Tianwen 1 has been passing over Zhurong's position once every Martian day, or sol, to relay data from the rover to Earth, but it will now shift its orbit to begin global mapping and analysis of the Martian surface and subsurface with its suite of seven science instruments. While Tianwen 1 will still provide relay services, a European satellite could also step in to help transmit Zhurong's data across hundreds of millions of miles of space. The European Space Agency's Mars Express, which launched in 2003, is planning to perform a set of five tests with Zhurong in November. Mars Express will attempt to receive data from Zhurong and then retransmit the information to Earth, James Godfrey, Mars Express spacecraft operations manager at ESA, told Space.com. However, Mars Express won't be able to send commands to Zhurong, as the rover's message-sending capabilities are limited to channels that Mars Express can't monitor. In the meantime, Zhurong will continue its journey south from the landing platform that safely delivered it to the surface. A new paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters on geomorphologic exploration targets led by Ye Binlong of the University of Hong Kong) and Qian Yuqi of the China University of Geosciences identifies fascinating targets for analysis by Zhurong. These include mud volcanoes and features that may have been formed by movements of subsurface water and ice. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar is expected to provide \"fundamentally new perspectives\" on potential subsurface Martian water ice, the authors claim. Underground water would not only have implications for potential life, but would also be a strategic natural resource for future crewed Mars exploration. NASA's Perseverance rover is also looking for water reserves under the Martian surface using its own ground-penetrating radar. A preprint science paper about Zhurong's progress so far reveals that the rover has been covering covering on average about 33 ft and up to 66 ft per sol for the first 60 sols, depending on terrain and science tasks, also detailing the route planning and autonomous drive aspects of Zhurong's operations. The paper also reveals some of the features in the landing area and rocks showing evidence of being weathered. Expect Zhurong to continue returning new images, findings and science data as it makes quick progress south.

Specifically, China's selfie-taking Zhurong rover, which has been on the Red Planet since May, will try to shoot data over to the ESA's Mars Express Orbiter. As the ESA explains, Zhurong can't actually receive any communications from the Express Orbiter, due to a radio incompatibility. That means it can't hear the hail signal sent from the orbiter, which is typically what a rover waits for before it starts sending out data. Instead, next month Mars and the ESA will attempt a new method that's previously only been tested on Earth. During five tests, Zhurong will send a signal blindly into space, and the Mars Express will listen for that signal and any potential data. \"If Mars Express detects the magic signal, the radio will lock on to it and begin recording any data,\" ESA's Josh Tapley writes. \"At the end of the communication window, the spacecraft will turn to face Earth and relay these data across space the same way it does for other scientific Mars missions. When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.\" It's not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter - that's commonly been seen as a smart backup method - but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That'll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.

ESA Operations announced on Wednesday that its Mars Express team is planning a series of five communication tests with the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover in November. Zhurong will transmit data 'blind' as part of a technique designed over a decade ago but not tested in orbit until now. ESA will pass any received data on to the Zhurong team for analysis. The China Lunar Exploration Project of the China National Space Administration, announced on October 22 that the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and the Zhurong rover will continue with their scientific exploration after safely passing through a period of solar outage, during which the probe lost contact with Earth and relied on its own smart autonomous systems. The Mars orbiter will enter remote sensing orbit in early November and carry out a remote exploration of the Mars. Landers and rovers like Zhurong need to get the large volumes of science data they collect back to Earth for analysis. But the equipment they would need to transmit these data directly to Earth from the Martian surface would take up valuable space and mass. To solve this issue, landers and rovers are instead equipped with small, short-range radios. Similar radios are carried by the spacecrafts orbiting the Mars like the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and ESA's Mars Express. This allows a lander or rover to send its data up to an orbiter which then uses its larger and more powerful transmitter to forward the data across the vast interplanetary distance to Earth. This data relay approach has become the standard for operating rovers and landers on Mars. Since landing in May, Zhurong has relayed data back to its team using the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter. However, it is often useful to explore alternative ways to get its data back to Earth. One common solution is to use the Mars orbiters of other space agencies to provide data relay support such as ESA's Mars Express. In November, Zhurong will perform a series of five tests to relay data to the Mars Express which will further relay it to ESA's ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, and then to the Zhurong team. This is also a chance for the Mars Express team to test a backup method for communicating with Mars landers designed over a decade ago but never before tested live in orbit. However, due to an incompatibility between the two radio systems, the Zhurong rover cannot receive the frequencies used by Mars Express nor respond to a traditional signal from the spacecraft. Fortunately, it can transmit a frequency compatible with Mars Express. Zhang Kejian, head of CNSA, said that \"China is willing to cooperate with developed countries and major space powers, as well as some developing countries, on international cooperation in space missions,\" adding that China is willing to share space technologies with other countries to promote global cooperation and development.

New images from the rover show the terrain that it most recently reached. Zhurong will continue to cross this area, which is thought to be below the shoreline of an ancient ocean in southern Utopia Planitia. CNSA says Zhurong's six scientific instruments are working well and that the rover has, with the help of the Tianwen 1 orbiter acting as a relay, sent back 10 gigabytes of raw science data. That information could help scientists better understand Mars and its history, Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the Tianwen 1 ground application system, told CCTV. \"Hopefully, by providing these data to our scientists, we can get a deeper understanding of the geology of Mars, and then even see if we can find evidence of the existence of an ancient ocean in Utopia Planitia,\" Liu said. The Tianwen 1 orbiter has been passing over Zhurong's position once a day to relay data back home. Both spacecraft will go into safe mode from mid- September through late October, however, because of a solar conjunction preventing communications between Earth and Mars. With Mars on the far side of the sun from Earth, our view of the Red Planet is obscured by the sun. Charged particles given off by the star interfere with radio communications between the planets, meaning Zhurong will need to operate autonomously, and in a limited capacity, for safety reasons. NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers will also be operating on their own between Oct. 2 and Oct.14 for the same reason. When fully active again, Zhurong will continue toward a feature described as a \"groove\" just over 1 mile away. \"If it is possible for us to see from the top to the bottom of the groove, or if there are disparities of rock types and compositions, we could learn about what has happened in its geological history. So, this is what we're going to focus on in the near future,\" Liu said. TIanwen 1, meanwhile, will sometime after the conjunction switch its orbit to allow it to begin a global survey of Mars with its own seven science payloads. Teams are devising an orbit that will allow the orbiter to begin its own detections while still assisting Zhurong, which has only limited data transmission capabilities.

The European Space Agency's Mars Express, which launched in 2003, is planning to perform a set of five tests with Zhurong in November. Mars Express will attempt to receive data from Zhurong and then retransmit the information to Earth, James Godfrey, Mars Express spacecraft operations manager at ESA, told Space.com. However, Mars Express won't be able to send commands to Zhurong, as the rover's message-sending capabilities are limited to channels that Mars Express can't monitor. In the meantime, Zhurong will continue its journey south from the landing platform that safely delivered it to the surface. A new paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters on geomorphologic exploration targets led by Ye Binlong of the University of Hong Kong) and Qian Yuqi of the China University of Geosciences identifies fascinating targets for analysis by Zhurong. These include mud volcanoes and features that may have been formed by movements of subsurface water and ice. Zhurong's ground-penetrating radar is expected to provide \"fundamentally new perspectives\" on potential subsurface Martian water ice, the authors claim. Underground water would not only have implications for potential life, but would also be a strategic natural resource for future crewed Mars exploration. NASA's Perseverance rover is also looking for water reserves under the Martian surface using its own ground-penetrating radar. A preprint science paper about Zhurong's progress so far reveals that the rover has been covering covering on average about 33 ft and up to 66 ft per sol for the first 60 sols, depending on terrain and science tasks, also detailing the route planning and autonomous drive aspects of Zhurong's operations. The paper also reveals some of the features in the landing area and rocks showing evidence of being weathered. Expect Zhurong to continue returning new images, findings and science data as it makes quick progress south.

ESA Operations announced on Wednesday that its Mars Express team is planning a series of five communication tests with the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover in November. Zhurong will transmit data 'blind' as part of a technique designed over a decade ago but not tested in orbit until now. ESA will pass any received data on to the Zhurong team for analysis. The China Lunar Exploration Project of the China National Space Administration, announced on October 22 that the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and the Zhurong rover will continue with their scientific exploration after safely passing through a period of solar outage, during which the probe lost contact with Earth and relied on its own smart autonomous systems. The Mars orbiter will enter remote sensing orbit in early November and carry out a remote exploration of the Mars. Landers and rovers like Zhurong need to get the large volumes of science data they collect back to Earth for analysis. But the equipment they would need to transmit these data directly to Earth from the Martian surface would take up valuable space and mass. To solve this issue, landers and rovers are instead equipped with small, short-range radios. Similar radios are carried by the spacecrafts orbiting the Mars like the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and ESA's Mars Express. This allows a lander or rover to send its data up to an orbiter which then uses its larger and more powerful transmitter to forward the data across the vast interplanetary distance to Earth. This data relay approach has become the standard for operating rovers and landers on Mars. Since landing in May, Zhurong has relayed data back to its team using the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter. However, it is often useful to explore alternative ways to get its data back to Earth. One common solution is to use the Mars orbiters of other space agencies to provide data relay support such as ESA's Mars Express. In November, Zhurong will perform a series of five tests to relay data to the Mars Express which will further relay it to ESA's ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, and then to the Zhurong team. This is also a chance for the Mars Express team to test a backup method for communicating with Mars landers designed over a decade ago but never before tested live in orbit. However, due to an incompatibility between the two radio systems, the Zhurong rover cannot receive the frequencies used by Mars Express nor respond to a traditional signal from the spacecraft. Fortunately, it can transmit a frequency compatible with Mars Express. Zhang Kejian, head of CNSA, said that \"China is willing to cooperate with developed countries and major space powers, as well as some developing countries, on international cooperation in space missions,\" adding that China is willing to share space technologies with other countries to promote global cooperation and development.

The Zhurong rover on Mars was designed only to communicate with its companion orbiter, Tianwen 1 ; however, the rover has long outlived its planned mission and the orbiter is no longer able to do as much data relaying. So China and Europe decided to try an experiment: Send data from Zhurong to Mars Express to Earth. That's challenging, since the robots' communications equipment doesn't match. Zhurong can transmit at a frequency Mars Express can detect, but not vice versa, so Zhurong sends data without hearing back from the orbiter. On Nov. 20, Mars Express passed 2,500 miles above Zhurong's location in Utopia Planitia, received a batch of data, then transmitted the data across 230 million miles of space to European Space Operations Center ground stations, which then forwarded the data to the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center. \"Mars Express successfully received the signals sent by the rover, and our colleagues in the Zhurong team confirmed that all the data arrived on Earth in very good quality,\" Gerhard Billig, a systems engineer at the European Space Agency, said in a statement. Mars rovers collect a wealth of science data down on the surface but don't carry large communications arrays. Insead, they rely on orbiters to relay their high volumes of data across the inner solar system to Earth. Normally a rover and orbiter will exchange short messages to establish two- communications and transmit data. But, according to ESA, Mars Express transmits its \"hello\" signal using communication frequencies that are different from those the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover receives, making two-way communication impossible. However, Zhurong can transmit signals using a frequency that Mars Express can receive, so ESA carried out a first test of a one-way communication technique: communication \"in the blind,\" where the sender can't be sure if their signal is being received. Zhurong, China's first Mars rover, landed on the Red Planet in May this year and has been exploring Utopia Planitia. With only a small antenna on the rover, its companion Tianwen 1 orbiter has been relaying Zhurong's science data to Earth. But with the start of Tianwen 1's own science mission in November, the opportunities for relaying the valuable information from Zhurong have been reduced. Instead, the orbiter is focused on mapping Mars. Existing cooperation between ESA and the China National Space Administration opened the way for a series of five communications tests between Mars Express and Zhurong, all carried out in November. Mars Express received a signal during each of the five tests, but during four of these, the received data was corrupted, an ESA spokesperson told Space.com via email. During an investigation into the glitches, interference from another unit on Mars Express was deemed responsible. The fourth test, on Nov. 20, yielded results, however, as the orbiter successfully collected 233 kilobytes of data and sent it on to Earth. The mission teams are now arranging additional tests. \"We're looking forward to carrying out more tests in the future to continue to experiment and further improve this method of communicating between space missions,\" Billig said. Teams will check when Mars Express will have visibility of the Zhurong rover and that the tests will be compatible with the orbiter's science plan. The next test would examine different bit rates and overflight durations, ESA said. \"In principle, it would be possible for Mars Express to play a formal relay role for Zhurong in the future, but this would have to be agreed between the two space agencies,\" the ESA spokesperson noted to Space.com. Mars Express has been in orbit around the Red Planet since December 2003. Its activities include discovering methane in the Martian atmosphere, mapping the composition of polar ice and tentatively detecting subsurface water beneath the south pole. A China Lunar Exploration Project report on the communications test also revealed that Zhurong has covered a total of 4,255 feet in 196 Martian days, or sols, since landing on May 14. Zhurong had already covered 4,111 feet by early November, suggesting that the rover has been spending time analyzing a sediment-filled trough with its science payloads rather than pushing south.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-communicates-via-european-orbiter"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "China's Mars rover in complex terrain, travels over 800 meters", "date": "2021-08-06", "content": "China's Mars rover Zhurong has traveled a total of 808 meters on the surface of the red planet as of Friday and is passing over a complex terrain, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA).

Zhurong completed its 90-sol mission in Mars' Utopia Planitia on Aug. 15, according to the China National Space Administration. Since landing on May 14, the rover has taken selfies with its landing platform and driven 2,917 feet across the surface, visiting its own discarded landing equipment and analyzing different rocks, dunes and other features as it went. New images from the rover show the terrain that it most recently reached. Zhurong will continue to cross this area, which is thought to be below the shoreline of an ancient ocean in southern Utopia Planitia. CNSA says Zhurong's six scientific instruments are working well and that the rover has, with the help of the Tianwen 1 orbiter acting as a relay, sent back 10 gigabytes of raw science data. That information could help scientists better understand Mars and its history, Liu Jianjun, chief designer of the Tianwen 1 ground application system, told CCTV. \"Hopefully, by providing these data to our scientists, we can get a deeper understanding of the geology of Mars, and then even see if we can find evidence of the existence of an ancient ocean in Utopia Planitia,\" Liu said. The Tianwen 1 orbiter has been passing over Zhurong's position once a day to relay data back home. Both spacecraft will go into safe mode from mid- September through late October, however, because of a solar conjunction preventing communications between Earth and Mars. With Mars on the far side of the sun from Earth, our view of the Red Planet is obscured by the sun. Charged particles given off by the star interfere with radio communications between the planets, meaning Zhurong will need to operate autonomously, and in a limited capacity, for safety reasons. NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers will also be operating on their own between Oct. 2 and Oct.14 for the same reason. When fully active again, Zhurong will continue toward a feature described as a \"groove\" just over 1 mile away. \"If it is possible for us to see from the top to the bottom of the groove, or if there are disparities of rock types and compositions, we could learn about what has happened in its geological history. So, this is what we're going to focus on in the near future,\" Liu said. TIanwen 1, meanwhile, will sometime after the conjunction switch its orbit to allow it to begin a global survey of Mars with its own seven science payloads. Teams are devising an orbit that will allow the orbiter to begin its own detections while still assisting Zhurong, which has only limited data transmission capabilities. Tianwen 1 launched in July 2020 and is China's first independent interplanetary mission. The spacecraft entered Mars orbit in February of this year, and Zhurong separated from the orbiter and made its successful landing in May.

Zhurong is the sixth rover to move on the Martian surface after five from the United States. It is currently joined by Nasa's Perseverance rover and the Curiosity rover that are exploring the uninhabitable world looking for signs of ancient microbial life within the surface. The three rovers are separated by thousands of kilometres on the Red Planet. The 240-kilogram robot is the core component of the Tianwen-1 mission, the country's first interplanetary adventure that created history by orbiting, landing and roving on Mars, all in its maiden attempt. Since its arrival on the surface, the Zhurong rover has obtained about 10 gigabytes of primary data and has moved close to a kilometre. It first touched down cocooned inside the lander on May 15 and separated from its landing platform a week later. \"The rover will suspend its operations from mid-September to late-October due to the anticipated disruption of its communications with Earth caused by solar electromagnetic radiation, and will then resume its mission,\" Sun Zezhou, head designer of the Tianwen 1 probe said in a statement.

The successful \"survival\" of Zhurong, as well as the valuable data acquired during this period, which has been a first in China's aerospace history, is invaluable experience for future deep-space missions, including that to Jupiter and the Mars sample retrieving mission, experts noted. The good news came on Friday from China National Space Administration's China Lunar Exploration Project, announcing that Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and Zhurong rover will continue with its scientific exploration after a safe passage through a period of solar outage. In late September, the communication between the probe and the Earth began experiencing blackouts due to disturbances caused by the Sun's radiation, which was caused by a phenomenon known as solar outage when the Earth and Mars fall on either side of the Sun in alomost a straight line. The loss of contact with the remote voyager worried many Chinese netizens, whose fears and anticipations struggled just like any parents seeing off their children to a faraway land - concerned by the unknown while also having faith in its capabilities. To ensure the probe's safety during the \"blackout,\" ground control team has suspended its exploration tasks and prepared a slew of measures, such as setting up in advance an autonomous working state and laying out possible conditions that it may encounter and their solutions, so that it can scrape off risks beforehand. The probe also has the ability to control its own operating system, and can remain self-guiding during any solar outage period, resuming communication with the ground once the period is over. While communication links are blocked, Chinese research fellows were able to track and observe the orbiter and rover's status, and acquired some valuable first-hand data with the help of many international institutions from Europe, Australia, Russia, and South Africa. Jiao Weixin, a space science professor at Peking University, believed the experience has tested China's deep-space exploration capabilities in both maintaining the probe's safety while also continuing its observation when ground control is unable to support the expedition. \"Solar outage is a common phenomenon when we explore celestial bodies in the solar system, especially with Mars and other celestial bodies close to the Sun. The successful experience on our country's first try has fully demonstrated our extensive preparation work, which will further help China's future deep-space missions, including that to Jupiter,\" Jiao told the Global Times on Friday.

During its next chapter, Zhurong will continue on its adventure on the Red Planet and travel south of the landing site to an area of suspected mud volcanoes detected by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. The area has not been closely examined before by any other country with many believing it could contain evidence of the existence of water or life, which could have been brought out of the ground through eruptions of the mud volcanoes, Jiao said. Launched on July 23, 2020 and landing on the Martian surface on May 15 this year, China's Tianwen-1 orbiter has been in orbit for over 450 days.

The China Lunar Exploration announced on Thursday that the orbiter and rover had reestablished communications and resumed science and exploration activities. Both Tianwen 1 and Zhurong are active sooner than first anticipated, as the spacecraft were expected to be beyond the reach of communications until the end of October. This estimate was likely conservative as this was the first time China has operated Mars spacecraft during a once- every-26-month solar conjunction.

Similar radios are carried by the spacecrafts orbiting the Mars like the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and ESA's Mars Express. This allows a lander or rover to send its data up to an orbiter which then uses its larger and more powerful transmitter to forward the data across the vast interplanetary distance to Earth. This data relay approach has become the standard for operating rovers and landers on Mars. Since landing in May, Zhurong has relayed data back to its team using the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter. However, it is often useful to explore alternative ways to get its data back to Earth. One common solution is to use the Mars orbiters of other space agencies to provide data relay support such as ESA's Mars Express. In November, Zhurong will perform a series of five tests to relay data to the Mars Express which will further relay it to ESA's ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, and then to the Zhurong team. This is also a chance for the Mars Express team to test a backup method for communicating with Mars landers designed over a decade ago but never before tested live in orbit. However, due to an incompatibility between the two radio systems, the Zhurong rover cannot receive the frequencies used by Mars Express nor respond to a traditional signal from the spacecraft. Fortunately, it can transmit a frequency compatible with Mars Express. Zhang Kejian, head of CNSA, said that \"China is willing to cooperate with developed countries and major space powers, as well as some developing countries, on international cooperation in space missions,\" adding that China is willing to share space technologies with other countries to promote global cooperation and development.

The Zhurong rover on Mars was designed only to communicate with its companion orbiter, Tianwen 1 ; however, the rover has long outlived its planned mission and the orbiter is no longer able to do as much data relaying. So China and Europe decided to try an experiment: Send data from Zhurong to Mars Express to Earth. That's challenging, since the robots' communications equipment doesn't match. Zhurong can transmit at a frequency Mars Express can detect, but not vice versa, so Zhurong sends data without hearing back from the orbiter. On Nov. 20, Mars Express passed 2,500 miles above Zhurong's location in Utopia Planitia, received a batch of data, then transmitted the data across 230 million miles of space to European Space Operations Center ground stations, which then forwarded the data to the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center. \"Mars Express successfully received the signals sent by the rover, and our colleagues in the Zhurong team confirmed that all the data arrived on Earth in very good quality,\" Gerhard Billig, a systems engineer at the European Space Agency, said in a statement. Mars rovers collect a wealth of science data down on the surface but don't carry large communications arrays. Insead, they rely on orbiters to relay their high volumes of data across the inner solar system to Earth. Normally a rover and orbiter will exchange short messages to establish two- communications and transmit data. But, according to ESA, Mars Express transmits its \"hello\" signal using communication frequencies that are different from those the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover receives, making two-way communication impossible. However, Zhurong can transmit signals using a frequency that Mars Express can receive, so ESA carried out a first test of a one-way communication technique: communication \"in the blind,\" where the sender can't be sure if their signal is being received. Zhurong, China's first Mars rover, landed on the Red Planet in May this year and has been exploring Utopia Planitia. With only a small antenna on the rover, its companion Tianwen 1 orbiter has been relaying Zhurong's science data to Earth. But with the start of Tianwen 1's own science mission in November, the opportunities for relaying the valuable information from Zhurong have been reduced. Instead, the orbiter is focused on mapping Mars. Existing cooperation between ESA and the China National Space Administration opened the way for a series of five communications tests between Mars Express and Zhurong, all carried out in November. Mars Express received a signal during each of the five tests, but during four of these, the received data was corrupted, an ESA spokesperson told Space.com via email. During an investigation into the glitches, interference from another unit on Mars Express was deemed responsible. The fourth test, on Nov. 20, yielded results, however, as the orbiter successfully collected 233 kilobytes of data and sent it on to Earth. The mission teams are now arranging additional tests. \"We're looking forward to carrying out more tests in the future to continue to experiment and further improve this method of communicating between space missions,\" Billig said. Teams will check when Mars Express will have visibility of the Zhurong rover and that the tests will be compatible with the orbiter's science plan. The next test would examine different bit rates and overflight durations, ESA said. \"In principle, it would be possible for Mars Express to play a formal relay role for Zhurong in the future, but this would have to be agreed between the two space agencies,\" the ESA spokesperson noted to Space.com. Mars Express has been in orbit around the Red Planet since December 2003. Its activities include discovering methane in the Martian atmosphere, mapping the composition of polar ice and tentatively detecting subsurface water beneath the south pole.

When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.\" It's not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter - that's commonly been seen as a smart backup method - but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That'll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.

ESA Operations announced on Wednesday that its Mars Express team is planning a series of five communication tests with the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover in November. Zhurong will transmit data 'blind' as part of a technique designed over a decade ago but not tested in orbit until now. ESA will pass any received data on to the Zhurong team for analysis. The China Lunar Exploration Project of the China National Space Administration, announced on October 22 that the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and the Zhurong rover will continue with their scientific exploration after safely passing through a period of solar outage, during which the probe lost contact with Earth and relied on its own smart autonomous systems. The Mars orbiter will enter remote sensing orbit in early November and carry out a remote exploration of the Mars. Landers and rovers like Zhurong need to get the large volumes of science data they collect back to Earth for analysis. But the equipment they would need to transmit these data directly to Earth from the Martian surface would take up valuable space and mass. To solve this issue, landers and rovers are instead equipped with small, short-range radios. Similar radios are carried by the spacecrafts orbiting the Mars like the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and ESA's Mars Express. This allows a lander or rover to send its data up to an orbiter which then uses its larger and more powerful transmitter to forward the data across the vast interplanetary distance to Earth. This data relay approach has become the standard for operating rovers and landers on Mars. Since landing in May, Zhurong has relayed data back to its team using the Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter. However, it is often useful to explore alternative ways to get its data back to Earth. One common solution is to use the Mars orbiters of other space agencies to provide data relay support such as ESA's Mars Express. In November, Zhurong will perform a series of five tests to relay data to the Mars Express which will further relay it to ESA's ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, and then to the Zhurong team. This is also a chance for the Mars Express team to test a backup method for communicating with Mars landers designed over a decade ago but never before tested live in orbit. However, due to an incompatibility between the two radio systems, the Zhurong rover cannot receive the frequencies used by Mars Express nor respond to a traditional signal from the spacecraft. Fortunately, it can transmit a frequency compatible with Mars Express. Zhang Kejian, head of CNSA, said that \"China is willing to cooperate with developed countries and major space powers, as well as some developing countries, on international cooperation in space missions,\" adding that China is willing to share space technologies with other countries to promote global cooperation and development.

The Zhurong rover on Mars was designed only to communicate with its companion orbiter, Tianwen 1 ; however, the rover has long outlived its planned mission and the orbiter is no longer able to do as much data relaying. So China and Europe decided to try an experiment: Send data from Zhurong to Mars Express to Earth. That's challenging, since the robots' communications equipment doesn't match. Zhurong can transmit at a frequency Mars Express can detect, but not vice versa, so Zhurong sends data without hearing back from the orbiter. On Nov. 20, Mars Express passed 2,500 miles above Zhurong's location in Utopia Planitia, received a batch of data, then transmitted the data across 230 million miles of space to European Space Operations Center ground stations, which then forwarded the data to the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center. \"Mars Express successfully received the signals sent by the rover, and our colleagues in the Zhurong team confirmed that all the data arrived on Earth in very good quality,\" Gerhard Billig, a systems engineer at the European Space Agency, said in a statement. Mars rovers collect a wealth of science data down on the surface but don't carry large communications arrays. Insead, they rely on orbiters to relay their high volumes of data across the inner solar system to Earth. Normally a rover and orbiter will exchange short messages to establish two- communications and transmit data. But, according to ESA, Mars Express transmits its \"hello\" signal using communication frequencies that are different from those the Chinese Zhurong Mars rover receives, making two-way communication impossible. However, Zhurong can transmit signals using a frequency that Mars Express can receive, so ESA carried out a first test of a one-way communication technique: communication \"in the blind,\" where the sender can't be sure if their signal is being received. Zhurong, China's first Mars rover, landed on the Red Planet in May this year and has been exploring Utopia Planitia. With only a small antenna on the rover, its companion Tianwen 1 orbiter has been relaying Zhurong's science data to Earth. But with the start of Tianwen 1's own science mission in November, the opportunities for relaying the valuable information from Zhurong have been reduced. Instead, the orbiter is focused on mapping Mars. Existing cooperation between ESA and the China National Space Administration opened the way for a series of five communications tests between Mars Express and Zhurong, all carried out in November. Mars Express received a signal during each of the five tests, but during four of these, the received data was corrupted, an ESA spokesperson told Space.com via email. During an investigation into the glitches, interference from another unit on Mars Express was deemed responsible. The fourth test, on Nov. 20, yielded results, however, as the orbiter successfully collected 233 kilobytes of data and sent it on to Earth. The mission teams are now arranging additional tests. \"We're looking forward to carrying out more tests in the future to continue to experiment and further improve this method of communicating between space missions,\" Billig said. Teams will check when Mars Express will have visibility of the Zhurong rover and that the tests will be compatible with the orbiter's science plan. The next test would examine different bit rates and overflight durations, ESA said. \"In principle, it would be possible for Mars Express to play a formal relay role for Zhurong in the future, but this would have to be agreed between the two space agencies,\" the ESA spokesperson noted to Space.com. Mars Express has been in orbit around the Red Planet since December 2003. Its activities include discovering methane in the Martian atmosphere, mapping the composition of polar ice and tentatively detecting subsurface water beneath the south pole. A China Lunar Exploration Project report on the communications test also revealed that Zhurong has covered a total of 4,255 feet in 196 Martian days, or sols, since landing on May 14. Zhurong had already covered 4,111 feet by early November, suggesting that the rover has been spending time analyzing a sediment-filled trough with its science payloads rather than pushing south.", "url": "https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-communicates-via-european-orbiter"}, {"title": "Evidence of wind, possible water erosion found on Mars: study", "date": "2022-03-11", "content": "A new study has revealed that the site where China's Mars rover Zhurong landed must have experienced wind and possibly water erosion, providing more evidence on the surface features of the red planet.

A team of researchers, led by Ding Liang of the Harbin Institute of Technology in northeast China, found that the Martian soil has high bearing strength and cohesion evidence of wind erosion after studying the surface rocks imaged by the rover's cameras.

The Tianwen 1 orbiter and rover mission, which launched for Mars in July 2020, and Chang'e 5, which gathered the youngest lunar samples ever collected and delivered them to Earth later that year, are now delivering exciting science results. The new data and results emerging from the missions sparked a call for a special session at this year's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held in Texas and virtually beginning March 7. For example, samples of the 3.81 pounds of lunar regolith and rocks collected by Chang'e 5 have been made available for applications for science institutes and universities, and new insights are already emerging. The Chang'e 5 mission has opened a new era of China's lunar and planetary sciences, Yuqi Qian, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth Sciences at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and an author of papers presented at LPSC, told Space.com. \"We have dozens of universities and institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences that have started to work on planetary sciences, with many new faces,\" Qian said. Teams at LPSC presented papers on a range of topics, including lunar petrology, the study of rocks and the conditions under which they form; textual analysis of samples; and assessments of the geological context of the landing area. A paper authored jointly by American, Chinese and European scientists notes how dating these relatively young Chang'e 5 samples, which are around 2 billion years old, allows for a refinement of the estimated ages of planetary surfaces in the solar system through counting the numbers of craters in particular areas. Areas with fewer craters are thought to be younger than those with more dense cratering, having had less time to be impacted by meteorites. Getting hold of samples and confirming the age of rocks through radioisotopic dating means scientists can verify and calibrate this technique. The new, young Chang'e 5 samples fill gaps left from estimates built on the Apollo samples, which are older than 3 billion years. The presence of material associated with the lunar highlands was found in the Chang'e 5 rocks, which were collected from Oceanus Procellarum, the largest lunar mare, or dark plain. Other presentations described unusually high water content at the landing site, suggesting the rocks in the area originated from the lunar interior. In addition to having a new presence at LPSC, China held its first planetary science conference last year and will have the second one this year. China's first interplanetary mission, Tianwen 1, which includes the Zhurong rover in the plain of Utopia Planitia, is also exciting the science community. Scientists from universitiesHong Kong and institutes in Wuhan and Weihai on the mainland noted that, unlike Mars' cold and oxidized surface, the subsurface of the Red Planet could provide the energy and liquid for past - or even present - life, making it an environment to search for biosignatures and evidence of life. Their paper focuses on mud volcanoes, which on Earth can expel subsurface materials from several miles deep and contain significant organic materials. Similar features on Mars in the vicinity of Zhurong could provide unique access to deep sediments, the scientists said. The rover - with its terrain camera, multispectral cameras and surface composition detector - can collect mineralogy and chemical data, while the ground-penetrating radar can peer up to around 330 feet below the surface. Zhurong could, therefore, provide fascinating new insight into what lies beneath the surface of Mars, the researchers said. Zhurong landed in Utopia Planitia in May 2021, and as of early February, the rover had driven a total of 5,043 feet. Tianwen 1 had been focused on relaying data from the rover to Earth until changing its orbit in November 2021 to begin its own dedicated science objectives. Currently, data from the Tianwen 1 mission are accessible only to Chinese scientists, but the data will soon be made available internationally via China's Lunar and Planetary Data Release System.

The Tianwen 1 orbiter and rover mission, which launched for Mars in July 2020, and Chang'e 5, which gathered the youngest lunar samples ever collected and delivered them to Earth later that year, are now delivering exciting science results. The new data and results emerging from the missions sparked a call for a special session at this year's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held in Texas and virtually beginning March 7. For example, samples of the 3.81 pounds of lunar regolith and rocks collected by Chang'e 5 have been made available for applications for science institutes and universities, and new insights are already emerging. The Chang'e 5 mission has opened a new era of China's lunar and planetary sciences, Yuqi Qian, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth Sciences at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and an author of papers presented at LPSC, told Space.com. \"We have dozens of universities and institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences that have started to work on planetary sciences, with many new faces,\" Qian said. Teams at LPSC presented papers on a range of topics, including lunar petrology, the study of rocks and the conditions under which they form; textual analysis of samples; and assessments of the geological context of the landing area. A paper authored jointly by American, Chinese and European scientists notes how dating these relatively young Chang'e 5 samples, which are around 2 billion years old, allows for a refinement of the estimated ages of planetary surfaces in the solar system through counting the numbers of craters in particular areas. Areas with fewer craters are thought to be younger than those with more dense cratering, having had less time to be impacted by meteorites. Getting hold of samples and confirming the age of rocks through radioisotopic dating means scientists can verify and calibrate this technique. The new, young Chang'e 5 samples fill gaps left from estimates built on the Apollo samples, which are older than 3 billion years. The presence of material associated with the lunar highlands was found in the Chang'e 5 rocks, which were collected from Oceanus Procellarum, the largest lunar mare, or dark plain. Other presentations described unusually high water content at the landing site, suggesting the rocks in the area originated from the lunar interior. In addition to having a new presence at LPSC, China held its first planetary science conference last year and will have the second one this year. China's first interplanetary mission, Tianwen 1, which includes the Zhurong rover in the plain of Utopia Planitia, is also exciting the science community. Scientists from universitiesHong Kong and institutes in Wuhan and Weihai on the mainland noted that, unlike Mars' cold and oxidized surface, the subsurface of the Red Planet could provide the energy and liquid for past - or even present - life, making it an environment to search for biosignatures and evidence of life. Their paper focuses on mud volcanoes, which on Earth can expel subsurface materials from several miles deep and contain significant organic materials. Similar features on Mars in the vicinity of Zhurong could provide unique access to deep sediments, the scientists said. The rover - with its terrain camera, multispectral cameras and surface composition detector - can collect mineralogy and chemical data, while the ground-penetrating radar can peer up to around 330 feet below the surface. Zhurong could, therefore, provide fascinating new insight into what lies beneath the surface of Mars, the researchers said. Zhurong landed in Utopia Planitia in May 2021, and as of early February, the rover had driven a total of 5,043 feet. Tianwen 1 had been focused on relaying data from the rover to Earth until changing its orbit in November 2021 to begin its own dedicated science objectives. Currently, data from the Tianwen 1 mission are accessible only to Chinese scientists, but the data will soon be made available internationally via China's Lunar and Planetary Data Release System.

On June 11, the China National Space Administration released the first photographs taken by Zhurong, signifying a complete success in the country's first Mars exploration mission. FRUITFUL RESULTS: Since landing, Zhurong has continued moving southward and transmitted data back to Earth. It has completed explorations of the Martian surface, passed through multiple complex terrains, and detected Martian rocks, sand dunes and impact craters, obtaining a large amount of data using its onboard scientific equipment. By Aug. 15, 2021, Zhurong had worked on the planet's surface for 90 Martian days, or about three months on Earth, accomplishing all exploration and detection tasks as planned. It was in good condition and continued service despite reaching its planned working target of 90 days. From late September to late October last year, the Mars orbiter and Zhurong suspended their explorations and relied on their own autonomous systems to survive their first solar outage, during which time solar electromagnetic radiation increased and disrupted communication between the probe and Earth. In November 2021, Zhurong and the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft performed an in-orbit relay communication test. In May this year, using data gathered by Zhurong on the landing site, Chinese scientists found new evidence suggesting the presence of liquid water activity and hydrated minerals on the red planet.

Zhurong's initial mission was just 90 days, but since then the rover has continued to study the Martian surface and atmosphere. The rover was also forced into a safe mode in September 2021, when a solar conjunction disrupted communications between Earth-based space agencies and all Martian spacecraft. Now, the issue is not with the motion of heavenly bodies but with local extreme weather.

The China National Space Administration told state-run media Xinhua that daytime temperatures could go below -4 degrees Fahrenheit, and nighttime temperatures could be a cog-chilling -148 degrees Fahrenheit. The agency stated that Zhurong won't wake up for a while-probably December, when the Martian spring returns, according to Xinhua. Comes with twelve different courses comprised of a huge number of lessons, and each one will help you learn more about Python itself, and can be accessed when you want and as often as you want forever, making it ideal for learning a new skill. Utopia Planitia's plain, like much of Mars, is dusty, making spacecraft on its surface susceptible to the massive storms kicked up by Martian winds. Such storms can be deadly to the Martian spacecraft that rely on solar power; the storms can blot out sunlight for months. A 2018 dust storm led to the end of NASA's Opportunity rover mission. In January this year, the InSight lander was forced into safe mode by a similar storm; though it survived, dust coating the lander's solar panels means the spacecraft is operating on borrowed time and probably will be decommissioned by the end of the year.

Zhurong landed on Mars a year ago this month; since then, the rover has recorded video and audio from a sweeping lava plain called Utopia Planitia, over 1,000 miles from NASA's Perseverance rover. Zhurong's initial mission was just 90 days, but since then the rover has continued to study the Martian surface and atmosphere. The rover was also forced into a safe mode in September 2021, when a solar conjunction disrupted communications between Earth-based space agencies and all Martian spacecraft. Now, the issue is not with the motion of heavenly bodies but with local extreme weather. Advertisement It's recently become winter in Utopia Planitia, and the conditions are harsh even without the dust storm. The China National Space Administration told state-run media Xinhua that daytime temperatures could go below -4 degrees Fahrenheit, and nighttime temperatures could be a cog-chilling -148 degrees Fahrenheit. The agency stated that Zhurong won't wake up for a while-probably December, when the Martian spring returns, according to Xinhua. Comes with twelve different courses comprised of a huge number of lessons, and each one will help you learn more about Python itself, and can be accessed when you want and as often as you want forever, making it ideal for learning a new skill. Utopia Planitia's plain, like much of Mars, is dusty, making spacecraft on its surface susceptible to the massive storms kicked up by Martian winds. Such storms can be deadly to the Martian spacecraft that rely on solar power; the storms can blot out sunlight for months. A 2018 dust storm led to the end of NASA's Opportunity rover mission. In January this year, the InSight lander was forced into safe mode by a similar storm; though it survived, dust coating the lander's solar panels means the spacecraft is operating on borrowed time and probably will be decommissioned by the end of the year. Advertisement Zhurong is expected to handle the ongoing storm with relative ease, though, and its safe mode is more a precaution than a desperate measure.

The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience this week, analyzed data collected by Zhurong over its first 60 Martian days, during which it has traveled approximately 450 meters. A team of researchers, led by Ding Liang of the Harbin Institute of Technology in northeast China, found that the Martian soil has high bearing strength and cohesion evidence of wind erosion after studying the surface rocks imaged by the rover's cameras. They also identified landscapes such as ridges, ripples and eroded craters, indicating that the site has been subject to long periods of weathering by the wind.

The Tianwen 1 orbiter and rover mission, which launched for Mars in July 2020, and Chang'e 5, which gathered the youngest lunar samples ever collected and delivered them to Earth later that year, are now delivering exciting science results. The new data and results emerging from the missions sparked a call for a special session at this year's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held in Texas and virtually beginning March 7. For example, samples of the 3.81 pounds of lunar regolith and rocks collected by Chang'e 5 have been made available for applications for science institutes and universities, and new insights are already emerging. The Chang'e 5 mission has opened a new era of China's lunar and planetary sciences, Yuqi Qian, a doctoral candidate at the School of Earth Sciences at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and an author of papers presented at LPSC, told Space.com. \"We have dozens of universities and institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences that have started to work on planetary sciences, with many new faces,\" Qian said. Teams at LPSC presented papers on a range of topics, including lunar petrology, the study of rocks and the conditions under which they form; textual analysis of samples; and assessments of the geological context of the landing area. A paper authored jointly by American, Chinese and European scientists notes how dating these relatively young Chang'e 5 samples, which are around 2 billion years old, allows for a refinement of the estimated ages of planetary surfaces in the solar system through counting the numbers of craters in particular areas. Areas with fewer craters are thought to be younger than those with more dense cratering, having had less time to be impacted by meteorites. Getting hold of samples and confirming the age of rocks through radioisotopic dating means scientists can verify and calibrate this technique. The new, young Chang'e 5 samples fill gaps left from estimates built on the Apollo samples, which are older than 3 billion years. The presence of material associated with the lunar highlands was found in the Chang'e 5 rocks, which were collected from Oceanus Procellarum, the largest lunar mare, or dark plain. Other presentations described unusually high water content at the landing site, suggesting the rocks in the area originated from the lunar interior. In addition to having a new presence at LPSC, China held its first planetary science conference last year and will have the second one this year. China's first interplanetary mission, Tianwen 1, which includes the Zhurong rover in the plain of Utopia Planitia, is also exciting the science community. Scientists from universitiesHong Kong and institutes in Wuhan and Weihai on the mainland noted that, unlike Mars' cold and oxidized surface, the subsurface of the Red Planet could provide the energy and liquid for past - or even present - life, making it an environment to search for biosignatures and evidence of life. Their paper focuses on mud volcanoes, which on Earth can expel subsurface materials from several miles deep and contain significant organic materials. Similar features on Mars in the vicinity of Zhurong could provide unique access to deep sediments, the scientists said. The rover - with its terrain camera, multispectral cameras and surface composition detector - can collect mineralogy and chemical data, while the ground-penetrating radar can peer up to around 330 feet below the surface. Zhurong could, therefore, provide fascinating new insight into what lies beneath the surface of Mars, the researchers said. Zhurong landed in Utopia Planitia in May 2021, and as of early February, the rover had driven a total of 5,043 feet. Tianwen 1 had been focused on relaying data from the rover to Earth until changing its orbit in November 2021 to begin its own dedicated science objectives. Currently, data from the Tianwen 1 mission are accessible only to Chinese scientists, but the data will soon be made available internationally via China's Lunar and Planetary Data Release System.

On May 15, 2021, it touched down at its pre-selected landing area in Utopia Planitia, a vast Martian plain, marking the first time that China has landed a probe on the planet. A week later on May 22, 2021, the Mars rover Zhurong, which resembles a butterfly, drove down from its landing platform to the Martian surface. On June 11, the China National Space Administration released the first photographs taken by Zhurong, signifying a complete success in the country's first Mars exploration mission. FRUITFUL RESULTS: Since landing, Zhurong has continued moving southward and transmitted data back to Earth. It has completed explorations of the Martian surface, passed through multiple complex terrains, and detected Martian rocks, sand dunes and impact craters, obtaining a large amount of data using its onboard scientific equipment. By Aug. 15, 2021, Zhurong had worked on the planet's surface for 90 Martian days, or about three months on Earth, accomplishing all exploration and detection tasks as planned. It was in good condition and continued service despite reaching its planned working target of 90 days. From late September to late October last year, the Mars orbiter and Zhurong suspended their explorations and relied on their own autonomous systems to survive their first solar outage, during which time solar electromagnetic radiation increased and disrupted communication between the probe and Earth. In November 2021, Zhurong and the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft performed an in-orbit relay communication test. In May this year, using data gathered by Zhurong on the landing site, Chinese scientists found new evidence suggesting the presence of liquid water activity and hydrated minerals on the red planet.

So far, Zhurong have been roving the landing site for a year and trekked nearly 2,000 meters on the Mars surface. Mars was once warm and wet billions of years ago, but something changed and caused the planet to become the arid, frozen desert it is today. The red planet entered this period during what is called the Amazonian epoch, which began about 3 billion years ago and remains ongoing. The latest findings on Zhurong rover's data suggested that water activities could be more frequent than what was once believed and that the landing site could store large deal of water in the form of minerals that could be exploited for the future human exploration to the Red Planet, media reports said.", "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1265451.shtml"}, {"title": "Tianwen-1 mission marks first year on Mars", "date": "2022-05-15", "content": "It has been a year since China's Tianwen-1 probe landed Mars. The mission has not only marked an important step in the country's interplanetary exploration but has also made a number of achievements in that time. The Tianwen-1 probe consists of an orbiter, a lander and a rover. On May 15, 2021, it touched down at its pre-selected landing area in Utopia Planitia, a vast Martian plain, marking the first time that China has landed a probe on the planet. A week later on May 22, 2021, the Mars rover Zhurong, which resembles a butterfly, drove down from its landing platform to the Martian surface. On June 11, the China National Space Administration released the first photographs taken by Zhurong, signifying a complete success in the country's first Mars exploration mission. FRUITFUL RESULTS: Since landing, Zhurong has continued moving southward and transmitted data back to Earth. It has completed explorations of the Martian surface, passed through multiple complex terrains, and detected Martian rocks, sand dunes and impact craters, obtaining a large amount of data using its onboard scientific equipment. By Aug. 15, 2021, Zhurong had worked on the planet's surface for 90 Martian days, or about three months on Earth, accomplishing all exploration and detection tasks as planned. It was in good condition and continued service despite reaching its planned working target of 90 days. From late September to late October last year, the Mars orbiter and Zhurong suspended their explorations and relied on their own autonomous systems to survive their first solar outage, during which time solar electromagnetic radiation increased and disrupted communication between the probe and Earth. In November 2021, Zhurong and the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft performed an in-orbit relay communication test. In May this year, using data gathered by Zhurong on the landing site, Chinese scientists found new evidence suggesting the presence of liquid water activity and hydrated minerals on the red planet. By May 5, 2022, the Tianwen-1 orbiter had been operating for 651 days at a distance of 240 million km from Earth. Zhurong had been working for 347 Martian days and traveled 1,921 meters. The orbiter and rover, operating normally, had obtained approximately 940 gigabytes of data. FUTURE ENDEAVORS: The Tianwen-1 mission is only the beginning of China's planetary exploration, and many new endeavors are in the pipeline. According to a white paper titled \"China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective,\" the country will continue its lunar exploration with the future Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7 and Chang'e-8 missions. It will complete the construction of an international lunar research station together with other countries, global organizations and partners. Future plans also include launching an asteroid probe, retrieving samples from near-Earth asteroids, and retrieving samples from Mars. The Tianwen-2 probe has entered the preliminary prototype development stage.", "url": "https://english.news.cn/20220515/42a6e7e2779541cd8b28d4c1cc5a5c2a/c.html"}, {"title": "China's Mars rover Zhurong goes dormant to survive sand, dust storms", "date": "2022-05-20", "content": "China's Mars rover Zhurong on May 18 went into dormancy to deal with the sand and dust storms on the Red Planet, according to the China National Space Administration. The administration said that Zhurong is predicted to resume its operation around December. To deal with the sandstorms which may weaken Zhurong's power generating capacity and the low temperatures at night, scientists decided to switch Zhurong to dormant mode. As Zhurong's landing area enters the winter season, the highest daytime temperatures drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius, while the night temperatures may drop below minus 100 degrees Celsius with a high probability of sandstorms. In the meantime, the Mars probe Tianwen-1 is conducting remote sensing over the planet.

Zhurong entered hibernation on May 18, with temperatures of around minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit during the local Mars day and minus 148 F during the night, according to a statement from the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program. China's Tianwen 1 orbiter, which delivered Zhurong to Mars last May, also detected sand and dust storm activity over Zhurong's landing area in Utopia Planitia with its medium-resolution camera. Zhurong has a few tricks in its design to help it withstand the challenges of winter temperatures and sand and dust storms. These measures include the ability to angle its solar panels to maximize sunlight collection and a special anti-dust coating on the panels. China's rover is not alone in its plight: NASA's InSight lander, which arrived on the Red Planet in November 2018, is also struggling to produce enough solar power to continue operations. In contrast, NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers can continue their journeys across the surface of Mars regardless of seasons, since they are powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators, a type of nuclear power. China's Yutu rovers on the moon are commanded to enter a dormant state for lunar nights, which last about 14 Earth days. However, the Zhurong rover will be able to autonomously detect the improvement in solar energy levels and power up once more, according to Chinese officials The rover is expected to resume activities again in December, with the onset of spring in the northern hemisphere and the clearing of local dust storms.", "url": "https://www.space.com/zhurong-china-mars-rover-hibernating-winter"}, {"title": "Dust Storm Sends China's Mars Rover Into Safe Mode", "date": "2022-05-24", "content": " China's Zhurong rover is currently in safe mode as it waits out a Martian dust storm, according to Chinese state-run media, and it may remain in safe mode until the end of 2022. Zhurong landed on Mars a year ago this month; since then, the rover has recorded video and audio from a sweeping lava plain called Utopia Planitia, over 1,000 miles from NASA's Perseverance rover. Zhurong's initial mission was just 90 days, but since then the rover has continued to study the Martian surface and atmosphere. The rover was also forced into a safe mode in September 2021, when a solar conjunction disrupted communications between Earth-based space agencies and all Martian spacecraft. Now, the issue is not with the motion of heavenly bodies but with local extreme weather. Advertisement It's recently become winter in Utopia Planitia, and the conditions are harsh even without the dust storm. The China National Space Administration told state-run media Xinhua that daytime temperatures could go below -4 degrees Fahrenheit, and nighttime temperatures could be a cog-chilling -148 degrees Fahrenheit. The agency stated that Zhurong won't wake up for a while-probably December, when the Martian spring returns, according to Xinhua. Comes with twelve different courses comprised of a huge number of lessons, and each one will help you learn more about Python itself, and can be accessed when you want and as often as you want forever, making it ideal for learning a new skill. Utopia Planitia's plain, like much of Mars, is dusty, making spacecraft on its surface susceptible to the massive storms kicked up by Martian winds. Such storms can be deadly to the Martian spacecraft that rely on solar power; the storms can blot out sunlight for months. A 2018 dust storm led to the end of NASA's Opportunity rover mission. In January this year, the InSight lander was forced into safe mode by a similar storm; though it survived, dust coating the lander's solar panels means the spacecraft is operating on borrowed time and probably will be decommissioned by the end of the year. Advertisement Zhurong is expected to handle the ongoing storm with relative ease, though, and its safe mode is more a precaution than a desperate measure. In the meantime, CNSA's Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter will continue to monitor the Martian atmosphere for any changes-for better or for worse-in the Red Planet's weather.
