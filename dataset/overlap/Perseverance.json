This announcement affirms the agency's commitment to a bold exploration program that meets our nation's scientific and human exploration objectives. \"The Obama administration is committed to a robust Mars exploration program,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. \"With this next mission, we're ensuring America remains the world leader in the exploration of the Red Planet, while taking another significant step toward sending humans there in the 2030s.\" The planned portfolio includes the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers; two NASA spacecraft and contributions to one European spacecraft currently orbiting Mars; the 2013 launch of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN orbiter to study the Martian upper atmosphere; the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport mission, which will take the first look into the deep interior of Mars; and participation in ESA's 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions, including providing \"Electra\" telecommunication radios to ESA's 2016 mission and a critical element of the premier astrobiology instrument on the 2018 ExoMars rover. The plan to design and build a new Mars robotic science rover with a launch in 2020 comes only months after the agency announced InSight, which will launch in 2016, bringing a total of seven NASA missions operating or being planned to study and explore our Earth-like neighbor. The 2020 mission will constitute another step toward being responsive to high-priority science goals and the president's challenge of sending humans to Mars orbit in the 2030s. The future rover development and design will be based on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) architecture that successfully carried the Curiosity rover to the Martian surface this summer. This will ensure mission costs and risks are as low as possible, while still delivering a highly capable rover with a proven landing system. The mission will constitute a vital component of a broad portfolio of Mars exploration missions in development for the coming decade. The mission will advance the science priorities of the National Research Council's 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey and responds to the findings of the Mars Program Planning Group established earlier this year to assist NASA in restructuring its Mars Exploration Program. \"The challenge to restructure the Mars Exploration Program has turned from the seven minutes of terror for the Curiosity landing to the start of seven years of innovation,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This mission concept fits within the current and projected Mars exploration budget, builds on the exciting discoveries of Curiosity, and takes advantage of a favorable launch opportunity.\" The specific payload and science instruments for the 2020 mission will be openly competed, following the Science Mission Directorate's established processes for instrument selection. This process will begin with the establishment of a science definition team that will be tasked to outline the scientific objectives for the mission. This mission fits within the five-year budget plan in the president's Fiscal Year 2013 budget request, and is contingent on future appropriations. Plans also will include opportunities for infusing new capabilities developed through investments by NASA's Space Technology Program, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and contributions from international partners.

The as-yet-unnamed rover is the second new Mars mission announced in the wake of the budget cuts that will be built using already-existing designs, a money-saving architecture agency officials say is more in line with current funding reality. \"The challenge to restructure the Mars Exploration Program has turned from the seven minutes of terror for the Curiosity landing to the start of seven years of innovation,\" John Grunsfeld, NASA's science chief, said in a statement. He was referring to Curiosity's innovative rocket-powered \"sky crane\" descent system that successfully lowered the nuclear-powered rover to the surface of Mars Aug. 6 after a nail-biting seven-minute plunge from space. \"This mission concept fits within the current and projected Mars exploration budget, builds on the exciting discoveries of Curiosity, and takes advantage of a favorable launch opportunity,\" Grunsfeld said after announcing the new mission at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San Francisco. In a briefing later Tuesday, Grunsfeld told reporters the availability of spare parts from Curiosity's development, including a backup nuclear generator, made the 2020 rover possible in the current budget environment. Equally, if not more important, he said, was the engineering expertise that got Curiosity to Mars. \"It's the availability of the spare parts but also the people and the engineering that went into building Curiosity that we still have,\" he said. \"This whole team...is still together and we're going to leverage that to build on the Mars 2020 rover. That's what enables us to do the whole plan within the current budget.\" The Obama administration's fiscal 2013 budget request called for a 20 percent reduction in NASA's planetary exploration budget with most of the cutbacks coming from the Mars program. Additional reductions are expected in later years. As a result, NASA pulled out of two planned Mars missions that would have been conducted jointly with the European Space Agency in 2016 and 2018. At that time, no other \"flagship\" planetary missions like Curiosity's were in development. Amid vocal criticism from some quarters of the scientific community, NASA began considering alternative approaches and mission scenarios. In August, just two weeks after Curiosity's touchdown, NASA announced that it would launch a relatively low-cost Mars lander in 2016 that will make a rocket-powered descent to the surface to study whether the red planet's core is solid or liquid and whether the planet has tectonic plates that slowly move like Earth's continents. Called InSight, for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, the new spacecraft will be based on the design of NASA's successful Phoenix probe, a traditional solar-powered legged lander that touched down near the north polar cap of of the red planet in May 2008. InSight will be equipped with a robotic arm, along with two black-and-white cameras and a geodetic instrument provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., to measure the planet's rotation axis. As a so-called Discovery-class mission, the cost is capped at $425 million, excluding the price of the launcher. The new rover announced Tuesday, along with the rocket needed to boost it to Mars, will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, according to a rough estimate by the Aerospace Corp. The Curiosity rover, the centerpiece of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, cost some $2.5 billion over a decade of development. But the new rover will not require the same development of new systems and technologies, Grunsfeld said, which will make it easier for NASA to control costs. Grunsfeld said the revised Mars program offers significant science that will keep NASA at the forefront of planetary exploration.", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/nasa-announces-plans-for-new-1-5-billion-mars-rover/"}, {"title": "NASA Outlines Budget, Scope for Next Mars Rover in 2020", "date": "2013-03-07", "content": "NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has barely scratched the surface of a planned two-year mission to assess if the solar system's most Earth-like planet ever had the chemistry for life, but planners of a bargain-priced 2020 follow-on rover already are eager for any lessons learned. That assessment, organized by the NASA chief engineer's office and expected to run about six months, kicked off on March 5, complementing work by a newly formed Mars 2020 Science Definition Team (SDT) to scope out instruments for the new rover that will meet the project's budget, deadlines and goals. \"Essentially they will be producing a document that we will use to develop the Announcement of Opportunity to select instruments to be on the 2020 mission,\" Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said at a webcast Mars program analysis group meeting Feb. 27. The 19-member SDT, headed by Brown University geologist Jack Mustard, has been told NASA will have about $80 million for rover science instruments, Meyer said, adding that at least one and possibly two more instruments, with a total value of about $20 million, also should be coming from participating international or other partners. \"We are quite interested in international partnering and I believe on the 2020 mission it could be extensive,\" said Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division. That cost estimate does not cover a Curiosity duplicate chassis, operating systems and support equipment; a sky crane entry, descent and landing system; and a robot arm, drill and possible sample cache, if one is included. Overall, NASA expects to spend about $1.5 billion on a second Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)-type rover, about $1 billion less than the cost of Curiosity, which landed on Mars Aug. 5. The cost also does not include a launch vehicle. Additional funding and instruments may come from NASA's human exploration and technology development divisions, Meyer added. Like Curiosity, the new rover, targeted for launch in 2020, will assess locations around its landing site for geological processes and chemistry that could have supported and preserved microbial life, but scientists also are weighing whether and how to directly search for biomarkers. A key question is whether the rover will cache samples for an eventual return to Earth. \"One specific question to the SDT is in fact whether or not to cache,\" Meyer said. Although Curiosity's initial budget for science instruments was $85 million in 2004 dollars, the agency ended up spending roughly twice that amount. \"It may very well be that the current instrumentation on MSL may not work financially for the 2020 mission, particularly since one of the issues is whether or not there's a cache, which could be a limitation on available volume for instrumentation,\" Meyer said. \"We really want open competition for the instrumentation to go on this mission. I don't doubt that some people will propose instrumentation that they're already familiar with building. That will be part of the equation when we go through weighing the pros and cons of those instruments that will be put on the mission,\" he added. In addition to taking advantage of engineering, testing and development that went into the Curiosity rover and landing system, NASA is looking to save money by reducing the number of science instruments and the complexity of integrating the payload. \"One of the things we learned from MSL is that adding another instrument, even if it's free, it's not free, and it greatly increases the complexity of the mission,\" Meyer said. \"Essentially, we are fiscally constrained. We just don't have the money, and in some ways we don't have the time, to develop the most sophisticated instruments to go on the 2020 rover,\" he said. The SDT is expected to issue an interim report mid-April. A final report is due May 31. NASA plans to put out a solicitation for rover science instruments this summer. In addition to its Mars 2020 rover, Maven orbiter and InSight lander, NASA is contributing to the European Space Agency's 2016 and 2018 Mars missions and the Indian Space Research Organisation's first Mars mission, which is scheduled for launch this fall. \"They have asked us for support in a number of areas, including tracking and navigation, for which we have agreed to help support them.

The team, composed of 19 scientists and engineers from universities and research organizations, proposed a mission concept that could accomplish several high-priority planetary science goals and be a major step in meeting President Obama's challenge to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. \"Crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major Mars mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington. \"The objectives determined by NASA with the input from this team will become the basis later this year for soliciting proposals to provide instruments to be part of the science payload on this exciting step in Mars exploration.\" NASA will conduct an open competition for the payload and science instruments. They will be placed on a rover similar to Curiosity, which landed on Mars almost a year ago. Using Curiosity's design will help minimize mission costs and risks and deliver a rover that can accomplish the mission objectives. The 2020 mission proposed by the Science Definition Team would build upon the accomplishments of Curiosity and other Mars missions. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with several orbiters, found evidence Mars has a watery history. Curiosity recently confirmed that past environmental conditions on Mars could have supported living microbes. According to the Science Definition Team, looking for signs of past life is the next logical step. The team's report details how the rover would use its instruments for visual, mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site and identify biosignatures, or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically. \"The Mars 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on Mars,\" said Jack Mustard, chairman of the Science Definition Team and a professor at the Geological Sciences at Brown University in Providence, R.I. \"However, given the recent Curiosity findings, past Martian life seems possible, and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life. No matter what we learn, we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on Earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.\" The measurements needed to explore a site on Mars to interpret ancient habitability and the potential for preserved biosignatures are identical to those needed to select and cache samples for future return to Earth. The Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth. The science conducted by the rover's instruments would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return the samples to Earth. \"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington. \"This mission represents a major step towards creating high-value sampling and interrogation methods, as part of a broader strategy for sample returns by planetary missions.\" Samples collected and analyzed by the rover will help inform future human exploration missions to Mars. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide, which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel. Improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface.

The new Mars rover - slated to launch in 2020 - should explore a site that once was habitable, make its own observations and snag material for scientists here on Earth to study in unprecedented detail at some point in the future, according to a new report compiled by the mission's \"science definition team\" (SDT). \"The SDT-preferred mission concept employs new in situ scientific instrumentation in order to seek signs of past life (had it been there), select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache and demonstrate technology for future robotic and human exploration of Mars,\" states the report, which was released to the public today (July 9). The 2020 Mars rover will be based heavily on NASA's Curiosity rover, which touched down last August on a mission to determine if Mars could ever have supported microbial life. For example, the new robot will use a similar chassis and \"sky crane\" landing system, NASA officials have said. But the 2020 rover will take the science to a whole new level. \"The 2020 rover as proposed by the Science Definition Team would carry a different and more advanced set of science instruments than Curiosity carries, its drill would extract cores rather than blended powder from rocks and it would collect and package samples for possible future return to Earth,\" NASA officials wrote today in an FAQ about the SDT's report. Just what those instruments will be is unclear at the moment; they will be selected through a competitive process. But the science gear will search for visual, mineralogical and chemical signs of past life if the SDT recommendations are adopted. \"The capability for examining the mineralogic composition of samples at microscopic scale would be unprecedented for a mission to Mars,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. \"The search for potential signs of past life could use assessments of textures, shapes, mineralogy, organic-matter content, and possibly elemental chemistry at the scale of individual grains within a sample.\" The rover would also gather and store samples for potential return to Earth by a future mission (the timing and details of which are yet to be determined). Sample-return is viewed by most scientists as the best way to look for signs of Red Planet life. The new rover's landing site has not been selected yet, officials said, and its power source similarly has not been confirmed. Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat generated by radioactive decay into electricity. The 2020 rover may follow suit, but it's also possible that it could run on solar power, like NASA's smaller Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004. \"No final decision on a power source for the 2020 rover would be made until the mission completes a review through the National Environmental Policy Act process, which considers the environmental impacts of launching and conducting the mission,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. Curiosity's mission cost a total of $2.5 billion. The 2020 rover is expected to be significantly cheaper, with a total price tag estimated at around $1.5 billion. The new 2020 rover mission was announced this past December, and the SDT was formed in January.

Planetary scientists howled last year when budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of European-led Mars missions planned for 2016 and 2018. The US agency regrouped, announcing in December that it would launch another Martian rover in 2020 using the same body and landing system as Curiosity, which touched down on the planet in August 2012. The agency asked a 19-person 'science-definition team' to determine which measurements the rover should be able to make to fulfil goals put forward by the US National Research Council (NRC). The rover is intended to examine a region of Mars that may once have harboured liquid water, scanning the region for signs of any life that may have developed there. To do that, the team says, it should be able to capture detailed images and measurements of the mineralogical and chemical composition of its rock and soil targets - including their organic carbon content. NASA, which estimates that the 2020 vehicle will cost about US$1.5 billion, asked the science team to limit the cost of the rover's scientific instruments to $100 million. That is much less than the $1.8 billion spent developing Curiosity and its instruments. Simple machine. As a result, the 2020 rover may have a simpler toolset than Curiosity's pricey on-board sample-processing equipment - but it might be more nimble. For example, the rover could use a technique known as 'deep ultraviolet' spectroscopy to look for signs of carbon in the spectra of sunlight reflected from rocks, says Jack Mustard, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and the leader of the science-definition team. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy provides less-detailed information than the equipment carried by Curiosity, which includes a laboratory that can detect the isotopic abundance of carbon in a sample to provide clues about whether it was produced by life. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy cannot distinguish organic carbon that fell to Mars on a comet from organic carbon created by life, but it is relatively fast and cheap. \"You have a trade-off there,\" Mustard says. But if the 2020 rover does find a particularly interesting sample, researchers on Earth might one day get to scrutinize it first hand. The team's report says that the 2020 rover should be able to store, or cache, soil and rock samples for retrieval by a later mission - a capability identified in a 2011 NRC report as the top priority for Mars missions over the next decade. Returning samples for study on Earth is the only way to rigorously test for signs of life, says Mustard. He says that the 2020 rover could be equipped to collect a total of 300-400 grams of material from more than 30 spots. But just when NASA might collect those samples is unclear. \"We're not signing up to a timetable or a commitment for a follow-on mission,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for science at NASA in Washington DC, told reporters Tuesday. Still, the fact that NASA is taking the first step towards sample return is reason for celebration, says Phil Christensen, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, who chaired the Mars panel for the 2011 NRC report. \"I think those samples sitting on the surface are going to be this incredible magnet crying out, 'Come get me!'\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13365"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Science Team Outlines Goals for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover", "date": "2013-07-09", "content": "The rover NASA will send to Mars in 2020 should look for signs of past life, collect samples for possible future return to Earth, and demonstrate technology for future human exploration of the Red Planet, according to a report provided to the agency.

The Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth. The science conducted by the rover's instruments would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return the samples to Earth. \"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington. \"This mission represents a major step towards creating high-value sampling and interrogation methods, as part of a broader strategy for sample returns by planetary missions.\" Samples collected and analyzed by the rover will help inform future human exploration missions to Mars. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide, which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel. Improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface.

The new Mars rover - slated to launch in 2020 - should explore a site that once was habitable, make its own observations and snag material for scientists here on Earth to study in unprecedented detail at some point in the future, according to a new report compiled by the mission's \"science definition team\" (SDT). \"The SDT-preferred mission concept employs new in situ scientific instrumentation in order to seek signs of past life (had it been there), select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache and demonstrate technology for future robotic and human exploration of Mars,\" states the report, which was released to the public today (July 9). The 2020 Mars rover will be based heavily on NASA's Curiosity rover, which touched down last August on a mission to determine if Mars could ever have supported microbial life. For example, the new robot will use a similar chassis and \"sky crane\" landing system, NASA officials have said. But the 2020 rover will take the science to a whole new level. \"The 2020 rover as proposed by the Science Definition Team would carry a different and more advanced set of science instruments than Curiosity carries, its drill would extract cores rather than blended powder from rocks and it would collect and package samples for possible future return to Earth,\" NASA officials wrote today in an FAQ about the SDT's report. Just what those instruments will be is unclear at the moment; they will be selected through a competitive process. But the science gear will search for visual, mineralogical and chemical signs of past life if the SDT recommendations are adopted. \"The capability for examining the mineralogic composition of samples at microscopic scale would be unprecedented for a mission to Mars,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. \"The search for potential signs of past life could use assessments of textures, shapes, mineralogy, organic-matter content, and possibly elemental chemistry at the scale of individual grains within a sample.\" The rover would also gather and store samples for potential return to Earth by a future mission (the timing and details of which are yet to be determined). Sample-return is viewed by most scientists as the best way to look for signs of Red Planet life. The new rover's landing site has not been selected yet, officials said, and its power source similarly has not been confirmed. Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat generated by radioactive decay into electricity. The 2020 rover may follow suit, but it's also possible that it could run on solar power, like NASA's smaller Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004. \"No final decision on a power source for the 2020 rover would be made until the mission completes a review through the National Environmental Policy Act process, which considers the environmental impacts of launching and conducting the mission,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. Curiosity's mission cost a total of $2.5 billion. The 2020 rover is expected to be significantly cheaper, with a total price tag estimated at around $1.5 billion. The new 2020 rover mission was announced this past December, and the SDT was formed in January.

Planetary scientists howled last year when budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of European-led Mars missions planned for 2016 and 2018. The US agency regrouped, announcing in December that it would launch another Martian rover in 2020 using the same body and landing system as Curiosity, which touched down on the planet in August 2012. The agency asked a 19-person 'science-definition team' to determine which measurements the rover should be able to make to fulfil goals put forward by the US National Research Council (NRC). The rover is intended to examine a region of Mars that may once have harboured liquid water, scanning the region for signs of any life that may have developed there. To do that, the team says, it should be able to capture detailed images and measurements of the mineralogical and chemical composition of its rock and soil targets - including their organic carbon content. NASA, which estimates that the 2020 vehicle will cost about US$1.5 billion, asked the science team to limit the cost of the rover's scientific instruments to $100 million. That is much less than the $1.8 billion spent developing Curiosity and its instruments. Simple machine. As a result, the 2020 rover may have a simpler toolset than Curiosity's pricey on-board sample-processing equipment - but it might be more nimble. For example, the rover could use a technique known as 'deep ultraviolet' spectroscopy to look for signs of carbon in the spectra of sunlight reflected from rocks, says Jack Mustard, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and the leader of the science-definition team. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy provides less-detailed information than the equipment carried by Curiosity, which includes a laboratory that can detect the isotopic abundance of carbon in a sample to provide clues about whether it was produced by life. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy cannot distinguish organic carbon that fell to Mars on a comet from organic carbon created by life, but it is relatively fast and cheap. \"You have a trade-off there,\" Mustard says. But if the 2020 rover does find a particularly interesting sample, researchers on Earth might one day get to scrutinize it first hand. The team's report says that the 2020 rover should be able to store, or cache, soil and rock samples for retrieval by a later mission - a capability identified in a 2011 NRC report as the top priority for Mars missions over the next decade. Returning samples for study on Earth is the only way to rigorously test for signs of life, says Mustard. He says that the 2020 rover could be equipped to collect a total of 300-400 grams of material from more than 30 spots. But just when NASA might collect those samples is unclear. \"We're not signing up to a timetable or a commitment for a follow-on mission,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for science at NASA in Washington DC, told reporters Tuesday. Still, the fact that NASA is taking the first step towards sample return is reason for celebration, says Phil Christensen, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, who chaired the Mars panel for the 2011 NRC report. \"I think those samples sitting on the surface are going to be this incredible magnet crying out, 'Come get me!'\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13365"}, {"title": "NASA Wants Investigations for a Mars 2020 Rover", "date": "2013-09-27", "content": "NASA has released its announcement of an open competition for the planetary community to submit proposals for the science and exploration technology instruments that would be carried aboard the agency's next Mars rover, scheduled for launch in July/August of 2020.

Depending on what scientists propose for the Mars 2020 rover's instrument package, a solicitation that closes in January, the ISRU technology demonstration also could include actual oxygen production. \"Our primary focus, at least for this demonstration, is separation [of carbon dioxide] because that's absolutely essential to test and know that we can pull that off\" on Mars, said James Reuther, deputy associate administrator of programs in NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. The space agency is interested in small, low-power, highly efficient machines that could handle Mars' variable pressure and temperatures, dust levels, atmospheric conditions and seasonal changes. One flight-certified prototype already exists. The Mars ISRU Precursor (MIP) was planned for NASA's 2001 Mars Surveyor Lander, but the mission was canceled. \"MIP included a very small solid oxide electrolysis device to electrolyze Mars atmosphere carbon dioxide into oxygen. The device is about one-twentieth scale of what is required for Mars 2020 mission,\" said planetary scientist Paul Spudis with the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. \"MIP got to a certain level of maturity where we thought we could make it work as a demo,\" Reuther said. \"It didn't happen. We certainly understand that technology and in this [announcement of opportunity] that might be the one that actually ends up going forward. But there are several other technologies that we think are more efficient that are out there.\" NASA expects to select the Mars 2020 science instruments in April, though Reuther said because NASA's human space exploration and technology directorates are paying for the ISRU demo, \"we're pretty confident\" one will be aboard. How much mass, volume and power will be allotted to the device will be determined as part of the overall competition, he added. The Mars 2020 Science Definition Team estimated a full ISRU demonstration, including capturing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, would cost about $55 million. A device to demonstrate just the carbon dioxide capture would be about $22 million. \"We don't know enough about the aerosols on the planet to know if carbon dioxide capture is going to be an easy task or an impossible task or an extremely long and tedious task. All those questions have to be answered before you can design a machine that will optimize the production of what you want to make,\" Spudis said. \"That's the purpose of doing an ISRU experiment. It's to get your hands dirty and try to do it in the alien environment and then see, 'What is it that I haven't thought of that's going to come and bite me in butt?' That's really the question you're trying to answer,\" he said. NASA ultimately would like to produce oxygen on Mars so that it could fuel a Mars-launched rocket heading back to Earth. \"Oxidizer is typically the big mass fraction in launch systems. If you can demonstrate that you can make oxygen, that would serve not only Mars sample return, but also ultimately human missions as well,\" Spudis said. \"Every pound that you don't have to launch from the Earth of dumb mass - things like water and air and propellant - means that you can add a pound of intelligent mass - an experiment, a computer, something designed to accomplish some job or give us some capability. So doing ISRU gives you incredible leverage,\" he said. Mars is not the only body beyond Earth NASA is eyeing for an ISRU demonstration. The proposed Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatiles Extraction, or RESOLVE, mission to the Moon, targeted for launch in 2018, is primarily a mission to inventory water, gases and other volatiles in the soil at one of the lunar poles. But the small rover also would include a device to try to extract water by heating some presumably oxygen-rich lunar soil and running hydrogen through it. \"We've been looking at ISRU for quite a number of years,\" said ISRU chief engineer Gerald Sanders at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Some say if you incorporate ISRU into your architectures, whether it's the Moon or Mars, you can get significant benefits, in mass reductions and potential long-term cost reductions and risk reductions.\" \"The problem is sort of a chicken-and-the-egg: There's an inherent risk of putting ISRU in the critical path of mission success, so it's been stated that you need to do demonstrations. That said, a lot of times funding is associated only with things that are in the critical path for human missions. So we've been kind of in a Catch-22,\" he said. \"The importance of a mission ... like RESOLVE or even the Mars 2020 small ISRU demo that we're talking about having, is that it kind of breaks that cycle. It starts showing that ISRU is potentially practical. ... If it pans out, you can start seriously thinking about how you would change your exploration approach,\" Sanders said.

Improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface.

The new Mars rover - slated to launch in 2020 - should explore a site that once was habitable, make its own observations and snag material for scientists here on Earth to study in unprecedented detail at some point in the future, according to a new report compiled by the mission's \"science definition team\" (SDT). \"The SDT-preferred mission concept employs new in situ scientific instrumentation in order to seek signs of past life (had it been there), select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache and demonstrate technology for future robotic and human exploration of Mars,\" states the report, which was released to the public today (July 9). The 2020 Mars rover will be based heavily on NASA's Curiosity rover, which touched down last August on a mission to determine if Mars could ever have supported microbial life. For example, the new robot will use a similar chassis and \"sky crane\" landing system, NASA officials have said. But the 2020 rover will take the science to a whole new level. \"The 2020 rover as proposed by the Science Definition Team would carry a different and more advanced set of science instruments than Curiosity carries, its drill would extract cores rather than blended powder from rocks and it would collect and package samples for possible future return to Earth,\" NASA officials wrote today in an FAQ about the SDT's report. Just what those instruments will be is unclear at the moment; they will be selected through a competitive process. But the science gear will search for visual, mineralogical and chemical signs of past life if the SDT recommendations are adopted. \"The capability for examining the mineralogic composition of samples at microscopic scale would be unprecedented for a mission to Mars,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. \"The search for potential signs of past life could use assessments of textures, shapes, mineralogy, organic-matter content, and possibly elemental chemistry at the scale of individual grains within a sample.\" The rover would also gather and store samples for potential return to Earth by a future mission (the timing and details of which are yet to be determined). Sample-return is viewed by most scientists as the best way to look for signs of Red Planet life. The new rover's landing site has not been selected yet, officials said, and its power source similarly has not been confirmed. Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat generated by radioactive decay into electricity. The 2020 rover may follow suit, but it's also possible that it could run on solar power, like NASA's smaller Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in 2004. \"No final decision on a power source for the 2020 rover would be made until the mission completes a review through the National Environmental Policy Act process, which considers the environmental impacts of launching and conducting the mission,\" NASA officials wrote in the FAQ. Curiosity's mission cost a total of $2.5 billion. The 2020 rover is expected to be significantly cheaper, with a total price tag estimated at around $1.5 billion. The new 2020 rover mission was announced this past December, and the SDT was formed in January.

Planetary scientists howled last year when budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of European-led Mars missions planned for 2016 and 2018. The US agency regrouped, announcing in December that it would launch another Martian rover in 2020 using the same body and landing system as Curiosity, which touched down on the planet in August 2012. The agency asked a 19-person 'science-definition team' to determine which measurements the rover should be able to make to fulfil goals put forward by the US National Research Council (NRC). The rover is intended to examine a region of Mars that may once have harboured liquid water, scanning the region for signs of any life that may have developed there. To do that, the team says, it should be able to capture detailed images and measurements of the mineralogical and chemical composition of its rock and soil targets - including their organic carbon content. NASA, which estimates that the 2020 vehicle will cost about US$1.5 billion, asked the science team to limit the cost of the rover's scientific instruments to $100 million. That is much less than the $1.8 billion spent developing Curiosity and its instruments. Simple machine. As a result, the 2020 rover may have a simpler toolset than Curiosity's pricey on-board sample-processing equipment - but it might be more nimble. For example, the rover could use a technique known as 'deep ultraviolet' spectroscopy to look for signs of carbon in the spectra of sunlight reflected from rocks, says Jack Mustard, a planetary scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and the leader of the science-definition team. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy provides less-detailed information than the equipment carried by Curiosity, which includes a laboratory that can detect the isotopic abundance of carbon in a sample to provide clues about whether it was produced by life. Deep ultraviolet spectroscopy cannot distinguish organic carbon that fell to Mars on a comet from organic carbon created by life, but it is relatively fast and cheap. \"You have a trade-off there,\" Mustard says. But if the 2020 rover does find a particularly interesting sample, researchers on Earth might one day get to scrutinize it first hand. The team's report says that the 2020 rover should be able to store, or cache, soil and rock samples for retrieval by a later mission - a capability identified in a 2011 NRC report as the top priority for Mars missions over the next decade. Returning samples for study on Earth is the only way to rigorously test for signs of life, says Mustard. He says that the 2020 rover could be equipped to collect a total of 300-400 grams of material from more than 30 spots. But just when NASA might collect those samples is unclear. \"We're not signing up to a timetable or a commitment for a follow-on mission,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for science at NASA in Washington DC, told reporters Tuesday. Still, the fact that NASA is taking the first step towards sample return is reason for celebration, says Phil Christensen, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, who chaired the Mars panel for the 2011 NRC report. \"I think those samples sitting on the surface are going to be this incredible magnet crying out, 'Come get me!'\" ", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.13365"}, {"title": "NASA Wants Investigations for a Mars 2020 Rover", "date": "2013-09-27", "content": "NASA has released its announcement of an open competition for the planetary community to submit proposals for the science and exploration technology instruments that would be carried aboard the agency's next Mars rover, scheduled for launch in July/August of 2020.

Officially called the Mars 2020 Mission Investigations Announcement of Opportunity (AO), this competition solicits flight investigations for which each principal investigator or scientist is responsible for a complete space flight investigation, including instrument hardware, mission operations and data analysis. The total allocated cost for development of all the investigations selected and funded by NASA is approximately $130 million. The competitively selected instruments will be placed on a rover similar to Curiosity, which landed on Mars in August 2012. Using Curiosity's design will help minimize mission costs and risks and deliver a rover that can accomplish the mission objectives. The Mars 2020 mission also would build upon the scientific accomplishments of Curiosity and other previous Mars missions. So what is different about Mars 2020? In January 2013, NASA appointed a Science Definition Team to outline objectives for the Mars 2020 mission. The team, composed of 19 scientists and engineers from universities and research organizations, proposed a mission concept that could accomplish several high-priority planetary science goals and be a major step in meeting President Obama's challenge to send humans to Mars in the 2030s.

Depending on what scientists propose for the Mars 2020 rover's instrument package, a solicitation that closes in January, the ISRU technology demonstration also could include actual oxygen production. \"Our primary focus, at least for this demonstration, is separation [of carbon dioxide] because that's absolutely essential to test and know that we can pull that off\" on Mars, said James Reuther, deputy associate administrator of programs in NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. The space agency is interested in small, low-power, highly efficient machines that could handle Mars' variable pressure and temperatures, dust levels, atmospheric conditions and seasonal changes. One flight-certified prototype already exists. The Mars ISRU Precursor (MIP) was planned for NASA's 2001 Mars Surveyor Lander, but the mission was canceled. \"MIP included a very small solid oxide electrolysis device to electrolyze Mars atmosphere carbon dioxide into oxygen. The device is about one-twentieth scale of what is required for Mars 2020 mission,\" said planetary scientist Paul Spudis with the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. \"MIP got to a certain level of maturity where we thought we could make it work as a demo,\" Reuther said. \"It didn't happen. We certainly understand that technology and in this [announcement of opportunity] that might be the one that actually ends up going forward. But there are several other technologies that we think are more efficient that are out there.\" NASA expects to select the Mars 2020 science instruments in April, though Reuther said because NASA's human space exploration and technology directorates are paying for the ISRU demo, \"we're pretty confident\" one will be aboard. How much mass, volume and power will be allotted to the device will be determined as part of the overall competition, he added. The Mars 2020 Science Definition Team estimated a full ISRU demonstration, including capturing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, would cost about $55 million. A device to demonstrate just the carbon dioxide capture would be about $22 million. \"We don't know enough about the aerosols on the planet to know if carbon dioxide capture is going to be an easy task or an impossible task or an extremely long and tedious task. All those questions have to be answered before you can design a machine that will optimize the production of what you want to make,\" Spudis said. \"That's the purpose of doing an ISRU experiment. It's to get your hands dirty and try to do it in the alien environment and then see, 'What is it that I haven't thought of that's going to come and bite me in butt?' That's really the question you're trying to answer,\" he said. NASA ultimately would like to produce oxygen on Mars so that it could fuel a Mars-launched rocket heading back to Earth. \"Oxidizer is typically the big mass fraction in launch systems. If you can demonstrate that you can make oxygen, that would serve not only Mars sample return, but also ultimately human missions as well,\" Spudis said. \"Every pound that you don't have to launch from the Earth of dumb mass - things like water and air and propellant - means that you can add a pound of intelligent mass - an experiment, a computer, something designed to accomplish some job or give us some capability. So doing ISRU gives you incredible leverage,\" he said. Mars is not the only body beyond Earth NASA is eyeing for an ISRU demonstration. The proposed Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatiles Extraction, or RESOLVE, mission to the Moon, targeted for launch in 2018, is primarily a mission to inventory water, gases and other volatiles in the soil at one of the lunar poles. But the small rover also would include a device to try to extract water by heating some presumably oxygen-rich lunar soil and running hydrogen through it. \"We've been looking at ISRU for quite a number of years,\" said ISRU chief engineer Gerald Sanders at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Some say if you incorporate ISRU into your architectures, whether it's the Moon or Mars, you can get significant benefits, in mass reductions and potential long-term cost reductions and risk reductions.\" \"The problem is sort of a chicken-and-the-egg: There's an inherent risk of putting ISRU in the critical path of mission success, so it's been stated that you need to do demonstrations.

So we've been kind of in a Catch-22,\" he said. \"The importance of a mission ... like RESOLVE or even the Mars 2020 small ISRU demo that we're talking about having, is that it kind of breaks that cycle.

It should come as no surprise then that when NASA started looking at the next wheeled robot that it wanted to send to the Red Planet - that it would base it off of the MSL design. The rover, which for now is simply called, the 2020 Mars Rover, has only been briefly described by the space agency. However, what clues have been given about its abilities and characteristics offer a tantalizing glimpse into future. NASA's Mars Program Planning Group has been stated as one of the guiding influences behind the decision to build yet another rover and that it be based on Curiosity's design. The way that Curiosity was developed and built lent itself to being utilized as a template for future rovers. The reason for this bit of forethought is readily understandable given the current economic environment. As with most everything these days, NASA is concerned about the cost of its missions. One of the largest factors in planetary missions is the expense of development. In an effort to limit development costs, NASA decided that, if it isn't broke - why fix it? As such, they opted to use the proven design of MSL. NASA even had some spare components leftover from Curiosity's construction. There will be some differences between the two rovers however, primarily in the instruments that the robot will carry with it. As the Mars 2020 rover will be following in the footsteps of Curiosity, it will have new questions to seek answers to, fresh investigations that it has to conduct. The landing system, however, will be very familiar to MSL fans. Both the acclaimed sky crane rocket as well as the heat shield will be virtually the same as those employed on MSL. As for the types of experiments which will be part of the rover's backpack - NASA is working on what those might be. The U.S. space agency announced an open competition for scientists in the planetary community to submit proposals for what instruments the Mars 2020 rover will bring with it. In January 2013, a Science Definition Team was selected by the space agency so as to define what the objectives of the Mars 2020 rover mission would be. It was composed of 19 scientists and engineers from a wide range of organizations and research facilities. They were, in essence, the ones who would develop the rover's core mission keeping in mind that it must achieve several high-priority scientific goals and that one of those was to aid in the accomplishment of sending crew to the Red Planet in the 2030s as directed by President Obama. NASA has stated that the Mars 2020 rover's primary mission will be to determine whether-or-not the Red Planet is a possible habitat for life, that is will seek out past evidence life existed there and it will collect specimens for a potential sample-return flight to Earth. Most intriguingly perhaps is that NASA has stated the rover will also demonstrate technologies which could enable future human exploration missions to Mars. How this will be accomplished is unclear. \"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"The science conducted by the rover's instruments also would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return any collected samples to Earth.\" Whatever mission requirements that the 2020 Mars Rover is assigned, one thing is clear - the Mars 2020 did not reach its destination without a wealth of experience in conducting Mars rover operations. When the 2020 Mars Rover sets down on the dusty Martian surface, it will follow a growing line of those that came before her. Starting with the 1993 Mars Pathfinder mission which was the first rover to be sent to the Red Planet. Then the \"twin\" Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity which landed back in 2004 - each of which far exceeded their design parameters (in fact, Opportunity is continuing to explore Mars to this very day). Finally, in August of 2012, Curiosity began her journey of discovery at Gusev Crater. \"For many folks last summer was an incredible ride, seven minutes of terror to get Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars,\" said NASA astronaut and the space agency's current Associate Administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate, John Grunsfeld. \"The year after has been an incredible drive - even though we are still on our way to Mount Sharp. We still have a fundamental question to answer and it is one that has piqued the curiosity of astronomers and planetary scientists for quite a while of, did Mars ever have an environment that was habitable for life - is there or has there ever been life on Mars? Does Mars support life now?\" The question of whether-or-not Mars ever been able to support life was, at least in a microbial sense, was the key mission for the Mars Science laboratory. It was one that Grunsfeld said harkens back to the very first landers to successfully touch down on Mars. \"Back when I was in High School in the 1970s we sent the Viking landers to answer that question, and it was very exciting, very challenging - these were grand voyages,\" Grunsfeld added. \"However, from these missions, Mars appeared to be somewhat lifeless - but the question remained - did Mars ever have an environment that was potentially habitable for life?\" That question has come into increasingly sharper focus since the Viking landers touched down in 1976. For a long time afterward, Mars faded from the scientific consciousness as the data gleaned from the spacecraft that had traveled to the Red Planet suggested that it was a lifeless world and one which was unlikely to have supported life in its past. However, with the uptick in missions and interest in Mars that began in the 1990s, it has become increasingly clear that Mars was not always as we see it today. The 2020 Mars Rover will serve to deepen our knowledge of the planet's history. What Curiosity has done, is, essentially, lay another layer of understanding about the forces which have shaped the Red Planet. One of these elements in particular, the Martian atmosphere, will come into sharper focus next year with the arrival of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN arrives at Mars. It will look into how Mars' atmosphere has been shaped throughout the planet's life. The 2020 Mars Rover will doubtlessly continue the narrative that began with Viking and could redefine how we view the Red Planet and its history.

The landing system, however, will be very familiar to MSL fans. Both the acclaimed sky crane rocket as well as the heat shield will be virtually the same as those employed on MSL. As for the types of experiments which will be part of the rover's backpack - NASA is working on what those might be. The U.S. space agency announced an open competition for scientists in the planetary community to submit proposals for what instruments the Mars 2020 rover will bring with it. In January 2013, a Science Definition Team was selected by the space agency so as to define what the objectives of the Mars 2020 rover mission would be. It was composed of 19 scientists and engineers from a wide range of organizations and research facilities. They were, in essence, the ones who would develop the rover's core mission keeping in mind that it must achieve several high-priority scientific goals and that one of those was to aid in the accomplishment of sending crew to the Red Planet in the 2030s as directed by President Obama. NASA has stated that the Mars 2020 rover's primary mission will be to determine whether-or-not the Red Planet is a possible habitat for life, that is will seek out past evidence life existed there and it will collect specimens for a potential sample-return flight to Earth. Most intriguingly perhaps is that NASA has stated the rover will also demonstrate technologies which could enable future human exploration missions to Mars. How this will be accomplished is unclear. \"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"The science conducted by the rover's instruments also would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return any collected samples to Earth.\" Whatever mission requirements that the 2020 Mars Rover is assigned, one thing is clear - the Mars 2020 did not reach its destination without a wealth of experience in conducting Mars rover operations. When the 2020 Mars Rover sets down on the dusty Martian surface, it will follow a growing line of those that came before her. Starting with the 1993 Mars Pathfinder mission which was the first rover to be sent to the Red Planet. Then the \"twin\" Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity which landed back in 2004 - each of which far exceeded their design parameters (in fact, Opportunity is continuing to explore Mars to this very day). Finally, in August of 2012, Curiosity began her journey of discovery at Gusev Crater. \"For many folks last summer was an incredible ride, seven minutes of terror to get Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars,\" said NASA astronaut and the space agency's current Associate Administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate, John Grunsfeld. \"The year after has been an incredible drive - even though we are still on our way to Mount Sharp. We still have a fundamental question to answer and it is one that has piqued the curiosity of astronomers and planetary scientists for quite a while of, did Mars ever have an environment that was habitable for life - is there or has there ever been life on Mars? Does Mars support life now?\" The question of whether-or-not Mars ever been able to support life was, at least in a microbial sense, was the key mission for the Mars Science laboratory. It was one that Grunsfeld said harkens back to the very first landers to successfully touch down on Mars. \"Back when I was in High School in the 1970s we sent the Viking landers to answer that question, and it was very exciting, very challenging - these were grand voyages,\" Grunsfeld added. \"However, from these missions, Mars appeared to be somewhat lifeless - but the question remained - did Mars ever have an environment that was potentially habitable for life?\" That question has come into increasingly sharper focus since the Viking landers touched down in 1976. For a long time afterward, Mars faded from the scientific consciousness as the data gleaned from the spacecraft that had traveled to the Red Planet suggested that it was a lifeless world and one which was unlikely to have supported life in its past. However, with the uptick in missions and interest in Mars that began in the 1990s, it has become increasingly clear that Mars was not always as we see it today. The 2020 Mars Rover will serve to deepen our knowledge of the planet's history. What Curiosity has done, is, essentially, lay another layer of understanding about the forces which have shaped the Red Planet. One of these elements in particular, the Martian atmosphere, will come into sharper focus next year with the arrival of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN arrives at Mars. It will look into how Mars' atmosphere has been shaped throughout the planet's life. The 2020 Mars Rover will doubtlessly continue the narrative that began with Viking and could redefine how we view the Red Planet and its history.

Depending on what scientists propose for the Mars 2020 rover's instrument package, a solicitation that closes in January, the ISRU technology demonstration also could include actual oxygen production. \"Our primary focus, at least for this demonstration, is separation [of carbon dioxide] because that's absolutely essential to test and know that we can pull that off\" on Mars, said James Reuther, deputy associate administrator of programs in NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. The space agency is interested in small, low-power, highly efficient machines that could handle Mars' variable pressure and temperatures, dust levels, atmospheric conditions and seasonal changes. One flight-certified prototype already exists. The Mars ISRU Precursor (MIP) was planned for NASA's 2001 Mars Surveyor Lander, but the mission was canceled. \"MIP included a very small solid oxide electrolysis device to electrolyze Mars atmosphere carbon dioxide into oxygen. The device is about one-twentieth scale of what is required for Mars 2020 mission,\" said planetary scientist Paul Spudis with the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. \"MIP got to a certain level of maturity where we thought we could make it work as a demo,\" Reuther said. \"It didn't happen. We certainly understand that technology and in this [announcement of opportunity] that might be the one that actually ends up going forward. But there are several other technologies that we think are more efficient that are out there.\" NASA expects to select the Mars 2020 science instruments in April, though Reuther said because NASA's human space exploration and technology directorates are paying for the ISRU demo, \"we're pretty confident\" one will be aboard. How much mass, volume and power will be allotted to the device will be determined as part of the overall competition, he added. The Mars 2020 Science Definition Team estimated a full ISRU demonstration, including capturing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, would cost about $55 million. A device to demonstrate just the carbon dioxide capture would be about $22 million. \"We don't know enough about the aerosols on the planet to know if carbon dioxide capture is going to be an easy task or an impossible task or an extremely long and tedious task. All those questions have to be answered before you can design a machine that will optimize the production of what you want to make,\" Spudis said. \"That's the purpose of doing an ISRU experiment. It's to get your hands dirty and try to do it in the alien environment and then see, 'What is it that I haven't thought of that's going to come and bite me in butt?' That's really the question you're trying to answer,\" he said. NASA ultimately would like to produce oxygen on Mars so that it could fuel a Mars-launched rocket heading back to Earth. \"Oxidizer is typically the big mass fraction in launch systems. If you can demonstrate that you can make oxygen, that would serve not only Mars sample return, but also ultimately human missions as well,\" Spudis said. \"Every pound that you don't have to launch from the Earth of dumb mass - things like water and air and propellant - means that you can add a pound of intelligent mass - an experiment, a computer, something designed to accomplish some job or give us some capability. So doing ISRU gives you incredible leverage,\" he said. Mars is not the only body beyond Earth NASA is eyeing for an ISRU demonstration. The proposed Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatiles Extraction, or RESOLVE, mission to the Moon, targeted for launch in 2018, is primarily a mission to inventory water, gases and other volatiles in the soil at one of the lunar poles. But the small rover also would include a device to try to extract water by heating some presumably oxygen-rich lunar soil and running hydrogen through it. \"We've been looking at ISRU for quite a number of years,\" said ISRU chief engineer Gerald Sanders at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Some say if you incorporate ISRU into your architectures, whether it's the Moon or Mars, you can get significant benefits, in mass reductions and potential long-term cost reductions and risk reductions.\" \"The problem is sort of a chicken-and-the-egg: There's an inherent risk of putting ISRU in the critical path of mission success, so it's been stated that you need to do demonstrations. That said, a lot of times funding is associated only with things that are in the critical path for human missions. So we've been kind of in a Catch-22,\" he said. \"The importance of a mission ... like RESOLVE or even the Mars 2020 small ISRU demo that we're talking about having, is that it kind of breaks that cycle. It starts showing that ISRU is potentially practical. ... If it pans out, you can start seriously thinking about how you would change your exploration approach,\" Sanders said.

It should come as no surprise then that when NASA started looking at the next wheeled robot that it wanted to send to the Red Planet - that it would base it off of the MSL design. The rover, which for now is simply called, the 2020 Mars Rover, has only been briefly described by the space agency. However, what clues have been given about its abilities and characteristics offer a tantalizing glimpse into future. NASA's Mars Program Planning Group has been stated as one of the guiding influences behind the decision to build yet another rover and that it be based on Curiosity's design. The way that Curiosity was developed and built lent itself to being utilized as a template for future rovers. The reason for this bit of forethought is readily understandable given the current economic environment. As with most everything these days, NASA is concerned about the cost of its missions. One of the largest factors in planetary missions is the expense of development. In an effort to limit development costs, NASA decided that, if it isn't broke - why fix it? As such, they opted to use the proven design of MSL. NASA even had some spare components leftover from Curiosity's construction. There will be some differences between the two rovers however, primarily in the instruments that the robot will carry with it.

It should come as no surprise then that when NASA started looking at the next wheeled robot that it wanted to send to the Red Planet - that it would base it off of the MSL design. The rover, which for now is simply called, the 2020 Mars Rover, has only been briefly described by the space agency. However, what clues have been given about its abilities and characteristics offer a tantalizing glimpse into future. NASA's Mars Program Planning Group has been stated as one of the guiding influences behind the decision to build yet another rover and that it be based on Curiosity's design. The way that Curiosity was developed and built lent itself to being utilized as a template for future rovers. The reason for this bit of forethought is readily understandable given the current economic environment. As with most everything these days, NASA is concerned about the cost of its missions. One of the largest factors in planetary missions is the expense of development. In an effort to limit development costs, NASA decided that, if it isn't broke - why fix it? As such, they opted to use the proven design of MSL. NASA even had some spare components leftover from Curiosity's construction. There will be some differences between the two rovers however, primarily in the instruments that the robot will carry with it. As the Mars 2020 rover will be following in the footsteps of Curiosity, it will have new questions to seek answers to, fresh investigations that it has to conduct. The landing system, however, will be very familiar to MSL fans. Both the acclaimed sky crane rocket as well as the heat shield will be virtually the same as those employed on MSL. As for the types of experiments which will be part of the rover's backpack - NASA is working on what those might be. The U.S. space agency announced an open competition for scientists in the planetary community to submit proposals for what instruments the Mars 2020 rover will bring with it. In January 2013, a Science Definition Team was selected by the space agency so as to define what the objectives of the Mars 2020 rover mission would be. It was composed of 19 scientists and engineers from a wide range of organizations and research facilities. They were, in essence, the ones who would develop the rover's core mission keeping in mind that it must achieve several high-priority scientific goals and that one of those was to aid in the accomplishment of sending crew to the Red Planet in the 2030s as directed by President Obama. NASA has stated that the Mars 2020 rover's primary mission will be to determine whether-or-not the Red Planet is a possible habitat for life, that is will seek out past evidence life existed there and it will collect specimens for a potential sample-return flight to Earth. Most intriguingly perhaps is that NASA has stated the rover will also demonstrate technologies which could enable future human exploration missions to Mars. How this will be accomplished is unclear. \"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"The science conducted by the rover's instruments also would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return any collected samples to Earth.\" Whatever mission requirements that the 2020 Mars Rover is assigned, one thing is clear - the Mars 2020 did not reach its destination without a wealth of experience in conducting Mars rover operations. When the 2020 Mars Rover sets down on the dusty Martian surface, it will follow a growing line of those that came before her. Starting with the 1993 Mars Pathfinder mission which was the first rover to be sent to the Red Planet. Then the \"twin\" Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity which landed back in 2004 - each of which far exceeded their design parameters (in fact, Opportunity is continuing to explore Mars to this very day). Finally, in August of 2012, Curiosity began her journey of discovery at Gusev Crater. \"For many folks last summer was an incredible ride, seven minutes of terror to get Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars,\" said NASA astronaut and the space agency's current Associate Administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate, John Grunsfeld. \"The year after has been an incredible drive - even though we are still on our way to Mount Sharp. We still have a fundamental question to answer and it is one that has piqued the curiosity of astronomers and planetary scientists for quite a while of, did Mars ever have an environment that was habitable for life - is there or has there ever been life on Mars? Does Mars support life now?\" The question of whether-or-not Mars ever been able to support life was, at least in a microbial sense, was the key mission for the Mars Science laboratory. It was one that Grunsfeld said harkens back to the very first landers to successfully touch down on Mars. \"Back when I was in High School in the 1970s we sent the Viking landers to answer that question, and it was very exciting, very challenging - these were grand voyages,\" Grunsfeld added. \"However, from these missions, Mars appeared to be somewhat lifeless - but the question remained - did Mars ever have an environment that was potentially habitable for life?\" That question has come into increasingly sharper focus since the Viking landers touched down in 1976. For a long time afterward, Mars faded from the scientific consciousness as the data gleaned from the spacecraft that had traveled to the Red Planet suggested that it was a lifeless world and one which was unlikely to have supported life in its past. However, with the uptick in missions and interest in Mars that began in the 1990s, it has become increasingly clear that Mars was not always as we see it today. The 2020 Mars Rover will serve to deepen our knowledge of the planet's history. What Curiosity has done, is, essentially, lay another layer of understanding about the forces which have shaped the Red Planet. One of these elements in particular, the Martian atmosphere, will come into sharper focus next year with the arrival of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN arrives at Mars. It will look into how Mars' atmosphere has been shaped throughout the planet's life. The 2020 Mars Rover will doubtlessly continue the narrative that began with Viking and could redefine how we view the Red Planet and its history.

Reading through the capabilities of the instruments makes them seem like technology from science fiction, complete with lasers and x-rays. However, the types of instruments that weren't selected say almost as much about the goals and expectations for the mission as those that were. This mission will be optimized for finding the best samples to return to Earth rather than carrying out the most sophisticated science that could have been sent to Mars. For Mars, the key questions are about the earliest environments present on Mars, whether they could have enabled the development of life, and whether life or its precursors arose. Answering these questions can require devilishly subtle measurements. On Earth with the best instruments available (far, far more capable than those that could be flown to another planet), concrete answers are hard to come by and debates rage about the earliest conditions on Earth. (It doesn't help that the active surface of the Earth has erased all but a few traces of the earliest surface, atmosphere, and ocean.) The Mars scientific community has collectively decided that the best and perhaps only way to answer these questions is to return carefully collected samples to Earth for study in terrestrial laboratories. The primary goal the science community laid out for the 2020 rover was to enable the efficient selection of the most compelling sample set possible - so compelling that Congress will spend the additional few billions of dollars for missions to retrieve and return them to Earth. To see how the instruments selected will work together towards this goal, imagine that you were sent to Mars and given the assignment to select a small set of samples to return to Earth. Because you can return only a few samples, you are under pressure to find those few special samples that can best reveal insights into the earliest history of Mars. The first thing you are likely to do is to look to see what types of terrain and rock formations surround you. The 2020 rover will carry two Mastcam-Z cameras for this task. These cameras were originally intended to fly on the Curiosity rover currently on Mars, but weren't completed in time. Unlike Curiosity's cameras, these will have the ability to zoom from wide angle to moderate zoom (28 mm to 100 mm, 35 mm film equivalent) and to take movies. (If still photos from Mars are cool, imagine movies.) These cameras will take color images, but unlike our eyes they will also be able to take images in twelve carefully selected bands (\"colors\") in the visible and near infrared spectrum to help map subtle distinctions in composition. The 2020 rover also will have the ability to assess the area around it in ways that our eyes never could. Like the Curiosity rover, the 2020 rover will zap rocks and soils with a laser to determine their composition. Curiosity's ChemCam laser heats its targets sufficiently that a tiny amount vaporizes. The instrument analyzes the glow of the plasma cloud to measure the elements present. However, if laser hits a target with specific wavelengths of light at a lower energy, the target will \"glow\" in characteristic ways that reveal the mineralogy and the presence of organic molecules. (In technical terms, this is Raman and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.) (An analogy helps explain the difference between elemental and mineralogical composition. French bread, Indian naan flat bread, and tortillas, for example, have similar ingredients (they are much more similar to each other than to, say, a steak or a Greek salad). In this analogy, the ingredients in the recipes are the elemental composition, while the specific type of baked good reflecting both the proportion of ingredients and method of cooking is the mineralogy.) The 2020 rover will carry an advanced version of ChemCam called SuperCam that will use all three types of laser analysis to provide both elemental and mineralogical analysis. In addition, it will have capabilities for mapping composition using visible and infrared spectroscopy, although no details were provided (such as whether this capability will be just for the spots hit by the lasers or will be full images of the scenes around the rover). The rocks and formations that Mastcam-Z and SuperCam can study, however, are only those at the surface. Geological formations often continue beneath the surface and the rocky outcrop in front of the rover may be the same or different than the outcrop viewed a hundred meters earlier in the rover's drive. A Norwegian-supplied ground penetrating radar, RIMFAX, will map soil and rock layers up to a half-kilometer below the surface with a resolution of 5 to 20 centimeters. To return to our analogy of you as Mars geologist, once you survey a location, you would go to specific soils or rocks that look interesting for closer examination. Similarly, the 2020 rover will carry two instruments to study small patches (approximately the size of postage stamps) in detail. Both will be contact instruments that operate once the rover's arm has placed them against a patch of soil or a rock. (It is likely that the 2020 rover, like NASA's previous Martian rovers, will be able to brush dust and the outer surface of rocks off to allow instruments to sample the more pristine internal rock.) The Curiosity rover carried two contact instruments, a microscopic imager and the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to measure elemental composition. The 2020 rover will carry two much more capable contact instruments. The PIXL instrument will measure elements using X-ray lithochemistry while the SHERLOC instrument will measure minerals using laser Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Both of these instruments will have their own microscopic cameras, and the SHERLOC instrument carry a near copy of Curiosity's MAHLI microscopic imager. (MAHLI operates as both a normal camera as well as a microscopic camera. This camera, mounted on the rover's arm, has taken the selfie pictures that show the rover on the Martian surface as well as images of the wheels and beneath the rover.) While Curiosity's Alpha Particle-X-Ray spectrometer could measure only the average composition of the surface in front of it, both PIXL and SHERLOC will make hundreds to thousands of measurements across each surface. Each measurement point will be approximately the size of a grain of sand. The new capability to measure composition at near microscopic resolution will be revolutionary. If you look at soils and the interiors of most rocks, you'll find that they are composed of many smaller rocks and inclusions. By taking many fine-scale measurements, each rock or patch of soil becomes a rich story of many rock fragments that together provide clues to their individual formation and that of their larger rock or soil type. SuperCam and SHERLOC's laser spectroscopy will have an important capability that Curiosity lacks - they can easily identify and map the presence of organic materials. While many processes other than life can produce organic chemicals, life as we understand it requires a rich abundance of organic material. While many processes other than life can produce organic chemicals, life as we understand it requires a rich abundance of organic material. A key goal for the 2020 rover is to find biosignatures to indicate pre-biotic chemistry or life itself. The Curiosity rover can detect organic materials through its mass spectrometer, but preparing samples for and using this instrument is a laborious process and has only been done rarely in the mission to date. In addition, the way the Curiosity's instrument works, it must heat samples, which triggers chemical reactions with the perchlorates found in the soils, destroying the organic materials. Careful measurements have allowed scientists to conclude that the samples taken by Curiosity contain some organic materials, but we aren't sure how much or what types. (Curiosity's instrument has a mechanism to avoid the \"perchlorate trap,\" but it can be used only seven times and hasn't been so far.) By using lasers, the 2020 rover can find organics quickly and won't be skunked by perchlorates, key advantages over Curiosity Two other instruments round out the 2020 rover's manifest. The MEDA instrument, supplied by Spain, will monitor the weather and study the airborne dust. MOXIE will demonstrate the extraction of oxygen from the predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere at Mars. Missions (manned or unmanned) that are to return to Earth could substantially reduce their launch weight if they could manufacture the oxidizer portion of their rocket fuel form the Martian air. The same applies to the oxygen supply to breath for any future astronauts. How does the 2020 rover's scientific instrument suite (MOXIE is an engineering demonstration) compare to that of the Curiosity rovers? The 2020 rover will have far superior remote sensing instruments (Mastcam-Z, SuperCam, and RIMFAX) and contact instruments (PIXL and SHERLOC) than Curiosity. This will allow this new rover to much more quickly find important samples to study and potentially cache. This is especially true for finding any rich deposits of organic material. To locate two to three dozen samples within the mission's lifetime on Mars, the 2020 rover will need to operate much more efficiently than the Curiosity rover has. The scientific team that defined the requirements that NASA used to select this instrument suite specifically asked for a suite of instruments simpler than Curiosity's to speed operations. Because almost a decade has passed since Curiosity's instruments were selected, the march of technology allows the new rover's instruments to be considerably more capable than Curiosity's. So what's left off? Ignoring the miniature greenhouse and the solar-powered helicopter proposals (either likely would have been media sensations), the 2020 mission will not have the class of laboratory instruments included in the both Curiosity and the ExoMars 2018 (now possibly to be 2020) payloads. Performing the most sensitive measurements requires larger instruments than can fit on the robotic arm. To address this, both the Curiosity and ExoMars rovers have instrument laboratories housed within their bodies. For example, the Curiosity and ExoMars mass spectrometers can identify the specific composition of organic molecules. This is useful to separate organics created from non-biotic processes from those created from possible biotic processes. The laser instruments to be carried by the 2020 rover will be limited to more general identification of the presence of broader groups of organic molecules. The mass spectrometer instruments proposed but not selected for the 2020 rover could have been more sensitive still than Curiosity and ExoMars'. The proposed CODEX instrument, which would have had to be located as a laboratory instrument within the body of the rover, would have used lasers to vaporize minute quantities of material across the sample to be fed into a mass spectrometer. (By vaporizing samples, the instrument would have avoided the perchlorate problem.) The resulting measurements would have provided detailed maps of the chemistry of samples, the types of organics within it, and the age of the rock from which it came. Achieving both of the latter goals has been one of the justifications for returning samples to Earth. CODEX would have made progress towards both on Mars, although measurements made in terrestrial laboratories would be much more precise. NASA doesn't discuss why particular instruments aren't chosen for a mission. CODEX and its kin may not have made the cut because the team of scientists that laid down the mission requirements specifically requested a simplified instrument suite. Or the reviewers may have concluded that the more sensitive measurements would not have been sensitive enough to answer critical questions about Mars. Or it could be that there wouldn't have been room in the rover or in the budget for them. The 2020 rover program has a tight budget, and the instrument suite selected will cost $130M, more than the $100M NASA had originally hoped to spend. (Curiosity's instruments cost $180M.) The instruments will be half of the 2020 rover's payload. Still to come are details on the sample collection and caching system. Based on work done to date, it appears that the rover will collect and store two to three dozen sample cores that each will be about as wide as a pencil and about half as long as a new one. The 2020 rover will carry an instrument suite optimized for efficiently finding the best sample suite at its landing site for a possible return to Earth. If those samples do make it to our world, we likely will have a revolution in our understanding of the Red Planet. If they do not, the scientific community may come to wish they had asked for a more capable instrument complement to do more sophisticated science on Mars. But life is about choices, and NASA and the scientific community have bet that the samples collected will be so compelling that funds will be made available for their return to Earth. Either way, the instruments of the 2020 rover will be marvels much more advanced than their counterparts on Curiosity. We will get great science.

PIXL, for Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry, would be mounted at the end of the rover's robotic arm so that it can be placed next to a rock or soil target. It is designed to provide finer-scale identification of elemental composition than ever before possible on Mars. The instrument's capabilities would help NASA's Mars 2020 rover mission accomplish its goals, which include seeking evidence for past life on Mars. \"If you are looking for signs of ancient life, you want to look at a small scale and get detailed information about chemical elements present,\" said PIXL Principal Investigator Abigail Allwood of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. PIXL will be fast. Its intended use is to spend a few seconds to 2 minutes with the instrument's X-ray focused on each spot to be analyzed, then move the beam to another spot, working in a linear or grid pattern to produce a detailed map of the elements in the rock or soil target. The mapped area would be up to about the size of a postage stamp. The element-identification method is X-ray fluorescence. It reads the X-rays distinctively emitted by various types of atoms when they are excited by X-rays coming from the instrument. PIXL's design also incorporates a high-resolution camera so that the map of elemental composition can be analyzed in conjunction with visible characteristics of the target area. \"We can correlate fine-scale textures and features with very detailed information about the chemistry,\" Allwood said. \"Understanding these relationships is crucial for investigation goals such as searching for microbial biosignatures.\" NASA announced selection of PIXL and six other investigations for the Mars 2020 rover's payload on July 31, 2014. The Mars 2020 mission will be based on the design of the highly successful Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, which landed almost two years ago and currently is operating on Mars. The new rover will carry more sophisticated, upgraded hardware and new instruments to conduct geological assessments of the rover's landing site, determine the potential habitability of the environment, and directly search for signs of ancient Martian life. Scientists will use the Mars 2020 rover to identify and select a collection of rock and soil samples that will be stored for potential return to Earth by a future mission. The Mars 2020 mission is responsive to the science objectives recommended by the National Research Council's 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The Mars 2020 rover also will help advance our knowledge of how future human explorers could use natural resources available on the surface of the Red Planet. An ability to live off the Martian land would transform future exploration of the planet. Designers of future human expeditions can use this mission to understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate technology to process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce oxygen. These experiments will help engineers learn how to use Martian resources to produce oxygen for human respiration and potentially for use as an oxidizer for rocket fuel.

Reading through the capabilities of the instruments makes them seem like technology from science fiction, complete with lasers and x-rays. However, the types of instruments that weren't selected say almost as much about the goals and expectations for the mission as those that were. This mission will be optimized for finding the best samples to return to Earth rather than carrying out the most sophisticated science that could have been sent to Mars. For Mars, the key questions are about the earliest environments present on Mars, whether they could have enabled the development of life, and whether life or its precursors arose. Answering these questions can require devilishly subtle measurements. On Earth with the best instruments available (far, far more capable than those that could be flown to another planet), concrete answers are hard to come by and debates rage about the earliest conditions on Earth. (It doesn't help that the active surface of the Earth has erased all but a few traces of the earliest surface, atmosphere, and ocean.) The Mars scientific community has collectively decided that the best and perhaps only way to answer these questions is to return carefully collected samples to Earth for study in terrestrial laboratories. The primary goal the science community laid out for the 2020 rover was to enable the efficient selection of the most compelling sample set possible - so compelling that Congress will spend the additional few billions of dollars for missions to retrieve and return them to Earth. To see how the instruments selected will work together towards this goal, imagine that you were sent to Mars and given the assignment to select a small set of samples to return to Earth. Because you can return only a few samples, you are under pressure to find those few special samples that can best reveal insights into the earliest history of Mars. The first thing you are likely to do is to look to see what types of terrain and rock formations surround you. The 2020 rover will carry two Mastcam-Z cameras for this task. These cameras were originally intended to fly on the Curiosity rover currently on Mars, but weren't completed in time. Unlike Curiosity's cameras, these will have the ability to zoom from wide angle to moderate zoom (28 mm to 100 mm, 35 mm film equivalent) and to take movies. (If still photos from Mars are cool, imagine movies.) These cameras will take color images, but unlike our eyes they will also be able to take images in twelve carefully selected bands (\"colors\") in the visible and near infrared spectrum to help map subtle distinctions in composition. The 2020 rover also will have the ability to assess the area around it in ways that our eyes never could. Like the Curiosity rover, the 2020 rover will zap rocks and soils with a laser to determine their composition. Curiosity's ChemCam laser heats its targets sufficiently that a tiny amount vaporizes.

Mars 2020 is basically a souped-up version of Curiosity, the car-sized rover currently exploring Gale Crater. Copying elements of Curiosity's design-particularly the entry, descent, and landing system-saves a lot of money and lets engineers take advantage of proven technology. (Mars 2020 will have sturdier tires than Curiosity.) If you parked Curiosity and Mars 2020 next to each other on Mars, most people wouldn't be able to tell them apart. Well, \"most people\" can't tell Mars from Arizona (there's a strong resemblance!), but you get my point... However, despite their physical similarities, Mars 2020 represents a completely different philosophy of planetary exploration. Whereas Curiosity is studying Mars in situ, the primary goal of Mars 2020 is preparing a cache of samples for eventual return to Earth. Curiosity aims to determine whether environments conducive to life ever existed on Mars (they did); scientists will analyze samples collected by Mars 2020 in sophisticated laboratories on Earth, which might allow them to discover whether life or its precursors actually existed on Mars. Planetary scientists agree that sample return is crucial to answering pressing questions about Mars. But planning a sample return mission involves potential pitfalls worth knowing about. Sample Return: Go Big and Go Home Every ten years, the planetary science community comes together to write a report, called a decadal survey, containing a prioritized list of missions and programs for the next decade. The last decadal survey, released in 2011, went all in on Mars sample return, endorsing a rover that would prepare a sample cache (then known as \"MAX-C\") as the highest priority, large-class mission-but did not recommend any alternative medium- or large-class missions to Mars. A caching rover is only the first part of a sample return campaign. Another mission is required to pick up the cache and launch it into orbit around Mars. We'd need yet another spacecraft to bring this precious cargo back to Earth-not to mention all the specialized facilities we'd construct here to handle and analyze the samples! All of this could take ~30 years and cost more than $10 billion. Policymakers are reluctant to commit to hugely expensive research projects that won't yield scientific results for several decades. This is always true, but especially now given our dismal fiscal climate and the cost and schedule overruns associated with JWST and, to a lesser extent, Curiosity. However, the decadal survey offered no Plan B for Mars exploration. NASA would either need to commit to sample return or smash the crown jewel of its own exploration program. Maybe this was a strategic attempt to force NASA to commit to a more ambitious plan than they'd otherwise undertake. Initially, it looked like this strategy, if it was a strategy, would fail. The Obama Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2014 gutted Mars exploration, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars relative to the 2012 budget. NASA pulled out of a planned collaboration with the European ExoMars program. Congress reinstated funding for Mars exploration after a loud outcry from planetary scientists and enthusiasts. With this funding, NASA announced that Mars 2020 would happen and, later, that Mars 2020 would indeed focus on preparing a sample cache. Mars 2020's Instrumental Payload. Now that we've discussed the overall goals and philosophy of Mars 2020, let's admire the instruments it'll actually use: SuperCam - an upgrade to Curiosity's meme-worthy ChemCam, which will analyze the chemical composition of surface material, including organic material, from afar using a laser. Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) - an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and high-resolution imager to map samples of surface material in fine detail. Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) - like PIXL, will map surface material at high-resolution, but using laser Raman fluorescence spectroscopy. The Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX) - ground-penetrating radar that can map geologic layers up to roughly half a kilometer below the surface, at 5-20 centimeter resolution, contributed by Norway. Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) - a weather station that can measure temperature, wind velocity, pressure, relative humidity, and dust characteristics, supplied by Spain. Mastcam-Z - two super fancy cameras that can zoom and take movies (hopefully of Mars bears or something) in twelve different wavelength bands in the visible and near infrared parts of the color spectrum. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE) - an engineering demonstration experiment that will produce oxygen from atmospheric carbon dioxide, which future missions would find exceedingly helpful, since oxygen is part of rocket fuel and, err, breathable.

To return to our analogy of you as Mars geologist, once you survey a location, you would go to specific soils or rocks that look interesting for closer examination. Similarly, the 2020 rover will carry two instruments to study small patches (approximately the size of postage stamps) in detail. Both will be contact instruments that operate once the rover's arm has placed them against a patch of soil or a rock. (It is likely that the 2020 rover, like NASA's previous Martian rovers, will be able to brush dust and the outer surface of rocks off to allow instruments to sample the more pristine internal rock.) The Curiosity rover carried two contact instruments, a microscopic imager and the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to measure elemental composition. The 2020 rover will carry two much more capable contact instruments. The PIXL instrument will measure elements using X-ray lithochemistry while the SHERLOC instrument will measure minerals using laser Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Both of these instruments will have their own microscopic cameras, and the SHERLOC instrument carry a near copy of Curiosity's MAHLI microscopic imager. (MAHLI operates as both a normal camera as well as a microscopic camera. This camera, mounted on the rover's arm, has taken the selfie pictures that show the rover on the Martian surface as well as images of the wheels and beneath the rover.) While Curiosity's Alpha Particle-X-Ray spectrometer could measure only the average composition of the surface in front of it, both PIXL and SHERLOC will make hundreds to thousands of measurements across each surface. Each measurement point will be approximately the size of a grain of sand. The new capability to measure composition at near microscopic resolution will be revolutionary. If you look at soils and the interiors of most rocks, you'll find that they are composed of many smaller rocks and inclusions. By taking many fine-scale measurements, each rock or patch of soil becomes a rich story of many rock fragments that together provide clues to their individual formation and that of their larger rock or soil type. SuperCam and SHERLOC's laser spectroscopy will have an important capability that Curiosity lacks - they can easily identify and map the presence of organic materials. While many processes other than life can produce organic chemicals, life as we understand it requires a rich abundance of organic material. While many processes other than life can produce organic chemicals, life as we understand it requires a rich abundance of organic material. A key goal for the 2020 rover is to find biosignatures to indicate pre-biotic chemistry or life itself. The Curiosity rover can detect organic materials through its mass spectrometer, but preparing samples for and using this instrument is a laborious process and has only been done rarely in the mission to date. In addition, the way the Curiosity's instrument works, it must heat samples, which triggers chemical reactions with the perchlorates found in the soils, destroying the organic materials. Careful measurements have allowed scientists to conclude that the samples taken by Curiosity contain some organic materials, but we aren't sure how much or what types. (Curiosity's instrument has a mechanism to avoid the \"perchlorate trap,\" but it can be used only seven times and hasn't been so far.) By using lasers, the 2020 rover can find organics quickly and won't be skunked by perchlorates, key advantages over Curiosity Two other instruments round out the 2020 rover's manifest. The MEDA instrument, supplied by Spain, will monitor the weather and study the airborne dust. MOXIE will demonstrate the extraction of oxygen from the predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere at Mars. Missions (manned or unmanned) that are to return to Earth could substantially reduce their launch weight if they could manufacture the oxidizer portion of their rocket fuel form the Martian air. The same applies to the oxygen supply to breath for any future astronauts. How does the 2020 rover's scientific instrument suite (MOXIE is an engineering demonstration) compare to that of the Curiosity rovers? The 2020 rover will have far superior remote sensing instruments (Mastcam-Z, SuperCam, and RIMFAX) and contact instruments (PIXL and SHERLOC) than Curiosity. This will allow this new rover to much more quickly find important samples to study and potentially cache. This is especially true for finding any rich deposits of organic material. To locate two to three dozen samples within the mission's lifetime on Mars, the 2020 rover will need to operate much more efficiently than the Curiosity rover has. The scientific team that defined the requirements that NASA used to select this instrument suite specifically asked for a suite of instruments simpler than Curiosity's to speed operations. Because almost a decade has passed since Curiosity's instruments were selected, the march of technology allows the new rover's instruments to be considerably more capable than Curiosity's. So what's left off? Ignoring the miniature greenhouse and the solar-powered helicopter proposals (either likely would have been media sensations), the 2020 mission will not have the class of laboratory instruments included in the both Curiosity and the ExoMars 2018 (now possibly to be 2020) payloads. Performing the most sensitive measurements requires larger instruments than can fit on the robotic arm. To address this, both the Curiosity and ExoMars rovers have instrument laboratories housed within their bodies. For example, the Curiosity and ExoMars mass spectrometers can identify the specific composition of organic molecules. This is useful to separate organics created from non-biotic processes from those created from possible biotic processes. The laser instruments to be carried by the 2020 rover will be limited to more general identification of the presence of broader groups of organic molecules. The mass spectrometer instruments proposed but not selected for the 2020 rover could have been more sensitive still than Curiosity and ExoMars'. The proposed CODEX instrument, which would have had to be located as a laboratory instrument within the body of the rover, would have used lasers to vaporize minute quantities of material across the sample to be fed into a mass spectrometer. (By vaporizing samples, the instrument would have avoided the perchlorate problem.) The resulting measurements would have provided detailed maps of the chemistry of samples, the types of organics within it, and the age of the rock from which it came. Achieving both of the latter goals has been one of the justifications for returning samples to Earth. CODEX would have made progress towards both on Mars, although measurements made in terrestrial laboratories would be much more precise. NASA doesn't discuss why particular instruments aren't chosen for a mission. CODEX and its kin may not have made the cut because the team of scientists that laid down the mission requirements specifically requested a simplified instrument suite. Or the reviewers may have concluded that the more sensitive measurements would not have been sensitive enough to answer critical questions about Mars. Or it could be that there wouldn't have been room in the rover or in the budget for them. The 2020 rover program has a tight budget, and the instrument suite selected will cost $130M, more than the $100M NASA had originally hoped to spend. (Curiosity's instruments cost $180M.) The instruments will be half of the 2020 rover's payload. Still to come are details on the sample collection and caching system. Based on work done to date, it appears that the rover will collect and store two to three dozen sample cores that each will be about as wide as a pencil and about half as long as a new one. The 2020 rover will carry an instrument suite optimized for efficiently finding the best sample suite at its landing site for a possible return to Earth. If those samples do make it to our world, we likely will have a revolution in our understanding of the Red Planet. If they do not, the scientific community may come to wish they had asked for a more capable instrument complement to do more sophisticated science on Mars. But life is about choices, and NASA and the scientific community have bet that the samples collected will be so compelling that funds will be made available for their return to Earth. Either way, the instruments of the 2020 rover will be marvels much more advanced than their counterparts on Curiosity. We will get great science.

We get real discussion about whether or not somebody is just blowing smoke or not and what is real,\" Meyer said. \"Getting humans out of low-Earth orbit with Mars as the ultimate destination ... this mission feeds into that, and it's critical.\" Old and new engineering. The future Mars rover mission is billed as leveraging the successful architecture of NASA's Curiosity rover/Mars Science Laboratory mission, including its entry, descent and landing system and much of its rover platform. Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012. The Mars 2020 development effort is a combination of the \"old\" and the \"new,\" said Gentry Lee, chief engineer for Solar System Exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. He is also a member of the Mars 2020 Standing Review Board. To keep the development costs in line and to accommodate the new elements of the project, the management and engineering teams must make maximum use of subsystems that do not need to be changed, Lee told Space.com. \"In a sense, then, there are two Mars 2020 projects operating at the same time,\" Lee said, \"one that is trying to make certain that only changes that are absolutely essential are made in the heritage subsystems, and another that must implement the new elements following historical development practices.\" The challenge for Mars. So what are the new elements of Mars 2020? You can count on a scientific payload that includes new remote-sensing and contact-science instruments, Lee said. Then there's the sampling and caching system that will extract cores from rocks and leave the Mars samples to be returned to Earth by a possible later mission, he added. Furthermore, \"there's need for a more efficient surface-operations system that will enable the mission to assay, sample and cache at least 20 scientifically important samples in one Mars year,\" Lee said. In addition, all parts of the Mars 2020 project must be cognizant of the need for strict planetary protection and contamination control in all elements associated with the samples, he added. \"The challenge to the Mars 2020 project management is to properly balance a resistance to change to the heritage subsystems with the open mindedness necessary to design and implement the new elements,\" Lee concluded. New wheels for Red Planet off-roading. Engineers at the meeting said that the Mars 2020 system is changing as its design is refined. For one, the overall system is becoming heavier. The rover's wheels are getting heavier, with the robot's body becoming a little longer. That may change the rover's mobility system and how it interacts with the ground, mission engineers said. \"We are really looking at ways to make this largely heritage, built-to-print rover drive faster and do more science on the surface of Mars,\" said Jennifer Trosper, JPL's mission manager on Mars 2020 and also the surface-phase lead. One thing the Mars 2020 team is confronting right away is the issue of wheels. Curiosity has been battling wear and tear on its wheels, a surprising and nagging glitch. \"Yes, we are going to have significantly more robust wheels,\" Trosper said. \"That will not be the problem we have on Mars 2020.\" Boosting productivity on Mars. Another plus for the future rover is to have machinery on Mars that is far speedier on complex terrain than Curiosity, Trosper said. By adding an onboard processor to run autonavigation algorithms, the rover would be driving - and spending far less time thinking about driving, she said. \"We can actually spend much less percentage of the mission traversing to interesting science sites and actually do contact science at those sites,\" Trosper said. \"We are putting some things onboard the vehicle to make it smarter so we don't have to be so conservative on the ground ... to make this surface mission more productive,\" Trosper said. Adopting these changes and other measures, she added, would make mission efficiency jump from Curiosity's roughly 55 percent to 80 percent, up to 95 percent for the Mars 2020 robot. During the landing-site meeting, engineers identified several \"inescapable hazards\" for the rover, such as sand drifts, high rock hazards and areas of high rock abundance, as well as slopes. \"Rocks! Geologists love them ... engineers hate them,\" said JPL's Matt Golombek, co-chair of the Mars Landing Site Steering Committee. New navigation tech. While the final landing site that the Mars 2020 mission will target is still to be determined, a new technological add-on is under deliberation. The new rover may carry Terrain Relative Navigation technology, which could allow the consideration of landing sites that are more troublesome in terms of menacing terrain issues, such as large rocks or machine-killing slopes. \"We only want to put it on if we need to put it on,\" said Al Chen, who is the entry, descent and landing-system lead at JPL. Terrain Relative Navigation, or TRN for short, would be enabled by just a few pieces of hardware, a computer and a camera, Chen told Space.com. According to Chen, the new TRN system works like this: During its descent to the surface, the Mars 2020 rover would take pictures of the terrain below and match them with an onboard map of the target landing site. \"It helps the vehicle figure out where it is,\" Chen said. \"Once the rover knows where it is, it can use a map of the nearby hazards to land in one of the safe spots. TRN makes the vehicle a little smarter about what's going on.\" In order to make it safer to land, TRN could allow so-called \"diverts\" during the rover's landing of nearly 2,000 feet (600 meters), he added. Double-duty on Mars. The computer processor that does the TRN job can also do double duty on the surface to speed up the 2020 rover's processing as the robot wheels across the Mars landscape, Chen said. \"It's not about physically moving the rover faster when it's driving,\" Chen said. \"It is about reducing the time that you are spending between drive steps, thinking about what you should be doing next.\" Chen said that TRN is considered a prerequisite technology for evolved human and precursor missions to Mars. The technology is ideal for not only hazard avoidance, but also to stick your landing next to prelanded hardware like habitats, food and other items. \"You don't want to drive miles and miles away to get to those assets. You want to land near them ... right where you want to be,\" Chen concluded.

The Mars 2020 development effort is a combination of the \"old\" and the \"new,\" said Gentry Lee, chief engineer for Solar System Exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. He is also a member of the Mars 2020 Standing Review Board. To keep the development costs in line and to accommodate the new elements of the project, the management and engineering teams must make maximum use of subsystems that do not need to be changed, Lee told Space.com. \"In a sense, then, there are two Mars 2020 projects operating at the same time,\" Lee said, \"one that is trying to make certain that only changes that are absolutely essential are made in the heritage subsystems, and another that must implement the new elements following historical development practices.\" The challenge for Mars. So what are the new elements of Mars 2020? You can count on a scientific payload that includes new remote-sensing and contact-science instruments, Lee said. Then there's the sampling and caching system that will extract cores from rocks and leave the Mars samples to be returned to Earth by a possible later mission, he added. Furthermore, \"there's need for a more efficient surface-operations system that will enable the mission to assay, sample and cache at least 20 scientifically important samples in one Mars year,\" Lee said. In addition, all parts of the Mars 2020 project must be cognizant of the need for strict planetary protection and contamination control in all elements associated with the samples, he added. \"The challenge to the Mars 2020 project management is to properly balance a resistance to change to the heritage subsystems with the open mindedness necessary to design and implement the new elements,\" Lee concluded. New wheels for Red Planet off-roading. Engineers at the meeting said that the Mars 2020 system is changing as its design is refined. For one, the overall system is becoming heavier. The rover's wheels are getting heavier, with the robot's body becoming a little longer. That may change the rover's mobility system and how it interacts with the ground, mission engineers said. \"We are really looking at ways to make this largely heritage, built-to-print rover drive faster and do more science on the surface of Mars,\" said Jennifer Trosper, JPL's mission manager on Mars 2020 and also the surface-phase lead. One thing the Mars 2020 team is confronting right away is the issue of wheels. Curiosity has been battling wear and tear on its wheels, a surprising and nagging glitch. \"Yes, we are going to have significantly more robust wheels,\" Trosper said. \"That will not be the problem we have on Mars 2020.\" Boosting productivity on Mars. Another plus for the future rover is to have machinery on Mars that is far speedier on complex terrain than Curiosity, Trosper said. By adding an onboard processor to run autonavigation algorithms, the rover would be driving - and spending far less time thinking about driving, she said. \"We can actually spend much less percentage of the mission traversing to interesting science sites and actually do contact science at those sites,\" Trosper said. \"We are putting some things onboard the vehicle to make it smarter so we don't have to be so conservative on the ground ... to make this surface mission more productive,\" Trosper said. Adopting these changes and other measures, she added, would make mission efficiency jump from Curiosity's roughly 55 percent to 80 percent, up to 95 percent for the Mars 2020 robot. During the landing-site meeting, engineers identified several \"inescapable hazards\" for the rover, such as sand drifts, high rock hazards and areas of high rock abundance, as well as slopes. \"Rocks! Geologists love them ... engineers hate them,\" said JPL's Matt Golombek, co-chair of the Mars Landing Site Steering Committee. New navigation tech. While the final landing site that the Mars 2020 mission will target is still to be determined, a new technological add-on is under deliberation. The new rover may carry Terrain Relative Navigation technology, which could allow the consideration of landing sites that are more troublesome in terms of menacing terrain issues, such as large rocks or machine-killing slopes. \"We only want to put it on if we need to put it on,\" said Al Chen, who is the entry, descent and landing-system lead at JPL. Terrain Relative Navigation, or TRN for short, would be enabled by just a few pieces of hardware, a computer and a camera, Chen told Space.com. According to Chen, the new TRN system works like this: During its descent to the surface, the Mars 2020 rover would take pictures of the terrain below and match them with an onboard map of the target landing site. \"It helps the vehicle figure out where it is,\" Chen said. \"Once the rover knows where it is, it can use a map of the nearby hazards to land in one of the safe spots. TRN makes the vehicle a little smarter about what's going on.\" In order to make it safer to land, TRN could allow so-called \"diverts\" during the rover's landing of nearly 2,000 feet (600 meters), he added. Double-duty on Mars. The computer processor that does the TRN job can also do double duty on the surface to speed up the 2020 rover's processing as the robot wheels across the Mars landscape, Chen said. \"It's not about physically moving the rover faster when it's driving,\" Chen said. \"It is about reducing the time that you are spending between drive steps, thinking about what you should be doing next.\" Chen said that TRN is considered a prerequisite technology for evolved human and precursor missions to Mars. The technology is ideal for not only hazard avoidance, but also to stick your landing next to prelanded hardware like habitats, food and other items. \"You don't want to drive miles and miles away to get to those assets. You want to land near them ... right where you want to be,\" Chen concluded.

The one-ton Mars 2020 rover is based largely on its predecessor, Curiosity, but comes equipped with a different suite of science instruments designed to search directly for signs of ancient Martian life. The mission has cleared a project milestone known as Key Decision Point C, which keeps the portable science laboratory on track for launch in July or August of 2020, with a landing in February 2021. \"NASA has given us the go-ahead to complete development of the mission,\" said project scientist Kenneth Farley, standing next to a full-scale testing mockup of Curiosity. \"This is a really big, important step for us.\" During the rover's two-year mission, it will search for signs of past life in rocks known to preserve organic biosignatures. Mars 2020-which is now eligible for a Curiosity-like name now that the project is in phase C-will also collect rock and soil samples for a possible future Earth return, and extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere to test technologies that may be needed for human visits. The surface of Mars is not currently conducive to life, but Curiosity found that it may have been in the past. \"Billions of years ago, there were rivers and lakes on the surface of the planet,\" Farley said. \"We're going to focus our exploration on this time in the distant past.\" The completion of Key Decision Point C also means the project has received a baseline cost. NASA officials said it would take $2.1 billion to develop and launch the mission, and another $300 million to operate the rover during its primary mission of one Martian year-slightly more than two Earth years. Landing and roving. In order for the Mars 2020 rover to look for signs of ancient Mars microbes, it must examine rocks formed while Mars was wet-approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Scientists have narrowed down a list of potential locations to eight candidates. \"The most important decision that we have ahead of us is where we're going to send the rover,\" Farley said. Safety is the biggest consideration, including both the entry, descent and landing sequence (EDL) and hazardous terrain the rover must cross to get to scientifically interesting spots. Over the course of the Curiosity mission, rough terrain has caused the rover's wheels to puncture and tear. Lessons learned from Curiosity will be applied to the new rover, according to Allen Chen, the mission's EDL lead. \"We are looking at a new design of the wheels that should help mitigate that,\" Chen said. \"Which principally has to do with thickening the wheels to be more robust to those puncture-type concerns that we've had with Curiosity.\" The Mars 2020 landing sequence will resemble Curiosity's \"seven minutes of terror,\" culminating with a hair-raising, rocket-powered descent and skycrane maneuver. But this time around, the size of the landing ellipse can shrink by about 50 percent, thanks to a smarter parachute deployment timing sequence and a feature called terrain-relative navigation. \"On Curiosity, once we popped the heat shield, we took pictures of the ground with a camera, but we didn't use that for landing,\" said Chen. \"This time, we can use those pictures and match them up with an onboard map.\" Once the rover knows where it is, it can make further trajectory changes and land closer to the more hazardous targets that scientists prefer. \"We prefer landing on things that are flat,\" Chen said. \"But they keep telling us that flat is boring.\" Hearing the bells and whistles. The sights and sounds of EDL will be captured by a suite of cameras and a microphone. Engineers will get their first look at an off-world parachute deployment, while audio of critical events will help NASA piece together information about the landing sequence. Another microphone on the SuperCam instrument will capture sounds from the surface as the rover trundles along. The Planetary Society, which helped fly a microphone on the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander in 1999, has been working with the project's SuperCam team and discussing possible ways to collaborate on their microphone. The Society also serves as the education and public outreach partner for the Mastcam-Z instrument. Other bells and whistles on the rover include the possibility of a small helicopter drone, which appears to be visible in new renderings of the spacecraft. During today's event, however, the drone was downplayed. \"We have been asked to study the possibility of bringing a helicopter along with us, so this is under consideration by NASA,\" Kenneth Farley said. \"But Mars 2020 is not yet certainly going to be flying a drone.\" Future plans. Whether or not Mars 2020 finds signs of past or present life, the mission could have far-reaching implications for future exploration of the planet. The rover will fill about 30 sample tubes with rock and soil samples, and deposit them for pickup by a future retrieval vehicle. Those samples could then be shipped back to Earth for analysis. A Mars sample return was listed as one of the top priorities in the last Decadal Survey. NASA's human spaceflight division is particularly interested in the results of the MOXIE instrument, which will ingest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into oxygen. That oxygen could then be used for rocket propellant and breathable air. As the event wrapped up, a viewer asked the JPL team when they believed humans would walk on Mars. \"The Journey to Mars will be a long one,\" said Allen Chen. \"It's certainly ahead of us in our future, but I hope it comes soon.\" ", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/20160715-mars-2020-kdp-c"}, {"title": "NASA is ready to build the Mars 2020 rover", "date": "2016-07-16", "content": "NASA announced today that the Mars 2020 rover has made it past a \"major development milestone\" in the review process and is ready for the final phases of design and construction. The agency also showed a new image of the rover's guts, and affirmed plans to launch the robot in the late summer of 2020 with a scheduled Martian arrival in February of 2021. The milestone that the rover passed is known as \"Key Decision Point C,\" according to George Tahu, the program executive for the mission. Tahu tells The Verge that the 2020 rover can now enter Phase C of development, which involves final design and fabrication, before moving on to Phase D: system assembly, testing, and launch. Tahu expects to transition to Phase D \"early next year.\" \"Like Curiosity, but even better.\"The Mars 2020 rover is a follow-up mission to the Curiosity rover. Though the two rovers look alike, the 2020 rover is tasked with probing Mars for signs of microbial life - something its predecessor didn't do. The 2020 rover will also collect and store samples, something Curiosity isn't equipped to do. These samples might someday be returned to Earth for further inspection, though there are no concrete plans to perform that at the moment. There are seven main instruments on the 2020 rover, all of which make it better-equipped than Curiosity to examine its surroundings. To start, the rover's main camera (the part that looks like the robot's head) is getting an upgrade. Mastcam-Z, as it's known, will be able to take panoramas and stereoscopic images just like Curiosity, but it will also be able to zoom in further than the older rover could. In fact, all of the 2020 rover's cameras will be better than Curiosity's, and the robot will even be equipped to record sound and video. The 2020 rover's \"SuperCam\" is like a more powerful version of Curiosity's \"ChemCam.\" It will fire a laser at Martian rocks and analyze the resulting radiation in order to identify minerals and better understand their elemental composition. This helps scientists back on Earth make more informed decisions about which rocks are the most important. Then there's the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment, or MOXIE. This instrument will pull carbon dioxide out of the Martian atmosphere and use it to produce pure oxygen. Being able to produce oxygen on Mars would be critical for future missions - it can be used to help keep visiting astronauts alive or turned into rocket fuel. Right next to MOXIE will be the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, or MEDA. It will measure the Martian weather by taking temperature and humidity readings, and it will also make atmospheric measurements to make sure MOXIE is operating properly. The 2020 rover will also be equipped with a ground penetrating radar instrument called RIFMAX. It will be able to see half a kilometer into the ground at a resolution of 5-20cm, offering scientists the first look at the subsurface of Mars. There are a few instruments on the rover's arm as well. One, called PIXL, will perform x-ray lithochemistry, which helps scientists map the distrobution of elements in Martian rocks. Another instrument called SHERLOC will perform fine-scale mineralogy and be able to detect organics. After NASA made today's announcement, the space agency performed a live stream on Facebook Live that ran through the history of the 2020 rover. They offered a deeper look at what the mission will look like, and the hosts also answered a number of questions from the virtual audience. Some topics covered included things like an explanation of how NASA plans to battle the problem of Curiosity's deteriorating wheels (the 2020 rover's wheels will be thicker), whether or not the famous \"seven minutes of terror\" landing sequence will be any different (it won't, but the rover will use cameras to make the landing even smoother), and whether it will still be able to take selfies (it will).

It should have enough power to make two- to three-minute flights every day covering about 550 yards per sortie. \"Because this thing is going to take off every day and land every day, we want to make sure we have a bulletproof landing system, and landing is the riskiest part of any mission,\" said Bob Balaram, chief engineer of mobility and robotics systems at JPL. NASA figures the helicopter could allow the rover to cover three times more territory in a day than if ground control teams relied only on the rover's onboard cameras and images from orbiting satellites to plot the path. \"With the helicopter, you can build up your terrain paths much more,\" Jim Green, head of NASA's Planetary Science division, told a science advisory panel last week. The helicopter also can moonlight as the rover's official photographer, taking spacecraft \"selfies\" to a whole new level, Green added.

The one-ton Mars 2020 rover is based largely on its predecessor, Curiosity, but comes equipped with a different suite of science instruments designed to search directly for signs of ancient Martian life. The mission has cleared a project milestone known as Key Decision Point C, which keeps the portable science laboratory on track for launch in July or August of 2020, with a landing in February 2021. \"NASA has given us the go-ahead to complete development of the mission,\" said project scientist Kenneth Farley, standing next to a full-scale testing mockup of Curiosity. \"This is a really big, important step for us.\" During the rover's two-year mission, it will search for signs of past life in rocks known to preserve organic biosignatures. Mars 2020-which is now eligible for a Curiosity-like name now that the project is in phase C-will also collect rock and soil samples for a possible future Earth return, and extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere to test technologies that may be needed for human visits. The surface of Mars is not currently conducive to life, but Curiosity found that it may have been in the past. \"Billions of years ago, there were rivers and lakes on the surface of the planet,\" Farley said. \"We're going to focus our exploration on this time in the distant past.\" The completion of Key Decision Point C also means the project has received a baseline cost. NASA officials said it would take $2.1 billion to develop and launch the mission, and another $300 million to operate the rover during its primary mission of one Martian year-slightly more than two Earth years. Landing and roving. In order for the Mars 2020 rover to look for signs of ancient Mars microbes, it must examine rocks formed while Mars was wet-approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Scientists have narrowed down a list of potential locations to eight candidates. \"The most important decision that we have ahead of us is where we're going to send the rover,\" Farley said. Safety is the biggest consideration, including both the entry, descent and landing sequence (EDL) and hazardous terrain the rover must cross to get to scientifically interesting spots. Over the course of the Curiosity mission, rough terrain has caused the rover's wheels to puncture and tear. Lessons learned from Curiosity will be applied to the new rover, according to Allen Chen, the mission's EDL lead. \"We are looking at a new design of the wheels that should help mitigate that,\" Chen said. \"Which principally has to do with thickening the wheels to be more robust to those puncture-type concerns that we've had with Curiosity.\" The Mars 2020 landing sequence will resemble Curiosity's \"seven minutes of terror,\" culminating with a hair-raising, rocket-powered descent and skycrane maneuver. But this time around, the size of the landing ellipse can shrink by about 50 percent, thanks to a smarter parachute deployment timing sequence and a feature called terrain-relative navigation. \"On Curiosity, once we popped the heat shield, we took pictures of the ground with a camera, but we didn't use that for landing,\" said Chen. \"This time, we can use those pictures and match them up with an onboard map.\" Once the rover knows where it is, it can make further trajectory changes and land closer to the more hazardous targets that scientists prefer. \"We prefer landing on things that are flat,\" Chen said. \"But they keep telling us that flat is boring.\" Hearing the bells and whistles. The sights and sounds of EDL will be captured by a suite of cameras and a microphone. Engineers will get their first look at an off-world parachute deployment, while audio of critical events will help NASA piece together information about the landing sequence. Another microphone on the SuperCam instrument will capture sounds from the surface as the rover trundles along. The Planetary Society, which helped fly a microphone on the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander in 1999, has been working with the project's SuperCam team and discussing possible ways to collaborate on their microphone. The Society also serves as the education and public outreach partner for the Mastcam-Z instrument. Other bells and whistles on the rover include the possibility of a small helicopter drone, which appears to be visible in new renderings of the spacecraft. During today's event, however, the drone was downplayed. \"We have been asked to study the possibility of bringing a helicopter along with us, so this is under consideration by NASA,\" Kenneth Farley said. \"But Mars 2020 is not yet certainly going to be flying a drone.\" Future plans. Whether or not Mars 2020 finds signs of past or present life, the mission could have far-reaching implications for future exploration of the planet. The rover will fill about 30 sample tubes with rock and soil samples, and deposit them for pickup by a future retrieval vehicle. Those samples could then be shipped back to Earth for analysis. A Mars sample return was listed as one of the top priorities in the last Decadal Survey. NASA's human spaceflight division is particularly interested in the results of the MOXIE instrument, which will ingest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into oxygen. That oxygen could then be used for rocket propellant and breathable air. As the event wrapped up, a viewer asked the JPL team when they believed humans would walk on Mars. \"The Journey to Mars will be a long one,\" said Allen Chen. \"It's certainly ahead of us in our future, but I hope it comes soon.\" ", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/20160715-mars-2020-kdp-c"}, {"title": "NASA is ready to build the Mars 2020 rover", "date": "2016-07-16", "content": "NASA announced today that the Mars 2020 rover has made it past a \"major development milestone\" in the review process and is ready for the final phases of design and construction.

The milestone that the rover passed is known as \"Key Decision Point C,\" according to George Tahu, the program executive for the mission. Tahu tells The Verge that the 2020 rover can now enter Phase C of development, which involves final design and fabrication, before moving on to Phase D: system assembly, testing, and launch. Tahu expects to transition to Phase D \"early next year.\" \"Like Curiosity, but even better.\"The Mars 2020 rover is a follow-up mission to the Curiosity rover. Though the two rovers look alike, the 2020 rover is tasked with probing Mars for signs of microbial life - something its predecessor didn't do. The 2020 rover will also collect and store samples, something Curiosity isn't equipped to do. These samples might someday be returned to Earth for further inspection, though there are no concrete plans to perform that at the moment. There are seven main instruments on the 2020 rover, all of which make it better-equipped than Curiosity to examine its surroundings. To start, the rover's main camera (the part that looks like the robot's head) is getting an upgrade. Mastcam-Z, as it's known, will be able to take panoramas and stereoscopic images just like Curiosity, but it will also be able to zoom in further than the older rover could. In fact, all of the 2020 rover's cameras will be better than Curiosity's, and the robot will even be equipped to record sound and video. The 2020 rover's \"SuperCam\" is like a more powerful version of Curiosity's \"ChemCam.\" It will fire a laser at Martian rocks and analyze the resulting radiation in order to identify minerals and better understand their elemental composition. This helps scientists back on Earth make more informed decisions about which rocks are the most important. Then there's the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment, or MOXIE. This instrument will pull carbon dioxide out of the Martian atmosphere and use it to produce pure oxygen. Being able to produce oxygen on Mars would be critical for future missions - it can be used to help keep visiting astronauts alive or turned into rocket fuel. Right next to MOXIE will be the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, or MEDA. It will measure the Martian weather by taking temperature and humidity readings, and it will also make atmospheric measurements to make sure MOXIE is operating properly. The 2020 rover will also be equipped with a ground penetrating radar instrument called RIFMAX. It will be able to see half a kilometer into the ground at a resolution of 5-20cm, offering scientists the first look at the subsurface of Mars. There are a few instruments on the rover's arm as well. One, called PIXL, will perform x-ray lithochemistry, which helps scientists map the distrobution of elements in Martian rocks. Another instrument called SHERLOC will perform fine-scale mineralogy and be able to detect organics. After NASA made today's announcement, the space agency performed a live stream on Facebook Live that ran through the history of the 2020 rover. They offered a deeper look at what the mission will look like, and the hosts also answered a number of questions from the virtual audience. Some topics covered included things like an explanation of how NASA plans to battle the problem of Curiosity's deteriorating wheels (the 2020 rover's wheels will be thicker), whether or not the famous \"seven minutes of terror\" landing sequence will be any different (it won't, but the rover will use cameras to make the landing even smoother), and whether it will still be able to take selfies (it will).

The terrain-relative navigation will match the rover's computer vision with pre-generated maps of Mars' surface to ensure safe landing conditions, making corrections to the landing destination as necessary. \"Terrain-relative navigation enables us to go to sites that were ruled too risky for Curiosity to explore,\" said Al Chen, the Mars 2020 entry, descent and landing lead at JPL. \"The range trigger lets us land closer to areas of scientific interest, shaving miles -- potentially as much as a year -- off a rover's journey.\" Though the specific landing site for Mars 2020 has yet to be determined, three strong contenders, all possibly fostering previous microbial life, are in the running: the potential hot spring at Columbia Hills, the ancient lakebed referred to as Jezero Crater, and the spot of possible chemical interactions between water and underground rocks at Northeast Syrtis. NASA indicates that the final landing site is the most important decision they are facing with the Mars 2020 mission, and a final decision is not expected for over a year. Regardless of which landing site is chosen, the upgraded instruments and advanced technologies on Mars 2020 have the potential to provide us with new scientific data, and possibly stimulate our wonder for extraterrestrial life.

Despite sharing approximately 85 percent of its design and hardware with the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, it has an objective different than its predecessor's. The new and improved mission includes upgraded wheels, enhanced camera features, and a built-in drill designed to collect rock cores. An integrated robotic arm will cap off rock core samples that will be brought back to Earth by a future Mars rover. The mission aims to drill a minimum of 20 rock cores, providing scientific data previously unavailable for analysis. In addition to the mechanical upgrades, the mission features seven new instruments that enable it to venture into territory deemed too dangerous for previous rovers. Mars 2020 will have the capability to survey surface areas believed to have housed bodies of water, such as lakes and rivers, some 3.5 billion years ago. Analysis of the uncharted surfaces will assist scientists in addressing the ever-burning question: Is there evidence of ancient life on Mars? \"Whether life ever existed beyond Earth is one of the grand questions humans seek to answer,\" said Ken Farley, JPL's Mars 2020's project scientist, in a press release. \"What we learn from the samples collected during this mission has the potential to address whether we're alone in the universe.\" To help answer this question, the mission has high-tech instruments designed to detect small-scale biosignatures that might remain on and below Mars' surface. Its ultraviolet laser has the power to identify active carbon atoms, while its X-ray spectrometer can pinpoint grain-of-salt size objects. The rover also features radar with ground-penetrating capabilities that, depending on the topography, can survey water, ice, and rock terrain up to 30 feet (10 meters) deep, giving us a look below Mars' surface for the first time.

The rover mission is scheduled to launch in July 2020 as NASA's next step in exploration of the Red Planet. It will not only seek signs of ancient habitable conditions - and past microbial life - but the rover also will collect rock and soil samples and store them in a cache on the planet's surface. NASA and ESA are studying future mission concepts to retrieve the samples and return them to Earth, so this landing site sets the stage for the next decade of Mars exploration. \"The landing site in Jezero Crater offers geologically rich terrain, with landforms reaching as far back as 3.6 billion years old, that could potentially answer important questions in planetary evolution and astrobiology,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Getting samples from this unique area will revolutionize how we think about Mars and its ability to harbor life.\" Jezero Crater is located on the western edge of Isidis Planitia, a giant impact basin just north of the Martian equator. Western Isidis presents some of the oldest and most scientifically interesting landscapes Mars has to offer. Mission scientists believe the 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) crater, once home to an ancient river delta, could have collected and preserved ancient organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life from the water and sediments that flowed into the crater billions of years ago. Jezero Crater's ancient lake-delta system offers many promising sampling targets of at least five kinds of rock, including clays and carbonates that have high potential to preserve signatures of past life. In addition, the material carried into the delta from a large watershed may contain a wide variety of minerals from inside and outside the crater.

In this test, a team of scientists and engineers had secreted themselves away to an undisclosed location in the desert southwest, and began taking pictures and other data from a mobile platform that simulated the view provided by a rover. Simultaneously, a team of scientists stationed around the world would meet remotely by telephone and computer video links to simulate nearly two weeks of rover activities, exercising all the software and communication tools needed to remotely operate the spacecraft. Many of us had experience with operating the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover, currently exploring the base on Mt. Sharp in Gale Crater. Some also had experience with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions-Opportunity and its twin Spirit, which had lost its battle to the martian elements back in 2011. Still others began their careers with Mars Pathfinder back in 1997 and its plucky little rover Sojourner. A few stalwart gray-beards went as far back as the Viking missions of the late 1970s. Others of us had experienced these types of tests in preparation for the MER and MSL missions. In 1999, NASA sponsored a Mars rover simulation in Silver Lake, California with a robotic prototype rover called Marsokhod. In 2001, a similar field experiment was done with a rover called FIDO to practice for what would become the MER rover missions. I had been on both sides of the experiment: Sometimes I was in the field acting like a rover and taking data requested by a remote team hundreds of miles away. Sometimes I sat comfortably in air-conditioned rooms, analyzing data that came in on a daily basis, interpreting what it meant and helping figure out what the \"rover\" should do the next day. The goal was always to test the abilities of both the on-site and off-site teams to maximize the scientific return from a remotely-operated rover. Like any good field trip, however, the ancillary goal was to get to know your colleagues-your team-and how best to combine sets of expertise while navigating the terrain and the rover. So what did we know about the area in which the ROASTT would be conducted? We had been shown the location of the \"rover\" in orbital images and the intended path toward different points of interest in the rugged desert terrain. We had been shown the \"downlink\" of data from \"Sol 99\" which revealed a narrow channel with rubble and small cobbles at the rover's wheels, flanked by jumbled conglomerates of rock and dirt comprising the banks of an apparent channel eroded into the terrain. In the distance, layered and tilted outcrops of rock were known to be the target of a 30-meter long drive that would happen on Sol 100. A portion of the team was dedicated to the \"Campaign Implementation\" (CI) aspect-figuring out what strategies and priorities should dictate how and where the rover should conduct its business of exploration and discovery. They had formulated a plan for Sol 101, the first real day of the test. I was filling the role of the \"Tactical Science Lead\" (TSL), tasked with organizing members of the team responsible for crafting a rover activity plan for the sol that met the overall goals handed to us by the CI team. At 07:07 AM at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where the main mission operations hub was housed, engineers released the contents of the Sol 100 downlink to the team. I had the luxury of living in Maryland where the corresponding 10:07 AM release time was a bit more manageable. From the first look at the images, it was apparent that the drive on Sol 100 had been a success and we were less than 10 m away from \"Waypoint 2\", a region identified from orbit that would provide access to the highest position in the area where exposed, layered outcrops of rock were thought to contain clay and carbonate minerals of interest to the science team-and prime targets for sampling! Our agenda for the day was highly scripted, with a series of timed meetings designed to advance the team from identifying rock targets of interest for analysis by the cameras and other instruments to piecing together \"components\" of activities that the rover and its instruments would perform. For example-we could request that the rover take additional color photos or mosaics of part of the channel, or use the spectrometers to take multiple shots at specific locations on a rock outcrop to determine its chemical makeup. Our tactical team had a little more than 3 hours dedicated to coming up with a plan that met today's goals---survey the area up ahead well enough that the next sol's short drive to Waypoint 2 would have enough information to begin interrogation of specific locations using the instruments on the rover's arm. That data would help the team pick a spot to drill, and eventually \"extract\" a sample to store onboard. The \"Kickoff\" meeting began the day at 08:00 AM, with about 20 people with specific roles on shift and a hoard of other science team members on the telecon line to plan Sol 101. In that meeting we confirmed that the rover was healthy and ready to proceed with another day of planning. We learned about the other limitations we would have on planning, like the amount of data volume that would make it back to \"Earth\" before the next sol's planning. That would inform us about how to limit our appetites for new images and data, and how to prioritize what we acquired. We reviewed the plan handed to us by the CI team, and made sure we read their reports about their intents for the observations in that plan. Their plan included a large Mastcam-Z mosaic intended to image the channel wall on the left side of the rover and the area it would drive to next. It also included three SuperCam observations to understand how the composition of the layered rocks near the rover might change from one place to another. Over the subsequent 60 minutes the \"Plan Development\" meeting allowed us to discuss the scene around the rover in more detail and identify potential targets of interest. The Mastcam-Z Payload Uplink Lead (PUL) for the day let us know that the intended 360-degree panorama in the CI plan required too much data volume (almost 10 times the amount we could downlink that day) and too long a time (four and a half hours) to be feasible. So we began to construct a more tractable Mastcam-Z mosaic that would image the entire channel wall and the Waypoint 2 region but at lower resolution, cutting both the number of images (data volume) and time. Others on the telecon pointed to the hill off the right side of the rover, and suggested that a lower priority observation would be a small mosaic of that region, given that it was the highest area in the local surroundings. The PUL began busily working on different efficient options to image the two areas.

While that will be the first time the wheels of the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) rover touch the Red Planet, the vehicle's network of processors, sensors and transmitters will, by then, have successfully simulated touchdown at Jezero many times before. \"We first landed on Jezero Crater on Jan. 23rd,\" said Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover successfully landed again on Mars two days later.\" Bottom was the test lead for Systems Test 1, or ST1, the Mars 2020 engineering team's first opportunity to take the major components of the Mars 2020 mission for a test drive. Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission's cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The heritage for Mars 2020's software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in 2020. \"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\" Making the Grade. On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission's hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling - \"umbilicals\" - were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft's cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft's electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn't go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. \"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices. There was a lot going on in there.\" On Jan. 30, the Mars 2020 test team was able to close their 1,000-plus page book of procedures for ST1. They went two-for-two on Mars landings. They also launchedfour times, performed deep space navigation, executed several trajectory correction maneuvers and even tested a few in-flight off-nominal situations.This first evaluation of flight hardware and software, over a year in the making, had been a thorough success, demonstrating where things excelled and where they could be improved. When these new changes have been investigated on both a virtual workstation and in the testbed, they will have their chance to \"fly\" in one of the many other systems tests planned for Mars 2020. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface. It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures,\" said Bottom. \"Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8421/nasas-mars-2020-rover-is-put-to-the-test/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover passes its tests with flying colors", "date": "2019-03-23", "content": "Preparations are well underway for NASA's next mission to Mars, when it plans to land the Mars 2020 rover on the surface to look for signs of life and collect samples.

Called Systems Test 1, or ST1, these tests represent the first test drive of the new rover. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission, said in a statement. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The tests were performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in the High Bay 1 cleanroom, requiring the technicians to don white \"bunny suits\" to prevent the introduction of any contaminants. Most of the working team members were outside the room and looking in, with just two technicians overseeing the tests in person. Designed to be as realistic as possible, the tests included communications handled by X-band radio transmission, just as will be the case with the real 2020 mission. An umbilical of electrical cabling fed data and power to the craft, and the launch capacities were tested when commands for powering on the electrical components and configuring the thermal, power, and telecomm systems were relayed. After several tests of the launch system, the landing sequence was tested too, as well as a deep space cruise. The tests were successful, and in the end the team was able to perform two landings, four launches, several trajectory correction maneuvers, and deep space navigation. The next challenge for the rover is to see how it will cope with the low temperatures on Mars by testing its abilities to perform in cold environments. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface,\" Bottom explained. \"It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures.

Mission scientists believe the 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) crater, once home to an ancient river delta, could have collected and preserved ancient organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life from the water and sediments that flowed into the crater billions of years ago. Jezero Crater's ancient lake-delta system offers many promising sampling targets of at least five kinds of rock, including clays and carbonates that have high potential to preserve signatures of past life. In addition, the material carried into the delta from a large watershed may contain a wide variety of minerals from inside and outside the crater. The geologic diversity that makes Jezero so appealing to Mars 2020 scientists also makes it a challenge for the team's entry, descent and landing (EDL) engineers. Along with the massive nearby river delta and small crater impacts, the site contains numerous boulders and rocks to the east, cliffs to the west and depressions filled with aeolian bedforms (wind-derived ripples in sand that could trap a rover) in several locations. \"The Mars community has long coveted the scientific value of sites such as Jezero Crater, and a previous mission contemplated going there, but the challenges with safely landing were considered prohibitive,\" said Ken Farley, project scientist for Mars 2020 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But what was once out of reach is now conceivable, thanks to the 2020 engineering team and advances in Mars entry, descent and landing technologies.\" When the landing site search began, mission engineers already had refined the landing system such that they were able to reduce the Mars 2020 landing zone to an area 50 percent smaller than that for the landing of NASA's Curiosity rover at Gale Crater in 2012. This allowed the science community to consider more challenging landing sites. The sites of greatest scientific interest led NASA to add a new capability called Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN). TRN will enable the \"sky crane\" descent stage, the rocket-powered system that carries the rover down to the surface, to avoid hazardous areas. The site selection is dependent upon extensive analyses and verification testing of the TRN capability. A final report will be presented to an independent review board and NASA Headquarters in the fall of 2019. \"Nothing has been more difficult in robotic planetary exploration than landing on Mars,\" said Zurbuchen. \"The Mars 2020 engineering team has done a tremendous amount of work to prepare us for this decision. The team will continue its work to truly understand the TRN system and the risks involved, and we will review the findings independently to reassure we have maximized our chances for success.\" Selecting a landing site this early allows the rover drivers and science operations team to optimize their plans for exploring Jezero Crater once the rover is safely on the ground. Using data from NASA's fleet of Mars orbiters, they will map the terrain in greater detail and identify regions of interest - places with the most interesting geological features, for example - where Mars 2020 could collect the best science samples.

In this test, a team of scientists and engineers had secreted themselves away to an undisclosed location in the desert southwest, and began taking pictures and other data from a mobile platform that simulated the view provided by a rover. Simultaneously, a team of scientists stationed around the world would meet remotely by telephone and computer video links to simulate nearly two weeks of rover activities, exercising all the software and communication tools needed to remotely operate the spacecraft. Many of us had experience with operating the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover, currently exploring the base on Mt. Sharp in Gale Crater. Some also had experience with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions-Opportunity and its twin Spirit, which had lost its battle to the martian elements back in 2011. Still others began their careers with Mars Pathfinder back in 1997 and its plucky little rover Sojourner. A few stalwart gray-beards went as far back as the Viking missions of the late 1970s. Others of us had experienced these types of tests in preparation for the MER and MSL missions. In 1999, NASA sponsored a Mars rover simulation in Silver Lake, California with a robotic prototype rover called Marsokhod. In 2001, a similar field experiment was done with a rover called FIDO to practice for what would become the MER rover missions. I had been on both sides of the experiment: Sometimes I was in the field acting like a rover and taking data requested by a remote team hundreds of miles away. Sometimes I sat comfortably in air-conditioned rooms, analyzing data that came in on a daily basis, interpreting what it meant and helping figure out what the \"rover\" should do the next day. The goal was always to test the abilities of both the on-site and off-site teams to maximize the scientific return from a remotely-operated rover. Like any good field trip, however, the ancillary goal was to get to know your colleagues-your team-and how best to combine sets of expertise while navigating the terrain and the rover. So what did we know about the area in which the ROASTT would be conducted? We had been shown the location of the \"rover\" in orbital images and the intended path toward different points of interest in the rugged desert terrain. We had been shown the \"downlink\" of data from \"Sol 99\" which revealed a narrow channel with rubble and small cobbles at the rover's wheels, flanked by jumbled conglomerates of rock and dirt comprising the banks of an apparent channel eroded into the terrain. In the distance, layered and tilted outcrops of rock were known to be the target of a 30-meter long drive that would happen on Sol 100. A portion of the team was dedicated to the \"Campaign Implementation\" (CI) aspect-figuring out what strategies and priorities should dictate how and where the rover should conduct its business of exploration and discovery. They had formulated a plan for Sol 101, the first real day of the test. I was filling the role of the \"Tactical Science Lead\" (TSL), tasked with organizing members of the team responsible for crafting a rover activity plan for the sol that met the overall goals handed to us by the CI team. At 07:07 AM at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where the main mission operations hub was housed, engineers released the contents of the Sol 100 downlink to the team. I had the luxury of living in Maryland where the corresponding 10:07 AM release time was a bit more manageable. From the first look at the images, it was apparent that the drive on Sol 100 had been a success and we were less than 10 m away from \"Waypoint 2\", a region identified from orbit that would provide access to the highest position in the area where exposed, layered outcrops of rock were thought to contain clay and carbonate minerals of interest to the science team-and prime targets for sampling! Our agenda for the day was highly scripted, with a series of timed meetings designed to advance the team from identifying rock targets of interest for analysis by the cameras and other instruments to piecing together \"components\" of activities that the rover and its instruments would perform. For example-we could request that the rover take additional color photos or mosaics of part of the channel, or use the spectrometers to take multiple shots at specific locations on a rock outcrop to determine its chemical makeup. Our tactical team had a little more than 3 hours dedicated to coming up with a plan that met today's goals---survey the area up ahead well enough that the next sol's short drive to Waypoint 2 would have enough information to begin interrogation of specific locations using the instruments on the rover's arm. That data would help the team pick a spot to drill, and eventually \"extract\" a sample to store onboard. The \"Kickoff\" meeting began the day at 08:00 AM, with about 20 people with specific roles on shift and a hoard of other science team members on the telecon line to plan Sol 101. In that meeting we confirmed that the rover was healthy and ready to proceed with another day of planning. We learned about the other limitations we would have on planning, like the amount of data volume that would make it back to \"Earth\" before the next sol's planning. That would inform us about how to limit our appetites for new images and data, and how to prioritize what we acquired. We reviewed the plan handed to us by the CI team, and made sure we read their reports about their intents for the observations in that plan. Their plan included a large Mastcam-Z mosaic intended to image the channel wall on the left side of the rover and the area it would drive to next. It also included three SuperCam observations to understand how the composition of the layered rocks near the rover might change from one place to another. Over the subsequent 60 minutes the \"Plan Development\" meeting allowed us to discuss the scene around the rover in more detail and identify potential targets of interest. The Mastcam-Z Payload Uplink Lead (PUL) for the day let us know that the intended 360-degree panorama in the CI plan required too much data volume (almost 10 times the amount we could downlink that day) and too long a time (four and a half hours) to be feasible. So we began to construct a more tractable Mastcam-Z mosaic that would image the entire channel wall and the Waypoint 2 region but at lower resolution, cutting both the number of images (data volume) and time. Others on the telecon pointed to the hill off the right side of the rover, and suggested that a lower priority observation would be a small mosaic of that region, given that it was the highest area in the local surroundings. The PUL began busily working on different efficient options to image the two areas.

While that will be the first time the wheels of the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) rover touch the Red Planet, the vehicle's network of processors, sensors and transmitters will, by then, have successfully simulated touchdown at Jezero many times before. \"We first landed on Jezero Crater on Jan. 23rd,\" said Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover successfully landed again on Mars two days later.\" Bottom was the test lead for Systems Test 1, or ST1, the Mars 2020 engineering team's first opportunity to take the major components of the Mars 2020 mission for a test drive. Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission's cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The heritage for Mars 2020's software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in 2020. \"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\" Making the Grade. On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission's hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling - \"umbilicals\" - were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft's cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft's electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn't go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. \"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices. There was a lot going on in there.\" On Jan. 30, the Mars 2020 test team was able to close their 1,000-plus page book of procedures for ST1. They went two-for-two on Mars landings. They also launchedfour times, performed deep space navigation, executed several trajectory correction maneuvers and even tested a few in-flight off-nominal situations.This first evaluation of flight hardware and software, over a year in the making, had been a thorough success, demonstrating where things excelled and where they could be improved. When these new changes have been investigated on both a virtual workstation and in the testbed, they will have their chance to \"fly\" in one of the many other systems tests planned for Mars 2020. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface. It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures,\" said Bottom. \"Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8421/nasas-mars-2020-rover-is-put-to-the-test/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover passes its tests with flying colors", "date": "2019-03-23", "content": "Preparations are well underway for NASA's next mission to Mars, when it plans to land the Mars 2020 rover on the surface to look for signs of life and collect samples. Recently, the Mars 2020 rover team has been undertaking a series of tests to see if the craft will be able to launch, navigate, and land on the Red Planet. Called Systems Test 1, or ST1, these tests represent the first test drive of the new rover. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission, said in a statement. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The tests were performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in the High Bay 1 cleanroom, requiring the technicians to don white \"bunny suits\" to prevent the introduction of any contaminants. Most of the working team members were outside the room and looking in, with just two technicians overseeing the tests in person. Designed to be as realistic as possible, the tests included communications handled by X-band radio transmission, just as will be the case with the real 2020 mission. An umbilical of electrical cabling fed data and power to the craft, and the launch capacities were tested when commands for powering on the electrical components and configuring the thermal, power, and telecomm systems were relayed. After several tests of the launch system, the landing sequence was tested too, as well as a deep space cruise. The tests were successful, and in the end the team was able to perform two landings, four launches, several trajectory correction maneuvers, and deep space navigation. The next challenge for the rover is to see how it will cope with the low temperatures on Mars by testing its abilities to perform in cold environments. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface,\" Bottom explained. \"It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures.

But over the past few weeks, some of these components - the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover - have seemingly disappeared. In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it's time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when. \"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an Atlas V rocket, which gives us about 15 feet 5 meters of width to work with,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane. \"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that's come through JPL since Mariner,\" said Gruel. \"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\" After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\" The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8428/things-are-stacking-up-for-nasas-mars-2020-spacecraft/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Practicing Mars 2020 rover operations, on Earth", "date": "2019-02-25", "content": "Months of preparations by the Mars 2020 mission operations staff would culminate in today's first practice \"sol\" (martian day) as part of an exercise named the Rover Operations Activities for Science Team Training (ROASTT).

But over the past few weeks, some of these components - the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover - have seemingly disappeared. In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it's time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when. \"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an Atlas V rocket, which gives us about 15 feet 5 meters of width to work with,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane. \"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that's come through JPL since Mariner,\" said Gruel. \"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\" After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\" The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers.

But the new model features a variety of upgrades and improvements, along with a suite of powerful instruments to look for signs of past martian life and to cache rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth. In the image above, taken 29 April, engineers in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 work to integrate the new rover's motor controller assembly in the body of the spacecraft. The motor controller assembly routes commands to the rover's wheels, robotic arm joints, camera mast, drill and systems used to collect soil samples for on-site analysis. In this view, the rover's body is upside down to provide access to the belly of the spacecraft. Along with integrating systems in the rover, JPL engineers also are assembling the spacecraft's interplanetary cruise stage and the rocket-powered \"sky crane\" landing system that will lower Mars 2020 to touchdown in Jezero Crater in February 2021. A critical part of that work is fitting components together - stacking - several times to make sure everything will fit properly inside the nose cone fairing of an Atlas 5 rocket. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" The first step in the stacking procedure was mounting the rocket-powered descent stage on top of a rover mockup. After multiple fit checks, the aerodynamic \"backshell\" was lowered into place. Once that was complete, and more fit checks verified the hardware matched the blueprints, a protective nose cone was placed over the spacecraft's folded parachute, followed by attachment to the cruise stage that will power Mars 2020 during its seven-month trip. The stack then was rotated back to its original position for attachment of the lander's heat shield. The completion of stacking clears the way for acoustic vibration testing to make sure the spacecraft is up to the sound and shaking of launch followed by thermal vacuum chamber testing to expose the craft to a simulated space environment. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work.

In this test, a team of scientists and engineers had secreted themselves away to an undisclosed location in the desert southwest, and began taking pictures and other data from a mobile platform that simulated the view provided by a rover. Simultaneously, a team of scientists stationed around the world would meet remotely by telephone and computer video links to simulate nearly two weeks of rover activities, exercising all the software and communication tools needed to remotely operate the spacecraft. Many of us had experience with operating the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover, currently exploring the base on Mt. Sharp in Gale Crater. Some also had experience with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions-Opportunity and its twin Spirit, which had lost its battle to the martian elements back in 2011. Still others began their careers with Mars Pathfinder back in 1997 and its plucky little rover Sojourner. A few stalwart gray-beards went as far back as the Viking missions of the late 1970s. Others of us had experienced these types of tests in preparation for the MER and MSL missions. In 1999, NASA sponsored a Mars rover simulation in Silver Lake, California with a robotic prototype rover called Marsokhod. In 2001, a similar field experiment was done with a rover called FIDO to practice for what would become the MER rover missions. I had been on both sides of the experiment: Sometimes I was in the field acting like a rover and taking data requested by a remote team hundreds of miles away. Sometimes I sat comfortably in air-conditioned rooms, analyzing data that came in on a daily basis, interpreting what it meant and helping figure out what the \"rover\" should do the next day. The goal was always to test the abilities of both the on-site and off-site teams to maximize the scientific return from a remotely-operated rover. Like any good field trip, however, the ancillary goal was to get to know your colleagues-your team-and how best to combine sets of expertise while navigating the terrain and the rover. So what did we know about the area in which the ROASTT would be conducted? We had been shown the location of the \"rover\" in orbital images and the intended path toward different points of interest in the rugged desert terrain. We had been shown the \"downlink\" of data from \"Sol 99\" which revealed a narrow channel with rubble and small cobbles at the rover's wheels, flanked by jumbled conglomerates of rock and dirt comprising the banks of an apparent channel eroded into the terrain. In the distance, layered and tilted outcrops of rock were known to be the target of a 30-meter long drive that would happen on Sol 100. A portion of the team was dedicated to the \"Campaign Implementation\" (CI) aspect-figuring out what strategies and priorities should dictate how and where the rover should conduct its business of exploration and discovery. They had formulated a plan for Sol 101, the first real day of the test. I was filling the role of the \"Tactical Science Lead\" (TSL), tasked with organizing members of the team responsible for crafting a rover activity plan for the sol that met the overall goals handed to us by the CI team. At 07:07 AM at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where the main mission operations hub was housed, engineers released the contents of the Sol 100 downlink to the team. I had the luxury of living in Maryland where the corresponding 10:07 AM release time was a bit more manageable. From the first look at the images, it was apparent that the drive on Sol 100 had been a success and we were less than 10 m away from \"Waypoint 2\", a region identified from orbit that would provide access to the highest position in the area where exposed, layered outcrops of rock were thought to contain clay and carbonate minerals of interest to the science team-and prime targets for sampling! Our agenda for the day was highly scripted, with a series of timed meetings designed to advance the team from identifying rock targets of interest for analysis by the cameras and other instruments to piecing together \"components\" of activities that the rover and its instruments would perform. For example-we could request that the rover take additional color photos or mosaics of part of the channel, or use the spectrometers to take multiple shots at specific locations on a rock outcrop to determine its chemical makeup. Our tactical team had a little more than 3 hours dedicated to coming up with a plan that met today's goals---survey the area up ahead well enough that the next sol's short drive to Waypoint 2 would have enough information to begin interrogation of specific locations using the instruments on the rover's arm. That data would help the team pick a spot to drill, and eventually \"extract\" a sample to store onboard. The \"Kickoff\" meeting began the day at 08:00 AM, with about 20 people with specific roles on shift and a hoard of other science team members on the telecon line to plan Sol 101. In that meeting we confirmed that the rover was healthy and ready to proceed with another day of planning. We learned about the other limitations we would have on planning, like the amount of data volume that would make it back to \"Earth\" before the next sol's planning. That would inform us about how to limit our appetites for new images and data, and how to prioritize what we acquired. We reviewed the plan handed to us by the CI team, and made sure we read their reports about their intents for the observations in that plan. Their plan included a large Mastcam-Z mosaic intended to image the channel wall on the left side of the rover and the area it would drive to next. It also included three SuperCam observations to understand how the composition of the layered rocks near the rover might change from one place to another. Over the subsequent 60 minutes the \"Plan Development\" meeting allowed us to discuss the scene around the rover in more detail and identify potential targets of interest. The Mastcam-Z Payload Uplink Lead (PUL) for the day let us know that the intended 360-degree panorama in the CI plan required too much data volume (almost 10 times the amount we could downlink that day) and too long a time (four and a half hours) to be feasible. So we began to construct a more tractable Mastcam-Z mosaic that would image the entire channel wall and the Waypoint 2 region but at lower resolution, cutting both the number of images (data volume) and time. Others on the telecon pointed to the hill off the right side of the rover, and suggested that a lower priority observation would be a small mosaic of that region, given that it was the highest area in the local surroundings. The PUL began busily working on different efficient options to image the two areas.

While that will be the first time the wheels of the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) rover touch the Red Planet, the vehicle's network of processors, sensors and transmitters will, by then, have successfully simulated touchdown at Jezero many times before. \"We first landed on Jezero Crater on Jan. 23rd,\" said Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover successfully landed again on Mars two days later.\" Bottom was the test lead for Systems Test 1, or ST1, the Mars 2020 engineering team's first opportunity to take the major components of the Mars 2020 mission for a test drive. Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission's cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The heritage for Mars 2020's software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in 2020. \"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\" Making the Grade. On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission's hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling - \"umbilicals\" - were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft's cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft's electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn't go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. \"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices.

Both of the rover's legs (the starboard leg's black tubing can be seen above the wheels) are composed of titanium tubing formed with the same process used to make high-end bicycle frames. The wheels in this picture are engineering models and will not make the trip to Mars. They will be swapped out for flight models of the wheels sometime next year. Made of aluminum, each of the six wheels (each 20.7 inches, or 52.5 centimeters, in diameter) features 48 grousers, or cleats, machined into its surface to provide excellent traction both in soft sand and on hard rocks. Every wheel has its own motor. The two front and two rear wheels also have individual steering motors that enable the vehicle to turn a full 360 degrees in place.

In this test, a team of scientists and engineers had secreted themselves away to an undisclosed location in the desert southwest, and began taking pictures and other data from a mobile platform that simulated the view provided by a rover. Simultaneously, a team of scientists stationed around the world would meet remotely by telephone and computer video links to simulate nearly two weeks of rover activities, exercising all the software and communication tools needed to remotely operate the spacecraft. Many of us had experience with operating the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover, currently exploring the base on Mt. Sharp in Gale Crater. Some also had experience with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions-Opportunity and its twin Spirit, which had lost its battle to the martian elements back in 2011. Still others began their careers with Mars Pathfinder back in 1997 and its plucky little rover Sojourner. A few stalwart gray-beards went as far back as the Viking missions of the late 1970s. Others of us had experienced these types of tests in preparation for the MER and MSL missions. In 1999, NASA sponsored a Mars rover simulation in Silver Lake, California with a robotic prototype rover called Marsokhod. In 2001, a similar field experiment was done with a rover called FIDO to practice for what would become the MER rover missions. I had been on both sides of the experiment: Sometimes I was in the field acting like a rover and taking data requested by a remote team hundreds of miles away. Sometimes I sat comfortably in air-conditioned rooms, analyzing data that came in on a daily basis, interpreting what it meant and helping figure out what the \"rover\" should do the next day. The goal was always to test the abilities of both the on-site and off-site teams to maximize the scientific return from a remotely-operated rover. Like any good field trip, however, the ancillary goal was to get to know your colleagues-your team-and how best to combine sets of expertise while navigating the terrain and the rover. So what did we know about the area in which the ROASTT would be conducted? We had been shown the location of the \"rover\" in orbital images and the intended path toward different points of interest in the rugged desert terrain. We had been shown the \"downlink\" of data from \"Sol 99\" which revealed a narrow channel with rubble and small cobbles at the rover's wheels, flanked by jumbled conglomerates of rock and dirt comprising the banks of an apparent channel eroded into the terrain. In the distance, layered and tilted outcrops of rock were known to be the target of a 30-meter long drive that would happen on Sol 100. A portion of the team was dedicated to the \"Campaign Implementation\" (CI) aspect-figuring out what strategies and priorities should dictate how and where the rover should conduct its business of exploration and discovery. They had formulated a plan for Sol 101, the first real day of the test. I was filling the role of the \"Tactical Science Lead\" (TSL), tasked with organizing members of the team responsible for crafting a rover activity plan for the sol that met the overall goals handed to us by the CI team. At 07:07 AM at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where the main mission operations hub was housed, engineers released the contents of the Sol 100 downlink to the team. I had the luxury of living in Maryland where the corresponding 10:07 AM release time was a bit more manageable. From the first look at the images, it was apparent that the drive on Sol 100 had been a success and we were less than 10 m away from \"Waypoint 2\", a region identified from orbit that would provide access to the highest position in the area where exposed, layered outcrops of rock were thought to contain clay and carbonate minerals of interest to the science team-and prime targets for sampling! Our agenda for the day was highly scripted, with a series of timed meetings designed to advance the team from identifying rock targets of interest for analysis by the cameras and other instruments to piecing together \"components\" of activities that the rover and its instruments would perform. For example-we could request that the rover take additional color photos or mosaics of part of the channel, or use the spectrometers to take multiple shots at specific locations on a rock outcrop to determine its chemical makeup. Our tactical team had a little more than 3 hours dedicated to coming up with a plan that met today's goals---survey the area up ahead well enough that the next sol's short drive to Waypoint 2 would have enough information to begin interrogation of specific locations using the instruments on the rover's arm. That data would help the team pick a spot to drill, and eventually \"extract\" a sample to store onboard. The \"Kickoff\" meeting began the day at 08:00 AM, with about 20 people with specific roles on shift and a hoard of other science team members on the telecon line to plan Sol 101. In that meeting we confirmed that the rover was healthy and ready to proceed with another day of planning. We learned about the other limitations we would have on planning, like the amount of data volume that would make it back to \"Earth\" before the next sol's planning. That would inform us about how to limit our appetites for new images and data, and how to prioritize what we acquired. We reviewed the plan handed to us by the CI team, and made sure we read their reports about their intents for the observations in that plan. Their plan included a large Mastcam-Z mosaic intended to image the channel wall on the left side of the rover and the area it would drive to next. It also included three SuperCam observations to understand how the composition of the layered rocks near the rover might change from one place to another. Over the subsequent 60 minutes the \"Plan Development\" meeting allowed us to discuss the scene around the rover in more detail and identify potential targets of interest. The Mastcam-Z Payload Uplink Lead (PUL) for the day let us know that the intended 360-degree panorama in the CI plan required too much data volume (almost 10 times the amount we could downlink that day) and too long a time (four and a half hours) to be feasible. So we began to construct a more tractable Mastcam-Z mosaic that would image the entire channel wall and the Waypoint 2 region but at lower resolution, cutting both the number of images (data volume) and time. Others on the telecon pointed to the hill off the right side of the rover, and suggested that a lower priority observation would be a small mosaic of that region, given that it was the highest area in the local surroundings. The PUL began busily working on different efficient options to image the two areas.

While that will be the first time the wheels of the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) rover touch the Red Planet, the vehicle's network of processors, sensors and transmitters will, by then, have successfully simulated touchdown at Jezero many times before. \"We first landed on Jezero Crater on Jan. 23rd,\" said Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover successfully landed again on Mars two days later.\" Bottom was the test lead for Systems Test 1, or ST1, the Mars 2020 engineering team's first opportunity to take the major components of the Mars 2020 mission for a test drive. Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission's cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The heritage for Mars 2020's software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in 2020. \"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\" Making the Grade. On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission's hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling - \"umbilicals\" - were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft's cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft's electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn't go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. \"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices. There was a lot going on in there.\" On Jan. 30, the Mars 2020 test team was able to close their 1,000-plus page book of procedures for ST1. They went two-for-two on Mars landings. They also launchedfour times, performed deep space navigation, executed several trajectory correction maneuvers and even tested a few in-flight off-nominal situations.This first evaluation of flight hardware and software, over a year in the making, had been a thorough success, demonstrating where things excelled and where they could be improved. When these new changes have been investigated on both a virtual workstation and in the testbed, they will have their chance to \"fly\" in one of the many other systems tests planned for Mars 2020. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface. It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures,\" said Bottom. \"Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8421/nasas-mars-2020-rover-is-put-to-the-test/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover passes its tests with flying colors", "date": "2019-03-23", "content": "Preparations are well underway for NASA's next mission to Mars, when it plans to land the Mars 2020 rover on the surface to look for signs of life and collect samples. Recently, the Mars 2020 rover team has been undertaking a series of tests to see if the craft will be able to launch, navigate, and land on the Red Planet. Called Systems Test 1, or ST1, these tests represent the first test drive of the new rover. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission, said in a statement. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The tests were performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in the High Bay 1 cleanroom, requiring the technicians to don white \"bunny suits\" to prevent the introduction of any contaminants. Most of the working team members were outside the room and looking in, with just two technicians overseeing the tests in person. Designed to be as realistic as possible, the tests included communications handled by X-band radio transmission, just as will be the case with the real 2020 mission. An umbilical of electrical cabling fed data and power to the craft, and the launch capacities were tested when commands for powering on the electrical components and configuring the thermal, power, and telecomm systems were relayed. After several tests of the launch system, the landing sequence was tested too, as well as a deep space cruise. The tests were successful, and in the end the team was able to perform two landings, four launches, several trajectory correction maneuvers, and deep space navigation. The next challenge for the rover is to see how it will cope with the low temperatures on Mars by testing its abilities to perform in cold environments. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface,\" Bottom explained. \"It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures. Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\" ", "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/mars-2020-rover-tests/"}, {"title": "Things Are Stacking up for NASA's Mars 2020 Spacecraft", "date": "2019-04-18", "content": "For the past few months, the clean room floor in High Bay 1 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has been covered in parts, components and test equipment for the Mars 2020 spacecraft, scheduled for launch toward the Red Planet in July of 2020. But over the past few weeks, some of these components - the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover - have seemingly disappeared. In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it's time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when. \"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an Atlas V rocket, which gives us about 15 feet 5 meters of width to work with,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane. \"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that's come through JPL since Mariner,\" said Gruel. \"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\" After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\" The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8428/things-are-stacking-up-for-nasas-mars-2020-spacecraft/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover coming together at JPL", "date": "2019-05-13", "content": "NASA's 2020 Mars rover and the spacecraft that will carry it to the red planet a little more than a year from now are taking shape at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The nuclear-powered 2020 rover is a close relative of the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 and is now working its way up the lower slopes of Mount Sharp in the heart of Gale Crater. But the new model features a variety of upgrades and improvements, along with a suite of powerful instruments to look for signs of past martian life and to cache rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth. In the image above, taken 29 April, engineers in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 work to integrate the new rover's motor controller assembly in the body of the spacecraft. The motor controller assembly routes commands to the rover's wheels, robotic arm joints, camera mast, drill and systems used to collect soil samples for on-site analysis. In this view, the rover's body is upside down to provide access to the belly of the spacecraft. Along with integrating systems in the rover, JPL engineers also are assembling the spacecraft's interplanetary cruise stage and the rocket-powered \"sky crane\" landing system that will lower Mars 2020 to touchdown in Jezero Crater in February 2021. A critical part of that work is fitting components together - stacking - several times to make sure everything will fit properly inside the nose cone fairing of an Atlas 5 rocket. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" The first step in the stacking procedure was mounting the rocket-powered descent stage on top of a rover mockup. After multiple fit checks, the aerodynamic \"backshell\" was lowered into place. Once that was complete, and more fit checks verified the hardware matched the blueprints, a protective nose cone was placed over the spacecraft's folded parachute, followed by attachment to the cruise stage that will power Mars 2020 during its seven-month trip. The stack then was rotated back to its original position for attachment of the lander's heat shield. The completion of stacking clears the way for acoustic vibration testing to make sure the spacecraft is up to the sound and shaking of launch followed by thermal vacuum chamber testing to expose the craft to a simulated space environment. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work.

In the video, which has been speed up 300 times, the \"bunny suit\" wearing engineers swiftly install the rover's wheels, looking very much like a racing pit crew. Like previous NASA rovers sent to explore the Red Planet, the Mars 2020 rover has six wheels, each with its own motor, and uses a \"rocker and bogie\" suspension system to keep the rover's body level as it rolls over rocky terrain. The two front and two rear wheels also have individual steering motors which enable the rover to turn 360 degrees in place. The wheels of the Mars 2020 are designed to be more robust and resistant to wear and tear than those on the Curiosity rover. At 20.7 inches (52.5 centimeters) in diameter, they are slightly larger in diameter than Curiosity's wheels and are made of thicker aluminum. Each wheel has 48 grousers, or cleats, machined into its surface to provide traction on both sandy and rocky terrain. The rover's current wheels are engineering models which will be switched out for flight models some time next year. On July 11, engineers installed the sensor-filled turret at the end of the rover's seven-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) robotic arm. The turret act's as the robotic arm's \"hand\", holding HD cameras, the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC) science instrument, the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), and a percussive drill and coring mechanism. \"Back when we started this project in 2013, we came up with a timeline to chart mission progress,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"That every single major spacecraft component on a project with this level of innovation is synching right now with that timeline is a testament to the innovation and perseverance of a great team.\" The rover will use its arm and the turret to reach out to investigate interesting rock specimens and collect samples for further study using its Sample Caching System, which will place some sealed sample tubes on the surface for possible return to Earth by a future mission.

While that will be the first time the wheels of the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) rover touch the Red Planet, the vehicle's network of processors, sensors and transmitters will, by then, have successfully simulated touchdown at Jezero many times before. \"We first landed on Jezero Crater on Jan. 23rd,\" said Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover successfully landed again on Mars two days later.\" Bottom was the test lead for Systems Test 1, or ST1, the Mars 2020 engineering team's first opportunity to take the major components of the Mars 2020 mission for a test drive. Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL's Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission's cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The heritage for Mars 2020's software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in 2020. \"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\" Making the Grade. On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission's hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling - \"umbilicals\" - were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft's cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft's electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn't go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. \"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices. There was a lot going on in there.\" On Jan. 30, the Mars 2020 test team was able to close their 1,000-plus page book of procedures for ST1. They went two-for-two on Mars landings. They also launchedfour times, performed deep space navigation, executed several trajectory correction maneuvers and even tested a few in-flight off-nominal situations.This first evaluation of flight hardware and software, over a year in the making, had been a thorough success, demonstrating where things excelled and where they could be improved. When these new changes have been investigated on both a virtual workstation and in the testbed, they will have their chance to \"fly\" in one of the many other systems tests planned for Mars 2020. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface. It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures,\" said Bottom. \"Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8421/nasas-mars-2020-rover-is-put-to-the-test/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover passes its tests with flying colors", "date": "2019-03-23", "content": "Preparations are well underway for NASA's next mission to Mars, when it plans to land the Mars 2020 rover on the surface to look for signs of life and collect samples. Recently, the Mars 2020 rover team has been undertaking a series of tests to see if the craft will be able to launch, navigate, and land on the Red Planet. Called Systems Test 1, or ST1, these tests represent the first test drive of the new rover. \"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" Heather Bottom, systems engineer for the Mars 2020 mission, said in a statement. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars - and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\" The tests were performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in the High Bay 1 cleanroom, requiring the technicians to don white \"bunny suits\" to prevent the introduction of any contaminants. Most of the working team members were outside the room and looking in, with just two technicians overseeing the tests in person. Designed to be as realistic as possible, the tests included communications handled by X-band radio transmission, just as will be the case with the real 2020 mission. An umbilical of electrical cabling fed data and power to the craft, and the launch capacities were tested when commands for powering on the electrical components and configuring the thermal, power, and telecomm systems were relayed. After several tests of the launch system, the landing sequence was tested too, as well as a deep space cruise. The tests were successful, and in the end the team was able to perform two landings, four launches, several trajectory correction maneuvers, and deep space navigation. The next challenge for the rover is to see how it will cope with the low temperatures on Mars by testing its abilities to perform in cold environments. \"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface,\" Bottom explained. \"It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures.

But over the past few weeks, some of these components - the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover - have seemingly disappeared. In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it's time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when. \"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an Atlas V rocket, which gives us about 15 feet 5 meters of width to work with,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane. \"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that's come through JPL since Mariner,\" said Gruel. \"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\" After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\" The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8428/things-are-stacking-up-for-nasas-mars-2020-spacecraft/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover coming together at JPL", "date": "2019-05-13", "content": "NASA's 2020 Mars rover and the spacecraft that will carry it to the red planet a little more than a year from now are taking shape at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The nuclear-powered 2020 rover is a close relative of the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 and is now working its way up the lower slopes of Mount Sharp in the heart of Gale Crater. But the new model features a variety of upgrades and improvements, along with a suite of powerful instruments to look for signs of past martian life and to cache rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth. In the image above, taken 29 April, engineers in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 work to integrate the new rover's motor controller assembly in the body of the spacecraft. The motor controller assembly routes commands to the rover's wheels, robotic arm joints, camera mast, drill and systems used to collect soil samples for on-site analysis. In this view, the rover's body is upside down to provide access to the belly of the spacecraft. Along with integrating systems in the rover, JPL engineers also are assembling the spacecraft's interplanetary cruise stage and the rocket-powered \"sky crane\" landing system that will lower Mars 2020 to touchdown in Jezero Crater in February 2021. A critical part of that work is fitting components together - stacking - several times to make sure everything will fit properly inside the nose cone fairing of an Atlas 5 rocket. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" The first step in the stacking procedure was mounting the rocket-powered descent stage on top of a rover mockup. After multiple fit checks, the aerodynamic \"backshell\" was lowered into place. Once that was complete, and more fit checks verified the hardware matched the blueprints, a protective nose cone was placed over the spacecraft's folded parachute, followed by attachment to the cruise stage that will power Mars 2020 during its seven-month trip. The stack then was rotated back to its original position for attachment of the lander's heat shield. The completion of stacking clears the way for acoustic vibration testing to make sure the spacecraft is up to the sound and shaking of launch followed by thermal vacuum chamber testing to expose the craft to a simulated space environment. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work.

Full integration of the mast - a process that includes installation of science instrument sensors, electrical wiring and checkout - continued into the following week, concluding on June 11. During Mars 2020's launch, interplanetary cruise, and its fast and fiery descent toward the Martian surface, the mast will be in stowed flat on the rover's deck. Soon after touchdown, the mast will be raised to provide a high perch for the SuperCam, Mastcam-Z and Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer instruments as well as four Navcam engineering cameras. Mars 2020 will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July of 2020. It will land at Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. In a mission first, the rover carries a sample-caching system that will collect Martian rock and soil samples and store them on the planet's surface for retrieval and return to Earth by subsequent missions.

Both of the rover's legs (the starboard leg's black tubing can be seen above the wheels) are composed of titanium tubing formed with the same process used to make high-end bicycle frames. The wheels in this picture are engineering models and will not make the trip to Mars. They will be swapped out for flight models of the wheels sometime next year. Made of aluminum, each of the six wheels (each 20.7 inches, or 52.5 centimeters, in diameter) features 48 grousers, or cleats, machined into its surface to provide excellent traction both in soft sand and on hard rocks. Every wheel has its own motor. The two front and two rear wheels also have individual steering motors that enable the vehicle to turn a full 360 degrees in place. When driving over uneven terrain, the suspension system - called a \"rocker-bogie\" system due to its multiple pivot points and struts - maintains a relatively constant weight on each wheel and minimizes rover tilt for stability. Rover drivers avoid terrain that would cause a tilt of more than 30 degrees, but even so, the rover can withstand a 45-degree tilt in any direction without tipping over. With its suspension, the rover can also roll over rocks and other obstacles as well as through depressions the size of its wheels.

The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\" The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8428/things-are-stacking-up-for-nasas-mars-2020-spacecraft/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover coming together at JPL", "date": "2019-05-13", "content": "NASA's 2020 Mars rover and the spacecraft that will carry it to the red planet a little more than a year from now are taking shape at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The nuclear-powered 2020 rover is a close relative of the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 and is now working its way up the lower slopes of Mount Sharp in the heart of Gale Crater. But the new model features a variety of upgrades and improvements, along with a suite of powerful instruments to look for signs of past martian life and to cache rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth. In the image above, taken 29 April, engineers in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 work to integrate the new rover's motor controller assembly in the body of the spacecraft. The motor controller assembly routes commands to the rover's wheels, robotic arm joints, camera mast, drill and systems used to collect soil samples for on-site analysis. In this view, the rover's body is upside down to provide access to the belly of the spacecraft. Along with integrating systems in the rover, JPL engineers also are assembling the spacecraft's interplanetary cruise stage and the rocket-powered \"sky crane\" landing system that will lower Mars 2020 to touchdown in Jezero Crater in February 2021. A critical part of that work is fitting components together - stacking - several times to make sure everything will fit properly inside the nose cone fairing of an Atlas 5 rocket. \"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\" The first step in the stacking procedure was mounting the rocket-powered descent stage on top of a rover mockup. After multiple fit checks, the aerodynamic \"backshell\" was lowered into place. Once that was complete, and more fit checks verified the hardware matched the blueprints, a protective nose cone was placed over the spacecraft's folded parachute, followed by attachment to the cruise stage that will power Mars 2020 during its seven-month trip. The stack then was rotated back to its original position for attachment of the lander's heat shield. The completion of stacking clears the way for acoustic vibration testing to make sure the spacecraft is up to the sound and shaking of launch followed by thermal vacuum chamber testing to expose the craft to a simulated space environment. \"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work.

Full integration of the mast - a process that includes installation of science instrument sensors, electrical wiring and checkout - continued into the following week, concluding on June 11. During Mars 2020's launch, interplanetary cruise, and its fast and fiery descent toward the Martian surface, the mast will be in stowed flat on the rover's deck. Soon after touchdown, the mast will be raised to provide a high perch for the SuperCam, Mastcam-Z and Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer instruments as well as four Navcam engineering cameras. Mars 2020 will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July of 2020. It will land at Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. In a mission first, the rover carries a sample-caching system that will collect Martian rock and soil samples and store them on the planet's surface for retrieval and return to Earth by subsequent missions.

They installed the port suspension later that day. \"Now that's a Mars rover,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test, and launch operations manager at JPL. \"With the suspension on, not only does it look like a rover, but we have almost all our big-ticket items for integration in our rearview mirror - if our rover had one.\" Within the next few weeks, the team expects to install the vehicle's robotic arm, the mast-mounted SuperCam instrument and the Sample Caching System, which includes 17 separate motors and will collect samples of Martian rock and soil that will be returned to Earth by a future mission. Both of the rover's legs (the starboard leg's black tubing can be seen above the wheels) are composed of titanium tubing formed with the same process used to make high-end bicycle frames. The wheels in this picture are engineering models and will not make the trip to Mars. They will be swapped out for flight models of the wheels sometime next year. Made of aluminum, each of the six wheels (each 20.7 inches, or 52.5 centimeters, in diameter) features 48 grousers, or cleats, machined into its surface to provide excellent traction both in soft sand and on hard rocks. Every wheel has its own motor. The two front and two rear wheels also have individual steering motors that enable the vehicle to turn a full 360 degrees in place. When driving over uneven terrain, the suspension system - called a \"rocker-bogie\" system due to its multiple pivot points and struts - maintains a relatively constant weight on each wheel and minimizes rover tilt for stability. Rover drivers avoid terrain that would cause a tilt of more than 30 degrees, but even so, the rover can withstand a 45-degree tilt in any direction without tipping over. With its suspension, the rover can also roll over rocks and other obstacles as well as through depressions the size of its wheels.

It is equipped with higher-resolution, wide-field-of-view color navigation cameras, an extra computer \"brain\" for processing images and making maps, and more sophisticated auto-navigation software. It also has wheels that have been redesigned for added durability. All these upgrades allow the rover to average about 650 feet (200 meters) per Martian day. To put that into perspective, the longest drive in a single Martian day was 702 feet (214 meters), a record set by NASA's Opportunity rover. Mars 2020 is designed to average the current planetwide record drive distance. In a 10-plus-hour marathon on Tuesday that demonstrated all the systems working in concert, the rover steered, turned and drove in 3-foot (1-meter) increments over small ramps covered with special static-control mats. Since these systems performed well under Earth's gravity, engineers expect them to perform well under Mars' gravity, which is only three-eighths as strong. The rover was also able to gather data with the Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX). \"A rover needs to rove, and Mars 2020 did that yesterday,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager. \"We can't wait to put some red Martian dirt under its wheels.\" JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for NASA. NASA's Launch Services Program, based at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, is responsible for launch management. Mars 2020 is part of a larger program that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. Charged with returning astronauts to the Moon by 2024, NASA will establish a sustained human presence on and around the Moon by 2028 through NASA's Artemis lunar exploration plans.

The rover, which is being assembled and tested at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, already has its wheels, mast, and science instruments installed. The helicopter drone has also been attached. Launch remains on track for the start of a window that lasts from 17 July to 5 August 2020. Mars 2020's bit carousel sits on the front of the rover, and has a wheel that rotates 9 tools and drill bits into position for the rover's robotic arm to grab with its drill. The carousel collection contains 2 abrasion tools for exposing unweathered rock surfaces, 6 drill bits for coring, and 1 bit for soft regolith. Next to the carousel sits storage for 43 empty sample collection tubes. When flight controllers command Mars 2020 to collect a sample, a smaller robotic arm moves an empty sample container into position for the big arm to grab along with a drill bit. After sample collection, the small arm takes the filled container and moves it to inspection and sealing stations. The bit carousel was one of Mars 2020's last major pieces to be installed. In late July, technicians tested and calibrated the rover's front-facing cameras, including 2 Navcams, 4 Hazcams, SuperCam and the 2 Mastcam-Z cameras. To do this, they had the rover image grids of dots from between 1 and 40 meters away. The procedure will soon be repeated for the rear cameras. Testing will continue throughout the rest of the year, until Mars 2020 ships in December to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. There, it will get bundled up for launch. The cruise stage that will house the rover all the way to Mars underwent thermal vacuum and acoustic testing in May. In Florida, Mars 2020 will receive its nuclear power source, the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal Generator (MMRTG) that will supply the spacecraft with 110 watts of electricity and keep it warm on Mars. The MMRTG is currently being fueled with plutonium-238 at the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory.

Over 4,000 judges reviewed more than 28,000 entries to whittle the list down to 155 semifinalists. Another round reduced the choices to just nine finalists: Endurance, Tenacity, Promise, Perseverance, Vision, Clarity, Ingenuity, Fortitude and Courage.

Over the weekend, 884 pounds of hydrazine monopropellant were loaded into the descent stage's four fuel tanks. As the aeroshell containing the descent stage and rover enter the Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021, the propellant will be pressure-fed through 120 feet of stainless steel and titanium tubing into eight Mars landing engines. The engines' job: to slow the spacecraft, which will be traveling at about 180 mph when it's 7,200 feet in altitude, to 1.7 mph by the time it's about 66 feet above the surface. Maintaining this rate of descent, the stage will then perform the sky crane maneuver: Nylon cords spool out to lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage; When the spacecraft senses touchdown at Jezero Crater, the connecting cords are severed and the descent stage flies off. \"The last hundred days before any Mars launch is chock-full of significant milestones,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test and launch operations manager at JPL. \"Fueling the descent stage is a big step.

After the descent stage fueling, the system that will deliver the Mars Helicopter to the surface of the Red Planet was integrated with Perseverance. The helicopter, which weighs 4 pounds and features propellers 4 feet in diameter, is cocooned within the delivery system. In one of the first steps in the day-long process on April 6, technicians and engineers made 34 electrical connections between the rover, the helicopter and its delivery system on the rover's belly. After confirming data and commands could be sent and received, they attached the delivery system to the rover. Finally, the team confirmed the helicopter could receive an electrical charge from the rover. Before being deployed onto the surface of Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter will rely on the rover for power. Afterward, it will generate its own electrical power through a solar panel located above its twin counter- rotating propellers. The helicopter will remain encapsulated on the rover's belly for the next year and will be deployed around the beginning of May - roughly two-and-a-half months after Perseverance's landing.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first. After sufficient deceleration, the parachutes are activated, which ensures a further reduction in speed. In the final phase, the descent stage is separated from the rear aerodynamic cover, and motorized reduces the rate of descent to less than 3 km/h. As the system with the rover is 20 meters above the surface of Mars, flight- separation bolts will be released by small pyrotechnic charges. Nylon cords then spool out through what are called bridle exit guides to lower the rover.

The Perseverance Mars rover is one of a kind, and the testing required to get it ready to roll on the mean streets of the Red Planet is one of a kind as well. Because hardware cannot be repaired once the rover is on Mars, the team has to build a vehicle that can survive for years on a planet with punishing temperature shifts, constant radiation and ever-present dust. To ensure readiness, they put Perseverance through a test program tougher than the trip to Mars and the environment it will encounter once there. \"Mars is hard, and everybody knows that,\" said project manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What they may not realize is that to be successful at Mars, you have to test the absolute heck out of the thing here on Earth.\" While the unique tests performed for the project number in the thousands, here's a handful that stand out. The Sound and Fury. It is no secret that loud noises can be detrimental to your hearing. They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they're at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose. Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer's launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels - louder than what you'd encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir. Oh, Chute. Ask any member of the Mars 2020 mission's entry, descent and landing team, and they'll tell you there's little point in traveling through 314 million miles of interplanetary space if you can't stick the landing. At 70.5 feet in diameter, the rover's supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled. Perseverance's parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test. First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research in California's Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior. More complex evaluations would come between March and September 2018. The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The final test flight , on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound load - the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission's chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars' atmosphere. The team also tested the chute's deployment mortar. Perseverance's parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream. Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature - about 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit - well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars . The mortar passed all three tests with flying colors. Running Hot and Cold. The Sun's rays heat a white-painted rover differently than they would, say, a Mars boulder. To better understand what temperature-sensitive instruments and subsystems will encounter, the team tested Perseverance's \"thermal model.\" In October 2019, they placed the rover in JPL's 25-foot-wide, 85-foot-tall vacuum chamber for a daylong test, where powerful xenon lamps several floors below beamed upward, hitting a mirror at the top of the chamber to drench the spacecraft with light. After the lamps warmed up and reached the same intensity of sunlight the rover will encounter at its landing site in Jezero Crater , an engineer climbed in and measured the \"sunlight\" reaching different portions of the rover. Data from the test was used to update the rover's thermal model, giving the team the assurance they needed to proceed with next step in ground-based cold testing. Once the solar-intensity tests concluded, engineers closed the doors and evacuated the majority of the atmosphere in the chamber to simulate Mars' thin atmosphere, which has about 1% the atmospheric density of Earth. Then the chamber was chilled to minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and for a weeklong subsystems check, they ran computer programs, raised the remote sensing mast and antennas, turned wheels, and deployed the Mars Helicopter to make sure the rover can handle even the coldest Martian nights. Camera Ready. The Mars 2020 mission is launching 25 cameras to the Red Planet, a record number for an interplanetary expedition. After installation, each camera bound for the Red Planet had to undergo an \"eye\" exam. With a camera called WATSON, which is tasked with taking close-up pictures and video of rock textures, project engineers recorded the scene as they danced and waved. The goal: to determine the imager's frame rate and exposure time, and the ability of its computer to hold and transfer the data. For other imagers, the test was a little more formal and rigorous. The process is called machine-vision calibration and involves using target boards featuring grids to establish a baseline for a camera's optical performance. The result? The mission's vision was 2020. About the Mars 2020 Mission. Whether they are working on final assembly of the vehicle at Kennedy Space Center, testing software and subsystems at JPL, or teleworking due to coronavirus safety precautions, the Perseverance team remains on track to meet the opening of the rover's launch period. No matter what day Perseverance launches, it will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission will search for signs of ancient microbial life.

Over 4,000 judges reviewed more than 28,000 entries to whittle the list down to 155 semifinalists. Another round reduced the choices to just nine finalists: Endurance, Tenacity, Promise, Perseverance, Vision, Clarity, Ingenuity, Fortitude and Courage. The winning entry came from 13-year-old Burke, Virginia middle school student Alexander Mather, who suggested Perseverance in the essay you can hear in the video below. \"We, not as a nation, but as humans, will not give up.

In some of the last steps required prior to stacking the spacecraft components in the configuration they'll be in atop the Atlas V rocket, the rover's wheels and parachute have been installed. Perseverance received its six flight wheels on March 30, 2020. While the rover took a test drive last December , it was on \"flight spares\" that wouldn't be making the trip to Mars. Designed for the kind of off-roading Perseverance will perform on the Red Planet, the wheels are re- engineered versions of the ones NASA's Curiosity has been using on its traverses of Mount Sharp. Machined out of a block of flight-grade aluminum and equipped with titanium spokes, each wheel is slightly larger in diameter and narrower than Curiosity's, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. They also feature new treads, or grousers: In place of Curiosity's 24 chevron-pattern treads are 48 gently curved ones. Extensive testing in the Mars Yard at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the rover and manages operations, has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks and grip just as well or better than Curiosity's when driving on sand. The Parachute. The job of adding Perseverance's parachute to the back shell, where the rover will be stowed on the journey to the Red Planet, took several days and was finished on March 26. Tasked with slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from Mach 1.7 to about 200 mph during the rover's landing on Feb., 18, 2021, the 194 pounds of nylon, Technora and Kevlar fibers are packed so tightly into a 20-inch-wide aluminum cylinder that it is as dense as oak wood. When deployed at about 7 miles above the Martian surface, the chute will take about a half-second to fully inflate its 70.5-foot-wide canopy.

In the past week, the assembly, test and launch operations team completed important milestones, fueling the descent stage - also known as the sky crane - and attaching the Mars Helicopter, which will be the first aircraft in history to attempt power-controlled flight on another planet. Over the weekend, 884 pounds of hydrazine monopropellant were loaded into the descent stage's four fuel tanks. As the aeroshell containing the descent stage and rover enter the Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021, the propellant will be pressure-fed through 120 feet of stainless steel and titanium tubing into eight Mars landing engines. The engines' job: to slow the spacecraft, which will be traveling at about 180 mph when it's 7,200 feet in altitude, to 1.7 mph by the time it's about 66 feet above the surface. Maintaining this rate of descent, the stage will then perform the sky crane maneuver: Nylon cords spool out to lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage; When the spacecraft senses touchdown at Jezero Crater, the connecting cords are severed and the descent stage flies off. \"The last hundred days before any Mars launch is chock-full of significant milestones,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test and launch operations manager at JPL. \"Fueling the descent stage is a big step. While we will continue to test and evaluate its performance as we move forward with launch preparations, it is now ready to fulfill its mission of placing Perseverance on the surface on Mars.\" The Helicopter. After the descent stage fueling, the system that will deliver the Mars Helicopter to the surface of the Red Planet was integrated with Perseverance. The helicopter, which weighs 4 pounds and features propellers 4 feet in diameter, is cocooned within the delivery system. In one of the first steps in the day-long process on April 6, technicians and engineers made 34 electrical connections between the rover, the helicopter and its delivery system on the rover's belly. After confirming data and commands could be sent and received, they attached the delivery system to the rover. Finally, the team confirmed the helicopter could receive an electrical charge from the rover. Before being deployed onto the surface of Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter will rely on the rover for power. Afterward, it will generate its own electrical power through a solar panel located above its twin counter- rotating propellers. The helicopter will remain encapsulated on the rover's belly for the next year and will be deployed around the beginning of May - roughly two-and-a-half months after Perseverance's landing. Once the rover drives about 330 feet away and the helicopter undergoes an extensive systems check, it will execute a flight-test campaign for up to 30 days.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first.

NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk revealed the delay in a presentation to a joint meeting of the National Academies' Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board June 9. \"We had a little bit of a hiccup with ULA and the launch vehicle processing, so we're incurring a three-day delay,\" he said. He didn't elaborate on the issue that caused the delay, but a spokesperson for United Launch Alliance, which is providing the Atlas 5 used to launch Mars 2020, told SpaceNews June 10 that \"additional time was needed for the team to repair an issue with the ground system equipment.\" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive, said on Twitter that a problem with a crane used as part of launch vehicle processing caused the delay, an issue that has since been corrected. The delay pushed back the launch of Mars 2020 to July 20, with a two-hour window opening at 9:15 a.m. Eastern, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before the launch vehicle processing problem, Mars 2020 had remained set to launch July 17, the first day of the overall launch window for the mission. That launch window extends to Aug. 11. If Mars 2020 doesn't launch by Aug. 11, the mission will have to wait until the next launch opportunity more than two years later. That's the main reason that NASA elevated the mission to one of its highest priorities during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the SpaceX Demo-2 commercial crew mission. NASA went to significant lengths to keep Mars 2020 on schedule, including using agency aircraft to ferry personnel and equipment to the Kennedy Space Center, where the spacecraft is wrapping up pre-launch preparations, to avoid any risks of coronavirus exposure from commercial flights. Mars 2020, whose rover was named Perseverance earlier this year, is the first step in a multi-mission effort to return samples from Mars to Earth. Perseverance will collect those samples, which will be picked up by a rover launched on a second mission. That second rover will place the samples into a small rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, which will lift off from the planet and place the sample container in orbit. A third mission, an orbiter, will collect the samples and return them to Earth as soon as 2031. Mars 2020 is closely modeled on the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012. \"We land in a similar fashion to Curiosity,\" said Adam Steltzner, Mars 2020 project chief engineer, at a June 10 SSB meeting. \"We've added some tricks to our landing system to make the performance even better,\" allowing a more precise targeting of the rover's landing site.

In some of the last steps required prior to stacking the spacecraft components in the configuration they'll be in atop the Atlas V rocket, the rover's wheels and parachute have been installed. Perseverance received its six flight wheels on March 30, 2020. While the rover took a test drive last December , it was on \"flight spares\" that wouldn't be making the trip to Mars. Designed for the kind of off-roading Perseverance will perform on the Red Planet, the wheels are re- engineered versions of the ones NASA's Curiosity has been using on its traverses of Mount Sharp. Machined out of a block of flight-grade aluminum and equipped with titanium spokes, each wheel is slightly larger in diameter and narrower than Curiosity's, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. They also feature new treads, or grousers: In place of Curiosity's 24 chevron-pattern treads are 48 gently curved ones. Extensive testing in the Mars Yard at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the rover and manages operations, has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks and grip just as well or better than Curiosity's when driving on sand. The Parachute. The job of adding Perseverance's parachute to the back shell, where the rover will be stowed on the journey to the Red Planet, took several days and was finished on March 26. Tasked with slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from Mach 1.7 to about 200 mph during the rover's landing on Feb., 18, 2021, the 194 pounds of nylon, Technora and Kevlar fibers are packed so tightly into a 20-inch-wide aluminum cylinder that it is as dense as oak wood. When deployed at about 7 miles above the Martian surface, the chute will take about a half-second to fully inflate its 70.5-foot-wide canopy. The Perseverance rover is a robotic scientist weighing 2,260 pounds .

In the past week, the assembly, test and launch operations team completed important milestones, fueling the descent stage - also known as the sky crane - and attaching the Mars Helicopter, which will be the first aircraft in history to attempt power-controlled flight on another planet. Over the weekend, 884 pounds of hydrazine monopropellant were loaded into the descent stage's four fuel tanks. As the aeroshell containing the descent stage and rover enter the Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021, the propellant will be pressure-fed through 120 feet of stainless steel and titanium tubing into eight Mars landing engines. The engines' job: to slow the spacecraft, which will be traveling at about 180 mph when it's 7,200 feet in altitude, to 1.7 mph by the time it's about 66 feet above the surface. Maintaining this rate of descent, the stage will then perform the sky crane maneuver: Nylon cords spool out to lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage; When the spacecraft senses touchdown at Jezero Crater, the connecting cords are severed and the descent stage flies off. \"The last hundred days before any Mars launch is chock-full of significant milestones,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test and launch operations manager at JPL. \"Fueling the descent stage is a big step. While we will continue to test and evaluate its performance as we move forward with launch preparations, it is now ready to fulfill its mission of placing Perseverance on the surface on Mars.\" The Helicopter. After the descent stage fueling, the system that will deliver the Mars Helicopter to the surface of the Red Planet was integrated with Perseverance. The helicopter, which weighs 4 pounds and features propellers 4 feet in diameter, is cocooned within the delivery system. In one of the first steps in the day-long process on April 6, technicians and engineers made 34 electrical connections between the rover, the helicopter and its delivery system on the rover's belly. After confirming data and commands could be sent and received, they attached the delivery system to the rover. Finally, the team confirmed the helicopter could receive an electrical charge from the rover. Before being deployed onto the surface of Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter will rely on the rover for power. Afterward, it will generate its own electrical power through a solar panel located above its twin counter- rotating propellers. The helicopter will remain encapsulated on the rover's belly for the next year and will be deployed around the beginning of May - roughly two-and-a-half months after Perseverance's landing. Once the rover drives about 330 feet away and the helicopter undergoes an extensive systems check, it will execute a flight-test campaign for up to 30 days.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first. After sufficient deceleration, the parachutes are activated, which ensures a further reduction in speed. In the final phase, the descent stage is separated from the rear aerodynamic cover, and motorized reduces the rate of descent to less than 3 km/h. As the system with the rover is 20 meters above the surface of Mars, flight- separation bolts will be released by small pyrotechnic charges. Nylon cords then spool out through what are called bridle exit guides to lower the rover. As soon as the rover wheels upon the ground, the cables will be broken, and the system will fly off to a safe distance. The Perseverance rover, comparable in size to the Curiosity rover, carries onboard seven different scientific instruments created as part of the Mars Exploration Program. During its astrobiological mission, the rover will search for traces of ancient life, helping to understand the evolution of the climate on Mars and its geology. It will also take samples that will be transported to Earth in a few years on another mission.

The Perseverance Mars rover is one of a kind, and the testing required to get it ready to roll on the mean streets of the Red Planet is one of a kind as well. Because hardware cannot be repaired once the rover is on Mars, the team has to build a vehicle that can survive for years on a planet with punishing temperature shifts, constant radiation and ever-present dust. To ensure readiness, they put Perseverance through a test program tougher than the trip to Mars and the environment it will encounter once there. \"Mars is hard, and everybody knows that,\" said project manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What they may not realize is that to be successful at Mars, you have to test the absolute heck out of the thing here on Earth.\" While the unique tests performed for the project number in the thousands, here's a handful that stand out. The Sound and Fury. It is no secret that loud noises can be detrimental to your hearing. They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they're at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose. Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer's launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels - louder than what you'd encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir. Oh, Chute. Ask any member of the Mars 2020 mission's entry, descent and landing team, and they'll tell you there's little point in traveling through 314 million miles of interplanetary space if you can't stick the landing. At 70.5 feet in diameter, the rover's supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled. Perseverance's parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test. First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research in California's Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior. More complex evaluations would come between March and September 2018. The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The final test flight , on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound load - the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission's chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars' atmosphere. The team also tested the chute's deployment mortar. Perseverance's parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream. Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature - about 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit - well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars . The mortar passed all three tests with flying colors. Running Hot and Cold. The Sun's rays heat a white-painted rover differently than they would, say, a Mars boulder. To better understand what temperature-sensitive instruments and subsystems will encounter, the team tested Perseverance's \"thermal model.\" In October 2019, they placed the rover in JPL's 25-foot-wide, 85-foot-tall vacuum chamber for a daylong test, where powerful xenon lamps several floors below beamed upward, hitting a mirror at the top of the chamber to drench the spacecraft with light. After the lamps warmed up and reached the same intensity of sunlight the rover will encounter at its landing site in Jezero Crater , an engineer climbed in and measured the \"sunlight\" reaching different portions of the rover. Data from the test was used to update the rover's thermal model, giving the team the assurance they needed to proceed with next step in ground-based cold testing. Once the solar-intensity tests concluded, engineers closed the doors and evacuated the majority of the atmosphere in the chamber to simulate Mars' thin atmosphere, which has about 1% the atmospheric density of Earth. Then the chamber was chilled to minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and for a weeklong subsystems check, they ran computer programs, raised the remote sensing mast and antennas, turned wheels, and deployed the Mars Helicopter to make sure the rover can handle even the coldest Martian nights. Camera Ready. The Mars 2020 mission is launching 25 cameras to the Red Planet, a record number for an interplanetary expedition. After installation, each camera bound for the Red Planet had to undergo an \"eye\" exam. With a camera called WATSON, which is tasked with taking close-up pictures and video of rock textures, project engineers recorded the scene as they danced and waved. The goal: to determine the imager's frame rate and exposure time, and the ability of its computer to hold and transfer the data. For other imagers, the test was a little more formal and rigorous. The process is called machine-vision calibration and involves using target boards featuring grids to establish a baseline for a camera's optical performance. The result? The mission's vision was 2020. About the Mars 2020 Mission. Whether they are working on final assembly of the vehicle at Kennedy Space Center, testing software and subsystems at JPL, or teleworking due to coronavirus safety precautions, the Perseverance team remains on track to meet the opening of the rover's launch period.

NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk revealed the delay in a presentation to a joint meeting of the National Academies' Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board June 9. \"We had a little bit of a hiccup with ULA and the launch vehicle processing, so we're incurring a three-day delay,\" he said. He didn't elaborate on the issue that caused the delay, but a spokesperson for United Launch Alliance, which is providing the Atlas 5 used to launch Mars 2020, told SpaceNews June 10 that \"additional time was needed for the team to repair an issue with the ground system equipment.\" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive, said on Twitter that a problem with a crane used as part of launch vehicle processing caused the delay, an issue that has since been corrected. The delay pushed back the launch of Mars 2020 to July 20, with a two-hour window opening at 9:15 a.m. Eastern, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before the launch vehicle processing problem, Mars 2020 had remained set to launch July 17, the first day of the overall launch window for the mission. That launch window extends to Aug. 11. If Mars 2020 doesn't launch by Aug. 11, the mission will have to wait until the next launch opportunity more than two years later. That's the main reason that NASA elevated the mission to one of its highest priorities during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the SpaceX Demo-2 commercial crew mission. NASA went to significant lengths to keep Mars 2020 on schedule, including using agency aircraft to ferry personnel and equipment to the Kennedy Space Center, where the spacecraft is wrapping up pre-launch preparations, to avoid any risks of coronavirus exposure from commercial flights. Mars 2020, whose rover was named Perseverance earlier this year, is the first step in a multi-mission effort to return samples from Mars to Earth. Perseverance will collect those samples, which will be picked up by a rover launched on a second mission. That second rover will place the samples into a small rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, which will lift off from the planet and place the sample container in orbit. A third mission, an orbiter, will collect the samples and return them to Earth as soon as 2031.

Perseverance is scheduled to lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Thursday during a two-hour window that opens at 7:50 a.m. EDT . You can watch all the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA. Mother Nature looks likely to cooperate with that plan. There's just a 20% chance that bad weather will scuttle Thursday's attempt, launch weather officer Jessica Williams, of the 45th Space Force, said during today's news conference. The launch will send Perseverance on a nearly 7-month cruise to Mars, which will end with a dramatic, sky-crane landing within the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The nuclear-powered rover will then spend at least one Mars year exploring the 28-mile-wide Jezero, which harbored a lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Perseverance will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life, study the crater's geology and collect and cache several dozen samples, among other tasks. Those samples will be brought back to Earth, perhaps as early as 2031, by a joint NASA/European Space Agency campaign. Once the Mars material is here, scientists around the world will scour it for signs of life and clues about the planet's mysterious history. \"That'll be the first time in history that we've done a Mars return mission,\" Bridenstine said. \"In fact, it's the first time in history we've done a return mission from any planet.\" Perseverance will also demonstrate several new technologies on the Martian surface. For example, one of the rover's 10 instruments, called MOXIE, will generate oxygen from the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. Such gear, once scaled up, could help future astronauts explore the Red Planet, a goal NASA wants to achieve in the 2030s. In addition, a 4-lb. helicopter called Ingenuity will travel to Mars on Perseverance's belly. Once the rover finds a good spot, the little chopper will detach and perform a few test flights - the first ever performed by a rotorcraft on an alien world. If Ingenuity is successful, future Mars missions may routinely employ helicopters as scouts for rovers or astronauts, NASA officials have said. Rotorcraft could also do substantial science work of their own, exploring hard-to-reach places such as caves and cliff faces. Ingenuity won't collect data in this manner; it carries no science instruments. But the little chopper does have a camera system, which should provide some amazing and unprecedented Red Planet views. \"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance, giving us images of Perseverance - what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kinds of activities happening on another world.\" Perseverance's launch window extends through Aug. 15. If the rover is unable to get off the ground by then, it will have to be put into storage until the next opportunity in 2022. The NASA rover's launch will be the third Mars liftoff in less than two weeks.

This rover, a successor to the Curiosity robotic explorer, is equipped with sensors specifically designed to help it hopefully find evidence of ancient, microbiotic life on Mars. Mars 2020 departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 7:50 AM EDT . Perseverance was loaded atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, which had a good liftoff and deployed its second stage, which put the spacecraft into a parking orbit as it readies to depart on its trip toward Mars, which will see it arrive in February 2021. Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet's surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what's known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today. This has been chosen specifically because it's a prime spot for finding any evidence of microbiological life that might exist, as it contains one of the best-preserved deposits of a river delta on Mars. NASA scientists don't expect to be able to confirm the existence of life on Mars using the instruments on Perseverance; however, they think they can find strong indications that the conditions and materials necessary for life once existed. But the ultimate proof could come from the ambitious Mars sample return mission being planned for 2026. This would involve NASA launching a return rocket to the red planet, which will carry a rocket that can take off from the Mars surface with samples collected by Perseverance on board. That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency , which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study. In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we've never done before. Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, and could include color photos - the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point. This is a great first step for this historic Mars 2020 mission, and now we'll wait and watch for other significant milestones, including next in around two weeks when the spacecraft fires its engines for its departure from Earth's orbit and begins the long trip to Mars.

It will land at Jezero Crater in about seven months, on February 18, 2021. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth. Humanity's most sophisticated rover launched with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at 7:50 a.m. EDT Thursday on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. \"With the launch of Perseverance, we begin another historic mission of exploration,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"This amazing explorer's journey has already required the very best from all of us to get it to launch through these challenging times. Now we can look forward to its incredible science and to bringing samples of Mars home even as we advance human missions to the Red Planet. As a mission, as an agency, and as a country, we will persevere.\" The ULA Atlas V's Centaur upper stage initially placed the Mars 2020 spacecraft into a parking orbit around Earth. The engine fired for a second time and the spacecraft separated from the Centaur as expected. Navigation data indicate the spacecraft is perfectly on course to Mars. Mars 2020 sent its first signal to ground controllers via NASA's Deep Space Network at 9:15 a.m. EDT . However, telemetry had not yet been acquired at that point. Around 11:30 a.m. EDT , a signal with telemetry was received from Mars 2020 by NASA ground stations. Data indicate the spacecraft had entered a state known as safe mode, likely because a part of the spacecraft was a little colder than expected while Mars 2020 was in Earth's shadow. All temperatures are now nominal and the spacecraft is out of Earth's shadow. When a spacecraft enters safe mode, all but essential systems are turned off until it receives new commands from mission control. An interplanetary launch is fast-paced and dynamic, so a spacecraft is designed to put itself in safe mode if its onboard computer perceives conditions are not within its preset parameters. Right now, the Mars 2020 mission is completing a full health assessment on the spacecraft and is working to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration for its journey to Mars. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission is to seek out signs of past microscopic life on Mars, explore the diverse geology of its landing site, Jezero Crater , and demonstrate key technologies that will help us prepare for future robotic and human exploration. \"Jezero Crater is the perfect place to search for signs of ancient life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. \"Perseverance is going to make discoveries that cause us to rethink our questions about what Mars was like and how we understand it today. As our instruments investigate rocks along an ancient lake bottom and select samples to return to Earth, we may very well be reaching back in time to get the information scientists need to say that life has existed elsewhere in the universe.\" The Martian rock and dust Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects could answer fundamental questions about the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. Two future missions currently under consideration by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to get the samples to an orbiter for return to Earth. When they arrive on Earth, the Mars samples will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large to send to the Red Planet. An Eye to a Martian Tomorrow. While most of Perseverance's seven instruments are geared toward learning more about the planet's geology and astrobiology, the MOXIE instrument's job is focused on missions yet to come. Designed to demonstrate that converting Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen is possible, it could lead to future versions of MOXIE technology that become staples on Mars missions, providing oxygen for rocket fuel and breathable air. Also future-leaning is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter , which will remain attached to the belly of Perseverance for the flight to Mars and the first 60 or so days on the surface. A technology demonstrator, Ingenuity's goal is a pure flight test - it carries no science instruments. Over 30 sols , the helicopter will attempt up to five powered, controlled flights. The data acquired during these flight tests will help the next generation of Mars helicopters provide an aerial dimension to Mars explorations - potentially scouting for rovers and human crews, transporting small payloads, or investigating difficult-to-reach destinations. The rover's technologies for entry, descent, and landing also will provide information to advance future human missions to Mars. \"Perseverance is the most capable rover in history because it is standing on the shoulders of our pioneers Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity,\" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"In the same way, the descendants of Ingenuity and MOXIE will become valuable tools for future explorers to the Red Planet and beyond.\" About seven cold, dark, unforgiving months of interplanetary space travel lay ahead for the mission - a fact never far from the mind of Mars 2020 project team. \"There is still a lot of road between us and Mars,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"About 290 million miles of them. But if there was ever a team that could make it happen, it is this one. We are going to Jezero Crater. We will see you there on February 18, 2021.\" The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of America's larger Moon to Mars exploration approach that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.

In some of the last steps required prior to stacking the spacecraft components in the configuration they'll be in atop the Atlas V rocket, the rover's wheels and parachute have been installed. Perseverance received its six flight wheels on March 30, 2020. While the rover took a test drive last December , it was on \"flight spares\" that wouldn't be making the trip to Mars. Designed for the kind of off-roading Perseverance will perform on the Red Planet, the wheels are re- engineered versions of the ones NASA's Curiosity has been using on its traverses of Mount Sharp. Machined out of a block of flight-grade aluminum and equipped with titanium spokes, each wheel is slightly larger in diameter and narrower than Curiosity's, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. They also feature new treads, or grousers: In place of Curiosity's 24 chevron-pattern treads are 48 gently curved ones. Extensive testing in the Mars Yard at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the rover and manages operations, has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks and grip just as well or better than Curiosity's when driving on sand. The Parachute. The job of adding Perseverance's parachute to the back shell, where the rover will be stowed on the journey to the Red Planet, took several days and was finished on March 26. Tasked with slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from Mach 1.7 to about 200 mph during the rover's landing on Feb., 18, 2021, the 194 pounds of nylon, Technora and Kevlar fibers are packed so tightly into a 20-inch-wide aluminum cylinder that it is as dense as oak wood. When deployed at about 7 miles above the Martian surface, the chute will take about a half-second to fully inflate its 70.5-foot-wide canopy.

In the past week, the assembly, test and launch operations team completed important milestones, fueling the descent stage - also known as the sky crane - and attaching the Mars Helicopter, which will be the first aircraft in history to attempt power-controlled flight on another planet. Over the weekend, 884 pounds of hydrazine monopropellant were loaded into the descent stage's four fuel tanks. As the aeroshell containing the descent stage and rover enter the Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021, the propellant will be pressure-fed through 120 feet of stainless steel and titanium tubing into eight Mars landing engines. The engines' job: to slow the spacecraft, which will be traveling at about 180 mph when it's 7,200 feet in altitude, to 1.7 mph by the time it's about 66 feet above the surface. Maintaining this rate of descent, the stage will then perform the sky crane maneuver: Nylon cords spool out to lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage; When the spacecraft senses touchdown at Jezero Crater, the connecting cords are severed and the descent stage flies off. \"The last hundred days before any Mars launch is chock-full of significant milestones,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test and launch operations manager at JPL. \"Fueling the descent stage is a big step. While we will continue to test and evaluate its performance as we move forward with launch preparations, it is now ready to fulfill its mission of placing Perseverance on the surface on Mars.\" The Helicopter. After the descent stage fueling, the system that will deliver the Mars Helicopter to the surface of the Red Planet was integrated with Perseverance. The helicopter, which weighs 4 pounds and features propellers 4 feet in diameter, is cocooned within the delivery system. In one of the first steps in the day-long process on April 6, technicians and engineers made 34 electrical connections between the rover, the helicopter and its delivery system on the rover's belly. After confirming data and commands could be sent and received, they attached the delivery system to the rover. Finally, the team confirmed the helicopter could receive an electrical charge from the rover. Before being deployed onto the surface of Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter will rely on the rover for power. Afterward, it will generate its own electrical power through a solar panel located above its twin counter- rotating propellers. The helicopter will remain encapsulated on the rover's belly for the next year and will be deployed around the beginning of May - roughly two-and-a-half months after Perseverance's landing. Once the rover drives about 330 feet away and the helicopter undergoes an extensive systems check, it will execute a flight-test campaign for up to 30 days.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first. After sufficient deceleration, the parachutes are activated, which ensures a further reduction in speed. In the final phase, the descent stage is separated from the rear aerodynamic cover, and motorized reduces the rate of descent to less than 3 km/h. As the system with the rover is 20 meters above the surface of Mars, flight- separation bolts will be released by small pyrotechnic charges. Nylon cords then spool out through what are called bridle exit guides to lower the rover. As soon as the rover wheels upon the ground, the cables will be broken, and the system will fly off to a safe distance. The Perseverance rover, comparable in size to the Curiosity rover, carries onboard seven different scientific instruments created as part of the Mars Exploration Program. During its astrobiological mission, the rover will search for traces of ancient life, helping to understand the evolution of the climate on Mars and its geology. It will also take samples that will be transported to Earth in a few years on another mission.

The Perseverance Mars rover is one of a kind, and the testing required to get it ready to roll on the mean streets of the Red Planet is one of a kind as well. Because hardware cannot be repaired once the rover is on Mars, the team has to build a vehicle that can survive for years on a planet with punishing temperature shifts, constant radiation and ever-present dust. To ensure readiness, they put Perseverance through a test program tougher than the trip to Mars and the environment it will encounter once there. \"Mars is hard, and everybody knows that,\" said project manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What they may not realize is that to be successful at Mars, you have to test the absolute heck out of the thing here on Earth.\" While the unique tests performed for the project number in the thousands, here's a handful that stand out. The Sound and Fury. It is no secret that loud noises can be detrimental to your hearing. They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they're at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose. Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer's launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels - louder than what you'd encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir. Oh, Chute. Ask any member of the Mars 2020 mission's entry, descent and landing team, and they'll tell you there's little point in traveling through 314 million miles of interplanetary space if you can't stick the landing. At 70.5 feet in diameter, the rover's supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled. Perseverance's parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test. First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research in California's Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior. More complex evaluations would come between March and September 2018. The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The final test flight , on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound load - the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission's chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars' atmosphere. The team also tested the chute's deployment mortar. Perseverance's parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream. Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature - about 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit - well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars . The mortar passed all three tests with flying colors. Running Hot and Cold. The Sun's rays heat a white-painted rover differently than they would, say, a Mars boulder. To better understand what temperature-sensitive instruments and subsystems will encounter, the team tested Perseverance's \"thermal model.\" In October 2019, they placed the rover in JPL's 25-foot-wide, 85-foot-tall vacuum chamber for a daylong test, where powerful xenon lamps several floors below beamed upward, hitting a mirror at the top of the chamber to drench the spacecraft with light. After the lamps warmed up and reached the same intensity of sunlight the rover will encounter at its landing site in Jezero Crater , an engineer climbed in and measured the \"sunlight\" reaching different portions of the rover. Data from the test was used to update the rover's thermal model, giving the team the assurance they needed to proceed with next step in ground-based cold testing. Once the solar-intensity tests concluded, engineers closed the doors and evacuated the majority of the atmosphere in the chamber to simulate Mars' thin atmosphere, which has about 1% the atmospheric density of Earth. Then the chamber was chilled to minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and for a weeklong subsystems check, they ran computer programs, raised the remote sensing mast and antennas, turned wheels, and deployed the Mars Helicopter to make sure the rover can handle even the coldest Martian nights. Camera Ready. The Mars 2020 mission is launching 25 cameras to the Red Planet, a record number for an interplanetary expedition. After installation, each camera bound for the Red Planet had to undergo an \"eye\" exam. With a camera called WATSON, which is tasked with taking close-up pictures and video of rock textures, project engineers recorded the scene as they danced and waved. The goal: to determine the imager's frame rate and exposure time, and the ability of its computer to hold and transfer the data. For other imagers, the test was a little more formal and rigorous. The process is called machine-vision calibration and involves using target boards featuring grids to establish a baseline for a camera's optical performance. The result? The mission's vision was 2020. About the Mars 2020 Mission.

NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk revealed the delay in a presentation to a joint meeting of the National Academies' Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board June 9. \"We had a little bit of a hiccup with ULA and the launch vehicle processing, so we're incurring a three-day delay,\" he said. He didn't elaborate on the issue that caused the delay, but a spokesperson for United Launch Alliance, which is providing the Atlas 5 used to launch Mars 2020, told SpaceNews June 10 that \"additional time was needed for the team to repair an issue with the ground system equipment.\" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive, said on Twitter that a problem with a crane used as part of launch vehicle processing caused the delay, an issue that has since been corrected. The delay pushed back the launch of Mars 2020 to July 20, with a two-hour window opening at 9:15 a.m. Eastern, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before the launch vehicle processing problem, Mars 2020 had remained set to launch July 17, the first day of the overall launch window for the mission. That launch window extends to Aug. 11. If Mars 2020 doesn't launch by Aug. 11, the mission will have to wait until the next launch opportunity more than two years later. That's the main reason that NASA elevated the mission to one of its highest priorities during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the SpaceX Demo-2 commercial crew mission. NASA went to significant lengths to keep Mars 2020 on schedule, including using agency aircraft to ferry personnel and equipment to the Kennedy Space Center, where the spacecraft is wrapping up pre-launch preparations, to avoid any risks of coronavirus exposure from commercial flights. Mars 2020, whose rover was named Perseverance earlier this year, is the first step in a multi-mission effort to return samples from Mars to Earth. Perseverance will collect those samples, which will be picked up by a rover launched on a second mission. That second rover will place the samples into a small rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, which will lift off from the planet and place the sample container in orbit. A third mission, an orbiter, will collect the samples and return them to Earth as soon as 2031. Mars 2020 is closely modeled on the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012. \"We land in a similar fashion to Curiosity,\" said Adam Steltzner, Mars 2020 project chief engineer, at a June 10 SSB meeting. \"We've added some tricks to our landing system to make the performance even better,\" allowing a more precise targeting of the rover's landing site.

This morning , the $2.7 billion Mars 2020 Perseverance rover passed its launch readiness review, the last big hurdle to clear before its planned liftoff Thursday from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \"The launch readiness review is complete, and we are indeed go for launch,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a news conference today. Perseverance is scheduled to lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Thursday during a two-hour window that opens at 7:50 a.m. EDT . You can watch all the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA. Mother Nature looks likely to cooperate with that plan. There's just a 20% chance that bad weather will scuttle Thursday's attempt, launch weather officer Jessica Williams, of the 45th Space Force, said during today's news conference. The launch will send Perseverance on a nearly 7-month cruise to Mars, which will end with a dramatic, sky-crane landing within the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The nuclear-powered rover will then spend at least one Mars year exploring the 28-mile-wide Jezero, which harbored a lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Perseverance will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life, study the crater's geology and collect and cache several dozen samples, among other tasks. Those samples will be brought back to Earth, perhaps as early as 2031, by a joint NASA/European Space Agency campaign. Once the Mars material is here, scientists around the world will scour it for signs of life and clues about the planet's mysterious history. \"That'll be the first time in history that we've done a Mars return mission,\" Bridenstine said. \"In fact, it's the first time in history we've done a return mission from any planet.\" Perseverance will also demonstrate several new technologies on the Martian surface. For example, one of the rover's 10 instruments, called MOXIE, will generate oxygen from the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. Such gear, once scaled up, could help future astronauts explore the Red Planet, a goal NASA wants to achieve in the 2030s. In addition, a 4-lb. helicopter called Ingenuity will travel to Mars on Perseverance's belly. Once the rover finds a good spot, the little chopper will detach and perform a few test flights - the first ever performed by a rotorcraft on an alien world. If Ingenuity is successful, future Mars missions may routinely employ helicopters as scouts for rovers or astronauts, NASA officials have said. Rotorcraft could also do substantial science work of their own, exploring hard-to-reach places such as caves and cliff faces. Ingenuity won't collect data in this manner; it carries no science instruments. But the little chopper does have a camera system, which should provide some amazing and unprecedented Red Planet views. \"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance, giving us images of Perseverance - what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kinds of activities happening on another world.\" Perseverance's launch window extends through Aug. 15. If the rover is unable to get off the ground by then, it will have to be put into storage until the next opportunity in 2022. The NASA rover's launch will be the third Mars liftoff in less than two weeks.

This rover, a successor to the Curiosity robotic explorer, is equipped with sensors specifically designed to help it hopefully find evidence of ancient, microbiotic life on Mars. Mars 2020 departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 7:50 AM EDT . Perseverance was loaded atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, which had a good liftoff and deployed its second stage, which put the spacecraft into a parking orbit as it readies to depart on its trip toward Mars, which will see it arrive in February 2021. Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet's surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what's known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today. This has been chosen specifically because it's a prime spot for finding any evidence of microbiological life that might exist, as it contains one of the best-preserved deposits of a river delta on Mars. NASA scientists don't expect to be able to confirm the existence of life on Mars using the instruments on Perseverance; however, they think they can find strong indications that the conditions and materials necessary for life once existed. But the ultimate proof could come from the ambitious Mars sample return mission being planned for 2026. This would involve NASA launching a return rocket to the red planet, which will carry a rocket that can take off from the Mars surface with samples collected by Perseverance on board. That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency , which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study. In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we've never done before. Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, and could include color photos - the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point. This is a great first step for this historic Mars 2020 mission, and now we'll wait and watch for other significant milestones, including next in around two weeks when the spacecraft fires its engines for its departure from Earth's orbit and begins the long trip to Mars.

It will land at Jezero Crater in about seven months, on February 18, 2021. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth. Humanity's most sophisticated rover launched with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at 7:50 a.m. EDT Thursday on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. \"With the launch of Perseverance, we begin another historic mission of exploration,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"This amazing explorer's journey has already required the very best from all of us to get it to launch through these challenging times. Now we can look forward to its incredible science and to bringing samples of Mars home even as we advance human missions to the Red Planet. As a mission, as an agency, and as a country, we will persevere.\" The ULA Atlas V's Centaur upper stage initially placed the Mars 2020 spacecraft into a parking orbit around Earth. The engine fired for a second time and the spacecraft separated from the Centaur as expected. Navigation data indicate the spacecraft is perfectly on course to Mars. Mars 2020 sent its first signal to ground controllers via NASA's Deep Space Network at 9:15 a.m. EDT . However, telemetry had not yet been acquired at that point. Around 11:30 a.m. EDT , a signal with telemetry was received from Mars 2020 by NASA ground stations. Data indicate the spacecraft had entered a state known as safe mode, likely because a part of the spacecraft was a little colder than expected while Mars 2020 was in Earth's shadow. All temperatures are now nominal and the spacecraft is out of Earth's shadow. When a spacecraft enters safe mode, all but essential systems are turned off until it receives new commands from mission control. An interplanetary launch is fast-paced and dynamic, so a spacecraft is designed to put itself in safe mode if its onboard computer perceives conditions are not within its preset parameters. Right now, the Mars 2020 mission is completing a full health assessment on the spacecraft and is working to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration for its journey to Mars. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission is to seek out signs of past microscopic life on Mars, explore the diverse geology of its landing site, Jezero Crater , and demonstrate key technologies that will help us prepare for future robotic and human exploration. \"Jezero Crater is the perfect place to search for signs of ancient life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. \"Perseverance is going to make discoveries that cause us to rethink our questions about what Mars was like and how we understand it today. As our instruments investigate rocks along an ancient lake bottom and select samples to return to Earth, we may very well be reaching back in time to get the information scientists need to say that life has existed elsewhere in the universe.\" The Martian rock and dust Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects could answer fundamental questions about the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. Two future missions currently under consideration by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to get the samples to an orbiter for return to Earth. When they arrive on Earth, the Mars samples will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large to send to the Red Planet. An Eye to a Martian Tomorrow. While most of Perseverance's seven instruments are geared toward learning more about the planet's geology and astrobiology, the MOXIE instrument's job is focused on missions yet to come. Designed to demonstrate that converting Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen is possible, it could lead to future versions of MOXIE technology that become staples on Mars missions, providing oxygen for rocket fuel and breathable air. Also future-leaning is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter , which will remain attached to the belly of Perseverance for the flight to Mars and the first 60 or so days on the surface. A technology demonstrator, Ingenuity's goal is a pure flight test - it carries no science instruments. Over 30 sols , the helicopter will attempt up to five powered, controlled flights. The data acquired during these flight tests will help the next generation of Mars helicopters provide an aerial dimension to Mars explorations - potentially scouting for rovers and human crews, transporting small payloads, or investigating difficult-to-reach destinations. The rover's technologies for entry, descent, and landing also will provide information to advance future human missions to Mars. \"Perseverance is the most capable rover in history because it is standing on the shoulders of our pioneers Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity,\" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"In the same way, the descendants of Ingenuity and MOXIE will become valuable tools for future explorers to the Red Planet and beyond.\" About seven cold, dark, unforgiving months of interplanetary space travel lay ahead for the mission - a fact never far from the mind of Mars 2020 project team. \"There is still a lot of road between us and Mars,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"About 290 million miles of them. But if there was ever a team that could make it happen, it is this one. We are going to Jezero Crater. We will see you there on February 18, 2021.\" The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of America's larger Moon to Mars exploration approach that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.

Perseverance, the centerpiece of NASA's $2.7 billion Mars 2020 mission, refined its course toward the Red Planet with a trajectory-correction maneuver on Friday (Aug. 14), 15 days after the life-hunting rover lifted off. The maneuver, which employed eight thrusters on Perseverance's cruise stage - the vehicle that carries the rover through deep space - was a success, mission team members announced via Twitter(opens in new tab) on Friday. Perseverance's mission plan calls for five trajectory-correction maneuvers to set the rover up for its pinpoint landing inside Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

In some of the last steps required prior to stacking the spacecraft components in the configuration they'll be in atop the Atlas V rocket, the rover's wheels and parachute have been installed. Perseverance received its six flight wheels on March 30, 2020. While the rover took a test drive last December , it was on \"flight spares\" that wouldn't be making the trip to Mars. Designed for the kind of off-roading Perseverance will perform on the Red Planet, the wheels are re- engineered versions of the ones NASA's Curiosity has been using on its traverses of Mount Sharp. Machined out of a block of flight-grade aluminum and equipped with titanium spokes, each wheel is slightly larger in diameter and narrower than Curiosity's, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. They also feature new treads, or grousers: In place of Curiosity's 24 chevron-pattern treads are 48 gently curved ones. Extensive testing in the Mars Yard at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the rover and manages operations, has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks and grip just as well or better than Curiosity's when driving on sand. The Parachute. The job of adding Perseverance's parachute to the back shell, where the rover will be stowed on the journey to the Red Planet, took several days and was finished on March 26. Tasked with slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from Mach 1.7 to about 200 mph during the rover's landing on Feb., 18, 2021, the 194 pounds of nylon, Technora and Kevlar fibers are packed so tightly into a 20-inch-wide aluminum cylinder that it is as dense as oak wood.

Over the weekend, 884 pounds of hydrazine monopropellant were loaded into the descent stage's four fuel tanks. As the aeroshell containing the descent stage and rover enter the Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021, the propellant will be pressure-fed through 120 feet of stainless steel and titanium tubing into eight Mars landing engines. The engines' job: to slow the spacecraft, which will be traveling at about 180 mph when it's 7,200 feet in altitude, to 1.7 mph by the time it's about 66 feet above the surface. Maintaining this rate of descent, the stage will then perform the sky crane maneuver: Nylon cords spool out to lower the rover 25 feet below the descent stage; When the spacecraft senses touchdown at Jezero Crater, the connecting cords are severed and the descent stage flies off. \"The last hundred days before any Mars launch is chock-full of significant milestones,\" said David Gruel, the Mars 2020 assembly, test and launch operations manager at JPL. \"Fueling the descent stage is a big step. While we will continue to test and evaluate its performance as we move forward with launch preparations, it is now ready to fulfill its mission of placing Perseverance on the surface on Mars.\" The Helicopter. After the descent stage fueling, the system that will deliver the Mars Helicopter to the surface of the Red Planet was integrated with Perseverance. The helicopter, which weighs 4 pounds and features propellers 4 feet in diameter, is cocooned within the delivery system. In one of the first steps in the day-long process on April 6, technicians and engineers made 34 electrical connections between the rover, the helicopter and its delivery system on the rover's belly. After confirming data and commands could be sent and received, they attached the delivery system to the rover. Finally, the team confirmed the helicopter could receive an electrical charge from the rover. Before being deployed onto the surface of Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter will rely on the rover for power. Afterward, it will generate its own electrical power through a solar panel located above its twin counter- rotating propellers. The helicopter will remain encapsulated on the rover's belly for the next year and will be deployed around the beginning of May - roughly two-and-a-half months after Perseverance's landing.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first. After sufficient deceleration, the parachutes are activated, which ensures a further reduction in speed. In the final phase, the descent stage is separated from the rear aerodynamic cover, and motorized reduces the rate of descent to less than 3 km/h. As the system with the rover is 20 meters above the surface of Mars, flight- separation bolts will be released by small pyrotechnic charges. Nylon cords then spool out through what are called bridle exit guides to lower the rover.

The Perseverance rover, comparable in size to the Curiosity rover, carries onboard seven different scientific instruments created as part of the Mars Exploration Program. During its astrobiological mission, the rover will search for traces of ancient life, helping to understand the evolution of the climate on Mars and its geology.

The Perseverance Mars rover is one of a kind, and the testing required to get it ready to roll on the mean streets of the Red Planet is one of a kind as well. Because hardware cannot be repaired once the rover is on Mars, the team has to build a vehicle that can survive for years on a planet with punishing temperature shifts, constant radiation and ever-present dust. To ensure readiness, they put Perseverance through a test program tougher than the trip to Mars and the environment it will encounter once there. \"Mars is hard, and everybody knows that,\" said project manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What they may not realize is that to be successful at Mars, you have to test the absolute heck out of the thing here on Earth.\" While the unique tests performed for the project number in the thousands, here's a handful that stand out. The Sound and Fury. It is no secret that loud noises can be detrimental to your hearing. They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they're at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose. Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer's launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels - louder than what you'd encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir. Oh, Chute. Ask any member of the Mars 2020 mission's entry, descent and landing team, and they'll tell you there's little point in traveling through 314 million miles of interplanetary space if you can't stick the landing. At 70.5 feet in diameter, the rover's supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled. Perseverance's parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test. First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research in California's Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior. More complex evaluations would come between March and September 2018. The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The final test flight , on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound load - the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission's chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars' atmosphere. The team also tested the chute's deployment mortar. Perseverance's parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream. Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature - about 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit - well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars . The mortar passed all three tests with flying colors. Running Hot and Cold. The Sun's rays heat a white-painted rover differently than they would, say, a Mars boulder. To better understand what temperature-sensitive instruments and subsystems will encounter, the team tested Perseverance's \"thermal model.\" In October 2019, they placed the rover in JPL's 25-foot-wide, 85-foot-tall vacuum chamber for a daylong test, where powerful xenon lamps several floors below beamed upward, hitting a mirror at the top of the chamber to drench the spacecraft with light. After the lamps warmed up and reached the same intensity of sunlight the rover will encounter at its landing site in Jezero Crater , an engineer climbed in and measured the \"sunlight\" reaching different portions of the rover. Data from the test was used to update the rover's thermal model, giving the team the assurance they needed to proceed with next step in ground-based cold testing. Once the solar-intensity tests concluded, engineers closed the doors and evacuated the majority of the atmosphere in the chamber to simulate Mars' thin atmosphere, which has about 1% the atmospheric density of Earth. Then the chamber was chilled to minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and for a weeklong subsystems check, they ran computer programs, raised the remote sensing mast and antennas, turned wheels, and deployed the Mars Helicopter to make sure the rover can handle even the coldest Martian nights. Camera Ready. The Mars 2020 mission is launching 25 cameras to the Red Planet, a record number for an interplanetary expedition. After installation, each camera bound for the Red Planet had to undergo an \"eye\" exam. With a camera called WATSON, which is tasked with taking close-up pictures and video of rock textures, project engineers recorded the scene as they danced and waved. The goal: to determine the imager's frame rate and exposure time, and the ability of its computer to hold and transfer the data. For other imagers, the test was a little more formal and rigorous. The process is called machine-vision calibration and involves using target boards featuring grids to establish a baseline for a camera's optical performance. The result? The mission's vision was 2020. About the Mars 2020 Mission. Whether they are working on final assembly of the vehicle at Kennedy Space Center, testing software and subsystems at JPL, or teleworking due to coronavirus safety precautions, the Perseverance team remains on track to meet the opening of the rover's launch period. No matter what day Perseverance launches, it will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission will search for signs of ancient microbial life. It will also characterize the planet's climate and geology, collect samples for future return to Earth, and pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet. The Perseverance rover mission is part of a larger program that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. Charged with returning astronauts to the Moon by 2024, NASA will establish a sustained human presence on and around the Moon by 2028 through NASA's Artemis lunar exploration plans .

NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk revealed the delay in a presentation to a joint meeting of the National Academies' Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board June 9. \"We had a little bit of a hiccup with ULA and the launch vehicle processing, so we're incurring a three-day delay,\" he said. He didn't elaborate on the issue that caused the delay, but a spokesperson for United Launch Alliance, which is providing the Atlas 5 used to launch Mars 2020, told SpaceNews June 10 that \"additional time was needed for the team to repair an issue with the ground system equipment.\" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive, said on Twitter that a problem with a crane used as part of launch vehicle processing caused the delay, an issue that has since been corrected. The delay pushed back the launch of Mars 2020 to July 20, with a two-hour window opening at 9:15 a.m. Eastern, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before the launch vehicle processing problem, Mars 2020 had remained set to launch July 17, the first day of the overall launch window for the mission. That launch window extends to Aug. 11. If Mars 2020 doesn't launch by Aug. 11, the mission will have to wait until the next launch opportunity more than two years later. That's the main reason that NASA elevated the mission to one of its highest priorities during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the SpaceX Demo-2 commercial crew mission. NASA went to significant lengths to keep Mars 2020 on schedule, including using agency aircraft to ferry personnel and equipment to the Kennedy Space Center, where the spacecraft is wrapping up pre-launch preparations, to avoid any risks of coronavirus exposure from commercial flights. Mars 2020, whose rover was named Perseverance earlier this year, is the first step in a multi-mission effort to return samples from Mars to Earth. Perseverance will collect those samples, which will be picked up by a rover launched on a second mission. That second rover will place the samples into a small rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, which will lift off from the planet and place the sample container in orbit. A third mission, an orbiter, will collect the samples and return them to Earth as soon as 2031. Mars 2020 is closely modeled on the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012. \"We land in a similar fashion to Curiosity,\" said Adam Steltzner, Mars 2020 project chief engineer, at a June 10 SSB meeting. \"We've added some tricks to our landing system to make the performance even better,\" allowing a more precise targeting of the rover's landing site. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, told the SSB at its June 10 meeting that he was not concerned about this three-day slip. \"We have a long window ahead of us. We always start by targeting the first day of the window,\" he said. \"It's rocket science, remember.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/mars-2020-launch-slips-three-days/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover Perseverance is 'go' for launch", "date": "2020-07-27", "content": "NASA's next Mars rover has been cleared for liftoff. This morning , the $2.7 billion Mars 2020 Perseverance rover passed its launch readiness review, the last big hurdle to clear before its planned liftoff Thursday from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \"The launch readiness review is complete, and we are indeed go for launch,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a news conference today. Perseverance is scheduled to lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Thursday during a two-hour window that opens at 7:50 a.m. EDT . You can watch all the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA. Mother Nature looks likely to cooperate with that plan. There's just a 20% chance that bad weather will scuttle Thursday's attempt, launch weather officer Jessica Williams, of the 45th Space Force, said during today's news conference. The launch will send Perseverance on a nearly 7-month cruise to Mars, which will end with a dramatic, sky-crane landing within the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The nuclear-powered rover will then spend at least one Mars year exploring the 28-mile-wide Jezero, which harbored a lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Perseverance will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life, study the crater's geology and collect and cache several dozen samples, among other tasks. Those samples will be brought back to Earth, perhaps as early as 2031, by a joint NASA/European Space Agency campaign. Once the Mars material is here, scientists around the world will scour it for signs of life and clues about the planet's mysterious history. \"That'll be the first time in history that we've done a Mars return mission,\" Bridenstine said. \"In fact, it's the first time in history we've done a return mission from any planet.\" Perseverance will also demonstrate several new technologies on the Martian surface. For example, one of the rover's 10 instruments, called MOXIE, will generate oxygen from the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. Such gear, once scaled up, could help future astronauts explore the Red Planet, a goal NASA wants to achieve in the 2030s. In addition, a 4-lb. helicopter called Ingenuity will travel to Mars on Perseverance's belly. Once the rover finds a good spot, the little chopper will detach and perform a few test flights - the first ever performed by a rotorcraft on an alien world. If Ingenuity is successful, future Mars missions may routinely employ helicopters as scouts for rovers or astronauts, NASA officials have said. Rotorcraft could also do substantial science work of their own, exploring hard-to-reach places such as caves and cliff faces. Ingenuity won't collect data in this manner; it carries no science instruments. But the little chopper does have a camera system, which should provide some amazing and unprecedented Red Planet views. \"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance, giving us images of Perseverance - what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kinds of activities happening on another world.\" Perseverance's launch window extends through Aug. 15. If the rover is unable to get off the ground by then, it will have to be put into storage until the next opportunity in 2022. The NASA rover's launch will be the third Mars liftoff in less than two weeks.

This rover, a successor to the Curiosity robotic explorer, is equipped with sensors specifically designed to help it hopefully find evidence of ancient, microbiotic life on Mars. Mars 2020 departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 7:50 AM EDT . Perseverance was loaded atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, which had a good liftoff and deployed its second stage, which put the spacecraft into a parking orbit as it readies to depart on its trip toward Mars, which will see it arrive in February 2021. Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet's surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what's known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today. This has been chosen specifically because it's a prime spot for finding any evidence of microbiological life that might exist, as it contains one of the best-preserved deposits of a river delta on Mars. NASA scientists don't expect to be able to confirm the existence of life on Mars using the instruments on Perseverance; however, they think they can find strong indications that the conditions and materials necessary for life once existed. But the ultimate proof could come from the ambitious Mars sample return mission being planned for 2026. This would involve NASA launching a return rocket to the red planet, which will carry a rocket that can take off from the Mars surface with samples collected by Perseverance on board. That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency , which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study. In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we've never done before. Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, and could include color photos - the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point. This is a great first step for this historic Mars 2020 mission, and now we'll wait and watch for other significant milestones, including next in around two weeks when the spacecraft fires its engines for its departure from Earth's orbit and begins the long trip to Mars.

It will land at Jezero Crater in about seven months, on February 18, 2021. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth. Humanity's most sophisticated rover launched with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at 7:50 a.m. EDT Thursday on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. \"With the launch of Perseverance, we begin another historic mission of exploration,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"This amazing explorer's journey has already required the very best from all of us to get it to launch through these challenging times. Now we can look forward to its incredible science and to bringing samples of Mars home even as we advance human missions to the Red Planet. As a mission, as an agency, and as a country, we will persevere.\" The ULA Atlas V's Centaur upper stage initially placed the Mars 2020 spacecraft into a parking orbit around Earth. The engine fired for a second time and the spacecraft separated from the Centaur as expected. Navigation data indicate the spacecraft is perfectly on course to Mars. Mars 2020 sent its first signal to ground controllers via NASA's Deep Space Network at 9:15 a.m. EDT . However, telemetry had not yet been acquired at that point. Around 11:30 a.m. EDT , a signal with telemetry was received from Mars 2020 by NASA ground stations. Data indicate the spacecraft had entered a state known as safe mode, likely because a part of the spacecraft was a little colder than expected while Mars 2020 was in Earth's shadow. All temperatures are now nominal and the spacecraft is out of Earth's shadow. When a spacecraft enters safe mode, all but essential systems are turned off until it receives new commands from mission control. An interplanetary launch is fast-paced and dynamic, so a spacecraft is designed to put itself in safe mode if its onboard computer perceives conditions are not within its preset parameters. Right now, the Mars 2020 mission is completing a full health assessment on the spacecraft and is working to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration for its journey to Mars. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission is to seek out signs of past microscopic life on Mars, explore the diverse geology of its landing site, Jezero Crater , and demonstrate key technologies that will help us prepare for future robotic and human exploration. \"Jezero Crater is the perfect place to search for signs of ancient life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. \"Perseverance is going to make discoveries that cause us to rethink our questions about what Mars was like and how we understand it today. As our instruments investigate rocks along an ancient lake bottom and select samples to return to Earth, we may very well be reaching back in time to get the information scientists need to say that life has existed elsewhere in the universe.\" The Martian rock and dust Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects could answer fundamental questions about the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. Two future missions currently under consideration by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to get the samples to an orbiter for return to Earth. When they arrive on Earth, the Mars samples will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large to send to the Red Planet. An Eye to a Martian Tomorrow. While most of Perseverance's seven instruments are geared toward learning more about the planet's geology and astrobiology, the MOXIE instrument's job is focused on missions yet to come. Designed to demonstrate that converting Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen is possible, it could lead to future versions of MOXIE technology that become staples on Mars missions, providing oxygen for rocket fuel and breathable air. Also future-leaning is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter , which will remain attached to the belly of Perseverance for the flight to Mars and the first 60 or so days on the surface. A technology demonstrator, Ingenuity's goal is a pure flight test - it carries no science instruments. Over 30 sols , the helicopter will attempt up to five powered, controlled flights. The data acquired during these flight tests will help the next generation of Mars helicopters provide an aerial dimension to Mars explorations - potentially scouting for rovers and human crews, transporting small payloads, or investigating difficult-to-reach destinations. The rover's technologies for entry, descent, and landing also will provide information to advance future human missions to Mars. \"Perseverance is the most capable rover in history because it is standing on the shoulders of our pioneers Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity,\" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"In the same way, the descendants of Ingenuity and MOXIE will become valuable tools for future explorers to the Red Planet and beyond.\" About seven cold, dark, unforgiving months of interplanetary space travel lay ahead for the mission - a fact never far from the mind of Mars 2020 project team. \"There is still a lot of road between us and Mars,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"About 290 million miles of them. But if there was ever a team that could make it happen, it is this one. We are going to Jezero Crater.

Recently, NASA experts have informed that they have begun the \"vehicle stacking\" process on the Perseverance rover of the future Mars 2020 mission . All work on the assembly of the rover itself has already been completed. Earlier, a parachute system and an unmanned aerial vehicle Mars Helicopter were installed on it. NASA hopes that it will be the first agency to bring a flying machine to an alien planet and successfully test it there. It has combined the rover with the Sky Crane braking system and the rear shell of the landing module, which should gently lower the rover to Mars. The crane was attached to the Rover on April 23, and a week later, a protective box was added. It contains parachutes and other necessary equipment, which will be used until the late stages of the descent. Its purpose will also be to protect the rover and its rocket crane in interplanetary space , especially when flying through the atmosphere of Mars. When the rover enters the sparse atmosphere of Mars on February 18, 2021, the heat shield comes into play first. After sufficient deceleration, the parachutes are activated, which ensures a further reduction in speed. In the final phase, the descent stage is separated from the rear aerodynamic cover, and motorized reduces the rate of descent to less than 3 km/h. As the system with the rover is 20 meters above the surface of Mars, flight- separation bolts will be released by small pyrotechnic charges. Nylon cords then spool out through what are called bridle exit guides to lower the rover. As soon as the rover wheels upon the ground, the cables will be broken, and the system will fly off to a safe distance. The Perseverance rover, comparable in size to the Curiosity rover, carries onboard seven different scientific instruments created as part of the Mars Exploration Program. During its astrobiological mission, the rover will search for traces of ancient life, helping to understand the evolution of the climate on Mars and its geology. It will also take samples that will be transported to Earth in a few years on another mission.

The Perseverance Mars rover is one of a kind, and the testing required to get it ready to roll on the mean streets of the Red Planet is one of a kind as well. Because hardware cannot be repaired once the rover is on Mars, the team has to build a vehicle that can survive for years on a planet with punishing temperature shifts, constant radiation and ever-present dust. To ensure readiness, they put Perseverance through a test program tougher than the trip to Mars and the environment it will encounter once there. \"Mars is hard, and everybody knows that,\" said project manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What they may not realize is that to be successful at Mars, you have to test the absolute heck out of the thing here on Earth.\" While the unique tests performed for the project number in the thousands, here's a handful that stand out. The Sound and Fury. It is no secret that loud noises can be detrimental to your hearing. They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they're at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose. Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer's launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels - louder than what you'd encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir. Oh, Chute. Ask any member of the Mars 2020 mission's entry, descent and landing team, and they'll tell you there's little point in traveling through 314 million miles of interplanetary space if you can't stick the landing. At 70.5 feet in diameter, the rover's supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled. Perseverance's parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test. First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research in California's Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior. More complex evaluations would come between March and September 2018. The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The final test flight , on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound load - the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission's chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars' atmosphere. The team also tested the chute's deployment mortar. Perseverance's parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream. Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature - about 70 degrees Fahrenheit . The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit - well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars . The mortar passed all three tests with flying colors. Running Hot and Cold. The Sun's rays heat a white-painted rover differently than they would, say, a Mars boulder. To better understand what temperature-sensitive instruments and subsystems will encounter, the team tested Perseverance's \"thermal model.\" In October 2019, they placed the rover in JPL's 25-foot-wide, 85-foot-tall vacuum chamber for a daylong test, where powerful xenon lamps several floors below beamed upward, hitting a mirror at the top of the chamber to drench the spacecraft with light. After the lamps warmed up and reached the same intensity of sunlight the rover will encounter at its landing site in Jezero Crater , an engineer climbed in and measured the \"sunlight\" reaching different portions of the rover. Data from the test was used to update the rover's thermal model, giving the team the assurance they needed to proceed with next step in ground-based cold testing. Once the solar-intensity tests concluded, engineers closed the doors and evacuated the majority of the atmosphere in the chamber to simulate Mars' thin atmosphere, which has about 1% the atmospheric density of Earth. Then the chamber was chilled to minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit , and for a weeklong subsystems check, they ran computer programs, raised the remote sensing mast and antennas, turned wheels, and deployed the Mars Helicopter to make sure the rover can handle even the coldest Martian nights. Camera Ready. The Mars 2020 mission is launching 25 cameras to the Red Planet, a record number for an interplanetary expedition. After installation, each camera bound for the Red Planet had to undergo an \"eye\" exam. With a camera called WATSON, which is tasked with taking close-up pictures and video of rock textures, project engineers recorded the scene as they danced and waved. The goal: to determine the imager's frame rate and exposure time, and the ability of its computer to hold and transfer the data. For other imagers, the test was a little more formal and rigorous. The process is called machine-vision calibration and involves using target boards featuring grids to establish a baseline for a camera's optical performance. The result? The mission's vision was 2020. About the Mars 2020 Mission. Whether they are working on final assembly of the vehicle at Kennedy Space Center, testing software and subsystems at JPL, or teleworking due to coronavirus safety precautions, the Perseverance team remains on track to meet the opening of the rover's launch period. No matter what day Perseverance launches, it will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission will search for signs of ancient microbial life. It will also characterize the planet's climate and geology, collect samples for future return to Earth, and pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet. The Perseverance rover mission is part of a larger program that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. Charged with returning astronauts to the Moon by 2024, NASA will establish a sustained human presence on and around the Moon by 2028 through NASA's Artemis lunar exploration plans .

NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk revealed the delay in a presentation to a joint meeting of the National Academies' Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board and Space Studies Board June 9. \"We had a little bit of a hiccup with ULA and the launch vehicle processing, so we're incurring a three-day delay,\" he said. He didn't elaborate on the issue that caused the delay, but a spokesperson for United Launch Alliance, which is providing the Atlas 5 used to launch Mars 2020, told SpaceNews June 10 that \"additional time was needed for the team to repair an issue with the ground system equipment.\" Tory Bruno, ULA president and chief executive, said on Twitter that a problem with a crane used as part of launch vehicle processing caused the delay, an issue that has since been corrected. The delay pushed back the launch of Mars 2020 to July 20, with a two-hour window opening at 9:15 a.m. Eastern, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before the launch vehicle processing problem, Mars 2020 had remained set to launch July 17, the first day of the overall launch window for the mission. That launch window extends to Aug. 11. If Mars 2020 doesn't launch by Aug. 11, the mission will have to wait until the next launch opportunity more than two years later. That's the main reason that NASA elevated the mission to one of its highest priorities during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the SpaceX Demo-2 commercial crew mission. NASA went to significant lengths to keep Mars 2020 on schedule, including using agency aircraft to ferry personnel and equipment to the Kennedy Space Center, where the spacecraft is wrapping up pre-launch preparations, to avoid any risks of coronavirus exposure from commercial flights. Mars 2020, whose rover was named Perseverance earlier this year, is the first step in a multi-mission effort to return samples from Mars to Earth. Perseverance will collect those samples, which will be picked up by a rover launched on a second mission. That second rover will place the samples into a small rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, which will lift off from the planet and place the sample container in orbit. A third mission, an orbiter, will collect the samples and return them to Earth as soon as 2031. Mars 2020 is closely modeled on the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012. \"We land in a similar fashion to Curiosity,\" said Adam Steltzner, Mars 2020 project chief engineer, at a June 10 SSB meeting. \"We've added some tricks to our landing system to make the performance even better,\" allowing a more precise targeting of the rover's landing site. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, told the SSB at its June 10 meeting that he was not concerned about this three-day slip. \"We have a long window ahead of us. We always start by targeting the first day of the window,\" he said. \"It's rocket science, remember.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/mars-2020-launch-slips-three-days/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover Perseverance is 'go' for launch", "date": "2020-07-27", "content": "NASA's next Mars rover has been cleared for liftoff.

You can watch all the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA. Mother Nature looks likely to cooperate with that plan. There's just a 20% chance that bad weather will scuttle Thursday's attempt, launch weather officer Jessica Williams, of the 45th Space Force, said during today's news conference. The launch will send Perseverance on a nearly 7-month cruise to Mars, which will end with a dramatic, sky-crane landing within the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The nuclear-powered rover will then spend at least one Mars year exploring the 28-mile-wide Jezero, which harbored a lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Perseverance will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life, study the crater's geology and collect and cache several dozen samples, among other tasks. Those samples will be brought back to Earth, perhaps as early as 2031, by a joint NASA/European Space Agency campaign. Once the Mars material is here, scientists around the world will scour it for signs of life and clues about the planet's mysterious history. \"That'll be the first time in history that we've done a Mars return mission,\" Bridenstine said. \"In fact, it's the first time in history we've done a return mission from any planet.\" Perseverance will also demonstrate several new technologies on the Martian surface. For example, one of the rover's 10 instruments, called MOXIE, will generate oxygen from the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. Such gear, once scaled up, could help future astronauts explore the Red Planet, a goal NASA wants to achieve in the 2030s. In addition, a 4-lb. helicopter called Ingenuity will travel to Mars on Perseverance's belly. Once the rover finds a good spot, the little chopper will detach and perform a few test flights - the first ever performed by a rotorcraft on an alien world. If Ingenuity is successful, future Mars missions may routinely employ helicopters as scouts for rovers or astronauts, NASA officials have said. Rotorcraft could also do substantial science work of their own, exploring hard-to-reach places such as caves and cliff faces. Ingenuity won't collect data in this manner; it carries no science instruments. But the little chopper does have a camera system, which should provide some amazing and unprecedented Red Planet views. \"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance, giving us images of Perseverance - what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kinds of activities happening on another world.\" Perseverance's launch window extends through Aug. 15. If the rover is unable to get off the ground by then, it will have to be put into storage until the next opportunity in 2022.

This rover, a successor to the Curiosity robotic explorer, is equipped with sensors specifically designed to help it hopefully find evidence of ancient, microbiotic life on Mars. Mars 2020 departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 7:50 AM EDT . Perseverance was loaded atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, which had a good liftoff and deployed its second stage, which put the spacecraft into a parking orbit as it readies to depart on its trip toward Mars, which will see it arrive in February 2021. Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet's surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what's known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today. This has been chosen specifically because it's a prime spot for finding any evidence of microbiological life that might exist, as it contains one of the best-preserved deposits of a river delta on Mars. NASA scientists don't expect to be able to confirm the existence of life on Mars using the instruments on Perseverance; however, they think they can find strong indications that the conditions and materials necessary for life once existed. But the ultimate proof could come from the ambitious Mars sample return mission being planned for 2026. This would involve NASA launching a return rocket to the red planet, which will carry a rocket that can take off from the Mars surface with samples collected by Perseverance on board. That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency , which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study. In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we've never done before. Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, and could include color photos - the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point. This is a great first step for this historic Mars 2020 mission, and now we'll wait and watch for other significant milestones, including next in around two weeks when the spacecraft fires its engines for its departure from Earth's orbit and begins the long trip to Mars.

NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth. Humanity's most sophisticated rover launched with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at 7:50 a.m. EDT Thursday on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. \"With the launch of Perseverance, we begin another historic mission of exploration,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"This amazing explorer's journey has already required the very best from all of us to get it to launch through these challenging times. Now we can look forward to its incredible science and to bringing samples of Mars home even as we advance human missions to the Red Planet. As a mission, as an agency, and as a country, we will persevere.\" The ULA Atlas V's Centaur upper stage initially placed the Mars 2020 spacecraft into a parking orbit around Earth. The engine fired for a second time and the spacecraft separated from the Centaur as expected. Navigation data indicate the spacecraft is perfectly on course to Mars. Mars 2020 sent its first signal to ground controllers via NASA's Deep Space Network at 9:15 a.m. EDT . However, telemetry had not yet been acquired at that point. Around 11:30 a.m. EDT , a signal with telemetry was received from Mars 2020 by NASA ground stations. Data indicate the spacecraft had entered a state known as safe mode, likely because a part of the spacecraft was a little colder than expected while Mars 2020 was in Earth's shadow. All temperatures are now nominal and the spacecraft is out of Earth's shadow. When a spacecraft enters safe mode, all but essential systems are turned off until it receives new commands from mission control. An interplanetary launch is fast-paced and dynamic, so a spacecraft is designed to put itself in safe mode if its onboard computer perceives conditions are not within its preset parameters. Right now, the Mars 2020 mission is completing a full health assessment on the spacecraft and is working to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration for its journey to Mars. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission is to seek out signs of past microscopic life on Mars, explore the diverse geology of its landing site, Jezero Crater , and demonstrate key technologies that will help us prepare for future robotic and human exploration. \"Jezero Crater is the perfect place to search for signs of ancient life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. \"Perseverance is going to make discoveries that cause us to rethink our questions about what Mars was like and how we understand it today. As our instruments investigate rocks along an ancient lake bottom and select samples to return to Earth, we may very well be reaching back in time to get the information scientists need to say that life has existed elsewhere in the universe.\" The Martian rock and dust Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects could answer fundamental questions about the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. Two future missions currently under consideration by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to get the samples to an orbiter for return to Earth. When they arrive on Earth, the Mars samples will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large to send to the Red Planet. An Eye to a Martian Tomorrow. While most of Perseverance's seven instruments are geared toward learning more about the planet's geology and astrobiology, the MOXIE instrument's job is focused on missions yet to come. Designed to demonstrate that converting Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen is possible, it could lead to future versions of MOXIE technology that become staples on Mars missions, providing oxygen for rocket fuel and breathable air. Also future-leaning is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter , which will remain attached to the belly of Perseverance for the flight to Mars and the first 60 or so days on the surface. A technology demonstrator, Ingenuity's goal is a pure flight test - it carries no science instruments. Over 30 sols , the helicopter will attempt up to five powered, controlled flights. The data acquired during these flight tests will help the next generation of Mars helicopters provide an aerial dimension to Mars explorations - potentially scouting for rovers and human crews, transporting small payloads, or investigating difficult-to-reach destinations. The rover's technologies for entry, descent, and landing also will provide information to advance future human missions to Mars. \"Perseverance is the most capable rover in history because it is standing on the shoulders of our pioneers Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity,\" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"In the same way, the descendants of Ingenuity and MOXIE will become valuable tools for future explorers to the Red Planet and beyond.\" About seven cold, dark, unforgiving months of interplanetary space travel lay ahead for the mission - a fact never far from the mind of Mars 2020 project team. \"There is still a lot of road between us and Mars,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"About 290 million miles of them. But if there was ever a team that could make it happen, it is this one. We are going to Jezero Crater.

That would then meet up with a rover to be launched by the European Space Agency , which would then make the trip all the way back to Earth for scientists to study. In addition to its contained, radioactive nuclear battery power source, environment sensors, cameras and a suite of other instruments to help pick up any preserved evidence of ancient life, Perseverance is equipped with microphones. This is the first time that microphones are making the trip to the surface of another world, and it means we could hear what it sounds like on the surface of another world, something we've never done before. Perseverance also carries the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, a small drone designed for first-ever self-powered flight, which is also designed to warm itself to survive the cold Martian night. It is set to hopefully make up to five flights in 30 days, and could include color photos - the first ever taken from an aerial vantage point.

The engine fired for a second time and the spacecraft separated from the Centaur as expected. Navigation data indicate the spacecraft is perfectly on course to Mars. Mars 2020 sent its first signal to ground controllers via NASA's Deep Space Network at 9:15 a.m. EDT . However, telemetry had not yet been acquired at that point. Around 11:30 a.m. EDT , a signal with telemetry was received from Mars 2020 by NASA ground stations. Data indicate the spacecraft had entered a state known as safe mode, likely because a part of the spacecraft was a little colder than expected while Mars 2020 was in Earth's shadow. All temperatures are now nominal and the spacecraft is out of Earth's shadow. When a spacecraft enters safe mode, all but essential systems are turned off until it receives new commands from mission control. An interplanetary launch is fast-paced and dynamic, so a spacecraft is designed to put itself in safe mode if its onboard computer perceives conditions are not within its preset parameters. Right now, the Mars 2020 mission is completing a full health assessment on the spacecraft and is working to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration for its journey to Mars. The Perseverance rover's astrobiology mission is to seek out signs of past microscopic life on Mars, explore the diverse geology of its landing site, Jezero Crater , and demonstrate key technologies that will help us prepare for future robotic and human exploration. \"Jezero Crater is the perfect place to search for signs of ancient life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. \"Perseverance is going to make discoveries that cause us to rethink our questions about what Mars was like and how we understand it today. As our instruments investigate rocks along an ancient lake bottom and select samples to return to Earth, we may very well be reaching back in time to get the information scientists need to say that life has existed elsewhere in the universe.\" The Martian rock and dust Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects could answer fundamental questions about the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. Two future missions currently under consideration by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to get the samples to an orbiter for return to Earth. When they arrive on Earth, the Mars samples will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large to send to the Red Planet. An Eye to a Martian Tomorrow. While most of Perseverance's seven instruments are geared toward learning more about the planet's geology and astrobiology, the MOXIE instrument's job is focused on missions yet to come. Designed to demonstrate that converting Martian carbon dioxide into oxygen is possible, it could lead to future versions of MOXIE technology that become staples on Mars missions, providing oxygen for rocket fuel and breathable air. Also future-leaning is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter , which will remain attached to the belly of Perseverance for the flight to Mars and the first 60 or so days on the surface. A technology demonstrator, Ingenuity's goal is a pure flight test - it carries no science instruments. Over 30 sols , the helicopter will attempt up to five powered, controlled flights. The data acquired during these flight tests will help the next generation of Mars helicopters provide an aerial dimension to Mars explorations - potentially scouting for rovers and human crews, transporting small payloads, or investigating difficult-to-reach destinations. The rover's technologies for entry, descent, and landing also will provide information to advance future human missions to Mars. \"Perseverance is the most capable rover in history because it is standing on the shoulders of our pioneers Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity,\" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"In the same way, the descendants of Ingenuity and MOXIE will become valuable tools for future explorers to the Red Planet and beyond.\" About seven cold, dark, unforgiving months of interplanetary space travel lay ahead for the mission - a fact never far from the mind of Mars 2020 project team. \"There is still a lot of road between us and Mars,\" said John McNamee, Mars 2020 project manager at JPL. \"About 290 million miles of them.

Perseverance is scheduled to lift off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Thursday during a two-hour window that opens at 7:50 a.m. EDT . You can watch all the action live here at Space.com, courtesy of NASA. Mother Nature looks likely to cooperate with that plan. There's just a 20% chance that bad weather will scuttle Thursday's attempt, launch weather officer Jessica Williams, of the 45th Space Force, said during today's news conference. The launch will send Perseverance on a nearly 7-month cruise to Mars, which will end with a dramatic, sky-crane landing within the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The nuclear-powered rover will then spend at least one Mars year exploring the 28-mile-wide Jezero, which harbored a lake and a river delta in the ancient past. Perseverance will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life, study the crater's geology and collect and cache several dozen samples, among other tasks. Those samples will be brought back to Earth, perhaps as early as 2031, by a joint NASA/European Space Agency campaign. Once the Mars material is here, scientists around the world will scour it for signs of life and clues about the planet's mysterious history. \"That'll be the first time in history that we've done a Mars return mission,\" Bridenstine said. \"In fact, it's the first time in history we've done a return mission from any planet.\" Perseverance will also demonstrate several new technologies on the Martian surface. For example, one of the rover's 10 instruments, called MOXIE, will generate oxygen from the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. Such gear, once scaled up, could help future astronauts explore the Red Planet, a goal NASA wants to achieve in the 2030s. In addition, a 4-lb. helicopter called Ingenuity will travel to Mars on Perseverance's belly. Once the rover finds a good spot, the little chopper will detach and perform a few test flights - the first ever performed by a rotorcraft on an alien world. If Ingenuity is successful, future Mars missions may routinely employ helicopters as scouts for rovers or astronauts, NASA officials have said. Rotorcraft could also do substantial science work of their own, exploring hard-to-reach places such as caves and cliff faces. Ingenuity won't collect data in this manner; it carries no science instruments. But the little chopper does have a camera system, which should provide some amazing and unprecedented Red Planet views. \"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance, giving us images of Perseverance - what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kinds of activities happening on another world.\" Perseverance's launch window extends through Aug. 15. If the rover is unable to get off the ground by then, it will have to be put into storage until the next opportunity in 2022.

Once at Mars, the lander vehicle will take Perseverance down to the planet's surface on February 18, 2021, to a target landing zone found in what's known as Jezero Crater. This location on Mars was once a lake, long ago when the atmosphere on Mars was quite different than the dry, dusty and cold environment we know today.

Perseverance, the centerpiece of NASA's $2.7 billion Mars 2020 mission, refined its course toward the Red Planet with a trajectory-correction maneuver on Friday (Aug. 14), 15 days after the life-hunting rover lifted off. The maneuver, which employed eight thrusters on Perseverance's cruise stage - the vehicle that carries the rover through deep space - was a success, mission team members announced via Twitter(opens in new tab) on Friday. Perseverance's mission plan calls for five trajectory-correction maneuvers to set the rover up for its pinpoint landing inside Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. The four remaining engine burns are scheduled to take place on Sept. 28, Dec. 20, Feb. 10 and Feb. 16. (There's also a backup opportunity on Feb. 17 if needed, and a final \"contingency\" window on Feb. 18, just nine hours before touchdown.) Perseverance launched July 30 on a mission to seek out signs of ancient Mars life inside the 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero Crater, which hosted a lake and river delta in the ancient past. The rover will also collect and cache samples for future return to Earth, potentially as early as 2031. Mars 2020 will test out new exploration technologies as well. For example, a tiny helicopter named Ingenuity is traveling to the Red Planet on the rover's belly and will attempt the first-ever rotorcraft flight on a world beyond Earth. Additionally, one of Perseverance's instruments, called MOXIE (short for \"Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment\"), will generate oxygen from the carbon dioxide-dominated Martian atmosphere. A scaled-up version of MOXIE could one day help human pioneers get a foothold on Mars, NASA officials have said. (The agency aims to put boots on the Red Planet in the 2030s.)

Future scientists will use these carefully selected representatives of Martian rock and regolith to look for evidence of potential microbial life present in Mars' ancient past and to answer other key questions about Mars and its history. Perseverance will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. About the size and shape of a standard lab test tube, the 43 sample tubes headed to Mars must be lightweight and hardy enough to survive the demands of the round trip, and so clean that future scientists will be confident that what they're analyzing is 100% Mars. \"Compared to Mars, Earth is filled with evidence of the life that covers our planet,\" said Ken Farley, the Mars 2020 project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"We needed to remove those signs so thoroughly that any scant evidence remaining can be confidently detected and differentiated when these first samples are returned.\" The practice of engineering containers to ferry samples from other worlds goes back to Apollo 11. When Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin returned to Earth with 47.7 pounds of samples from the Moon's Sea of Tranquility in 1969, they carried them in two triple-sealed, briefcase- size aluminum boxes. But Apollo's rock boxes needed to keep their cargo pristine only for about 10 days - from the lunar surface to splashdown - before being whisked off to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. Perseverance's sample tubes must isolate and preserve the scientific value of their contents for well over 10 years. Mars Sample Return. As NASA's newest rover investigates Jezero Crater , mission scientists will determine when and where it will drill for samples. This precious Martian cargo will be packaged in those tubes with the most intricate and technologically advanced mechanism ever sent into space: the Sample Caching System . After the samples have been deposited on the Martian surface, two other missions being formulated by NASA in partnership with ESA will complete the relay to get them back to Earth. The second mission in this sample return campaign will send a \"fetch\" rover to retrieve the hermetically-sealed tubes and deliver them to a special sample return container inside the Mars Ascent Vehicle. The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover could also deliver tubes with samples to the vicinity of the Mars Ascent Vehicle if it remains healthy well into an extended mission. The Mars Ascent Vehicle will then launch the tubes into orbit. The final mission will fly an orbiter to Mars to rendezvous with the encapsulated samples, capture them in a highly secure containment capsule, and ferry them back to Earth . Robust Containers. Made chiefly of titanium, each sample tube weighs less than 2 ounces . A white exterior coating guards against heating by the Sun potentially changing the chemical composition of the samples after Perseverance deposits the tubes on the surface of Mars. Laser-etched serial numbers on the exterior will help the team identify the tubes and their contents. Each tube must fit within the tight tolerances not only of Perseverance's Sample Caching System, but those of the future missions. \"They are less than 6 inches 15.2 centimeters long, but we still found over 60 different dimensions to scrutinize,\" said Sample Tube Cognizant Engineer Pavlina Karafillis of JPL. \"Because of the intricacies of all the complex mechanisms they will pass through during the Mars Sample Return campaign, if any measurement was off by about the thickness of a human hair, the tube was deemed not suitable for flight.\" 100% Pure Jezero. Precision engineering is only part of the challenge. The tubes are also the product of extreme cleanliness standards. All of NASA's planetary missions involve exacting processes to prevent the introduction of Earthly organic, inorganic, and biological material. But since these tubes could hold proof that life once existed elsewhere in the universe, the Mars 2020 team needed to reduce - even further - the possibility that they could host Earthly artifacts that could complicate the scientific process. The mandate was essentially that nothing should be in a tube until the Sample Caching System begins filling it with 9 cubic inches of Jezero Crater . \"And when they said 'nothing,' they meant it,\" said Ian Clark, the mission's assistant project systems engineer for sample tube cleanliness at JPL. \"An example: To achieve the kind of science the mission is going after, we needed to limit the total amount of Earth-based organic compounds in a given sample to less than 150 nanograms. For a set of particular organic compounds - ones that are very indicative of life - we were limited to less than 15 nanograms in a sample.\" A nanogram is a billionth of a gram. An average thumbprint carries about 45,000 nanograms of organics - about 300 times the total allowed in a sample tube. To meet such stringent mission specifications, the team had to rewrite the book on cleaning. \"We did all our assembly in a hyper-clean-room environment, which is essentially a clean room inside a clean room,\" said Clark. \"Between assembly steps, the sample tubes would be cleaned with filtered air blasts, rinsed with deionized water, and sonically cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and other exotic cleaning agents.\" After each cleaning, the team would measure contaminants and bake the tubes for good measure. By the time the 43 sample tubes were selected from a field of 93 fabricated for flight, each had generated over 250 pages of documentation and 3 gigabytes of images and videos. Of the tubes aboard Perseverance, up to 38 are destined to be filled with Martian rock and regolith. The other five are \"witness tubes\" that have been loaded with materials geared to capture molecular and particulate contaminants. They'll be opened one at a time on Mars to witness the ambient environment primarily near sample collection sites, cataloging any Earthly impurities or contaminants from the spacecraft that may be present during sample collection. The the sample and witness tubes' eventual return to and examination on Earth will allow the full breadth of terrestrial science laboratory capabilities to investigate the samples, using instruments too large and complex to send to Mars.

Once at the top of the Red Planet's atmosphere, an action-packed seven minutes of descent awaits - complete with temperatures equivalent to the surface of the Sun, a supersonic parachute inflation, and the first ever autonomous guided landing on Mars. Only then can the rover search Jezero Crater for signs of ancient life and collect samples that will eventually be returned to Earth. \"NASA has been exploring Mars since Mariner 4 performed a flyby in July of 1965, with two more flybys, seven successful orbiters, and eight landers since then,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington,\" said in a statement. \"Perseverance, which was built from the collective knowledge gleaned from such trailblazers, has the opportunity to not only expand our knowledge of the Red Planet, but to investigate one of the most important and exciting questions of humanity about the origin of life both on Earth and also on other planets.\" Jezero Crater is believed to be the perfect place to search for signs of ancient microbial life. Billions of years ago, the now-bone-dry 45-kilometre-wide basin was home to an actively-forming river delta and lake filled with water. The rock and regolith that Perseverance's Sample Caching System collects from Jezero could help answer fundamental questions about the existence of life beyond Earth. Two future missions currently in the planning stages by NASA, in collaboration with ESA , will work together to bring the samples back to Earth, where they will undergo in-depth analysis by scientists around the world using equipment far too large and complex to send to the Red Planet.

In order to communicate with Earth from its landing site in Jezero Crater, the rover will rely on spacecraft orbiting Mars to relay the images and other data it collects back to Earth and pass on the commands from engineers beamed across space in the other direction. The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is one of these spacecraft. As its orbit takes it over the landing site, TGO will enter communication windows with Perseverance and relay data between Earth and the rover via a network of deep space ground stations on Earth, including ESA's Estrack network. Helping Perseverance phone home. The data transmitted by Perseverance in its first hours and days on Mars will be vital to the mission. Did the rover land safely? Are all of its systems functional? To ensure that this information gets to the engineers on Earth as quickly as possible, TGO and NASA's Mars orbiters will be able to communicate with deep space ground stations on Earth almost twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the first two weeks after landing. ESA's ground station network will provide roughly 14 hours a day of this 'low-latency' coverage. \"TGO will provide low-latency data relay support to Perseverance during this period, and continue to provide routine relay support afterwards,\" says ESA's Peter Schmitz, TGO Spacecraft Operations Manager. \"Our first relay session with TGO will start at 02:07 CET on 19 February, just four hours after landing.\" The Trace Gas Orbiter is the first of two missions of the ExoMars program - a joint endeavor between ESA and Roscosmos. ExoMars is attempting to determine whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016 and is conducting a detailed study of the atmosphere and mapping signatures of water below the planet's surface. The orbiter is operated from ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, where mission controllers already have a lot of experience relaying data from existing Mars landers. \"The orbiter usually supports one relay session per lander per day, but from February 18, we will be supporting an additional two sessions per day for Perseverance,\" says Schmitz. \"From then on, TGO will relay twice the volume of data to and from the surface of Mars as it does now.\" In total, Perseverance will communicate with NASA or ESA Mars orbiters at least twice a day, and typically four to six times. During these sessions, data and images will be sent to NASA to help the operations team plan the rover's activities for the following days. Monitoring conditions at Jezero. Mars Express is Europe's first mission to the Red Planet. Since beginning operations in 2004, the durable orbiter has helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water, and potential for life on Mars. The high-resolution camera on board Mars Express has sent back thousands of dramatic, 3D views of the martian surface, including those used to produce a virtual flight over Jezero Crater , the planned landing site for Perseverance. The spacecraft's Visual Monitoring Camera - also known as the 'Mars Webcam' - is providing additional wide context views of the landing region. The Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer is monitoring local conditions at Jezero Crater. The information it collects is passed on to the Perseverance Entry, Descent and Landing team at NASA and is included in their daily report during the two weeks leading up to the landing. \"The engineers working with EDL systems need precise information on the density of the Martian atmosphere above the site at the time of landing and how it changes with altitude,\" says Marco Giuranna, PFS Principal Investigator from Istituto Fisica Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy. \"Having up-to-date knowledge of the temperature, pressure, dust and ice conditions in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding its density and predicting and analyzing the trajectory of the rover's descent to the surface of the Red Planet.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-is-about-to-land-on-the-red-planet-it-will-have-some-help-from-these-mars-orbiters/"}, {"title": "Mars 2020: Perseverance rover has landed", "date": "2021-02-18", "content": "The Mars 2020 rover landed near the Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. After eight months hurtling through space, the Mars Perseverance rover has successfully landed and begun its mission. This is NASA's first major return to Mars since the Curiosity rover landed in 2011. Prof Caroline Smith, Head of Collections for Earth Sciences at the Museum, has been working on the mission. She describes how the Museum's expertise in planetary science, geology and searching for evidence of life, and collecting samples can make a contribution to this exciting mission. The journey so far. Travelling at speeds of 79,000 kilometres per hour and across approximately 470 million kilometres, it has taken the Perseverance rover nearly eight months to reach its destination. The landing process is always a challenge - more than two thirds of missions sent to Mars have failed in their descent into the planet's thin atmosphere. Perseverance is specially adapted to land successfully, however. On entry, it shed its cruise stage, which includes solar panels, radios and fuel tanks, then used a parachute and rockets to slowly lower itself onto the planet's surface. Its exterior aeroshell protected it from the high temperatures caused by entry into Mars' atmosphere and which caused the outside heatshield to reach temperatures of 1,300\u00b0C. Finally, a 'sky crane' system, similar to that used on the Curiosity rover, ensured that it safely reached the surface. The team back on Earth endured a wait to find out if the landing was successful. It can take up to half an hour to know if all is well. Caroline describes the entry, descent and landing as 'seven minutes of terror' while UKSA Aurora Fellow Keyron Hickman-Lewis refers to this moment as 'seven minutes of anticipation', adding that it is 'decades of work held in a small window of time'. This is a career highlight for engineers and scientists involved, as many have been building up to this mission for their entire careers. Caroline comments that the mission is 'the result of much hard work, over many years by friends and colleagues', a testament to the close bonds forged around the rover. What is the Perseverance doing on Mars? The rover's first few days were spent carrying out safety checks. Its landing was directed near the sedimentary deposits on the delta in the Jezero Crater. Ideally, scientists wanted it near the delta but not too far away or too close. Landing directly onto the Delta makes it harder to see the deposits, while too far away and the mission loses time steering the rover to the correct place. Keyron says the team have had 'operational readiness training' so that they were prepared for any scenario. Perseverance will drill for interesting rock samples that show different features to help understand the geology of Jezero Crater. The team also hope to find rocks containing biosignatures, which are fossilised chemical and textural residues of life that can be found in sedimentary rocks. Caroline hopes that they can be returned to Earth as soon as 2031, saying, 'we are in the best place we've ever been to get Mars samples back from Mars'. This opportunity to collect samples is exciting: the Martian rock samples we have on Earth in the form of meteorites are all igneous rocks. The volcanic nature of igneous rocks makes them unsuitable for preserving traces of life, unlike sedimentary rocks, which are better at retaining fossil traces. How is the Museum helping with research? Physical samples may not return to Earth until 2031, but Perseverance's cameras allow scientists to examine the surface of Mars almost immediately. These images will give them insight into the geological history of Mars and help them to understand whether the planet holds physical or chemical evidence of life. For Keyron, the first image data returned is the most exciting part of the landing. He says, 'At the moment of landing we'll be waiting intently for the images.' Habitability on Mars has similar a timeframe to that on Earth, as during its earliest history, Mars also had liquid water. Scientists hope that by examining fossil evidence through the textures of Martian rocks, they could see whether the planet has ever supported life. Keyron's specialism is Archaean microbial palaeontology and early surface environments and ecosystems. He examines the fragmentary record left by simple organisms found in rocks which date from when there was no oxygen on Earth. The age and state of preservation of these rocks make this a difficult area of study. 'It can sometimes be hard to tell if it even is a fossil,' Keyron says, but his research gives us a framework for studying the rocks. Earth and Mars share a history within the solar system, so if Mars were habitable then it could at one point have had similar conditions as Earth when it comes to harbouring life. The Museum is returning a small sample of one of its own Martian meteorites , Sayh al Uhaymir , to the red planet. This specimen will help the SHERLOC instrument -a tool for exploring Mars which uses spectrometers, a camera and a laser - test that it is working as expected and that the data it collects on Mars is accurate. This meteorite was chosen because it is tough enough to survive the landing.

The panorama shows the rim of the Jezero Crater where the rover touched down last week and the cliff face of an ancient river delta in the distance. It was taken by rotating the rover's mast 360 degrees. The mast is equipped with dual, zoomable cameras which can take high-definition video and images. The photo was stitched together by NASA researchers from 142 images taken by the Mastcam-Z camera on Feb. 21. NASA says the state-of-the-art camera system will help scientists examine the geologic history and atmospheric condition of the crater and identify rocks and sediment from a distance that will be probed by the rover's instruments, before collection for eventual return to Earth. Jezero Crater is an area where scientists hope to find evidence that microbes previously existed on Mars. Mars had water on its surface billions of years ago, a fact that has led to speculation that there may have been some form of life on the planet. \"We're nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,\" said Jim Bell of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. Perseverance traveled through space for nearly seven months after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity were previous missions to Mars. The rover joins NASA's InSight lander, which has been on the Martian surface since 2018, and the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012. Perseverance is expected to study the Mars surface for at least two years as it examines the climate and geology and collects rock and soil samples. On Monday, the U.S. space agency released the first audio from Mars, a faint crackling recording of a gust of wind captured by the rover's microphone.

Each tube must fit within the tight tolerances not only of Perseverance's Sample Caching System, but those of the future missions. \"They are less than 6 inches 15.2 centimeters long, but we still found over 60 different dimensions to scrutinize,\" said Sample Tube Cognizant Engineer Pavlina Karafillis of JPL. \"Because of the intricacies of all the complex mechanisms they will pass through during the Mars Sample Return campaign, if any measurement was off by about the thickness of a human hair, the tube was deemed not suitable for flight.\" 100% Pure Jezero. Precision engineering is only part of the challenge. The tubes are also the product of extreme cleanliness standards. All of NASA's planetary missions involve exacting processes to prevent the introduction of Earthly organic, inorganic, and biological material. But since these tubes could hold proof that life once existed elsewhere in the universe, the Mars 2020 team needed to reduce - even further - the possibility that they could host Earthly artifacts that could complicate the scientific process. The mandate was essentially that nothing should be in a tube until the Sample Caching System begins filling it with 9 cubic inches of Jezero Crater . \"And when they said 'nothing,' they meant it,\" said Ian Clark, the mission's assistant project systems engineer for sample tube cleanliness at JPL. \"An example: To achieve the kind of science the mission is going after, we needed to limit the total amount of Earth-based organic compounds in a given sample to less than 150 nanograms. For a set of particular organic compounds - ones that are very indicative of life - we were limited to less than 15 nanograms in a sample.\" A nanogram is a billionth of a gram. An average thumbprint carries about 45,000 nanograms of organics - about 300 times the total allowed in a sample tube. To meet such stringent mission specifications, the team had to rewrite the book on cleaning. \"We did all our assembly in a hyper-clean-room environment, which is essentially a clean room inside a clean room,\" said Clark. \"Between assembly steps, the sample tubes would be cleaned with filtered air blasts, rinsed with deionized water, and sonically cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and other exotic cleaning agents.\" After each cleaning, the team would measure contaminants and bake the tubes for good measure. By the time the 43 sample tubes were selected from a field of 93 fabricated for flight, each had generated over 250 pages of documentation and 3 gigabytes of images and videos. Of the tubes aboard Perseverance, up to 38 are destined to be filled with Martian rock and regolith. The other five are \"witness tubes\" that have been loaded with materials geared to capture molecular and particulate contaminants. They'll be opened one at a time on Mars to witness the ambient environment primarily near sample collection sites, cataloging any Earthly impurities or contaminants from the spacecraft that may be present during sample collection.

In order to communicate with Earth from its landing site in Jezero Crater, the rover will rely on spacecraft orbiting Mars to relay the images and other data it collects back to Earth and pass on the commands from engineers beamed across space in the other direction. The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is one of these spacecraft. As its orbit takes it over the landing site, TGO will enter communication windows with Perseverance and relay data between Earth and the rover via a network of deep space ground stations on Earth, including ESA's Estrack network. Helping Perseverance phone home. The data transmitted by Perseverance in its first hours and days on Mars will be vital to the mission. Did the rover land safely? Are all of its systems functional? To ensure that this information gets to the engineers on Earth as quickly as possible, TGO and NASA's Mars orbiters will be able to communicate with deep space ground stations on Earth almost twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the first two weeks after landing. ESA's ground station network will provide roughly 14 hours a day of this 'low-latency' coverage. \"TGO will provide low-latency data relay support to Perseverance during this period, and continue to provide routine relay support afterwards,\" says ESA's Peter Schmitz, TGO Spacecraft Operations Manager. \"Our first relay session with TGO will start at 02:07 CET on 19 February, just four hours after landing.\" The Trace Gas Orbiter is the first of two missions of the ExoMars program - a joint endeavor between ESA and Roscosmos. ExoMars is attempting to determine whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016 and is conducting a detailed study of the atmosphere and mapping signatures of water below the planet's surface. The orbiter is operated from ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, where mission controllers already have a lot of experience relaying data from existing Mars landers. \"The orbiter usually supports one relay session per lander per day, but from February 18, we will be supporting an additional two sessions per day for Perseverance,\" says Schmitz. \"From then on, TGO will relay twice the volume of data to and from the surface of Mars as it does now.\" In total, Perseverance will communicate with NASA or ESA Mars orbiters at least twice a day, and typically four to six times. During these sessions, data and images will be sent to NASA to help the operations team plan the rover's activities for the following days. Monitoring conditions at Jezero. Mars Express is Europe's first mission to the Red Planet. Since beginning operations in 2004, the durable orbiter has helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water, and potential for life on Mars. The high-resolution camera on board Mars Express has sent back thousands of dramatic, 3D views of the martian surface, including those used to produce a virtual flight over Jezero Crater , the planned landing site for Perseverance. The spacecraft's Visual Monitoring Camera - also known as the 'Mars Webcam' - is providing additional wide context views of the landing region. The Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer is monitoring local conditions at Jezero Crater. The information it collects is passed on to the Perseverance Entry, Descent and Landing team at NASA and is included in their daily report during the two weeks leading up to the landing. \"The engineers working with EDL systems need precise information on the density of the Martian atmosphere above the site at the time of landing and how it changes with altitude,\" says Marco Giuranna, PFS Principal Investigator from Istituto Fisica Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy. \"Having up-to-date knowledge of the temperature, pressure, dust and ice conditions in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding its density and predicting and analyzing the trajectory of the rover's descent to the surface of the Red Planet.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-is-about-to-land-on-the-red-planet-it-will-have-some-help-from-these-mars-orbiters/"}, {"title": "Mars 2020: Perseverance rover has landed", "date": "2021-02-18", "content": "The Mars 2020 rover landed near the Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. After eight months hurtling through space, the Mars Perseverance rover has successfully landed and begun its mission. This is NASA's first major return to Mars since the Curiosity rover landed in 2011. Prof Caroline Smith, Head of Collections for Earth Sciences at the Museum, has been working on the mission. She describes how the Museum's expertise in planetary science, geology and searching for evidence of life, and collecting samples can make a contribution to this exciting mission. The journey so far. Travelling at speeds of 79,000 kilometres per hour and across approximately 470 million kilometres, it has taken the Perseverance rover nearly eight months to reach its destination. The landing process is always a challenge - more than two thirds of missions sent to Mars have failed in their descent into the planet's thin atmosphere. Perseverance is specially adapted to land successfully, however. On entry, it shed its cruise stage, which includes solar panels, radios and fuel tanks, then used a parachute and rockets to slowly lower itself onto the planet's surface. Its exterior aeroshell protected it from the high temperatures caused by entry into Mars' atmosphere and which caused the outside heatshield to reach temperatures of 1,300\u00b0C. Finally, a 'sky crane' system, similar to that used on the Curiosity rover, ensured that it safely reached the surface. The team back on Earth endured a wait to find out if the landing was successful. It can take up to half an hour to know if all is well. Caroline describes the entry, descent and landing as 'seven minutes of terror' while UKSA Aurora Fellow Keyron Hickman-Lewis refers to this moment as 'seven minutes of anticipation', adding that it is 'decades of work held in a small window of time'. This is a career highlight for engineers and scientists involved, as many have been building up to this mission for their entire careers. Caroline comments that the mission is 'the result of much hard work, over many years by friends and colleagues', a testament to the close bonds forged around the rover. What is the Perseverance doing on Mars? The rover's first few days were spent carrying out safety checks. Its landing was directed near the sedimentary deposits on the delta in the Jezero Crater. Ideally, scientists wanted it near the delta but not too far away or too close. Landing directly onto the Delta makes it harder to see the deposits, while too far away and the mission loses time steering the rover to the correct place. Keyron says the team have had 'operational readiness training' so that they were prepared for any scenario. Perseverance will drill for interesting rock samples that show different features to help understand the geology of Jezero Crater. The team also hope to find rocks containing biosignatures, which are fossilised chemical and textural residues of life that can be found in sedimentary rocks. Caroline hopes that they can be returned to Earth as soon as 2031, saying, 'we are in the best place we've ever been to get Mars samples back from Mars'. This opportunity to collect samples is exciting: the Martian rock samples we have on Earth in the form of meteorites are all igneous rocks. The volcanic nature of igneous rocks makes them unsuitable for preserving traces of life, unlike sedimentary rocks, which are better at retaining fossil traces. How is the Museum helping with research? Physical samples may not return to Earth until 2031, but Perseverance's cameras allow scientists to examine the surface of Mars almost immediately. These images will give them insight into the geological history of Mars and help them to understand whether the planet holds physical or chemical evidence of life. For Keyron, the first image data returned is the most exciting part of the landing. He says, 'At the moment of landing we'll be waiting intently for the images.' Habitability on Mars has similar a timeframe to that on Earth, as during its earliest history, Mars also had liquid water. Scientists hope that by examining fossil evidence through the textures of Martian rocks, they could see whether the planet has ever supported life. Keyron's specialism is Archaean microbial palaeontology and early surface environments and ecosystems. He examines the fragmentary record left by simple organisms found in rocks which date from when there was no oxygen on Earth. The age and state of preservation of these rocks make this a difficult area of study. 'It can sometimes be hard to tell if it even is a fossil,' Keyron says, but his research gives us a framework for studying the rocks. Earth and Mars share a history within the solar system, so if Mars were habitable then it could at one point have had similar conditions as Earth when it comes to harbouring life. The Museum is returning a small sample of one of its own Martian meteorites , Sayh al Uhaymir , to the red planet. This specimen will help the SHERLOC instrument -a tool for exploring Mars which uses spectrometers, a camera and a laser - test that it is working as expected and that the data it collects on Mars is accurate. This meteorite was chosen because it is tough enough to survive the landing.

The panorama shows the rim of the Jezero Crater where the rover touched down last week and the cliff face of an ancient river delta in the distance. It was taken by rotating the rover's mast 360 degrees. The mast is equipped with dual, zoomable cameras which can take high-definition video and images. The photo was stitched together by NASA researchers from 142 images taken by the Mastcam-Z camera on Feb. 21. NASA says the state-of-the-art camera system will help scientists examine the geologic history and atmospheric condition of the crater and identify rocks and sediment from a distance that will be probed by the rover's instruments, before collection for eventual return to Earth. Jezero Crater is an area where scientists hope to find evidence that microbes previously existed on Mars. Mars had water on its surface billions of years ago, a fact that has led to speculation that there may have been some form of life on the planet. \"We're nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,\" said Jim Bell of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. Perseverance traveled through space for nearly seven months after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity were previous missions to Mars. The rover joins NASA's InSight lander, which has been on the Martian surface since 2018, and the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012. Perseverance is expected to study the Mars surface for at least two years as it examines the climate and geology and collects rock and soil samples. On Monday, the U.S. space agency released the first audio from Mars, a faint crackling recording of a gust of wind captured by the rover's microphone. NASA also released a video of the landing of the rover, which is on a mission to search for signs of past life on the red planet.

SuperCam was developed jointly by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico and a consortium of French research laboratories under the auspices of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The instrument delivered data to the French Space Agency's operations center in Toulouse that includes the first audio of laser zaps on another planet. \"It is amazing to see SuperCam working so well on Mars,\" said Roger Wiens, the principal investigator for Perseverance's SuperCam instrument from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. \"When we first dreamed up this instrument eight years ago, we worried that we were being way too ambitious. Now it is up there working like a charm.\" \"The sounds acquired are remarkable quality,\" says Naomi Murdoch, a research scientist and lecturer at the ISAE-SUPAERO aerospace engineering school in Toulouse. \"It's incredible to think that we're going to do science with the first sounds ever recorded on the surface of Mars!\" On March 9, the mission released three SuperCam audio files. Obtained only about 18 hours after landing, when the mast remained stowed on the rover deck, the first file captures the faint sounds of Martian wind. The wind is more audible, especially around the 20-second mark, in the second sound file, recorded on the rover's fourth Martian day, or sol. SuperCam's third file, from Sol 12, includes the zapping sounds of the laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet (3.1 meters). Some zaps sound slightly louder than others, providing information on the physical structure of the targets, such as its relative hardness. \"I want to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to our international partners at CNES and the SuperCam team for being a part of this momentous journey with us,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"SuperCam truly gives our rover eyes to see promising rock samples and ears to hear what it sounds like when the lasers strike them. This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity.\" The SuperCam team also received excellent first datasets from the instrument's visible and infrared (VISIR) sensor as well as its Raman spectrometer. VISIR collects light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This technique complements the Raman spectrometer, which uses a green laser beam to excite the chemical bonds in a sample to produce a signal depending on what elements are bonded together, in turn providing insights into a rock's mineral composition. \"This is the first time an instrument has used Raman spectroscopy anywhere other than on Earth!\" said Olivier Beyssac, CNRS research director at the Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie in Paris. \"Raman spectroscopy is going to play a crucial role in characterizing minerals to gain deeper insight into the geological conditions under which they formed and to detect potential organic and mineral molecules that might have been formed by living organisms.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8885/perseverance-rovers-supercam-science-instrument-delivers-first-results/"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Perseverance Rover Is 100 Days Out", "date": "2020-11-10", "content": "A mere 100 days and 166 million miles (268 million kilometers) separate NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission and the Red Planet's Jezero Crater.

The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is one of these spacecraft. As its orbit takes it over the landing site, TGO will enter communication windows with Perseverance and relay data between Earth and the rover via a network of deep space ground stations on Earth, including ESA's Estrack network.

To ensure that this information gets to the engineers on Earth as quickly as possible, TGO and NASA's Mars orbiters will be able to communicate with deep space ground stations on Earth almost twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the first two weeks after landing. ESA's ground station network will provide roughly 14 hours a day of this 'low-latency' coverage. \"TGO will provide low-latency data relay support to Perseverance during this period, and continue to provide routine relay support afterwards,\" says ESA's Peter Schmitz, TGO Spacecraft Operations Manager. \"Our first relay session with TGO will start at 02:07 CET on 19 February, just four hours after landing.\" The Trace Gas Orbiter is the first of two missions of the ExoMars program - a joint endeavor between ESA and Roscosmos. ExoMars is attempting to determine whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016 and is conducting a detailed study of the atmosphere and mapping signatures of water below the planet's surface. The orbiter is operated from ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, where mission controllers already have a lot of experience relaying data from existing Mars landers. \"The orbiter usually supports one relay session per lander per day, but from February 18, we will be supporting an additional two sessions per day for Perseverance,\" says Schmitz. \"From then on, TGO will relay twice the volume of data to and from the surface of Mars as it does now.\" In total, Perseverance will communicate with NASA or ESA Mars orbiters at least twice a day, and typically four to six times. During these sessions, data and images will be sent to NASA to help the operations team plan the rover's activities for the following days. Monitoring conditions at Jezero. Mars Express is Europe's first mission to the Red Planet. Since beginning operations in 2004, the durable orbiter has helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water, and potential for life on Mars. The high-resolution camera on board Mars Express has sent back thousands of dramatic, 3D views of the martian surface, including those used to produce a virtual flight over Jezero Crater , the planned landing site for Perseverance. The spacecraft's Visual Monitoring Camera - also known as the 'Mars Webcam' - is providing additional wide context views of the landing region. The Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer is monitoring local conditions at Jezero Crater. The information it collects is passed on to the Perseverance Entry, Descent and Landing team at NASA and is included in their daily report during the two weeks leading up to the landing. \"The engineers working with EDL systems need precise information on the density of the Martian atmosphere above the site at the time of landing and how it changes with altitude,\" says Marco Giuranna, PFS Principal Investigator from Istituto Fisica Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy. \"Having up-to-date knowledge of the temperature, pressure, dust and ice conditions in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding its density and predicting and analyzing the trajectory of the rover's descent to the surface of the Red Planet.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-is-about-to-land-on-the-red-planet-it-will-have-some-help-from-these-mars-orbiters/"}, {"title": "Mars 2020: Perseverance rover has landed", "date": "2021-02-18", "content": "The Mars 2020 rover landed near the Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. After eight months hurtling through space, the Mars Perseverance rover has successfully landed and begun its mission. This is NASA's first major return to Mars since the Curiosity rover landed in 2011. Prof Caroline Smith, Head of Collections for Earth Sciences at the Museum, has been working on the mission. She describes how the Museum's expertise in planetary science, geology and searching for evidence of life, and collecting samples can make a contribution to this exciting mission. The journey so far. Travelling at speeds of 79,000 kilometres per hour and across approximately 470 million kilometres, it has taken the Perseverance rover nearly eight months to reach its destination. The landing process is always a challenge - more than two thirds of missions sent to Mars have failed in their descent into the planet's thin atmosphere. Perseverance is specially adapted to land successfully, however. On entry, it shed its cruise stage, which includes solar panels, radios and fuel tanks, then used a parachute and rockets to slowly lower itself onto the planet's surface. Its exterior aeroshell protected it from the high temperatures caused by entry into Mars' atmosphere and which caused the outside heatshield to reach temperatures of 1,300\u00b0C. Finally, a 'sky crane' system, similar to that used on the Curiosity rover, ensured that it safely reached the surface. The team back on Earth endured a wait to find out if the landing was successful. It can take up to half an hour to know if all is well. Caroline describes the entry, descent and landing as 'seven minutes of terror' while UKSA Aurora Fellow Keyron Hickman-Lewis refers to this moment as 'seven minutes of anticipation', adding that it is 'decades of work held in a small window of time'. This is a career highlight for engineers and scientists involved, as many have been building up to this mission for their entire careers. Caroline comments that the mission is 'the result of much hard work, over many years by friends and colleagues', a testament to the close bonds forged around the rover. What is the Perseverance doing on Mars? The rover's first few days were spent carrying out safety checks. Its landing was directed near the sedimentary deposits on the delta in the Jezero Crater. Ideally, scientists wanted it near the delta but not too far away or too close. Landing directly onto the Delta makes it harder to see the deposits, while too far away and the mission loses time steering the rover to the correct place. Keyron says the team have had 'operational readiness training' so that they were prepared for any scenario. Perseverance will drill for interesting rock samples that show different features to help understand the geology of Jezero Crater. The team also hope to find rocks containing biosignatures, which are fossilised chemical and textural residues of life that can be found in sedimentary rocks. Caroline hopes that they can be returned to Earth as soon as 2031, saying, 'we are in the best place we've ever been to get Mars samples back from Mars'. This opportunity to collect samples is exciting: the Martian rock samples we have on Earth in the form of meteorites are all igneous rocks. The volcanic nature of igneous rocks makes them unsuitable for preserving traces of life, unlike sedimentary rocks, which are better at retaining fossil traces. How is the Museum helping with research? Physical samples may not return to Earth until 2031, but Perseverance's cameras allow scientists to examine the surface of Mars almost immediately. These images will give them insight into the geological history of Mars and help them to understand whether the planet holds physical or chemical evidence of life. For Keyron, the first image data returned is the most exciting part of the landing. He says, 'At the moment of landing we'll be waiting intently for the images.' Habitability on Mars has similar a timeframe to that on Earth, as during its earliest history, Mars also had liquid water. Scientists hope that by examining fossil evidence through the textures of Martian rocks, they could see whether the planet has ever supported life. Keyron's specialism is Archaean microbial palaeontology and early surface environments and ecosystems. He examines the fragmentary record left by simple organisms found in rocks which date from when there was no oxygen on Earth. The age and state of preservation of these rocks make this a difficult area of study. 'It can sometimes be hard to tell if it even is a fossil,' Keyron says, but his research gives us a framework for studying the rocks. Earth and Mars share a history within the solar system, so if Mars were habitable then it could at one point have had similar conditions as Earth when it comes to harbouring life. The Museum is returning a small sample of one of its own Martian meteorites , Sayh al Uhaymir , to the red planet. This specimen will help the SHERLOC instrument -a tool for exploring Mars which uses spectrometers, a camera and a laser - test that it is working as expected and that the data it collects on Mars is accurate. This meteorite was chosen because it is tough enough to survive the landing.

The panorama shows the rim of the Jezero Crater where the rover touched down last week and the cliff face of an ancient river delta in the distance. It was taken by rotating the rover's mast 360 degrees. The mast is equipped with dual, zoomable cameras which can take high-definition video and images. The photo was stitched together by NASA researchers from 142 images taken by the Mastcam-Z camera on Feb. 21. NASA says the state-of-the-art camera system will help scientists examine the geologic history and atmospheric condition of the crater and identify rocks and sediment from a distance that will be probed by the rover's instruments, before collection for eventual return to Earth. Jezero Crater is an area where scientists hope to find evidence that microbes previously existed on Mars. Mars had water on its surface billions of years ago, a fact that has led to speculation that there may have been some form of life on the planet. \"We're nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,\" said Jim Bell of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. Perseverance traveled through space for nearly seven months after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity were previous missions to Mars. The rover joins NASA's InSight lander, which has been on the Martian surface since 2018, and the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012. Perseverance is expected to study the Mars surface for at least two years as it examines the climate and geology and collects rock and soil samples. On Monday, the U.S. space agency released the first audio from Mars, a faint crackling recording of a gust of wind captured by the rover's microphone. NASA also released a video of the landing of the rover, which is on a mission to search for signs of past life on the red planet.

SuperCam was developed jointly by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico and a consortium of French research laboratories under the auspices of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The instrument delivered data to the French Space Agency's operations center in Toulouse that includes the first audio of laser zaps on another planet. \"It is amazing to see SuperCam working so well on Mars,\" said Roger Wiens, the principal investigator for Perseverance's SuperCam instrument from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. \"When we first dreamed up this instrument eight years ago, we worried that we were being way too ambitious. Now it is up there working like a charm.\" \"The sounds acquired are remarkable quality,\" says Naomi Murdoch, a research scientist and lecturer at the ISAE-SUPAERO aerospace engineering school in Toulouse. \"It's incredible to think that we're going to do science with the first sounds ever recorded on the surface of Mars!\" On March 9, the mission released three SuperCam audio files. Obtained only about 18 hours after landing, when the mast remained stowed on the rover deck, the first file captures the faint sounds of Martian wind. The wind is more audible, especially around the 20-second mark, in the second sound file, recorded on the rover's fourth Martian day, or sol. SuperCam's third file, from Sol 12, includes the zapping sounds of the laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet (3.1 meters). Some zaps sound slightly louder than others, providing information on the physical structure of the targets, such as its relative hardness. \"I want to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to our international partners at CNES and the SuperCam team for being a part of this momentous journey with us,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"SuperCam truly gives our rover eyes to see promising rock samples and ears to hear what it sounds like when the lasers strike them. This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity.\" The SuperCam team also received excellent first datasets from the instrument's visible and infrared (VISIR) sensor as well as its Raman spectrometer. VISIR collects light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This technique complements the Raman spectrometer, which uses a green laser beam to excite the chemical bonds in a sample to produce a signal depending on what elements are bonded together, in turn providing insights into a rock's mineral composition. \"This is the first time an instrument has used Raman spectroscopy anywhere other than on Earth!\" said Olivier Beyssac, CNRS research director at the Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie in Paris. \"Raman spectroscopy is going to play a crucial role in characterizing minerals to gain deeper insight into the geological conditions under which they formed and to detect potential organic and mineral molecules that might have been formed by living organisms.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8885/perseverance-rovers-supercam-science-instrument-delivers-first-results/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover Produces Oxygen on Another Planet for the First Time", "date": "2021-04-25", "content": "NASA's Perseverance rover has been marking milestones on Mars since landing on the Red Planet in February. Its latest historic accomplishment is the first creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide in the thin Mars atmosphere . Mission time is measured in sols, or Martian days. Oxygen production was achieved early in the evening of April 20, or early morning on Sol 60 in Jezero Crater. MOXIE, a small, gold box-shaped instrument on the rover, successfully demonstrated a solid oxide electrolysis technology for converting the Martian atmosphere to oxygen. The atmosphere on Mars is about 95% carbon dioxide. MOXIE's first oxygen run produced 5.4 grams of oxygen in an hour. The power supply limits potential production to 12 g/hr - about the same amount that a large tree would produce. For both rockets and astronauts, oxygen is crucial, says MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of MIT Haystack Observatory. \"To burn its fuel, a rocket must have many times more oxygen by weight. To get four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require 15,000 pounds of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds of oxygen.\" In contrast, Hecht says, \"The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them to breathe.\" The oxygen production process starts with carbon dioxide intake; inside MOXIE, the Martian CO2 is compressed and filtered to remove any contaminants. It is then heated, which causes separation into oxygen and carbon monoxide. The oxygen is further isolated by a hot, charged ceramic component; the oxygen ions merge into O2. Carbon monoxide is expelled harmlessly back into the atmosphere. The MOXIE teams will next analyze the purity of the oxygen; preliminary indications are that once the background CO2 was flushed out by the flowing oxygen, the resulting product was nearly 100% pure oxygen. Serving as a proof of concept, MOXIE has paved the way for possible future Mars missions to produce oxygen, which will be needed for rocket propulsion on return trips for crewed missions. \"The first run of MOXIE is a step in the right direction to bring us closer to the possibility of human missions to Mars,\" says Jeffrey Hoffman, a professor of the practice in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who is the deputy principal investigator the project. \"The technology that evolves from what we have been able to do here will be the grandchildren descended from the success of our MOXIE instrument.\" MOXIE is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. It is a joint venture between NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , MIT Haystack Observatory, and MIT's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Future scientists will use these carefully selected representatives of Martian rock and regolith to look for evidence of potential microbial life present in Mars' ancient past and to answer other key questions about Mars and its history. Perseverance will land at Mars' Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. About the size and shape of a standard lab test tube, the 43 sample tubes headed to Mars must be lightweight and hardy enough to survive the demands of the round trip, and so clean that future scientists will be confident that what they're analyzing is 100% Mars. \"Compared to Mars, Earth is filled with evidence of the life that covers our planet,\" said Ken Farley, the Mars 2020 project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"We needed to remove those signs so thoroughly that any scant evidence remaining can be confidently detected and differentiated when these first samples are returned.\" The practice of engineering containers to ferry samples from other worlds goes back to Apollo 11. When Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin returned to Earth with 47.7 pounds of samples from the Moon's Sea of Tranquility in 1969, they carried them in two triple-sealed, briefcase- size aluminum boxes. But Apollo's rock boxes needed to keep their cargo pristine only for about 10 days - from the lunar surface to splashdown - before being whisked off to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. Perseverance's sample tubes must isolate and preserve the scientific value of their contents for well over 10 years. Mars Sample Return. As NASA's newest rover investigates Jezero Crater , mission scientists will determine when and where it will drill for samples. This precious Martian cargo will be packaged in those tubes with the most intricate and technologically advanced mechanism ever sent into space: the Sample Caching System . After the samples have been deposited on the Martian surface, two other missions being formulated by NASA in partnership with ESA will complete the relay to get them back to Earth. The second mission in this sample return campaign will send a \"fetch\" rover to retrieve the hermetically-sealed tubes and deliver them to a special sample return container inside the Mars Ascent Vehicle. The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover could also deliver tubes with samples to the vicinity of the Mars Ascent Vehicle if it remains healthy well into an extended mission. The Mars Ascent Vehicle will then launch the tubes into orbit. The final mission will fly an orbiter to Mars to rendezvous with the encapsulated samples, capture them in a highly secure containment capsule, and ferry them back to Earth . Robust Containers. Made chiefly of titanium, each sample tube weighs less than 2 ounces . A white exterior coating guards against heating by the Sun potentially changing the chemical composition of the samples after Perseverance deposits the tubes on the surface of Mars. Laser-etched serial numbers on the exterior will help the team identify the tubes and their contents. Each tube must fit within the tight tolerances not only of Perseverance's Sample Caching System, but those of the future missions. \"They are less than 6 inches 15.2 centimeters long, but we still found over 60 different dimensions to scrutinize,\" said Sample Tube Cognizant Engineer Pavlina Karafillis of JPL. \"Because of the intricacies of all the complex mechanisms they will pass through during the Mars Sample Return campaign, if any measurement was off by about the thickness of a human hair, the tube was deemed not suitable for flight.\" 100% Pure Jezero. Precision engineering is only part of the challenge. The tubes are also the product of extreme cleanliness standards. All of NASA's planetary missions involve exacting processes to prevent the introduction of Earthly organic, inorganic, and biological material. But since these tubes could hold proof that life once existed elsewhere in the universe, the Mars 2020 team needed to reduce - even further - the possibility that they could host Earthly artifacts that could complicate the scientific process. The mandate was essentially that nothing should be in a tube until the Sample Caching System begins filling it with 9 cubic inches of Jezero Crater . \"And when they said 'nothing,' they meant it,\" said Ian Clark, the mission's assistant project systems engineer for sample tube cleanliness at JPL. \"An example: To achieve the kind of science the mission is going after, we needed to limit the total amount of Earth-based organic compounds in a given sample to less than 150 nanograms. For a set of particular organic compounds - ones that are very indicative of life - we were limited to less than 15 nanograms in a sample.\" A nanogram is a billionth of a gram. An average thumbprint carries about 45,000 nanograms of organics - about 300 times the total allowed in a sample tube. To meet such stringent mission specifications, the team had to rewrite the book on cleaning. \"We did all our assembly in a hyper-clean-room environment, which is essentially a clean room inside a clean room,\" said Clark. \"Between assembly steps, the sample tubes would be cleaned with filtered air blasts, rinsed with deionized water, and sonically cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and other exotic cleaning agents.\" After each cleaning, the team would measure contaminants and bake the tubes for good measure. By the time the 43 sample tubes were selected from a field of 93 fabricated for flight, each had generated over 250 pages of documentation and 3 gigabytes of images and videos. Of the tubes aboard Perseverance, up to 38 are destined to be filled with Martian rock and regolith. The other five are \"witness tubes\" that have been loaded with materials geared to capture molecular and particulate contaminants. They'll be opened one at a time on Mars to witness the ambient environment primarily near sample collection sites, cataloging any Earthly impurities or contaminants from the spacecraft that may be present during sample collection. The the sample and witness tubes' eventual return to and examination on Earth will allow the full breadth of terrestrial science laboratory capabilities to investigate the samples, using instruments too large and complex to send to Mars.

Once at the top of the Red Planet's atmosphere, an action-packed seven minutes of descent awaits - complete with temperatures equivalent to the surface of the Sun, a supersonic parachute inflation, and the first ever autonomous guided landing on Mars. Only then can the rover search Jezero Crater for signs of ancient life and collect samples that will eventually be returned to Earth. \"NASA has been exploring Mars since Mariner 4 performed a flyby in July of 1965, with two more flybys, seven successful orbiters, and eight landers since then,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington,\" said in a statement. \"Perseverance, which was built from the collective knowledge gleaned from such trailblazers, has the opportunity to not only expand our knowledge of the Red Planet, but to investigate one of the most important and exciting questions of humanity about the origin of life both on Earth and also on other planets.\" Jezero Crater is believed to be the perfect place to search for signs of ancient microbial life.

How is the Museum helping with research? Physical samples may not return to Earth until 2031, but Perseverance's cameras allow scientists to examine the surface of Mars almost immediately. These images will give them insight into the geological history of Mars and help them to understand whether the planet holds physical or chemical evidence of life. For Keyron, the first image data returned is the most exciting part of the landing. He says, 'At the moment of landing we'll be waiting intently for the images.' Habitability on Mars has similar a timeframe to that on Earth, as during its earliest history, Mars also had liquid water. Scientists hope that by examining fossil evidence through the textures of Martian rocks, they could see whether the planet has ever supported life. Keyron's specialism is Archaean microbial palaeontology and early surface environments and ecosystems. He examines the fragmentary record left by simple organisms found in rocks which date from when there was no oxygen on Earth. The age and state of preservation of these rocks make this a difficult area of study. 'It can sometimes be hard to tell if it even is a fossil,' Keyron says, but his research gives us a framework for studying the rocks. Earth and Mars share a history within the solar system, so if Mars were habitable then it could at one point have had similar conditions as Earth when it comes to harbouring life. The Museum is returning a small sample of one of its own Martian meteorites , Sayh al Uhaymir , to the red planet. This specimen will help the SHERLOC instrument -a tool for exploring Mars which uses spectrometers, a camera and a laser - test that it is working as expected and that the data it collects on Mars is accurate. This meteorite was chosen because it is tough enough to survive the landing.

Its latest historic accomplishment is the first creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide in the thin Mars atmosphere . Mission time is measured in sols, or Martian days. Oxygen production was achieved early in the evening of April 20, or early morning on Sol 60 in Jezero Crater. MOXIE, a small, gold box-shaped instrument on the rover, successfully demonstrated a solid oxide electrolysis technology for converting the Martian atmosphere to oxygen. The atmosphere on Mars is about 95% carbon dioxide. MOXIE's first oxygen run produced 5.4 grams of oxygen in an hour. The power supply limits potential production to 12 g/hr - about the same amount that a large tree would produce. For both rockets and astronauts, oxygen is crucial, says MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of MIT Haystack Observatory. \"To burn its fuel, a rocket must have many times more oxygen by weight. To get four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require 15,000 pounds of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds of oxygen.\" In contrast, Hecht says, \"The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them to breathe.\" The oxygen production process starts with carbon dioxide intake; inside MOXIE, the Martian CO2 is compressed and filtered to remove any contaminants.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover used one of its two microphones to listen as the Ingenuity helicopter flew for the fourth time on April 30, 2021. A new video combines footage of the solar-powered helicopter taken by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z imager with audio from a microphone belonging to the rover's SuperCam laser instrument. The laser zaps rocks from a distance, studying their vapor with a spectrometer to reveal their chemical composition. The instrument's microphone records the sounds of those laser strikes, which provide information on the physical properties of the targets, such as their relative hardness. The microphone can also record ambient noise, like the Martian wind. With Perseverance parked 262 feet from the helicopter's takeoff and landing spot, the rover mission wasn't sure if the microphone would pick up any sound of the flight. Even during flight, when the helicopter's blades spin at 2,537 rpm, the sound is greatly muffled by the thin Martian atmosphere. It is further obscured by Martian wind gusts during the initial moments of the flight. Listen closely, though, and the helicopter's hum can be heard faintly above the sound of those winds. \"This is a very good surprise,\" said David Mimoun, a professor of planetary science at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace in Toulouse, France, and science lead for the SuperCam Mars microphone. \"We had carried out tests and simulations that told us the microphone would barely pick up the sounds of the helicopter, as the Mars atmosphere damps the sound propagation strongly. We have been lucky to register the helicopter at such a distance. This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.\" Scientists made the audio, which is recorded in mono, easier to hear by isolating the 84 hertz helicopter blade sound, reducing the frequencies below 80 hertz and above 90 hertz, and increasing the volume of the remaining signal. Some frequencies were clipped to bring out the helicopter's hum, which is loudest when the helicopter passes through the field of view of the camera. \"This is an example of how the different payload instrument suites complement each other, resulting in information synergy,\" said Soren Madsen, Perseverance payload development manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. JPL built Perseverance as well as Ingenuity and operates both of them. \"In this particular case, the microphone and video let us observe the helicopter as if we are there, and additional information, such as the Doppler shift, confirms details of the flight path.\" SuperCam is led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's body unit was developed. That part of the instrument includes several spectrometers, control electronics, and software.

Once at the top of the Red Planet's atmosphere, an action-packed seven minutes of descent awaits - complete with temperatures equivalent to the surface of the Sun, a supersonic parachute inflation, and the first ever autonomous guided landing on Mars. Only then can the rover search Jezero Crater for signs of ancient life and collect samples that will eventually be returned to Earth. \"NASA has been exploring Mars since Mariner 4 performed a flyby in July of 1965, with two more flybys, seven successful orbiters, and eight landers since then,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington,\" said in a statement. \"Perseverance, which was built from the collective knowledge gleaned from such trailblazers, has the opportunity to not only expand our knowledge of the Red Planet, but to investigate one of the most important and exciting questions of humanity about the origin of life both on Earth and also on other planets.\" Jezero Crater is believed to be the perfect place to search for signs of ancient microbial life. Billions of years ago, the now-bone-dry 45-kilometre-wide basin was home to an actively-forming river delta and lake filled with water.

In order to communicate with Earth from its landing site in Jezero Crater, the rover will rely on spacecraft orbiting Mars to relay the images and other data it collects back to Earth and pass on the commands from engineers beamed across space in the other direction. The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is one of these spacecraft. As its orbit takes it over the landing site, TGO will enter communication windows with Perseverance and relay data between Earth and the rover via a network of deep space ground stations on Earth, including ESA's Estrack network. Helping Perseverance phone home. The data transmitted by Perseverance in its first hours and days on Mars will be vital to the mission. Did the rover land safely? Are all of its systems functional? To ensure that this information gets to the engineers on Earth as quickly as possible, TGO and NASA's Mars orbiters will be able to communicate with deep space ground stations on Earth almost twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the first two weeks after landing. ESA's ground station network will provide roughly 14 hours a day of this 'low-latency' coverage. \"TGO will provide low-latency data relay support to Perseverance during this period, and continue to provide routine relay support afterwards,\" says ESA's Peter Schmitz, TGO Spacecraft Operations Manager. \"Our first relay session with TGO will start at 02:07 CET on 19 February, just four hours after landing.\" The Trace Gas Orbiter is the first of two missions of the ExoMars program - a joint endeavor between ESA and Roscosmos. ExoMars is attempting to determine whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016 and is conducting a detailed study of the atmosphere and mapping signatures of water below the planet's surface. The orbiter is operated from ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, where mission controllers already have a lot of experience relaying data from existing Mars landers. \"The orbiter usually supports one relay session per lander per day, but from February 18, we will be supporting an additional two sessions per day for Perseverance,\" says Schmitz. \"From then on, TGO will relay twice the volume of data to and from the surface of Mars as it does now.\" In total, Perseverance will communicate with NASA or ESA Mars orbiters at least twice a day, and typically four to six times. During these sessions, data and images will be sent to NASA to help the operations team plan the rover's activities for the following days. Monitoring conditions at Jezero. Mars Express is Europe's first mission to the Red Planet. Since beginning operations in 2004, the durable orbiter has helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water, and potential for life on Mars.

The spacecraft's Visual Monitoring Camera - also known as the 'Mars Webcam' - is providing additional wide context views of the landing region. The Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer is monitoring local conditions at Jezero Crater. The information it collects is passed on to the Perseverance Entry, Descent and Landing team at NASA and is included in their daily report during the two weeks leading up to the landing. \"The engineers working with EDL systems need precise information on the density of the Martian atmosphere above the site at the time of landing and how it changes with altitude,\" says Marco Giuranna, PFS Principal Investigator from Istituto Fisica Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy. \"Having up-to-date knowledge of the temperature, pressure, dust and ice conditions in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding its density and predicting and analyzing the trajectory of the rover's descent to the surface of the Red Planet.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-is-about-to-land-on-the-red-planet-it-will-have-some-help-from-these-mars-orbiters/"}, {"title": "Mars 2020: Perseverance rover has landed", "date": "2021-02-18", "content": "The Mars 2020 rover landed near the Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. After eight months hurtling through space, the Mars Perseverance rover has successfully landed and begun its mission. This is NASA's first major return to Mars since the Curiosity rover landed in 2011. Prof Caroline Smith, Head of Collections for Earth Sciences at the Museum, has been working on the mission. She describes how the Museum's expertise in planetary science, geology and searching for evidence of life, and collecting samples can make a contribution to this exciting mission. The journey so far. Travelling at speeds of 79,000 kilometres per hour and across approximately 470 million kilometres, it has taken the Perseverance rover nearly eight months to reach its destination. The landing process is always a challenge - more than two thirds of missions sent to Mars have failed in their descent into the planet's thin atmosphere. Perseverance is specially adapted to land successfully, however. On entry, it shed its cruise stage, which includes solar panels, radios and fuel tanks, then used a parachute and rockets to slowly lower itself onto the planet's surface. Its exterior aeroshell protected it from the high temperatures caused by entry into Mars' atmosphere and which caused the outside heatshield to reach temperatures of 1,300\u00b0C. Finally, a 'sky crane' system, similar to that used on the Curiosity rover, ensured that it safely reached the surface. The team back on Earth endured a wait to find out if the landing was successful. It can take up to half an hour to know if all is well. Caroline describes the entry, descent and landing as 'seven minutes of terror' while UKSA Aurora Fellow Keyron Hickman-Lewis refers to this moment as 'seven minutes of anticipation', adding that it is 'decades of work held in a small window of time'. This is a career highlight for engineers and scientists involved, as many have been building up to this mission for their entire careers. Caroline comments that the mission is 'the result of much hard work, over many years by friends and colleagues', a testament to the close bonds forged around the rover. What is the Perseverance doing on Mars? The rover's first few days were spent carrying out safety checks. Its landing was directed near the sedimentary deposits on the delta in the Jezero Crater. Ideally, scientists wanted it near the delta but not too far away or too close. Landing directly onto the Delta makes it harder to see the deposits, while too far away and the mission loses time steering the rover to the correct place. Keyron says the team have had 'operational readiness training' so that they were prepared for any scenario. Perseverance will drill for interesting rock samples that show different features to help understand the geology of Jezero Crater. The team also hope to find rocks containing biosignatures, which are fossilised chemical and textural residues of life that can be found in sedimentary rocks. Caroline hopes that they can be returned to Earth as soon as 2031, saying, 'we are in the best place we've ever been to get Mars samples back from Mars'. This opportunity to collect samples is exciting: the Martian rock samples we have on Earth in the form of meteorites are all igneous rocks. The volcanic nature of igneous rocks makes them unsuitable for preserving traces of life, unlike sedimentary rocks, which are better at retaining fossil traces.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover used one of its two microphones to listen as the Ingenuity helicopter flew for the fourth time on April 30, 2021. A new video combines footage of the solar-powered helicopter taken by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z imager with audio from a microphone belonging to the rover's SuperCam laser instrument. The laser zaps rocks from a distance, studying their vapor with a spectrometer to reveal their chemical composition. The instrument's microphone records the sounds of those laser strikes, which provide information on the physical properties of the targets, such as their relative hardness. The microphone can also record ambient noise, like the Martian wind. With Perseverance parked 262 feet from the helicopter's takeoff and landing spot, the rover mission wasn't sure if the microphone would pick up any sound of the flight. Even during flight, when the helicopter's blades spin at 2,537 rpm, the sound is greatly muffled by the thin Martian atmosphere. It is further obscured by Martian wind gusts during the initial moments of the flight. Listen closely, though, and the helicopter's hum can be heard faintly above the sound of those winds. \"This is a very good surprise,\" said David Mimoun, a professor of planetary science at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace in Toulouse, France, and science lead for the SuperCam Mars microphone. \"We had carried out tests and simulations that told us the microphone would barely pick up the sounds of the helicopter, as the Mars atmosphere damps the sound propagation strongly. We have been lucky to register the helicopter at such a distance. This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.\" Scientists made the audio, which is recorded in mono, easier to hear by isolating the 84 hertz helicopter blade sound, reducing the frequencies below 80 hertz and above 90 hertz, and increasing the volume of the remaining signal. Some frequencies were clipped to bring out the helicopter's hum, which is loudest when the helicopter passes through the field of view of the camera. \"This is an example of how the different payload instrument suites complement each other, resulting in information synergy,\" said Soren Madsen, Perseverance payload development manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. JPL built Perseverance as well as Ingenuity and operates both of them. \"In this particular case, the microphone and video let us observe the helicopter as if we are there, and additional information, such as the Doppler shift, confirms details of the flight path.\" SuperCam is led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's body unit was developed.

In order to communicate with Earth from its landing site in Jezero Crater, the rover will rely on spacecraft orbiting Mars to relay the images and other data it collects back to Earth and pass on the commands from engineers beamed across space in the other direction. The ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is one of these spacecraft. As its orbit takes it over the landing site, TGO will enter communication windows with Perseverance and relay data between Earth and the rover via a network of deep space ground stations on Earth, including ESA's Estrack network. Helping Perseverance phone home. The data transmitted by Perseverance in its first hours and days on Mars will be vital to the mission. Did the rover land safely? Are all of its systems functional? To ensure that this information gets to the engineers on Earth as quickly as possible, TGO and NASA's Mars orbiters will be able to communicate with deep space ground stations on Earth almost twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for the first two weeks after landing. ESA's ground station network will provide roughly 14 hours a day of this 'low-latency' coverage. \"TGO will provide low-latency data relay support to Perseverance during this period, and continue to provide routine relay support afterwards,\" says ESA's Peter Schmitz, TGO Spacecraft Operations Manager. \"Our first relay session with TGO will start at 02:07 CET on 19 February, just four hours after landing.\" The Trace Gas Orbiter is the first of two missions of the ExoMars program - a joint endeavor between ESA and Roscosmos. ExoMars is attempting to determine whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. TGO arrived at Mars in October 2016 and is conducting a detailed study of the atmosphere and mapping signatures of water below the planet's surface. The orbiter is operated from ESA's European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, where mission controllers already have a lot of experience relaying data from existing Mars landers. \"The orbiter usually supports one relay session per lander per day, but from February 18, we will be supporting an additional two sessions per day for Perseverance,\" says Schmitz. \"From then on, TGO will relay twice the volume of data to and from the surface of Mars as it does now.\" In total, Perseverance will communicate with NASA or ESA Mars orbiters at least twice a day, and typically four to six times. During these sessions, data and images will be sent to NASA to help the operations team plan the rover's activities for the following days. Monitoring conditions at Jezero. Mars Express is Europe's first mission to the Red Planet. Since beginning operations in 2004, the durable orbiter has helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water, and potential for life on Mars. The high-resolution camera on board Mars Express has sent back thousands of dramatic, 3D views of the martian surface, including those used to produce a virtual flight over Jezero Crater , the planned landing site for Perseverance. The spacecraft's Visual Monitoring Camera - also known as the 'Mars Webcam' - is providing additional wide context views of the landing region. The Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer is monitoring local conditions at Jezero Crater. The information it collects is passed on to the Perseverance Entry, Descent and Landing team at NASA and is included in their daily report during the two weeks leading up to the landing. \"The engineers working with EDL systems need precise information on the density of the Martian atmosphere above the site at the time of landing and how it changes with altitude,\" says Marco Giuranna, PFS Principal Investigator from Istituto Fisica Spazio Interplanetario in Rome, Italy. \"Having up-to-date knowledge of the temperature, pressure, dust and ice conditions in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding its density and predicting and analyzing the trajectory of the rover's descent to the surface of the Red Planet.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-is-about-to-land-on-the-red-planet-it-will-have-some-help-from-these-mars-orbiters/"}, {"title": "Mars 2020: Perseverance rover has landed", "date": "2021-02-18", "content": "The Mars 2020 rover landed near the Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. After eight months hurtling through space, the Mars Perseverance rover has successfully landed and begun its mission. This is NASA's first major return to Mars since the Curiosity rover landed in 2011. Prof Caroline Smith, Head of Collections for Earth Sciences at the Museum, has been working on the mission. She describes how the Museum's expertise in planetary science, geology and searching for evidence of life, and collecting samples can make a contribution to this exciting mission. The journey so far. Travelling at speeds of 79,000 kilometres per hour and across approximately 470 million kilometres, it has taken the Perseverance rover nearly eight months to reach its destination. The landing process is always a challenge - more than two thirds of missions sent to Mars have failed in their descent into the planet's thin atmosphere. Perseverance is specially adapted to land successfully, however. On entry, it shed its cruise stage, which includes solar panels, radios and fuel tanks, then used a parachute and rockets to slowly lower itself onto the planet's surface. Its exterior aeroshell protected it from the high temperatures caused by entry into Mars' atmosphere and which caused the outside heatshield to reach temperatures of 1,300\u00b0C. Finally, a 'sky crane' system, similar to that used on the Curiosity rover, ensured that it safely reached the surface. The team back on Earth endured a wait to find out if the landing was successful. It can take up to half an hour to know if all is well. Caroline describes the entry, descent and landing as 'seven minutes of terror' while UKSA Aurora Fellow Keyron Hickman-Lewis refers to this moment as 'seven minutes of anticipation', adding that it is 'decades of work held in a small window of time'. This is a career highlight for engineers and scientists involved, as many have been building up to this mission for their entire careers. Caroline comments that the mission is 'the result of much hard work, over many years by friends and colleagues', a testament to the close bonds forged around the rover. What is the Perseverance doing on Mars? The rover's first few days were spent carrying out safety checks. Its landing was directed near the sedimentary deposits on the delta in the Jezero Crater. Ideally, scientists wanted it near the delta but not too far away or too close. Landing directly onto the Delta makes it harder to see the deposits, while too far away and the mission loses time steering the rover to the correct place. Keyron says the team have had 'operational readiness training' so that they were prepared for any scenario. Perseverance will drill for interesting rock samples that show different features to help understand the geology of Jezero Crater. The team also hope to find rocks containing biosignatures, which are fossilised chemical and textural residues of life that can be found in sedimentary rocks. Caroline hopes that they can be returned to Earth as soon as 2031, saying, 'we are in the best place we've ever been to get Mars samples back from Mars'. This opportunity to collect samples is exciting: the Martian rock samples we have on Earth in the form of meteorites are all igneous rocks. The volcanic nature of igneous rocks makes them unsuitable for preserving traces of life, unlike sedimentary rocks, which are better at retaining fossil traces. How is the Museum helping with research? Physical samples may not return to Earth until 2031, but Perseverance's cameras allow scientists to examine the surface of Mars almost immediately. These images will give them insight into the geological history of Mars and help them to understand whether the planet holds physical or chemical evidence of life. For Keyron, the first image data returned is the most exciting part of the landing. He says, 'At the moment of landing we'll be waiting intently for the images.' Habitability on Mars has similar a timeframe to that on Earth, as during its earliest history, Mars also had liquid water. Scientists hope that by examining fossil evidence through the textures of Martian rocks, they could see whether the planet has ever supported life. Keyron's specialism is Archaean microbial palaeontology and early surface environments and ecosystems. He examines the fragmentary record left by simple organisms found in rocks which date from when there was no oxygen on Earth. The age and state of preservation of these rocks make this a difficult area of study. 'It can sometimes be hard to tell if it even is a fossil,' Keyron says, but his research gives us a framework for studying the rocks. Earth and Mars share a history within the solar system, so if Mars were habitable then it could at one point have had similar conditions as Earth when it comes to harbouring life. The Museum is returning a small sample of one of its own Martian meteorites , Sayh al Uhaymir , to the red planet. This specimen will help the SHERLOC instrument -a tool for exploring Mars which uses spectrometers, a camera and a laser - test that it is working as expected and that the data it collects on Mars is accurate. This meteorite was chosen because it is tough enough to survive the landing.

The panorama shows the rim of the Jezero Crater where the rover touched down last week and the cliff face of an ancient river delta in the distance. It was taken by rotating the rover's mast 360 degrees. The mast is equipped with dual, zoomable cameras which can take high-definition video and images. The photo was stitched together by NASA researchers from 142 images taken by the Mastcam-Z camera on Feb. 21. NASA says the state-of-the-art camera system will help scientists examine the geologic history and atmospheric condition of the crater and identify rocks and sediment from a distance that will be probed by the rover's instruments, before collection for eventual return to Earth. Jezero Crater is an area where scientists hope to find evidence that microbes previously existed on Mars. Mars had water on its surface billions of years ago, a fact that has led to speculation that there may have been some form of life on the planet. \"We're nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,\" said Jim Bell of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. Perseverance traveled through space for nearly seven months after launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity were previous missions to Mars. The rover joins NASA's InSight lander, which has been on the Martian surface since 2018, and the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012. Perseverance is expected to study the Mars surface for at least two years as it examines the climate and geology and collects rock and soil samples. On Monday, the U.S. space agency released the first audio from Mars, a faint crackling recording of a gust of wind captured by the rover's microphone. NASA also released a video of the landing of the rover, which is on a mission to search for signs of past life on the red planet.

Obtained only about 18 hours after landing, when the mast remained stowed on the rover deck, the first file captures the faint sounds of Martian wind. The wind is more audible, especially around the 20-second mark, in the second sound file, recorded on the rover's fourth Martian day, or sol. SuperCam's third file, from Sol 12, includes the zapping sounds of the laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet (3.1 meters). Some zaps sound slightly louder than others, providing information on the physical structure of the targets, such as its relative hardness. \"I want to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to our international partners at CNES and the SuperCam team for being a part of this momentous journey with us,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"SuperCam truly gives our rover eyes to see promising rock samples and ears to hear what it sounds like when the lasers strike them. This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity.\" The SuperCam team also received excellent first datasets from the instrument's visible and infrared (VISIR) sensor as well as its Raman spectrometer. VISIR collects light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This technique complements the Raman spectrometer, which uses a green laser beam to excite the chemical bonds in a sample to produce a signal depending on what elements are bonded together, in turn providing insights into a rock's mineral composition. \"This is the first time an instrument has used Raman spectroscopy anywhere other than on Earth!\" said Olivier Beyssac, CNRS research director at the Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie in Paris. \"Raman spectroscopy is going to play a crucial role in characterizing minerals to gain deeper insight into the geological conditions under which they formed and to detect potential organic and mineral molecules that might have been formed by living organisms.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8885/perseverance-rovers-supercam-science-instrument-delivers-first-results/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover Produces Oxygen on Another Planet for the First Time", "date": "2021-04-25", "content": "NASA's Perseverance rover has been marking milestones on Mars since landing on the Red Planet in February. Its latest historic accomplishment is the first creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide in the thin Mars atmosphere . Mission time is measured in sols, or Martian days. Oxygen production was achieved early in the evening of April 20, or early morning on Sol 60 in Jezero Crater. MOXIE, a small, gold box-shaped instrument on the rover, successfully demonstrated a solid oxide electrolysis technology for converting the Martian atmosphere to oxygen. The atmosphere on Mars is about 95% carbon dioxide. MOXIE's first oxygen run produced 5.4 grams of oxygen in an hour. The power supply limits potential production to 12 g/hr - about the same amount that a large tree would produce. For both rockets and astronauts, oxygen is crucial, says MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of MIT Haystack Observatory. \"To burn its fuel, a rocket must have many times more oxygen by weight. To get four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require 15,000 pounds of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds of oxygen.\" In contrast, Hecht says, \"The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them to breathe.\" The oxygen production process starts with carbon dioxide intake; inside MOXIE, the Martian CO2 is compressed and filtered to remove any contaminants. It is then heated, which causes separation into oxygen and carbon monoxide. The oxygen is further isolated by a hot, charged ceramic component; the oxygen ions merge into O2. Carbon monoxide is expelled harmlessly back into the atmosphere. The MOXIE teams will next analyze the purity of the oxygen; preliminary indications are that once the background CO2 was flushed out by the flowing oxygen, the resulting product was nearly 100% pure oxygen. Serving as a proof of concept, MOXIE has paved the way for possible future Mars missions to produce oxygen, which will be needed for rocket propulsion on return trips for crewed missions. \"The first run of MOXIE is a step in the right direction to bring us closer to the possibility of human missions to Mars,\" says Jeffrey Hoffman, a professor of the practice in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who is the deputy principal investigator the project. \"The technology that evolves from what we have been able to do here will be the grandchildren descended from the success of our MOXIE instrument.\" MOXIE is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.

Ingenuity provided new insight into where different rock layers begin and end, each layer serving as a time capsule for how conditions in the ancient climate changed at this location. The flight also revealed obstacles the rover may have to drive around as it explores Jezero Crater. During the flight - designed to test the helicopter's ability to serve as an aerial scout - Ingenuity soared over a dune field nicknamed \"S\u00e9\u00edtah.\" Perseverance is making a detour south around those dunes , which would be too risky for the six-wheeled rover to try crossing. The color images from Ingenuity, taken from a height of around 33 feet , offer the rover team much greater detail than they get from the orbiter images they typically use for route planning. While a camera like HiRISE aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can resolve rocks about 3 feet in diameter, missions usually rely on rover images to see smaller rocks or terrain features. \"Once a rover gets close enough to a location, we get ground-scale images that we can compare to orbital images,\" said Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"With Ingenuity, we now have this intermediate-scale imagery that nicely fills the gap in resolution.\" Below are a few of Ingenuity's images, which completed the long journey back to Earth on July 8. Raised Ridges. Ingenuity offered a high- resolution glimpse of rock features nicknamed \"Raised Ridges.\" They belong to a fracture system, which often serve as pathways for fluid to flow underground. Here in Jezero Crater, a lake existed billions of years ago. Spying the ridges in images from Mars orbiters, scientists have wondered whether water might have flowed through these fractures at some point, dissolving minerals that could help feed ancient microbial colonies. That would make them a prime location to look for signs of ancient life - and perhaps to drill a sample. The samples Perseverance takes will eventually be deposited on Mars for a future mission that would take them to Earth for in-depth analysis. \"Our current plan is to visit Raised Ridges and investigate it close up,\" Williford said. \"The helicopter's images are by far better in resolution than the orbital ones we were using. Studying these will allow us to ensure that visiting these ridges is important to the team.\" Sand dunes like the ones in this image keep rover drivers like JPL's Olivier Toupet awake at night: Knee- or waist-high, they could easily cause the two- ton rover to get stuck. After landing in February, Perseverance scientists asked whether it was possible to make a beeline across this terrain; Toupet's answer was a hard no. \"Sand is a big concern,\" said Toupet, who leads the team of mobility experts that plans Perseverance's drives. \"If we drive downhill into a dune, we could embed ourselves into it and not be able to get back out.\" Toupet is also the lead for Perseverance's newly tested AutoNav feature , which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to drive the rover autonomously over greater distances than could be achieved otherwise. While good at avoiding rocks and other hazards, AutoNav can't detect sand, so human drivers still need to define \"keep-out zones\" around areas that could entrap the rover. Without Ingenuity, visible in silhouette at the bottom of this next image, Perseverance's scientists would never get to see this section of S\u00e9\u00edtah so clearly: It's too sandy for Perseverance to visit. The unique view offers enough detail to inspect these rocks and get a better understanding of this area of Jezero Crater. As the rover works its way around the dune field, it may make what the team calls a \"toe dip\" into some scientifically compelling spots with interesting bedrock. While Toupet and his team wouldn't attempt a toe dip here, the recent images from Ingenuity will allow them to plan potential toe-dip paths in other regions along the route of Perseverance's first science campaign . \"The helicopter is an extremely valuable asset for rover planning because it provides high-resolution imagery of the terrain we want to drive through,\" said Toupet. \"We can better assess the size of the dunes and where bedrock is poking out. That's great information for us; it helps identify which areas may be traversable by the rover and whether certain high-value science targets are reachable.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-helicopter-spots-intriguing-terrain-for-perseverance-rover-to-explore/"}, {"title": "Signs of Life on Mars? NASA's Perseverance Rover Begins the Hunt", "date": "2021-07-20", "content": "After testing a bristling array of instruments on its robotic arm, NASA's latest Mars rover gets down to business: probing rocks and dust for evidence of past life. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover has begun its search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet. Flexing its 7-foot (2-meter) mechanical arm, the rover is testing the sensitive detectors it carries, capturing their first science readings. Along with analyzing rocks using X-rays and ultraviolet light, the six-wheeled scientist will zoom in for closeups of tiny segments of rock surfaces that might show evidence of past microbial activity. Called PIXL, or Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, the rover's X-ray instrument delivered unexpectedly strong science results while it was still being tested, said Abigail Allwood, PIXL's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Located at the end of the arm, the lunchbox-size instrument fired its X-rays at a small calibration target - used to test instrument settings - aboard Perseverance and was able to determine the composition of Martian dust clinging to the target. \"We got our best-ever composition analysis of Martian dust before it even looked at rock,\" Allwood said. That's just a small taste of what PIXL, combined with the arm's other instruments, is expected to reveal as it zeroes in on promising geological features over the weeks and months ahead. Scientists say Jezero Crater was a crater lake billions of years ago, making it a choice landing site for Perseverance. The crater has long since dried out, and the rover is now picking its way across its red, broken floor. \"If life was there in Jezero Crater, the evidence of that life could be there,\" said Allwood, a key member of the Perseverance \"arm science\" team. To get a detailed profile of rock textures, contours, and composition, PIXL's maps of the chemicals throughout a rock can be combined with mineral maps produced by the SHERLOC instrument and its partner, WATSON. SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals - uses an ultraviolet laser to identify some of the minerals in the rock, while WATSON takes closeup images that scientists can use to determine grain size, roundness, and texture, all of which can help determine how the rock was formed. Early WATSON closeups have already yielded a trove of data from Martian rocks, the scientists said, such as a variety of colors, sizes of grains in the sediment, and even the presence of \"cement\" between the grains. Such details can provide important clues about formation history, water flow, and ancient, potentially habitable Martian environments. And combined with those from PIXL, they can provide a broader environmental and even historical snapshot of Jezero Crater. \"What is the crater floor made out of? What were the conditions like on the crater floor?\" asks Luther Beegle of JPL, SHERLOC's principal investigator. \"That does tell us a lot about the early days of Mars, and potentially how Mars formed. If we have an idea of what the history of Mars is like, we'll be able to understand the potential for finding evidence of life.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasas-perseverance-rover-begins-the-hunt"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Perseverance Rover's SuperCam Science Instrument Delivers First Results", "date": "2021-03-10", "content": "The first readings from the SuperCam instrument aboard NASA's Perseverance rover have arrived on Earth.

Now it is up there working like a charm.\" \"The sounds acquired are remarkable quality,\" says Naomi Murdoch, a research scientist and lecturer at the ISAE-SUPAERO aerospace engineering school in Toulouse. \"It's incredible to think that we're going to do science with the first sounds ever recorded on the surface of Mars!\" On March 9, the mission released three SuperCam audio files. Obtained only about 18 hours after landing, when the mast remained stowed on the rover deck, the first file captures the faint sounds of Martian wind. The wind is more audible, especially around the 20-second mark, in the second sound file, recorded on the rover's fourth Martian day, or sol. SuperCam's third file, from Sol 12, includes the zapping sounds of the laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet (3.1 meters). Some zaps sound slightly louder than others, providing information on the physical structure of the targets, such as its relative hardness. \"I want to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to our international partners at CNES and the SuperCam team for being a part of this momentous journey with us,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"SuperCam truly gives our rover eyes to see promising rock samples and ears to hear what it sounds like when the lasers strike them. This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity.\" The SuperCam team also received excellent first datasets from the instrument's visible and infrared (VISIR) sensor as well as its Raman spectrometer. VISIR collects light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This technique complements the Raman spectrometer, which uses a green laser beam to excite the chemical bonds in a sample to produce a signal depending on what elements are bonded together, in turn providing insights into a rock's mineral composition. \"This is the first time an instrument has used Raman spectroscopy anywhere other than on Earth!\" said Olivier Beyssac, CNRS research director at the Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie in Paris. \"Raman spectroscopy is going to play a crucial role in characterizing minerals to gain deeper insight into the geological conditions under which they formed and to detect potential organic and mineral molecules that might have been formed by living organisms.\" ", "url": "https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8885/perseverance-rovers-supercam-science-instrument-delivers-first-results/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover Produces Oxygen on Another Planet for the First Time", "date": "2021-04-25", "content": "NASA's Perseverance rover has been marking milestones on Mars since landing on the Red Planet in February. Its latest historic accomplishment is the first creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide in the thin Mars atmosphere . Mission time is measured in sols, or Martian days. Oxygen production was achieved early in the evening of April 20, or early morning on Sol 60 in Jezero Crater. MOXIE, a small, gold box-shaped instrument on the rover, successfully demonstrated a solid oxide electrolysis technology for converting the Martian atmosphere to oxygen. The atmosphere on Mars is about 95% carbon dioxide. MOXIE's first oxygen run produced 5.4 grams of oxygen in an hour. The power supply limits potential production to 12 g/hr - about the same amount that a large tree would produce. For both rockets and astronauts, oxygen is crucial, says MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of MIT Haystack Observatory. \"To burn its fuel, a rocket must have many times more oxygen by weight. To get four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require 15,000 pounds of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds of oxygen.\" In contrast, Hecht says, \"The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them to breathe.\" The oxygen production process starts with carbon dioxide intake; inside MOXIE, the Martian CO2 is compressed and filtered to remove any contaminants. It is then heated, which causes separation into oxygen and carbon monoxide. The oxygen is further isolated by a hot, charged ceramic component; the oxygen ions merge into O2. Carbon monoxide is expelled harmlessly back into the atmosphere. The MOXIE teams will next analyze the purity of the oxygen; preliminary indications are that once the background CO2 was flushed out by the flowing oxygen, the resulting product was nearly 100% pure oxygen. Serving as a proof of concept, MOXIE has paved the way for possible future Mars missions to produce oxygen, which will be needed for rocket propulsion on return trips for crewed missions. \"The first run of MOXIE is a step in the right direction to bring us closer to the possibility of human missions to Mars,\" says Jeffrey Hoffman, a professor of the practice in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who is the deputy principal investigator the project. \"The technology that evolves from what we have been able to do here will be the grandchildren descended from the success of our MOXIE instrument.\" MOXIE is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover used one of its two microphones to listen as the Ingenuity helicopter flew for the fourth time on April 30, 2021. A new video combines footage of the solar-powered helicopter taken by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z imager with audio from a microphone belonging to the rover's SuperCam laser instrument. The laser zaps rocks from a distance, studying their vapor with a spectrometer to reveal their chemical composition. The instrument's microphone records the sounds of those laser strikes, which provide information on the physical properties of the targets, such as their relative hardness. The microphone can also record ambient noise, like the Martian wind. With Perseverance parked 262 feet from the helicopter's takeoff and landing spot, the rover mission wasn't sure if the microphone would pick up any sound of the flight. Even during flight, when the helicopter's blades spin at 2,537 rpm, the sound is greatly muffled by the thin Martian atmosphere. It is further obscured by Martian wind gusts during the initial moments of the flight. Listen closely, though, and the helicopter's hum can be heard faintly above the sound of those winds. \"This is a very good surprise,\" said David Mimoun, a professor of planetary science at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace in Toulouse, France, and science lead for the SuperCam Mars microphone. \"We had carried out tests and simulations that told us the microphone would barely pick up the sounds of the helicopter, as the Mars atmosphere damps the sound propagation strongly. We have been lucky to register the helicopter at such a distance. This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.\" Scientists made the audio, which is recorded in mono, easier to hear by isolating the 84 hertz helicopter blade sound, reducing the frequencies below 80 hertz and above 90 hertz, and increasing the volume of the remaining signal. Some frequencies were clipped to bring out the helicopter's hum, which is loudest when the helicopter passes through the field of view of the camera. \"This is an example of how the different payload instrument suites complement each other, resulting in information synergy,\" said Soren Madsen, Perseverance payload development manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. JPL built Perseverance as well as Ingenuity and operates both of them. \"In this particular case, the microphone and video let us observe the helicopter as if we are there, and additional information, such as the Doppler shift, confirms details of the flight path.\" SuperCam is led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's body unit was developed.

Ingenuity provided new insight into where different rock layers begin and end, each layer serving as a time capsule for how conditions in the ancient climate changed at this location. The flight also revealed obstacles the rover may have to drive around as it explores Jezero Crater. During the flight - designed to test the helicopter's ability to serve as an aerial scout - Ingenuity soared over a dune field nicknamed \"S\u00e9\u00edtah.\" Perseverance is making a detour south around those dunes , which would be too risky for the six-wheeled rover to try crossing. The color images from Ingenuity, taken from a height of around 33 feet , offer the rover team much greater detail than they get from the orbiter images they typically use for route planning. While a camera like HiRISE aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can resolve rocks about 3 feet in diameter, missions usually rely on rover images to see smaller rocks or terrain features. \"Once a rover gets close enough to a location, we get ground-scale images that we can compare to orbital images,\" said Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"With Ingenuity, we now have this intermediate-scale imagery that nicely fills the gap in resolution.\" Below are a few of Ingenuity's images, which completed the long journey back to Earth on July 8. Raised Ridges. Ingenuity offered a high- resolution glimpse of rock features nicknamed \"Raised Ridges.\" They belong to a fracture system, which often serve as pathways for fluid to flow underground. Here in Jezero Crater, a lake existed billions of years ago. Spying the ridges in images from Mars orbiters, scientists have wondered whether water might have flowed through these fractures at some point, dissolving minerals that could help feed ancient microbial colonies. That would make them a prime location to look for signs of ancient life - and perhaps to drill a sample. The samples Perseverance takes will eventually be deposited on Mars for a future mission that would take them to Earth for in-depth analysis. \"Our current plan is to visit Raised Ridges and investigate it close up,\" Williford said. \"The helicopter's images are by far better in resolution than the orbital ones we were using. Studying these will allow us to ensure that visiting these ridges is important to the team.\" Sand dunes like the ones in this image keep rover drivers like JPL's Olivier Toupet awake at night: Knee- or waist-high, they could easily cause the two- ton rover to get stuck. After landing in February, Perseverance scientists asked whether it was possible to make a beeline across this terrain; Toupet's answer was a hard no. \"Sand is a big concern,\" said Toupet, who leads the team of mobility experts that plans Perseverance's drives. \"If we drive downhill into a dune, we could embed ourselves into it and not be able to get back out.\" Toupet is also the lead for Perseverance's newly tested AutoNav feature , which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to drive the rover autonomously over greater distances than could be achieved otherwise. While good at avoiding rocks and other hazards, AutoNav can't detect sand, so human drivers still need to define \"keep-out zones\" around areas that could entrap the rover. Without Ingenuity, visible in silhouette at the bottom of this next image, Perseverance's scientists would never get to see this section of S\u00e9\u00edtah so clearly: It's too sandy for Perseverance to visit. The unique view offers enough detail to inspect these rocks and get a better understanding of this area of Jezero Crater. As the rover works its way around the dune field, it may make what the team calls a \"toe dip\" into some scientifically compelling spots with interesting bedrock. While Toupet and his team wouldn't attempt a toe dip here, the recent images from Ingenuity will allow them to plan potential toe-dip paths in other regions along the route of Perseverance's first science campaign . \"The helicopter is an extremely valuable asset for rover planning because it provides high-resolution imagery of the terrain we want to drive through,\" said Toupet. \"We can better assess the size of the dunes and where bedrock is poking out. That's great information for us; it helps identify which areas may be traversable by the rover and whether certain high-value science targets are reachable.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-helicopter-spots-intriguing-terrain-for-perseverance-rover-to-explore/"}, {"title": "Signs of Life on Mars? NASA's Perseverance Rover Begins the Hunt", "date": "2021-07-20", "content": "After testing a bristling array of instruments on its robotic arm, NASA's latest Mars rover gets down to business: probing rocks and dust for evidence of past life. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover has begun its search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet. Flexing its 7-foot (2-meter) mechanical arm, the rover is testing the sensitive detectors it carries, capturing their first science readings. Along with analyzing rocks using X-rays and ultraviolet light, the six-wheeled scientist will zoom in for closeups of tiny segments of rock surfaces that might show evidence of past microbial activity. Called PIXL, or Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, the rover's X-ray instrument delivered unexpectedly strong science results while it was still being tested, said Abigail Allwood, PIXL's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Located at the end of the arm, the lunchbox-size instrument fired its X-rays at a small calibration target - used to test instrument settings - aboard Perseverance and was able to determine the composition of Martian dust clinging to the target. \"We got our best-ever composition analysis of Martian dust before it even looked at rock,\" Allwood said. That's just a small taste of what PIXL, combined with the arm's other instruments, is expected to reveal as it zeroes in on promising geological features over the weeks and months ahead. Scientists say Jezero Crater was a crater lake billions of years ago, making it a choice landing site for Perseverance. The crater has long since dried out, and the rover is now picking its way across its red, broken floor. \"If life was there in Jezero Crater, the evidence of that life could be there,\" said Allwood, a key member of the Perseverance \"arm science\" team. To get a detailed profile of rock textures, contours, and composition, PIXL's maps of the chemicals throughout a rock can be combined with mineral maps produced by the SHERLOC instrument and its partner, WATSON. SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals - uses an ultraviolet laser to identify some of the minerals in the rock, while WATSON takes closeup images that scientists can use to determine grain size, roundness, and texture, all of which can help determine how the rock was formed. Early WATSON closeups have already yielded a trove of data from Martian rocks, the scientists said, such as a variety of colors, sizes of grains in the sediment, and even the presence of \"cement\" between the grains. Such details can provide important clues about formation history, water flow, and ancient, potentially habitable Martian environments. And combined with those from PIXL, they can provide a broader environmental and even historical snapshot of Jezero Crater. \"What is the crater floor made out of? What were the conditions like on the crater floor?\" asks Luther Beegle of JPL, SHERLOC's principal investigator. \"That does tell us a lot about the early days of Mars, and potentially how Mars formed. If we have an idea of what the history of Mars is like, we'll be able to understand the potential for finding evidence of life.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasas-perseverance-rover-begins-the-hunt"}, {"title": "NASA's Perseverance Team Assessing First Mars Sampling Attempt", "date": "2021-08-06", "content": "Data sent to Earth by NASA's Perseverance rover after its first attempt to collect a rock sample on Mars and seal it in a sample tube indicate that no rock was collected during the initial sampling activity. The rover carries 43 titanium sample tubes and is exploring Jezero Crater, where it will be gathering samples of rock and regolith for future analysis on Earth. \"While this is not the 'hole-in-one' we hoped for, there is always risk with breaking new ground,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"I'm confident we have the right team working this, and we will persevere toward a solution to ensure future success.\" Perseverance's Sampling and Caching System uses a hollow coring bit and a percussive drill at the end of its 7-foot-long robotic arm to extract samples. Telemetry from the rover indicates that during its first coring attempt, the drill and bit were engaged as planned, and post- coring, the sample tube was processed as intended. \"The sampling process is autonomous from beginning to end,\" said Jessica Samuels, the surface mission manager for Perseverance at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"One of the steps that occurs after placing a probe into the collection tube is to measure the volume of the sample. The probe did not encounter the expected resistance that would be there if a sample were inside the tube.\" The Perseverance mission is assembling a response team to analyze the data. One early step will be to use the WATSON imager - located at the end of the robotic arm - to take close-up pictures \"The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the Sampling and Caching System,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at JPL. \"Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analyzing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.\" Previous NASA missions on Mars have also encountered surprising rock and regolith properties during sample collection and other activities. In 2008, the Phoenix mission sampled soil that was \"sticky\" and difficult to move into onboard science instruments, resulting in multiple tries before achieving success. Curiosity has drilled into rocks that turned out to be harder and more brittle than expected. Most recently, the heat probe on the InSight lander, known as the \"mole,\" was unable to penetrate the Martian surface as planned. \"I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don't know about it,\" said Trosper. \"One thing I've found is, it's not unusual to have complications during complex, first- time activities.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring two geologic units containing Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock and other intriguing geologic features. The first unit, called the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough,\" is the floor of Jezero. The adjacent unit, named \"S\u00e9\u00edtah\" , has Mars bedrock as well, and is also home to ridges, layered rocks, and sand dunes. Recently, the Perseverance science team began using color images from the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to help scout for areas of potential scientific interest and to look for potential hazards. Ingenuity completed its 11th flight Wednesday, Aug. 4, traveling about 1,250 feet downrange of its current location so that it could provide the project aerial reconnaissance of the southern S\u00e9\u00edtah area. The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled up to eight of its sample tubes. Next, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan- shaped remains of the confluence of an ancient river and a lake within Jezero Crater. The region may be especially rich in carbonate minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are associated with biological processes.

The Mars 2020 mission was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. The landing site contains ancient bedrock and fan-delta deposits rich in clay minerals. Perseverance, accompanied by a helicopter named Ingenuity, has spent the last six months surveying and documenting the terrain and geological features at the landing site to prepare for sample collection. To collect samples, the Sampling and Caching System on the rover uses a percussive drill with a hollow coring bit on its robotic arm to break up rocky material and place it into a sample tube. Initial assessment of the sampling effort shows that the Sampling and Caching System hardware functioned nominally, but no sample was detected in the tube. A response team has been assembled and is conducting analyses to diagnose the reason for this, which may be related to the unanticipated properties of the rock itself. Their results will guide future sample collection attempts. One of the major objectives of the Mars 2020 mission is to search for habitable conditions on Mars, including biosignatures such as the presence of water or ancient life. Perseverance will collect samples from regions such as ancient delta deposits, where past conditions may have been suitable for life.

NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover has begun its search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet. Flexing its 7-foot (2-meter) mechanical arm, the rover is testing the sensitive detectors it carries, capturing their first science readings. Along with analyzing rocks using X-rays and ultraviolet light, the six-wheeled scientist will zoom in for closeups of tiny segments of rock surfaces that might show evidence of past microbial activity. Called PIXL, or Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, the rover's X-ray instrument delivered unexpectedly strong science results while it was still being tested, said Abigail Allwood, PIXL's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Located at the end of the arm, the lunchbox-size instrument fired its X-rays at a small calibration target - used to test instrument settings - aboard Perseverance and was able to determine the composition of Martian dust clinging to the target. \"We got our best-ever composition analysis of Martian dust before it even looked at rock,\" Allwood said. That's just a small taste of what PIXL, combined with the arm's other instruments, is expected to reveal as it zeroes in on promising geological features over the weeks and months ahead. Scientists say Jezero Crater was a crater lake billions of years ago, making it a choice landing site for Perseverance. The crater has long since dried out, and the rover is now picking its way across its red, broken floor. \"If life was there in Jezero Crater, the evidence of that life could be there,\" said Allwood, a key member of the Perseverance \"arm science\" team. To get a detailed profile of rock textures, contours, and composition, PIXL's maps of the chemicals throughout a rock can be combined with mineral maps produced by the SHERLOC instrument and its partner, WATSON. SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals - uses an ultraviolet laser to identify some of the minerals in the rock, while WATSON takes closeup images that scientists can use to determine grain size, roundness, and texture, all of which can help determine how the rock was formed. Early WATSON closeups have already yielded a trove of data from Martian rocks, the scientists said, such as a variety of colors, sizes of grains in the sediment, and even the presence of \"cement\" between the grains. Such details can provide important clues about formation history, water flow, and ancient, potentially habitable Martian environments. And combined with those from PIXL, they can provide a broader environmental and even historical snapshot of Jezero Crater. \"What is the crater floor made out of? What were the conditions like on the crater floor?\" asks Luther Beegle of JPL, SHERLOC's principal investigator. \"That does tell us a lot about the early days of Mars, and potentially how Mars formed. If we have an idea of what the history of Mars is like, we'll be able to understand the potential for finding evidence of life.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasas-perseverance-rover-begins-the-hunt"}, {"title": "NASA's Perseverance Team Assessing First Mars Sampling Attempt", "date": "2021-08-06", "content": "Data sent to Earth by NASA's Perseverance rover after its first attempt to collect a rock sample on Mars and seal it in a sample tube indicate that no rock was collected during the initial sampling activity.

Telemetry from the rover indicates that during its first coring attempt, the drill and bit were engaged as planned, and post- coring, the sample tube was processed as intended. \"The sampling process is autonomous from beginning to end,\" said Jessica Samuels, the surface mission manager for Perseverance at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"One of the steps that occurs after placing a probe into the collection tube is to measure the volume of the sample. The probe did not encounter the expected resistance that would be there if a sample were inside the tube.\" The Perseverance mission is assembling a response team to analyze the data. One early step will be to use the WATSON imager - located at the end of the robotic arm - to take close-up pictures \"The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the Sampling and Caching System,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at JPL. \"Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analyzing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.\" Previous NASA missions on Mars have also encountered surprising rock and regolith properties during sample collection and other activities. In 2008, the Phoenix mission sampled soil that was \"sticky\" and difficult to move into onboard science instruments, resulting in multiple tries before achieving success. Curiosity has drilled into rocks that turned out to be harder and more brittle than expected. Most recently, the heat probe on the InSight lander, known as the \"mole,\" was unable to penetrate the Martian surface as planned. \"I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don't know about it,\" said Trosper. \"One thing I've found is, it's not unusual to have complications during complex, first- time activities.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring two geologic units containing Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock and other intriguing geologic features. The first unit, called the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough,\" is the floor of Jezero. The adjacent unit, named \"S\u00e9\u00edtah\" , has Mars bedrock as well, and is also home to ridges, layered rocks, and sand dunes. Recently, the Perseverance science team began using color images from the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to help scout for areas of potential scientific interest and to look for potential hazards. Ingenuity completed its 11th flight Wednesday, Aug. 4, traveling about 1,250 feet downrange of its current location so that it could provide the project aerial reconnaissance of the southern S\u00e9\u00edtah area. The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled up to eight of its sample tubes. Next, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan- shaped remains of the confluence of an ancient river and a lake within Jezero Crater. The region may be especially rich in carbonate minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are associated with biological processes.

The Mars 2020 mission was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. The landing site contains ancient bedrock and fan-delta deposits rich in clay minerals. Perseverance, accompanied by a helicopter named Ingenuity, has spent the last six months surveying and documenting the terrain and geological features at the landing site to prepare for sample collection. To collect samples, the Sampling and Caching System on the rover uses a percussive drill with a hollow coring bit on its robotic arm to break up rocky material and place it into a sample tube. Initial assessment of the sampling effort shows that the Sampling and Caching System hardware functioned nominally, but no sample was detected in the tube. A response team has been assembled and is conducting analyses to diagnose the reason for this, which may be related to the unanticipated properties of the rock itself. Their results will guide future sample collection attempts. One of the major objectives of the Mars 2020 mission is to search for habitable conditions on Mars, including biosignatures such as the presence of water or ancient life. Perseverance will collect samples from regions such as ancient delta deposits, where past conditions may have been suitable for life.

The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover's sampling attempt on Aug. 5. Although the Perseverance mission team is confident that the sample is in the tube, images in optimal lighting conditions will confirm its presence. Perseverance's Sampling and Caching System uses a rotary-percussive drill and a hollow coring bit at the end of its 7-foot-long robotic arm to extract samples slightly thicker than a pencil. Within the bit during coring is a sample tube. After completing yesterday's coring, Perseverance maneuvered the corer, bit, and open end of the sample tube in order to be imaged by the rover's Mastcam-Z instrument. The target for the sample collection attempt was a briefcase-size rock belonging to a ridgeline that is more than half-a-mile long and contains rock outcrops and boulders. The initial set of images from Mastcam-Z showed the end of a cored rock within the sample tube. After taking these images, the rover began a procedure called \"percuss to ingest,\" which vibrates the drill bit and tube for one second, five separate times. The movement is designed to clear the lip of the sample tube of any residual material. The action can also cause a sample to slide down farther into the tube. After the rover finished the percuss-to-ingest procedure, it took a second set of Mastcam-Z images. In these images, the lighting is poor, and internal portions of the sample tube are not visible. \"The project got its first cored rock under its belt, and that's a phenomenal accomplishment,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The team determined a location, and selected and cored a viable and scientifically valuable rock. We did what we came to do. We will work through this small hiccup with the lighting conditions in the images and remain encouraged that there is sample in this tube.\" Commands uplinked to the rover earlier today will result in images of the corer and tube to be acquired tomorrow, Sept. 3, at times of day on Mars when the Sun is angled in a more favorable position. Photos will also be taken after sunset to diminish point-sources of light that can saturate an image. The photos will be returned to Earth early in the morning of Sept. 4. If the results of this additional imaging remain inconclusive, the Perseverance team still has several options to choose from going forward, including using the Sampling and Caching System's volume probe as a final confirmation of the sample being in the tube. The Sept. 1 coring is the second time that Perseverance has employed its Sampling and Caching System since landing in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California received data that confirmed the historic milestone. The core is now enclosed in an airtight titanium sample tube , making it available for retrieval in the future. Through the Mars Sample Return campaign, NASA and ESA are planning a series of future missions to return the rover's sample tubes to Earth for closer study. These samples would be the first set of scientifically identified and selected materials returned to our planet from another. \"NASA has a history of setting ambitious goals and then accomplishing them, reflecting our nation's commitment to discovery and innovation,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"This is a momentous achievement and I can't wait to see the incredible discoveries produced by Perseverance and our team.\" Along with identifying and collecting samples of rock and regolith while searching for signs of ancient microscopic life, Perseverance's mission includes studying the Jezero region to understand the geology and ancient habitability of the area, as well as to characterize the past climate . \"For all of NASA science, this is truly a historic moment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Just as the Apollo Moon missions demonstrated the enduring scientific value of returning samples from other worlds for analysis here on our planet, we will be doing the same with the samples Perseverance collects as part of our Mars Sample Return program. Using the most sophisticated science instruments on Earth, we expect jaw-dropping discoveries across a broad set of science areas, including exploration into the question of whether life once existed on Mars.\" First Sample. The sample-taking process began on Wednesday, Sept. 1, when the rotary- percussive drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm cored into a flat, briefcase-size Mars rock nicknamed \"Rochette.\" After completing the coring process, the arm maneuvered the corer, bit, and sample tube so the rover's Mastcam-Z camera instrument could image the contents of the still-unsealed tube and transmit the results back to Earth. After mission controllers confirmed the cored rock's presence in the tube, they sent a command to complete processing of the sample. Today, at 12:34 a.m. EDT, Perseverance transferred sample tube serial number 266 and its Martian cargo into the rover's interior to measure and image the rock core. It then hermetically sealed the container, took another image, and stored the tube. \"With over 3,000 parts, the Sampling and Caching System is the most complex mechanism ever sent into space,\" said Larry D. James, interim director of JPL. \"Our Perseverance team is excited and proud to see the system perform so well on Mars and take the first step for returning samples to Earth. We also recognize that a worldwide team of NASA, industry partners, academia, and international space agencies contributed to and share in this historic success.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring the rocky outcrops and boulders of \"Artuby,\" a ridgeline of more than a half-mile bordering two geologic units believed to contain Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock. \"Getting the first sample under our belt is a huge milestone,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech. \"When we get these samples back on Earth, they are going to tell us a great deal about some of the earliest chapters in the evolution of Mars. But however geologically intriguing the contents of sample tube 266 will be, they won't tell the complete story of this place. There is a lot of Jezero Crater left to explore, and we will continue our journey in the months and years ahead.\" The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled as many as eight of its 43 sample tubes. After that, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan-shaped remains of the spot where an ancient river met a lake within the crater. The region may be especially rich in clay minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are often associated with biological processes.

After collecting its first sample , named \"Montdenier,\" Sept. 6, the team collected a second, \"Montagnac,\" from the same rock Sept. 8. Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. \"It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.\" The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed. Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past. What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life. The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a \"flash in the pan\": Floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example. But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample- acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long time. This groundwater could have been related to the lake that was once in Jezero, or it could have traveled through the rocks long after the lake had dried up. Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past. \"These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,\" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist. \"One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent. This will help answer the big- picture science question of the history and stability of liquid water on Mars.\" Next Stop, 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah'. Perseverance is currently searching the crater floor for samples that can be brought back to Earth to answer profound questions about Mars' history. Promising samples are sealed in titanium tubes the rover carries in its chassis, where they'll be stored until Perseverance drops them to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple \"depots\" later in the mission, where it will drop off samples for a future mission to bring to Earth. Having one or more depots increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval to Earth. Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet away in \"South S\u00e9\u00edtah,\" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to \"broken dinner plates.\" The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South S\u00e9\u00edtah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake. By the start of October, all Mars missions will be standing down from commanding their spacecraft for several weeks, a protective measure during a period called Mars solar conjunction . Perseverance isn't likely to drill in South S\u00e9\u00edtah until sometime after that period.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover used one of its two microphones to listen as the Ingenuity helicopter flew for the fourth time on April 30, 2021. A new video combines footage of the solar-powered helicopter taken by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z imager with audio from a microphone belonging to the rover's SuperCam laser instrument. The laser zaps rocks from a distance, studying their vapor with a spectrometer to reveal their chemical composition. The instrument's microphone records the sounds of those laser strikes, which provide information on the physical properties of the targets, such as their relative hardness. The microphone can also record ambient noise, like the Martian wind. With Perseverance parked 262 feet from the helicopter's takeoff and landing spot, the rover mission wasn't sure if the microphone would pick up any sound of the flight. Even during flight, when the helicopter's blades spin at 2,537 rpm, the sound is greatly muffled by the thin Martian atmosphere. It is further obscured by Martian wind gusts during the initial moments of the flight. Listen closely, though, and the helicopter's hum can be heard faintly above the sound of those winds. \"This is a very good surprise,\" said David Mimoun, a professor of planetary science at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de l'A\u00e9ronautique et de l'Espace in Toulouse, France, and science lead for the SuperCam Mars microphone. \"We had carried out tests and simulations that told us the microphone would barely pick up the sounds of the helicopter, as the Mars atmosphere damps the sound propagation strongly. We have been lucky to register the helicopter at such a distance. This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.\" Scientists made the audio, which is recorded in mono, easier to hear by isolating the 84 hertz helicopter blade sound, reducing the frequencies below 80 hertz and above 90 hertz, and increasing the volume of the remaining signal. Some frequencies were clipped to bring out the helicopter's hum, which is loudest when the helicopter passes through the field of view of the camera. \"This is an example of how the different payload instrument suites complement each other, resulting in information synergy,\" said Soren Madsen, Perseverance payload development manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. JPL built Perseverance as well as Ingenuity and operates both of them. \"In this particular case, the microphone and video let us observe the helicopter as if we are there, and additional information, such as the Doppler shift, confirms details of the flight path.\" SuperCam is led by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument's body unit was developed. That part of the instrument includes several spectrometers, control electronics, and software. The mast unit, including the microphone, was developed and built by several laboratories of the CNRS , ISAE-Supa\u00e9ro, and French universities under the contracting authority of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales .

Ingenuity provided new insight into where different rock layers begin and end, each layer serving as a time capsule for how conditions in the ancient climate changed at this location. The flight also revealed obstacles the rover may have to drive around as it explores Jezero Crater. During the flight - designed to test the helicopter's ability to serve as an aerial scout - Ingenuity soared over a dune field nicknamed \"S\u00e9\u00edtah.\" Perseverance is making a detour south around those dunes , which would be too risky for the six-wheeled rover to try crossing. The color images from Ingenuity, taken from a height of around 33 feet , offer the rover team much greater detail than they get from the orbiter images they typically use for route planning. While a camera like HiRISE aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can resolve rocks about 3 feet in diameter, missions usually rely on rover images to see smaller rocks or terrain features. \"Once a rover gets close enough to a location, we get ground-scale images that we can compare to orbital images,\" said Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"With Ingenuity, we now have this intermediate-scale imagery that nicely fills the gap in resolution.\" Below are a few of Ingenuity's images, which completed the long journey back to Earth on July 8. Raised Ridges. Ingenuity offered a high- resolution glimpse of rock features nicknamed \"Raised Ridges.\" They belong to a fracture system, which often serve as pathways for fluid to flow underground. Here in Jezero Crater, a lake existed billions of years ago. Spying the ridges in images from Mars orbiters, scientists have wondered whether water might have flowed through these fractures at some point, dissolving minerals that could help feed ancient microbial colonies. That would make them a prime location to look for signs of ancient life - and perhaps to drill a sample. The samples Perseverance takes will eventually be deposited on Mars for a future mission that would take them to Earth for in-depth analysis. \"Our current plan is to visit Raised Ridges and investigate it close up,\" Williford said. \"The helicopter's images are by far better in resolution than the orbital ones we were using. Studying these will allow us to ensure that visiting these ridges is important to the team.\" Sand dunes like the ones in this image keep rover drivers like JPL's Olivier Toupet awake at night: Knee- or waist-high, they could easily cause the two- ton rover to get stuck. After landing in February, Perseverance scientists asked whether it was possible to make a beeline across this terrain; Toupet's answer was a hard no. \"Sand is a big concern,\" said Toupet, who leads the team of mobility experts that plans Perseverance's drives. \"If we drive downhill into a dune, we could embed ourselves into it and not be able to get back out.\" Toupet is also the lead for Perseverance's newly tested AutoNav feature , which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to drive the rover autonomously over greater distances than could be achieved otherwise. While good at avoiding rocks and other hazards, AutoNav can't detect sand, so human drivers still need to define \"keep-out zones\" around areas that could entrap the rover. Without Ingenuity, visible in silhouette at the bottom of this next image, Perseverance's scientists would never get to see this section of S\u00e9\u00edtah so clearly: It's too sandy for Perseverance to visit. The unique view offers enough detail to inspect these rocks and get a better understanding of this area of Jezero Crater. As the rover works its way around the dune field, it may make what the team calls a \"toe dip\" into some scientifically compelling spots with interesting bedrock. While Toupet and his team wouldn't attempt a toe dip here, the recent images from Ingenuity will allow them to plan potential toe-dip paths in other regions along the route of Perseverance's first science campaign . \"The helicopter is an extremely valuable asset for rover planning because it provides high-resolution imagery of the terrain we want to drive through,\" said Toupet. \"We can better assess the size of the dunes and where bedrock is poking out.

That's just a small taste of what PIXL, combined with the arm's other instruments, is expected to reveal as it zeroes in on promising geological features over the weeks and months ahead. Scientists say Jezero Crater was a crater lake billions of years ago, making it a choice landing site for Perseverance. The crater has long since dried out, and the rover is now picking its way across its red, broken floor. \"If life was there in Jezero Crater, the evidence of that life could be there,\" said Allwood, a key member of the Perseverance \"arm science\" team. To get a detailed profile of rock textures, contours, and composition, PIXL's maps of the chemicals throughout a rock can be combined with mineral maps produced by the SHERLOC instrument and its partner, WATSON. SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals - uses an ultraviolet laser to identify some of the minerals in the rock, while WATSON takes closeup images that scientists can use to determine grain size, roundness, and texture, all of which can help determine how the rock was formed. Early WATSON closeups have already yielded a trove of data from Martian rocks, the scientists said, such as a variety of colors, sizes of grains in the sediment, and even the presence of \"cement\" between the grains. Such details can provide important clues about formation history, water flow, and ancient, potentially habitable Martian environments. And combined with those from PIXL, they can provide a broader environmental and even historical snapshot of Jezero Crater. \"What is the crater floor made out of? What were the conditions like on the crater floor?\" asks Luther Beegle of JPL, SHERLOC's principal investigator. \"That does tell us a lot about the early days of Mars, and potentially how Mars formed. If we have an idea of what the history of Mars is like, we'll be able to understand the potential for finding evidence of life.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasas-perseverance-rover-begins-the-hunt"}, {"title": "NASA's Perseverance Team Assessing First Mars Sampling Attempt", "date": "2021-08-06", "content": "Data sent to Earth by NASA's Perseverance rover after its first attempt to collect a rock sample on Mars and seal it in a sample tube indicate that no rock was collected during the initial sampling activity.

In 2008, the Phoenix mission sampled soil that was \"sticky\" and difficult to move into onboard science instruments, resulting in multiple tries before achieving success. Curiosity has drilled into rocks that turned out to be harder and more brittle than expected. Most recently, the heat probe on the InSight lander, known as the \"mole,\" was unable to penetrate the Martian surface as planned. \"I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don't know about it,\" said Trosper. \"One thing I've found is, it's not unusual to have complications during complex, first- time activities.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring two geologic units containing Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock and other intriguing geologic features. The first unit, called the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough,\" is the floor of Jezero. The adjacent unit, named \"S\u00e9\u00edtah\" , has Mars bedrock as well, and is also home to ridges, layered rocks, and sand dunes. Recently, the Perseverance science team began using color images from the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to help scout for areas of potential scientific interest and to look for potential hazards. Ingenuity completed its 11th flight Wednesday, Aug. 4, traveling about 1,250 feet downrange of its current location so that it could provide the project aerial reconnaissance of the southern S\u00e9\u00edtah area. The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled up to eight of its sample tubes. Next, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan- shaped remains of the confluence of an ancient river and a lake within Jezero Crater. The region may be especially rich in carbonate minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are associated with biological processes.

However, data sent by the rover indicate that no rock was collected during the initial sampling activity. Perseverance carries 43 sample tubes for collecting martian rocks and regolith that will be returned to Earth by future missions for detailed analysis. The Mars 2020 mission was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. The landing site contains ancient bedrock and fan-delta deposits rich in clay minerals. Perseverance, accompanied by a helicopter named Ingenuity, has spent the last six months surveying and documenting the terrain and geological features at the landing site to prepare for sample collection. To collect samples, the Sampling and Caching System on the rover uses a percussive drill with a hollow coring bit on its robotic arm to break up rocky material and place it into a sample tube. Initial assessment of the sampling effort shows that the Sampling and Caching System hardware functioned nominally, but no sample was detected in the tube. A response team has been assembled and is conducting analyses to diagnose the reason for this, which may be related to the unanticipated properties of the rock itself. Their results will guide future sample collection attempts. One of the major objectives of the Mars 2020 mission is to search for habitable conditions on Mars, including biosignatures such as the presence of water or ancient life. Perseverance will collect samples from regions such as ancient delta deposits, where past conditions may have been suitable for life.

The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover's sampling attempt on Aug. 5. Although the Perseverance mission team is confident that the sample is in the tube, images in optimal lighting conditions will confirm its presence. Perseverance's Sampling and Caching System uses a rotary-percussive drill and a hollow coring bit at the end of its 7-foot-long robotic arm to extract samples slightly thicker than a pencil. Within the bit during coring is a sample tube. After completing yesterday's coring, Perseverance maneuvered the corer, bit, and open end of the sample tube in order to be imaged by the rover's Mastcam-Z instrument. The target for the sample collection attempt was a briefcase-size rock belonging to a ridgeline that is more than half-a-mile long and contains rock outcrops and boulders. The initial set of images from Mastcam-Z showed the end of a cored rock within the sample tube. After taking these images, the rover began a procedure called \"percuss to ingest,\" which vibrates the drill bit and tube for one second, five separate times. The movement is designed to clear the lip of the sample tube of any residual material. The action can also cause a sample to slide down farther into the tube. After the rover finished the percuss-to-ingest procedure, it took a second set of Mastcam-Z images. In these images, the lighting is poor, and internal portions of the sample tube are not visible. \"The project got its first cored rock under its belt, and that's a phenomenal accomplishment,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The team determined a location, and selected and cored a viable and scientifically valuable rock. We did what we came to do. We will work through this small hiccup with the lighting conditions in the images and remain encouraged that there is sample in this tube.\" Commands uplinked to the rover earlier today will result in images of the corer and tube to be acquired tomorrow, Sept. 3, at times of day on Mars when the Sun is angled in a more favorable position. Photos will also be taken after sunset to diminish point-sources of light that can saturate an image. The photos will be returned to Earth early in the morning of Sept. 4. If the results of this additional imaging remain inconclusive, the Perseverance team still has several options to choose from going forward, including using the Sampling and Caching System's volume probe as a final confirmation of the sample being in the tube. The Sept. 1 coring is the second time that Perseverance has employed its Sampling and Caching System since landing in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California received data that confirmed the historic milestone. The core is now enclosed in an airtight titanium sample tube , making it available for retrieval in the future. Through the Mars Sample Return campaign, NASA and ESA are planning a series of future missions to return the rover's sample tubes to Earth for closer study. These samples would be the first set of scientifically identified and selected materials returned to our planet from another. \"NASA has a history of setting ambitious goals and then accomplishing them, reflecting our nation's commitment to discovery and innovation,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"This is a momentous achievement and I can't wait to see the incredible discoveries produced by Perseverance and our team.\" Along with identifying and collecting samples of rock and regolith while searching for signs of ancient microscopic life, Perseverance's mission includes studying the Jezero region to understand the geology and ancient habitability of the area, as well as to characterize the past climate . \"For all of NASA science, this is truly a historic moment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Just as the Apollo Moon missions demonstrated the enduring scientific value of returning samples from other worlds for analysis here on our planet, we will be doing the same with the samples Perseverance collects as part of our Mars Sample Return program. Using the most sophisticated science instruments on Earth, we expect jaw-dropping discoveries across a broad set of science areas, including exploration into the question of whether life once existed on Mars.\" First Sample. The sample-taking process began on Wednesday, Sept. 1, when the rotary- percussive drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm cored into a flat, briefcase-size Mars rock nicknamed \"Rochette.\" After completing the coring process, the arm maneuvered the corer, bit, and sample tube so the rover's Mastcam-Z camera instrument could image the contents of the still-unsealed tube and transmit the results back to Earth. After mission controllers confirmed the cored rock's presence in the tube, they sent a command to complete processing of the sample. Today, at 12:34 a.m. EDT, Perseverance transferred sample tube serial number 266 and its Martian cargo into the rover's interior to measure and image the rock core. It then hermetically sealed the container, took another image, and stored the tube. \"With over 3,000 parts, the Sampling and Caching System is the most complex mechanism ever sent into space,\" said Larry D. James, interim director of JPL. \"Our Perseverance team is excited and proud to see the system perform so well on Mars and take the first step for returning samples to Earth.

But however geologically intriguing the contents of sample tube 266 will be, they won't tell the complete story of this place. There is a lot of Jezero Crater left to explore, and we will continue our journey in the months and years ahead.\" The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled as many as eight of its 43 sample tubes. After that, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan-shaped remains of the spot where an ancient river met a lake within the crater. The region may be especially rich in clay minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are often associated with biological processes.

After collecting its first sample , named \"Montdenier,\" Sept. 6, the team collected a second, \"Montagnac,\" from the same rock Sept. 8. Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. \"It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.\" The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed. Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past. What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life. The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a \"flash in the pan\": Floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example. But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample- acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long time. This groundwater could have been related to the lake that was once in Jezero, or it could have traveled through the rocks long after the lake had dried up. Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past. \"These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,\" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist. \"One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent. This will help answer the big- picture science question of the history and stability of liquid water on Mars.\" Next Stop, 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah'. Perseverance is currently searching the crater floor for samples that can be brought back to Earth to answer profound questions about Mars' history. Promising samples are sealed in titanium tubes the rover carries in its chassis, where they'll be stored until Perseverance drops them to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple \"depots\" later in the mission, where it will drop off samples for a future mission to bring to Earth. Having one or more depots increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval to Earth. Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet away in \"South S\u00e9\u00edtah,\" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to \"broken dinner plates.\" The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South S\u00e9\u00edtah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake. By the start of October, all Mars missions will be standing down from commanding their spacecraft for several weeks, a protective measure during a period called Mars solar conjunction . Perseverance isn't likely to drill in South S\u00e9\u00edtah until sometime after that period.

Ingenuity provided new insight into where different rock layers begin and end, each layer serving as a time capsule for how conditions in the ancient climate changed at this location. The flight also revealed obstacles the rover may have to drive around as it explores Jezero Crater. During the flight - designed to test the helicopter's ability to serve as an aerial scout - Ingenuity soared over a dune field nicknamed \"S\u00e9\u00edtah.\" Perseverance is making a detour south around those dunes , which would be too risky for the six-wheeled rover to try crossing. The color images from Ingenuity, taken from a height of around 33 feet , offer the rover team much greater detail than they get from the orbiter images they typically use for route planning. While a camera like HiRISE aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can resolve rocks about 3 feet in diameter, missions usually rely on rover images to see smaller rocks or terrain features. \"Once a rover gets close enough to a location, we get ground-scale images that we can compare to orbital images,\" said Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"With Ingenuity, we now have this intermediate-scale imagery that nicely fills the gap in resolution.\" Below are a few of Ingenuity's images, which completed the long journey back to Earth on July 8. Raised Ridges. Ingenuity offered a high- resolution glimpse of rock features nicknamed \"Raised Ridges.\" They belong to a fracture system, which often serve as pathways for fluid to flow underground. Here in Jezero Crater, a lake existed billions of years ago. Spying the ridges in images from Mars orbiters, scientists have wondered whether water might have flowed through these fractures at some point, dissolving minerals that could help feed ancient microbial colonies. That would make them a prime location to look for signs of ancient life - and perhaps to drill a sample. The samples Perseverance takes will eventually be deposited on Mars for a future mission that would take them to Earth for in-depth analysis. \"Our current plan is to visit Raised Ridges and investigate it close up,\" Williford said. \"The helicopter's images are by far better in resolution than the orbital ones we were using. Studying these will allow us to ensure that visiting these ridges is important to the team.\" Sand dunes like the ones in this image keep rover drivers like JPL's Olivier Toupet awake at night: Knee- or waist-high, they could easily cause the two- ton rover to get stuck. After landing in February, Perseverance scientists asked whether it was possible to make a beeline across this terrain; Toupet's answer was a hard no. \"Sand is a big concern,\" said Toupet, who leads the team of mobility experts that plans Perseverance's drives. \"If we drive downhill into a dune, we could embed ourselves into it and not be able to get back out.\" Toupet is also the lead for Perseverance's newly tested AutoNav feature , which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to drive the rover autonomously over greater distances than could be achieved otherwise. While good at avoiding rocks and other hazards, AutoNav can't detect sand, so human drivers still need to define \"keep-out zones\" around areas that could entrap the rover. Without Ingenuity, visible in silhouette at the bottom of this next image, Perseverance's scientists would never get to see this section of S\u00e9\u00edtah so clearly: It's too sandy for Perseverance to visit. The unique view offers enough detail to inspect these rocks and get a better understanding of this area of Jezero Crater. As the rover works its way around the dune field, it may make what the team calls a \"toe dip\" into some scientifically compelling spots with interesting bedrock. While Toupet and his team wouldn't attempt a toe dip here, the recent images from Ingenuity will allow them to plan potential toe-dip paths in other regions along the route of Perseverance's first science campaign . \"The helicopter is an extremely valuable asset for rover planning because it provides high-resolution imagery of the terrain we want to drive through,\" said Toupet. \"We can better assess the size of the dunes and where bedrock is poking out.

Ingenuity completed its 11th flight Wednesday, Aug. 4, traveling about 1,250 feet downrange of its current location so that it could provide the project aerial reconnaissance of the southern S\u00e9\u00edtah area. The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled up to eight of its sample tubes. Next, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan- shaped remains of the confluence of an ancient river and a lake within Jezero Crater. The region may be especially rich in carbonate minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are associated with biological processes.

The Mars 2020 mission was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. The landing site contains ancient bedrock and fan-delta deposits rich in clay minerals. Perseverance, accompanied by a helicopter named Ingenuity, has spent the last six months surveying and documenting the terrain and geological features at the landing site to prepare for sample collection. To collect samples, the Sampling and Caching System on the rover uses a percussive drill with a hollow coring bit on its robotic arm to break up rocky material and place it into a sample tube. Initial assessment of the sampling effort shows that the Sampling and Caching System hardware functioned nominally, but no sample was detected in the tube. A response team has been assembled and is conducting analyses to diagnose the reason for this, which may be related to the unanticipated properties of the rock itself.

The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover's sampling attempt on Aug. 5. Although the Perseverance mission team is confident that the sample is in the tube, images in optimal lighting conditions will confirm its presence. Perseverance's Sampling and Caching System uses a rotary-percussive drill and a hollow coring bit at the end of its 7-foot-long robotic arm to extract samples slightly thicker than a pencil. Within the bit during coring is a sample tube. After completing yesterday's coring, Perseverance maneuvered the corer, bit, and open end of the sample tube in order to be imaged by the rover's Mastcam-Z instrument. The target for the sample collection attempt was a briefcase-size rock belonging to a ridgeline that is more than half-a-mile long and contains rock outcrops and boulders. The initial set of images from Mastcam-Z showed the end of a cored rock within the sample tube. After taking these images, the rover began a procedure called \"percuss to ingest,\" which vibrates the drill bit and tube for one second, five separate times. The movement is designed to clear the lip of the sample tube of any residual material. The action can also cause a sample to slide down farther into the tube. After the rover finished the percuss-to-ingest procedure, it took a second set of Mastcam-Z images. In these images, the lighting is poor, and internal portions of the sample tube are not visible. \"The project got its first cored rock under its belt, and that's a phenomenal accomplishment,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The team determined a location, and selected and cored a viable and scientifically valuable rock. We did what we came to do. We will work through this small hiccup with the lighting conditions in the images and remain encouraged that there is sample in this tube.\" Commands uplinked to the rover earlier today will result in images of the corer and tube to be acquired tomorrow, Sept. 3, at times of day on Mars when the Sun is angled in a more favorable position. Photos will also be taken after sunset to diminish point-sources of light that can saturate an image. The photos will be returned to Earth early in the morning of Sept. 4. If the results of this additional imaging remain inconclusive, the Perseverance team still has several options to choose from going forward, including using the Sampling and Caching System's volume probe as a final confirmation of the sample being in the tube.

Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California received data that confirmed the historic milestone. The core is now enclosed in an airtight titanium sample tube , making it available for retrieval in the future. Through the Mars Sample Return campaign, NASA and ESA are planning a series of future missions to return the rover's sample tubes to Earth for closer study. These samples would be the first set of scientifically identified and selected materials returned to our planet from another. \"NASA has a history of setting ambitious goals and then accomplishing them, reflecting our nation's commitment to discovery and innovation,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"This is a momentous achievement and I can't wait to see the incredible discoveries produced by Perseverance and our team.\" Along with identifying and collecting samples of rock and regolith while searching for signs of ancient microscopic life, Perseverance's mission includes studying the Jezero region to understand the geology and ancient habitability of the area, as well as to characterize the past climate . \"For all of NASA science, this is truly a historic moment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Just as the Apollo Moon missions demonstrated the enduring scientific value of returning samples from other worlds for analysis here on our planet, we will be doing the same with the samples Perseverance collects as part of our Mars Sample Return program. Using the most sophisticated science instruments on Earth, we expect jaw-dropping discoveries across a broad set of science areas, including exploration into the question of whether life once existed on Mars.\" First Sample. The sample-taking process began on Wednesday, Sept. 1, when the rotary- percussive drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm cored into a flat, briefcase-size Mars rock nicknamed \"Rochette.\" After completing the coring process, the arm maneuvered the corer, bit, and sample tube so the rover's Mastcam-Z camera instrument could image the contents of the still-unsealed tube and transmit the results back to Earth. After mission controllers confirmed the cored rock's presence in the tube, they sent a command to complete processing of the sample. Today, at 12:34 a.m. EDT, Perseverance transferred sample tube serial number 266 and its Martian cargo into the rover's interior to measure and image the rock core. It then hermetically sealed the container, took another image, and stored the tube. \"With over 3,000 parts, the Sampling and Caching System is the most complex mechanism ever sent into space,\" said Larry D. James, interim director of JPL. \"Our Perseverance team is excited and proud to see the system perform so well on Mars and take the first step for returning samples to Earth. We also recognize that a worldwide team of NASA, industry partners, academia, and international space agencies contributed to and share in this historic success.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring the rocky outcrops and boulders of \"Artuby,\" a ridgeline of more than a half-mile bordering two geologic units believed to contain Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock. \"Getting the first sample under our belt is a huge milestone,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech. \"When we get these samples back on Earth, they are going to tell us a great deal about some of the earliest chapters in the evolution of Mars. But however geologically intriguing the contents of sample tube 266 will be, they won't tell the complete story of this place. There is a lot of Jezero Crater left to explore, and we will continue our journey in the months and years ahead.\" The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled as many as eight of its 43 sample tubes. After that, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan-shaped remains of the spot where an ancient river met a lake within the crater. The region may be especially rich in clay minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are often associated with biological processes.

After collecting its first sample , named \"Montdenier,\" Sept. 6, the team collected a second, \"Montagnac,\" from the same rock Sept. 8. Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. \"It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.\" The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed. Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past. What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life. The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a \"flash in the pan\": Floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example. But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample- acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long time. This groundwater could have been related to the lake that was once in Jezero, or it could have traveled through the rocks long after the lake had dried up. Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past. \"These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,\" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist. \"One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent. This will help answer the big- picture science question of the history and stability of liquid water on Mars.\" Next Stop, 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah'. Perseverance is currently searching the crater floor for samples that can be brought back to Earth to answer profound questions about Mars' history. Promising samples are sealed in titanium tubes the rover carries in its chassis, where they'll be stored until Perseverance drops them to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple \"depots\" later in the mission, where it will drop off samples for a future mission to bring to Earth. Having one or more depots increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval to Earth. Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet away in \"South S\u00e9\u00edtah,\" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to \"broken dinner plates.\" The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South S\u00e9\u00edtah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake. By the start of October, all Mars missions will be standing down from commanding their spacecraft for several weeks, a protective measure during a period called Mars solar conjunction . Perseverance isn't likely to drill in South S\u00e9\u00edtah until sometime after that period.

There are two versions of the selfie: Figure 1 shows Perseverance looking at the rock holes and Figure 2 shows it looking back at the camera. Each version is made up of 57 individual images that are sent back down to Earth and stitched into the resulting selfies.

Ingenuity provided new insight into where different rock layers begin and end, each layer serving as a time capsule for how conditions in the ancient climate changed at this location. The flight also revealed obstacles the rover may have to drive around as it explores Jezero Crater. During the flight - designed to test the helicopter's ability to serve as an aerial scout - Ingenuity soared over a dune field nicknamed \"S\u00e9\u00edtah.\" Perseverance is making a detour south around those dunes , which would be too risky for the six-wheeled rover to try crossing. The color images from Ingenuity, taken from a height of around 33 feet , offer the rover team much greater detail than they get from the orbiter images they typically use for route planning. While a camera like HiRISE aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can resolve rocks about 3 feet in diameter, missions usually rely on rover images to see smaller rocks or terrain features. \"Once a rover gets close enough to a location, we get ground-scale images that we can compare to orbital images,\" said Perseverance Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"With Ingenuity, we now have this intermediate-scale imagery that nicely fills the gap in resolution.\" Below are a few of Ingenuity's images, which completed the long journey back to Earth on July 8. Raised Ridges. Ingenuity offered a high- resolution glimpse of rock features nicknamed \"Raised Ridges.\" They belong to a fracture system, which often serve as pathways for fluid to flow underground. Here in Jezero Crater, a lake existed billions of years ago. Spying the ridges in images from Mars orbiters, scientists have wondered whether water might have flowed through these fractures at some point, dissolving minerals that could help feed ancient microbial colonies. That would make them a prime location to look for signs of ancient life - and perhaps to drill a sample. The samples Perseverance takes will eventually be deposited on Mars for a future mission that would take them to Earth for in-depth analysis. \"Our current plan is to visit Raised Ridges and investigate it close up,\" Williford said. \"The helicopter's images are by far better in resolution than the orbital ones we were using. Studying these will allow us to ensure that visiting these ridges is important to the team.\" Sand dunes like the ones in this image keep rover drivers like JPL's Olivier Toupet awake at night: Knee- or waist-high, they could easily cause the two- ton rover to get stuck. After landing in February, Perseverance scientists asked whether it was possible to make a beeline across this terrain; Toupet's answer was a hard no. \"Sand is a big concern,\" said Toupet, who leads the team of mobility experts that plans Perseverance's drives. \"If we drive downhill into a dune, we could embed ourselves into it and not be able to get back out.\" Toupet is also the lead for Perseverance's newly tested AutoNav feature , which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to drive the rover autonomously over greater distances than could be achieved otherwise. While good at avoiding rocks and other hazards, AutoNav can't detect sand, so human drivers still need to define \"keep-out zones\" around areas that could entrap the rover. Without Ingenuity, visible in silhouette at the bottom of this next image, Perseverance's scientists would never get to see this section of S\u00e9\u00edtah so clearly: It's too sandy for Perseverance to visit. The unique view offers enough detail to inspect these rocks and get a better understanding of this area of Jezero Crater. As the rover works its way around the dune field, it may make what the team calls a \"toe dip\" into some scientifically compelling spots with interesting bedrock. While Toupet and his team wouldn't attempt a toe dip here, the recent images from Ingenuity will allow them to plan potential toe-dip paths in other regions along the route of Perseverance's first science campaign . \"The helicopter is an extremely valuable asset for rover planning because it provides high-resolution imagery of the terrain we want to drive through,\" said Toupet. \"We can better assess the size of the dunes and where bedrock is poking out. That's great information for us; it helps identify which areas may be traversable by the rover and whether certain high-value science targets are reachable.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-mars-helicopter-spots-intriguing-terrain-for-perseverance-rover-to-explore/"}, {"title": "Signs of Life on Mars? NASA's Perseverance Rover Begins the Hunt", "date": "2021-07-20", "content": "After testing a bristling array of instruments on its robotic arm, NASA's latest Mars rover gets down to business: probing rocks and dust for evidence of past life. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover has begun its search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet. Flexing its 7-foot (2-meter) mechanical arm, the rover is testing the sensitive detectors it carries, capturing their first science readings. Along with analyzing rocks using X-rays and ultraviolet light, the six-wheeled scientist will zoom in for closeups of tiny segments of rock surfaces that might show evidence of past microbial activity. Called PIXL, or Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, the rover's X-ray instrument delivered unexpectedly strong science results while it was still being tested, said Abigail Allwood, PIXL's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Located at the end of the arm, the lunchbox-size instrument fired its X-rays at a small calibration target - used to test instrument settings - aboard Perseverance and was able to determine the composition of Martian dust clinging to the target. \"We got our best-ever composition analysis of Martian dust before it even looked at rock,\" Allwood said. That's just a small taste of what PIXL, combined with the arm's other instruments, is expected to reveal as it zeroes in on promising geological features over the weeks and months ahead. Scientists say Jezero Crater was a crater lake billions of years ago, making it a choice landing site for Perseverance. The crater has long since dried out, and the rover is now picking its way across its red, broken floor. \"If life was there in Jezero Crater, the evidence of that life could be there,\" said Allwood, a key member of the Perseverance \"arm science\" team. To get a detailed profile of rock textures, contours, and composition, PIXL's maps of the chemicals throughout a rock can be combined with mineral maps produced by the SHERLOC instrument and its partner, WATSON. SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals - uses an ultraviolet laser to identify some of the minerals in the rock, while WATSON takes closeup images that scientists can use to determine grain size, roundness, and texture, all of which can help determine how the rock was formed. Early WATSON closeups have already yielded a trove of data from Martian rocks, the scientists said, such as a variety of colors, sizes of grains in the sediment, and even the presence of \"cement\" between the grains. Such details can provide important clues about formation history, water flow, and ancient, potentially habitable Martian environments. And combined with those from PIXL, they can provide a broader environmental and even historical snapshot of Jezero Crater. \"What is the crater floor made out of? What were the conditions like on the crater floor?\" asks Luther Beegle of JPL, SHERLOC's principal investigator. \"That does tell us a lot about the early days of Mars, and potentially how Mars formed. If we have an idea of what the history of Mars is like, we'll be able to understand the potential for finding evidence of life.\" ", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs-of-life-on-mars-nasas-perseverance-rover-begins-the-hunt"}, {"title": "NASA's Perseverance Team Assessing First Mars Sampling Attempt", "date": "2021-08-06", "content": "Data sent to Earth by NASA's Perseverance rover after its first attempt to collect a rock sample on Mars and seal it in a sample tube indicate that no rock was collected during the initial sampling activity.

Telemetry from the rover indicates that during its first coring attempt, the drill and bit were engaged as planned, and post- coring, the sample tube was processed as intended. \"The sampling process is autonomous from beginning to end,\" said Jessica Samuels, the surface mission manager for Perseverance at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"One of the steps that occurs after placing a probe into the collection tube is to measure the volume of the sample. The probe did not encounter the expected resistance that would be there if a sample were inside the tube.\" The Perseverance mission is assembling a response team to analyze the data. One early step will be to use the WATSON imager - located at the end of the robotic arm - to take close-up pictures \"The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the Sampling and Caching System,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at JPL. \"Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analyzing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.\" Previous NASA missions on Mars have also encountered surprising rock and regolith properties during sample collection and other activities. In 2008, the Phoenix mission sampled soil that was \"sticky\" and difficult to move into onboard science instruments, resulting in multiple tries before achieving success. Curiosity has drilled into rocks that turned out to be harder and more brittle than expected. Most recently, the heat probe on the InSight lander, known as the \"mole,\" was unable to penetrate the Martian surface as planned. \"I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don't know about it,\" said Trosper. \"One thing I've found is, it's not unusual to have complications during complex, first- time activities.\" First Science Campaign.

Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. \"It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.\" The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed. Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past. What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life. The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a \"flash in the pan\": Floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example. But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample- acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long time. This groundwater could have been related to the lake that was once in Jezero, or it could have traveled through the rocks long after the lake had dried up. Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past. \"These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,\" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist. \"One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent. This will help answer the big- picture science question of the history and stability of liquid water on Mars.\" Next Stop, 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah'. Perseverance is currently searching the crater floor for samples that can be brought back to Earth to answer profound questions about Mars' history. Promising samples are sealed in titanium tubes the rover carries in its chassis, where they'll be stored until Perseverance drops them to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple \"depots\" later in the mission, where it will drop off samples for a future mission to bring to Earth. Having one or more depots increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval to Earth. Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet away in \"South S\u00e9\u00edtah,\" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to \"broken dinner plates.\" The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South S\u00e9\u00edtah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake. By the start of October, all Mars missions will be standing down from commanding their spacecraft for several weeks, a protective measure during a period called Mars solar conjunction . Perseverance isn't likely to drill in South S\u00e9\u00edtah until sometime after that period.

Two holes can be seen where the rover used its robotic arm to drill rock core samples. There are two versions of the selfie: Figure 1 shows Perseverance looking at the rock holes and Figure 2 shows it looking back at the camera. Each version is made up of 57 individual images that are sent back down to Earth and stitched into the resulting selfies. Perseverance uses a camera called WATSON on the end of its seven-foot-long robotic arm to take its selfies. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory built and manages operations of Perseverance and Ingenuity for the agency. Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages JPL for NASA. WATSON was built by Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego and is operated jointly by MSSS and JPL. A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology , including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith . Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA , would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

The discovery has implications for understanding and accurately dating critical events in the history of Jezero Crater - as well as the rest of the planet. The team has also concluded that rocks in the crater have interacted with water multiple times over the eons and that some contain organic molecules. These and other findings were presented today during a news briefing at the American Geophysical Union fall science meeting in New Orleans. Even before Perseverance touched down on Mars, the mission's science team had wondered about the origin of the rocks in the area. Were they sedimentary - the compressed accumulation of mineral particles possibly carried to the location by an ancient river system? Or where they igneous, possibly born in lava flows rising to the surface from a now long-extinct Martian volcano? \"I was beginning to despair we would never find the answer,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena. \"But then our PIXL instrument got a good look at the abraded patch of a rock from the area nicknamed 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah,' and it all became clear: The crystals within the rock provided the smoking gun.\" The drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm can abrade, or grind, rock surfaces to allow other instruments, such as PIXL, to study them. Short for Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, PIXL uses X-ray fluorescence to map the elemental composition of rocks. On Nov. 12, PIXL analyzed a South S\u00e9\u00edtah rock the science team had chosen to take a core sample from using the rover's drill. The PIXL data showed the rock, nicknamed \"Brac,\" to be composed of an unusual abundance of large olivine crystals engulfed in pyroxene crystals. \"A good geology student will tell you that such a texture indicates the rock formed when crystals grew and settled in a slowly cooling magma - for example a thick lava flow, lava lake, or magma chamber,\" said Farley. \"The rock was then altered by water several times, making it a treasure trove that will allow future scientists to date events in Jezero, better understand the period in which water was more common on its surface, and reveal the early history of the planet. Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from!\" The multi-mission Mars Sample Return campaign began with Perseverance, which is collecting Martian rock samples in search of ancient microscopic life. Of Perseverance's 43 sample tubes, six have been sealed to date - four with rock cores, one with Martian atmosphere, and one that contained \"witness\" material to observe any contamination the rover might have brought from Earth. Mars Sample Return seeks to bring select tubes back to Earth, where generations of scientists will be able to study them with powerful lab equipment far too large to send to Mars. Still to be determined is whether the olivine-rich rock formed in a thick lava lake cooling on the surface or in a subterranean chamber that was later exposed by erosion. Organic Molecules. Also great news for Mars Sample Return is the discovery of organic compounds by the SHERLOC instrument. The carbon-containing molecules are not only in the interiors of abraded rocks SHERLOC analyzed, but in the dust on non-abraded rock. Confirmation of organics is not a confirmation that life once existed in Jezero and left telltale signs . There are both biological and non-biological mechanisms that create organics. \"Curiosity also discovered organics at its landing site within Gale Crater,\" said Luther Beegle, SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What SHERLOC adds to the story is its capability to map the spatial distribution of organics inside rocks and relate those organics to minerals found there. This helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed. More analysis needs to be done to determine the method of production for the identified organics.\" The preservation of organics inside ancient rocks - regardless of origin - at both Gale and Jezero Craters does mean that potential biosignatures could be preserved, too. \"This is a question that may not be solved until the samples are returned to Earth, but the preservation of organics is very exciting. When these samples are returned to Earth, they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years,\" Beegle said. 'Radargram'. Along with its rock-core sampling capabilities, Perseverance has brought the first ground-penetrating radar to the surface of Mars. RIMFAX creates a \"radargram\" of subsurface features up to about 33 feet deep. Data for this first released radargram was collected as the rover drove across a ridgeline from the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough\" geologic unit into the S\u00e9\u00edtah geologic unit. The ridgeline has multiple rock formations with a visible downward tilt. With RIMFAX data, Perseverance scientists now know that these angled rock layers continue at the same angle well below the surface. The radargram also shows the S\u00e9\u00edtah rock layers project below those of Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The results further confirm the science team's belief that the creation of S\u00e9\u00edtah preceded Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The ability to observe geologic features even below the surface adds a new dimension to the team's geologic mapping capabilities at Mars.

The probe did not encounter the expected resistance that would be there if a sample were inside the tube.\" The Perseverance mission is assembling a response team to analyze the data. One early step will be to use the WATSON imager - located at the end of the robotic arm - to take close-up pictures \"The initial thinking is that the empty tube is more likely a result of the rock target not reacting the way we expected during coring, and less likely a hardware issue with the Sampling and Caching System,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager for Perseverance at JPL. \"Over the next few days, the team will be spending more time analyzing the data we have, and also acquiring some additional diagnostic data to support understanding the root cause for the empty tube.\" Previous NASA missions on Mars have also encountered surprising rock and regolith properties during sample collection and other activities. In 2008, the Phoenix mission sampled soil that was \"sticky\" and difficult to move into onboard science instruments, resulting in multiple tries before achieving success. Curiosity has drilled into rocks that turned out to be harder and more brittle than expected. Most recently, the heat probe on the InSight lander, known as the \"mole,\" was unable to penetrate the Martian surface as planned. \"I have been on every Mars rover mission since the beginning, and this planet is always teaching us what we don't know about it,\" said Trosper. \"One thing I've found is, it's not unusual to have complications during complex, first- time activities.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring two geologic units containing Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock and other intriguing geologic features. The first unit, called the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough,\" is the floor of Jezero. The adjacent unit, named \"S\u00e9\u00edtah\" , has Mars bedrock as well, and is also home to ridges, layered rocks, and sand dunes. Recently, the Perseverance science team began using color images from the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to help scout for areas of potential scientific interest and to look for potential hazards. Ingenuity completed its 11th flight Wednesday, Aug. 4, traveling about 1,250 feet downrange of its current location so that it could provide the project aerial reconnaissance of the southern S\u00e9\u00edtah area. The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled up to eight of its sample tubes. Next, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region.

Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past. \"These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,\" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist. \"One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent.

Perseverance is currently searching the crater floor for samples that can be brought back to Earth to answer profound questions about Mars' history. Promising samples are sealed in titanium tubes the rover carries in its chassis, where they'll be stored until Perseverance drops them to be retrieved by a future mission. Perseverance will likely create multiple \"depots\" later in the mission, where it will drop off samples for a future mission to bring to Earth. Having one or more depots increases the likelihood that especially valuable samples will be accessible for retrieval to Earth. Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet away in \"South S\u00e9\u00edtah,\" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to \"broken dinner plates.\" The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South S\u00e9\u00edtah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake.

The PIXL data showed the rock, nicknamed \"Brac,\" to be composed of an unusual abundance of large olivine crystals engulfed in pyroxene crystals. \"A good geology student will tell you that such a texture indicates the rock formed when crystals grew and settled in a slowly cooling magma - for example a thick lava flow, lava lake, or magma chamber,\" said Farley. \"The rock was then altered by water several times, making it a treasure trove that will allow future scientists to date events in Jezero, better understand the period in which water was more common on its surface, and reveal the early history of the planet. Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from!\" The multi-mission Mars Sample Return campaign began with Perseverance, which is collecting Martian rock samples in search of ancient microscopic life. Of Perseverance's 43 sample tubes, six have been sealed to date - four with rock cores, one with Martian atmosphere, and one that contained \"witness\" material to observe any contamination the rover might have brought from Earth. Mars Sample Return seeks to bring select tubes back to Earth, where generations of scientists will be able to study them with powerful lab equipment far too large to send to Mars. Still to be determined is whether the olivine-rich rock formed in a thick lava lake cooling on the surface or in a subterranean chamber that was later exposed by erosion. Organic Molecules. Also great news for Mars Sample Return is the discovery of organic compounds by the SHERLOC instrument. The carbon-containing molecules are not only in the interiors of abraded rocks SHERLOC analyzed, but in the dust on non-abraded rock. Confirmation of organics is not a confirmation that life once existed in Jezero and left telltale signs . There are both biological and non-biological mechanisms that create organics. \"Curiosity also discovered organics at its landing site within Gale Crater,\" said Luther Beegle, SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What SHERLOC adds to the story is its capability to map the spatial distribution of organics inside rocks and relate those organics to minerals found there. This helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed. More analysis needs to be done to determine the method of production for the identified organics.\" The preservation of organics inside ancient rocks - regardless of origin - at both Gale and Jezero Craters does mean that potential biosignatures could be preserved, too. \"This is a question that may not be solved until the samples are returned to Earth, but the preservation of organics is very exciting. When these samples are returned to Earth, they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years,\" Beegle said. 'Radargram'. Along with its rock-core sampling capabilities, Perseverance has brought the first ground-penetrating radar to the surface of Mars. RIMFAX creates a \"radargram\" of subsurface features up to about 33 feet deep. Data for this first released radargram was collected as the rover drove across a ridgeline from the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough\" geologic unit into the S\u00e9\u00edtah geologic unit. The ridgeline has multiple rock formations with a visible downward tilt. With RIMFAX data, Perseverance scientists now know that these angled rock layers continue at the same angle well below the surface. The radargram also shows the S\u00e9\u00edtah rock layers project below those of Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The results further confirm the science team's belief that the creation of S\u00e9\u00edtah preceded Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The ability to observe geologic features even below the surface adds a new dimension to the team's geologic mapping capabilities at Mars.

Over the previous weekend, and earlier this week, operational sequences were developed and tested to remove these rocky interlopers. With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On January 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more - from our bit carousel - join them in the not-so-distant future. With this below-chassis, preliminary imaging, in hand, the team embarked on a maneuver with our robotic arm I never imagined we would perform - ever. Simply put, we are returning the remaining contents of Sample Tube 261 back to its planet of origin. Although this scenario was never designed or planned for prior to launch, it turns out dumping a core from an open tube is a fairly straightforward process . We sent commands up yesterday, and later on today the rover's robotic arm will simply point the open end of the sample tube toward the surface of Mars and let gravity do the rest. I imagine your next question is, \"Why are you dumping out the contents of the sample tube?\" The answer is that, at present, we are not certain how much cored rock continues to reside in Tube 261. And while this rock will never make my holiday card list, the science team really seems to like it. So if our plans go well with our pebble mitigation , we may very well attempt to core \"Issole\" again. This brings me to the next steps in our pebble mitigation strategy: we're sending up commands to the rover later today, ordering it to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel. These tests will execute this weekend. Our expectations are that these rotations - and any subsequent pebble movement - will help guide our team, providing them the necessary information on how to proceed. Still, to be thorough, we are also commanding the rover to take a second set of under- chassis images, just in case one or more pebbles happen to pop free. We expect the data and imagery from these two rotation tests to be sent to Earth by next Tuesday, January 18. From there, we'll analyze and further refine our plans. If I had to ballpark it, I would estimate we'll be at our current location another week or so - or even more if we decide to re-sample Issole. So there you have it. The Perseverance team is exploring every facet of the issue to ensure that we not only get rid of this rocky debris but also prevent a similar reoccurrence during future sampling. Essentially, we are leaving no rock unturned in the pursuit of these four pebbles.

The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover's sampling attempt on Aug. 5. Although the Perseverance mission team is confident that the sample is in the tube, images in optimal lighting conditions will confirm its presence. Perseverance's Sampling and Caching System uses a rotary-percussive drill and a hollow coring bit at the end of its 7-foot-long robotic arm to extract samples slightly thicker than a pencil. Within the bit during coring is a sample tube. After completing yesterday's coring, Perseverance maneuvered the corer, bit, and open end of the sample tube in order to be imaged by the rover's Mastcam-Z instrument. The target for the sample collection attempt was a briefcase-size rock belonging to a ridgeline that is more than half-a-mile long and contains rock outcrops and boulders. The initial set of images from Mastcam-Z showed the end of a cored rock within the sample tube. After taking these images, the rover began a procedure called \"percuss to ingest,\" which vibrates the drill bit and tube for one second, five separate times. The movement is designed to clear the lip of the sample tube of any residual material. The action can also cause a sample to slide down farther into the tube. After the rover finished the percuss-to-ingest procedure, it took a second set of Mastcam-Z images. In these images, the lighting is poor, and internal portions of the sample tube are not visible. \"The project got its first cored rock under its belt, and that's a phenomenal accomplishment,\" said Jennifer Trosper, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"The team determined a location, and selected and cored a viable and scientifically valuable rock. We did what we came to do. We will work through this small hiccup with the lighting conditions in the images and remain encouraged that there is sample in this tube.\" Commands uplinked to the rover earlier today will result in images of the corer and tube to be acquired tomorrow, Sept. 3, at times of day on Mars when the Sun is angled in a more favorable position. Photos will also be taken after sunset to diminish point-sources of light that can saturate an image. The photos will be returned to Earth early in the morning of Sept. 4. If the results of this additional imaging remain inconclusive, the Perseverance team still has several options to choose from going forward, including using the Sampling and Caching System's volume probe as a final confirmation of the sample being in the tube. The Sept. 1 coring is the second time that Perseverance has employed its Sampling and Caching System since landing in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California received data that confirmed the historic milestone. The core is now enclosed in an airtight titanium sample tube , making it available for retrieval in the future. Through the Mars Sample Return campaign, NASA and ESA are planning a series of future missions to return the rover's sample tubes to Earth for closer study. These samples would be the first set of scientifically identified and selected materials returned to our planet from another. \"NASA has a history of setting ambitious goals and then accomplishing them, reflecting our nation's commitment to discovery and innovation,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"This is a momentous achievement and I can't wait to see the incredible discoveries produced by Perseverance and our team.\" Along with identifying and collecting samples of rock and regolith while searching for signs of ancient microscopic life, Perseverance's mission includes studying the Jezero region to understand the geology and ancient habitability of the area, as well as to characterize the past climate . \"For all of NASA science, this is truly a historic moment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Just as the Apollo Moon missions demonstrated the enduring scientific value of returning samples from other worlds for analysis here on our planet, we will be doing the same with the samples Perseverance collects as part of our Mars Sample Return program. Using the most sophisticated science instruments on Earth, we expect jaw-dropping discoveries across a broad set of science areas, including exploration into the question of whether life once existed on Mars.\" First Sample. The sample-taking process began on Wednesday, Sept. 1, when the rotary- percussive drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm cored into a flat, briefcase-size Mars rock nicknamed \"Rochette.\" After completing the coring process, the arm maneuvered the corer, bit, and sample tube so the rover's Mastcam-Z camera instrument could image the contents of the still-unsealed tube and transmit the results back to Earth. After mission controllers confirmed the cored rock's presence in the tube, they sent a command to complete processing of the sample. Today, at 12:34 a.m. EDT, Perseverance transferred sample tube serial number 266 and its Martian cargo into the rover's interior to measure and image the rock core. It then hermetically sealed the container, took another image, and stored the tube. \"With over 3,000 parts, the Sampling and Caching System is the most complex mechanism ever sent into space,\" said Larry D. James, interim director of JPL. \"Our Perseverance team is excited and proud to see the system perform so well on Mars and take the first step for returning samples to Earth. We also recognize that a worldwide team of NASA, industry partners, academia, and international space agencies contributed to and share in this historic success.\" First Science Campaign. Perseverance is currently exploring the rocky outcrops and boulders of \"Artuby,\" a ridgeline of more than a half-mile bordering two geologic units believed to contain Jezero Crater's deepest and most ancient layers of exposed bedrock. \"Getting the first sample under our belt is a huge milestone,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech. \"When we get these samples back on Earth, they are going to tell us a great deal about some of the earliest chapters in the evolution of Mars. But however geologically intriguing the contents of sample tube 266 will be, they won't tell the complete story of this place. There is a lot of Jezero Crater left to explore, and we will continue our journey in the months and years ahead.\" The rover's initial science foray, which spans hundreds of sols , will be complete when Perseverance returns to its landing site. At that point, Perseverance will have traveled between 1.6 and 3.1 miles and may have filled as many as eight of its 43 sample tubes. After that, Perseverance will travel north, then west, toward the location of its second science campaign: Jezero Crater's delta region. The delta is the fan-shaped remains of the spot where an ancient river met a lake within the crater. The region may be especially rich in clay minerals. On Earth, such minerals can preserve fossilized signs of ancient microscopic life and are often associated with biological processes.

After collecting its first sample , named \"Montdenier,\" Sept. 6, the team collected a second, \"Montagnac,\" from the same rock Sept. 8. Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. \"It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.\" The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed. Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past. What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life. The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a \"flash in the pan\": Floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example. But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample- acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long time.

The Perseverance team is exploring every facet of the issue to ensure that we not only get rid of this rocky debris but also prevent a similar reoccurrence during future sampling.

The twin of the Perseverance rover that is exploring Jezero Crater on Mars is performing a crucial job: navigating the Mars Yard's slopes and hazards, drilling sample cores from boulders, and storing the samples in metal tubes - just like Perseverance is doing in its hunt for signs of ancient microbial life. The recently upgraded rover has already begun testing out new equipment. The tests help ensure that OPTIMISM's twin on Mars can safely execute the commands sent by controllers on Earth. They also could potentially reveal unexpected problems Perseverance might encounter. \"The size and shape of rocks in the visual field - will they turn into obstacles or not?\" said Bryan Martin, the flight software and test beds manager at JPL. \"We test a lot of that, figure out what kinds of things to avoid. What we have safely traversed around here has informed rover drivers in planning their traverses on Mars. We've done so much testing on the ground we can be confident in it. It works.\" About as long as a doubles tennis court and twice as wide, the Mars Yard has served as a testing ground for many a fully-engineered rover twin - from the engineering model of the very first, tiny Sojourner that landed on Mars in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity missions that began in 2004 to the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers exploring Mars today. In each case, a rover double has scaled slopes, dodged obstacles, or helped rover planners puzzle out new paths on the simulated patch of Mars. OPTIMISM first rolled out into the Mars Yard in September 2020, when it conducted mobility tests. But it recently received some key updates to match features available on Perseverance, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the exquisitely complex sample caching system. And while the team has already performed tests using the coring drill at the end of OPTIMISM's robotic arm, they'll be testing the newly installed Adaptive Caching Assembly for the first time in the Mars Yard. The assembly on Perseverance is responsible for storing rock and sediment samples. Some or all of these initial samples could be among those returned to Earth by a future mission. \"Now we can do it end-to-end in the test bed,\" said the Vehicle System Ted Bed systems engineering lead, Jose G. Trujillo-Rojas. \"Drill into the rock, collect the core sample, and now we have the mechanism responsible to cache that sample in the cylinder.\" And if problems arise on Perseverance on Mars, OPTIMISM can be used as a platform to figure out what went wrong and also how to fix it. Drilling core samples from terrestrial rocks in the Mars Yard and sealing them in metal tubes is not as straightforward as it might sound. JPL's Mars team provides a variety of rock types for OPTIMISM to drill through, since the exact nature of the rock Perseverance will encounter often can't be known in advance. Terrain is a variable, too: One previous test with the robotic arm involved parking the rover on a slope, then instructing it to drill. \"There was a possibility that the rover might slip,\" Trujillo-Rojas said. \"We wanted to test that first here on Earth before sending instructions to the rover on Mars. That was scary, because you can imagine if you drill this way, and the rover slightly slipped back, the drill could have gotten stuck.\" OPTIMISM drilled the core successfully, suggesting Perseverance also could pull off drilling on a slope if required. With longer drives in Perseverance's near future, another job for the Earth- bound twin will involve presenting new challenges to the rover's autonomous navigation system, or AutoNav. Perseverance uses a powerful computer to make 3D maps using rover images of the terrain ahead and uses those maps to plan its drive with minimal human assistance. In Mars Yard tests, the twin rover might pause as it \"thinks through\" several possible choices - or even decides, unexpectedly, to avoid obstacles altogether and just go around. Of course, OPTIMISM and its human team must contend with environmental factors very different from those encountered by Perseverance, which is built for freezing temperatures and intense radiation. Earth's stronger gravity required OPTIMISM's metal wheels to be thicker than its Martian counterpart's. And its electronics sometimes must be cooled to avoid damage from Southern California's summer temperatures - the opposite of the problem caused by deep cold on Mars. The rover twin's testing and staffing schedules had to contend with COVID-19. Now, a revamped OPTIMISM is ready to get back to work.

NASA's Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on February 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton , Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet , served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE , the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles. The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor - the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology for the formation of Jezero Crater,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Each one is carefully considered for its scientific value.\" Counting the Eons. Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the \"Ch'al\" rock type , a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative of what's seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero's formation and the lake that once resided there. Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon's surface by counting its impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They've taken those lessons to narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is - and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars' geological history. \"Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and extrapolate that to Mars,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the rover mission. \"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.\" The mission hasn't been without challenges. The rover's first attempt at drilling a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits. Perseverance's airborne companion, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance's team to plan the path ahead. To the west of \" Octavia E. Butler Landing ,\" where Perseverance started its journey, are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake in Jezero Crater.

The discovery has implications for understanding and accurately dating critical events in the history of Jezero Crater - as well as the rest of the planet. The team has also concluded that rocks in the crater have interacted with water multiple times over the eons and that some contain organic molecules. These and other findings were presented today during a news briefing at the American Geophysical Union fall science meeting in New Orleans. Even before Perseverance touched down on Mars, the mission's science team had wondered about the origin of the rocks in the area. Were they sedimentary - the compressed accumulation of mineral particles possibly carried to the location by an ancient river system? Or where they igneous, possibly born in lava flows rising to the surface from a now long-extinct Martian volcano? \"I was beginning to despair we would never find the answer,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena. \"But then our PIXL instrument got a good look at the abraded patch of a rock from the area nicknamed 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah,' and it all became clear: The crystals within the rock provided the smoking gun.\" The drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm can abrade, or grind, rock surfaces to allow other instruments, such as PIXL, to study them. Short for Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, PIXL uses X-ray fluorescence to map the elemental composition of rocks. On Nov. 12, PIXL analyzed a South S\u00e9\u00edtah rock the science team had chosen to take a core sample from using the rover's drill. The PIXL data showed the rock, nicknamed \"Brac,\" to be composed of an unusual abundance of large olivine crystals engulfed in pyroxene crystals. \"A good geology student will tell you that such a texture indicates the rock formed when crystals grew and settled in a slowly cooling magma - for example a thick lava flow, lava lake, or magma chamber,\" said Farley. \"The rock was then altered by water several times, making it a treasure trove that will allow future scientists to date events in Jezero, better understand the period in which water was more common on its surface, and reveal the early history of the planet. Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from!\" The multi-mission Mars Sample Return campaign began with Perseverance, which is collecting Martian rock samples in search of ancient microscopic life. Of Perseverance's 43 sample tubes, six have been sealed to date - four with rock cores, one with Martian atmosphere, and one that contained \"witness\" material to observe any contamination the rover might have brought from Earth. Mars Sample Return seeks to bring select tubes back to Earth, where generations of scientists will be able to study them with powerful lab equipment far too large to send to Mars. Still to be determined is whether the olivine-rich rock formed in a thick lava lake cooling on the surface or in a subterranean chamber that was later exposed by erosion. Organic Molecules. Also great news for Mars Sample Return is the discovery of organic compounds by the SHERLOC instrument. The carbon-containing molecules are not only in the interiors of abraded rocks SHERLOC analyzed, but in the dust on non-abraded rock. Confirmation of organics is not a confirmation that life once existed in Jezero and left telltale signs . There are both biological and non-biological mechanisms that create organics. \"Curiosity also discovered organics at its landing site within Gale Crater,\" said Luther Beegle, SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What SHERLOC adds to the story is its capability to map the spatial distribution of organics inside rocks and relate those organics to minerals found there. This helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed. More analysis needs to be done to determine the method of production for the identified organics.\" The preservation of organics inside ancient rocks - regardless of origin - at both Gale and Jezero Craters does mean that potential biosignatures could be preserved, too. \"This is a question that may not be solved until the samples are returned to Earth, but the preservation of organics is very exciting. When these samples are returned to Earth, they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years,\" Beegle said. 'Radargram'. Along with its rock-core sampling capabilities, Perseverance has brought the first ground-penetrating radar to the surface of Mars. RIMFAX creates a \"radargram\" of subsurface features up to about 33 feet deep. Data for this first released radargram was collected as the rover drove across a ridgeline from the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough\" geologic unit into the S\u00e9\u00edtah geologic unit. The ridgeline has multiple rock formations with a visible downward tilt. With RIMFAX data, Perseverance scientists now know that these angled rock layers continue at the same angle well below the surface. The radargram also shows the S\u00e9\u00edtah rock layers project below those of Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The results further confirm the science team's belief that the creation of S\u00e9\u00edtah preceded Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The ability to observe geologic features even below the surface adds a new dimension to the team's geologic mapping capabilities at Mars.

Over the previous weekend, and earlier this week, operational sequences were developed and tested to remove these rocky interlopers. With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On January 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more - from our bit carousel - join them in the not-so-distant future. With this below-chassis, preliminary imaging, in hand, the team embarked on a maneuver with our robotic arm I never imagined we would perform - ever. Simply put, we are returning the remaining contents of Sample Tube 261 back to its planet of origin. Although this scenario was never designed or planned for prior to launch, it turns out dumping a core from an open tube is a fairly straightforward process . We sent commands up yesterday, and later on today the rover's robotic arm will simply point the open end of the sample tube toward the surface of Mars and let gravity do the rest. I imagine your next question is, \"Why are you dumping out the contents of the sample tube?\" The answer is that, at present, we are not certain how much cored rock continues to reside in Tube 261. And while this rock will never make my holiday card list, the science team really seems to like it. So if our plans go well with our pebble mitigation , we may very well attempt to core \"Issole\" again. This brings me to the next steps in our pebble mitigation strategy: we're sending up commands to the rover later today, ordering it to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel. These tests will execute this weekend. Our expectations are that these rotations - and any subsequent pebble movement - will help guide our team, providing them the necessary information on how to proceed.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

The PIXL data showed the rock, nicknamed \"Brac,\" to be composed of an unusual abundance of large olivine crystals engulfed in pyroxene crystals. \"A good geology student will tell you that such a texture indicates the rock formed when crystals grew and settled in a slowly cooling magma - for example a thick lava flow, lava lake, or magma chamber,\" said Farley. \"The rock was then altered by water several times, making it a treasure trove that will allow future scientists to date events in Jezero, better understand the period in which water was more common on its surface, and reveal the early history of the planet. Mars Sample Return is going to have great stuff to choose from!\" The multi-mission Mars Sample Return campaign began with Perseverance, which is collecting Martian rock samples in search of ancient microscopic life. Of Perseverance's 43 sample tubes, six have been sealed to date - four with rock cores, one with Martian atmosphere, and one that contained \"witness\" material to observe any contamination the rover might have brought from Earth. Mars Sample Return seeks to bring select tubes back to Earth, where generations of scientists will be able to study them with powerful lab equipment far too large to send to Mars. Still to be determined is whether the olivine-rich rock formed in a thick lava lake cooling on the surface or in a subterranean chamber that was later exposed by erosion. Organic Molecules. Also great news for Mars Sample Return is the discovery of organic compounds by the SHERLOC instrument. The carbon-containing molecules are not only in the interiors of abraded rocks SHERLOC analyzed, but in the dust on non-abraded rock. Confirmation of organics is not a confirmation that life once existed in Jezero and left telltale signs . There are both biological and non-biological mechanisms that create organics. \"Curiosity also discovered organics at its landing site within Gale Crater,\" said Luther Beegle, SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What SHERLOC adds to the story is its capability to map the spatial distribution of organics inside rocks and relate those organics to minerals found there. This helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed. More analysis needs to be done to determine the method of production for the identified organics.\" The preservation of organics inside ancient rocks - regardless of origin - at both Gale and Jezero Craters does mean that potential biosignatures could be preserved, too. \"This is a question that may not be solved until the samples are returned to Earth, but the preservation of organics is very exciting. When these samples are returned to Earth, they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years,\" Beegle said. 'Radargram'. Along with its rock-core sampling capabilities, Perseverance has brought the first ground-penetrating radar to the surface of Mars. RIMFAX creates a \"radargram\" of subsurface features up to about 33 feet deep. Data for this first released radargram was collected as the rover drove across a ridgeline from the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough\" geologic unit into the S\u00e9\u00edtah geologic unit. The ridgeline has multiple rock formations with a visible downward tilt. With RIMFAX data, Perseverance scientists now know that these angled rock layers continue at the same angle well below the surface. The radargram also shows the S\u00e9\u00edtah rock layers project below those of Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The results further confirm the science team's belief that the creation of S\u00e9\u00edtah preceded Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The ability to observe geologic features even below the surface adds a new dimension to the team's geologic mapping capabilities at Mars.

Over the previous weekend, and earlier this week, operational sequences were developed and tested to remove these rocky interlopers. With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On January 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more - from our bit carousel - join them in the not-so-distant future. With this below-chassis, preliminary imaging, in hand, the team embarked on a maneuver with our robotic arm I never imagined we would perform - ever. Simply put, we are returning the remaining contents of Sample Tube 261 back to its planet of origin. Although this scenario was never designed or planned for prior to launch, it turns out dumping a core from an open tube is a fairly straightforward process . We sent commands up yesterday, and later on today the rover's robotic arm will simply point the open end of the sample tube toward the surface of Mars and let gravity do the rest. I imagine your next question is, \"Why are you dumping out the contents of the sample tube?\" The answer is that, at present, we are not certain how much cored rock continues to reside in Tube 261. And while this rock will never make my holiday card list, the science team really seems to like it. So if our plans go well with our pebble mitigation , we may very well attempt to core \"Issole\" again. This brings me to the next steps in our pebble mitigation strategy: we're sending up commands to the rover later today, ordering it to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel. These tests will execute this weekend. Our expectations are that these rotations - and any subsequent pebble movement - will help guide our team, providing them the necessary information on how to proceed. Still, to be thorough, we are also commanding the rover to take a second set of under- chassis images, just in case one or more pebbles happen to pop free. We expect the data and imagery from these two rotation tests to be sent to Earth by next Tuesday, January 18. From there, we'll analyze and further refine our plans. If I had to ballpark it, I would estimate we'll be at our current location another week or so - or even more if we decide to re-sample Issole. So there you have it. The Perseverance team is exploring every facet of the issue to ensure that we not only get rid of this rocky debris but also prevent a similar reoccurrence during future sampling. Essentially, we are leaving no rock unturned in the pursuit of these four pebbles.

Short for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, OPTIMISM is more generically known as a vehicle system test bed. The twin of the Perseverance rover that is exploring Jezero Crater on Mars is performing a crucial job: navigating the Mars Yard's slopes and hazards, drilling sample cores from boulders, and storing the samples in metal tubes - just like Perseverance is doing in its hunt for signs of ancient microbial life. The recently upgraded rover has already begun testing out new equipment. The tests help ensure that OPTIMISM's twin on Mars can safely execute the commands sent by controllers on Earth. They also could potentially reveal unexpected problems Perseverance might encounter. \"The size and shape of rocks in the visual field - will they turn into obstacles or not?\" said Bryan Martin, the flight software and test beds manager at JPL. \"We test a lot of that, figure out what kinds of things to avoid. What we have safely traversed around here has informed rover drivers in planning their traverses on Mars. We've done so much testing on the ground we can be confident in it. It works.\" About as long as a doubles tennis court and twice as wide, the Mars Yard has served as a testing ground for many a fully-engineered rover twin - from the engineering model of the very first, tiny Sojourner that landed on Mars in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity missions that began in 2004 to the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers exploring Mars today. In each case, a rover double has scaled slopes, dodged obstacles, or helped rover planners puzzle out new paths on the simulated patch of Mars. OPTIMISM first rolled out into the Mars Yard in September 2020, when it conducted mobility tests. But it recently received some key updates to match features available on Perseverance, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the exquisitely complex sample caching system. And while the team has already performed tests using the coring drill at the end of OPTIMISM's robotic arm, they'll be testing the newly installed Adaptive Caching Assembly for the first time in the Mars Yard. The assembly on Perseverance is responsible for storing rock and sediment samples. Some or all of these initial samples could be among those returned to Earth by a future mission. \"Now we can do it end-to-end in the test bed,\" said the Vehicle System Ted Bed systems engineering lead, Jose G. Trujillo-Rojas. \"Drill into the rock, collect the core sample, and now we have the mechanism responsible to cache that sample in the cylinder.\" And if problems arise on Perseverance on Mars, OPTIMISM can be used as a platform to figure out what went wrong and also how to fix it. Drilling core samples from terrestrial rocks in the Mars Yard and sealing them in metal tubes is not as straightforward as it might sound. JPL's Mars team provides a variety of rock types for OPTIMISM to drill through, since the exact nature of the rock Perseverance will encounter often can't be known in advance. Terrain is a variable, too: One previous test with the robotic arm involved parking the rover on a slope, then instructing it to drill. \"There was a possibility that the rover might slip,\" Trujillo-Rojas said. \"We wanted to test that first here on Earth before sending instructions to the rover on Mars. That was scary, because you can imagine if you drill this way, and the rover slightly slipped back, the drill could have gotten stuck.\" OPTIMISM drilled the core successfully, suggesting Perseverance also could pull off drilling on a slope if required. With longer drives in Perseverance's near future, another job for the Earth- bound twin will involve presenting new challenges to the rover's autonomous navigation system, or AutoNav. Perseverance uses a powerful computer to make 3D maps using rover images of the terrain ahead and uses those maps to plan its drive with minimal human assistance. In Mars Yard tests, the twin rover might pause as it \"thinks through\" several possible choices - or even decides, unexpectedly, to avoid obstacles altogether and just go around. Of course, OPTIMISM and its human team must contend with environmental factors very different from those encountered by Perseverance, which is built for freezing temperatures and intense radiation. Earth's stronger gravity required OPTIMISM's metal wheels to be thicker than its Martian counterpart's. And its electronics sometimes must be cooled to avoid damage from Southern California's summer temperatures - the opposite of the problem caused by deep cold on Mars. The rover twin's testing and staffing schedules had to contend with COVID-19. Now, a revamped OPTIMISM is ready to get back to work.

NASA's Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on February 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton , Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet , served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE , the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles. The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor - the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology for the formation of Jezero Crater,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Each one is carefully considered for its scientific value.\" Counting the Eons. Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the \"Ch'al\" rock type , a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative of what's seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero's formation and the lake that once resided there. Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon's surface by counting its impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They've taken those lessons to narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is - and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars' geological history. \"Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and extrapolate that to Mars,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the rover mission. \"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.\" The mission hasn't been without challenges. The rover's first attempt at drilling a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits. Perseverance's airborne companion, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance's team to plan the path ahead. To the west of \" Octavia E. Butler Landing ,\" where Perseverance started its journey, are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic matter and possible biosignatures - signs of life - that may be in the environment. That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a highlight of the year to come.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples. All of this hard work has brought our total sample tube tally to 10 following our investigation of the Jezero crater floor. Up next for Perseverance is a phase we refer to as Rapid Traverse, or, more colloquially, our \"drive, drive, drive\" campaign. As the names suggest, during this phase, it's full-steam ahead; we'll be trying to make as much drive progress on each sol as we can, with the goal of reaching the location of our next science campaign as expeditiously as possible. While Perseverance is driving, the science team is busy pre-planning for our next campaign, which will take place at the Jezero crater delta . As a member of the science operations team, I'm involved in the both the development and execution of our sampling strategy and the campaign planning process for our upcoming delta campaign.

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet. Studying Phobos' orbit also allows scientists to refine predictions of when the doomed moon will crash into Mars. A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology , including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith . Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA , would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago. Its exploration tops the Perseverance science team's wish list because all the fine-grained sediment deposited at its base long ago is the mission's best bet for finding the preserved remnants of ancient microbial life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system , Perseverance is gathering rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"We've been eyeing the delta from a distance for more than a year while we explored the crater floor,\" said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"At the end of our fast traverse , we are finally able to get close to it, obtaining images of ever-greater detail revealing where we can best explore these important rocks.\" Sticking a Fork in Three Forks. The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks. The rover's six flight-grade-aluminum wheels completed 3,116.25 revolutions during the 16,617-foot journey to Three Forks. Averaging 692 feet per drive , the rover's artificial- intelligence-assisted autonavigation capability, or AutoNav , assessed 10,744 navigation camera images during the road trip and commanded the rover to halt and turn in place to negotiate surface hazards 55 times.

We are back to standard operations now, and the team is beginning our Delta Front Campaign . For more on why exploring the delta is so thrilling, check out last week's article . We haven't left the Crater Floor Campaign totally behind us though, as we'll investigate the contact between the rocks of the crater floor and those that make up the delta, as well as between different types of crater floor rocks named 'M\u00e1az' and 'S\u00e9\u00edtah.' Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks. Was the transition from one type of rock to another gradual or abrupt? Is the contact indicative of a change in the environment or how the rocks were deposited? Was there a long period of time between the different kinds of rocks? All of these are questions that we can look into at contacts, and they will help us better understand the history of Jezero crater. Analyzing rover data is one way we learn about Mars' geologic past, but planetary geologists can also study \"terrestrial analogs.\" These are locations on Earth where we can make valuable comparisons to what we see on other planetary bodies, such as Mars, to help us understand their landscapes. I've enjoyed hearing comparisons between Jezero and Earth from members of our Science Team; most recently we discussed how the Jezero delta sediments might be similar to those in Greece.

The team has also concluded that rocks in the crater have interacted with water multiple times over the eons and that some contain organic molecules. These and other findings were presented today during a news briefing at the American Geophysical Union fall science meeting in New Orleans. Even before Perseverance touched down on Mars, the mission's science team had wondered about the origin of the rocks in the area. Were they sedimentary - the compressed accumulation of mineral particles possibly carried to the location by an ancient river system? Or where they igneous, possibly born in lava flows rising to the surface from a now long-extinct Martian volcano? \"I was beginning to despair we would never find the answer,\" said Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena. \"But then our PIXL instrument got a good look at the abraded patch of a rock from the area nicknamed 'South S\u00e9\u00edtah,' and it all became clear: The crystals within the rock provided the smoking gun.\" The drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm can abrade, or grind, rock surfaces to allow other instruments, such as PIXL, to study them.

Of Perseverance's 43 sample tubes, six have been sealed to date - four with rock cores, one with Martian atmosphere, and one that contained \"witness\" material to observe any contamination the rover might have brought from Earth. Mars Sample Return seeks to bring select tubes back to Earth, where generations of scientists will be able to study them with powerful lab equipment far too large to send to Mars. Still to be determined is whether the olivine-rich rock formed in a thick lava lake cooling on the surface or in a subterranean chamber that was later exposed by erosion. Organic Molecules. Also great news for Mars Sample Return is the discovery of organic compounds by the SHERLOC instrument. The carbon-containing molecules are not only in the interiors of abraded rocks SHERLOC analyzed, but in the dust on non-abraded rock. Confirmation of organics is not a confirmation that life once existed in Jezero and left telltale signs . There are both biological and non-biological mechanisms that create organics. \"Curiosity also discovered organics at its landing site within Gale Crater,\" said Luther Beegle, SHERLOC principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"What SHERLOC adds to the story is its capability to map the spatial distribution of organics inside rocks and relate those organics to minerals found there. This helps us understand the environment in which the organics formed. More analysis needs to be done to determine the method of production for the identified organics.\" The preservation of organics inside ancient rocks - regardless of origin - at both Gale and Jezero Craters does mean that potential biosignatures could be preserved, too. \"This is a question that may not be solved until the samples are returned to Earth, but the preservation of organics is very exciting. When these samples are returned to Earth, they will be a source of scientific inquiry and discovery for many years,\" Beegle said. 'Radargram'. Along with its rock-core sampling capabilities, Perseverance has brought the first ground-penetrating radar to the surface of Mars. RIMFAX creates a \"radargram\" of subsurface features up to about 33 feet deep. Data for this first released radargram was collected as the rover drove across a ridgeline from the \"Crater Floor Fractured Rough\" geologic unit into the S\u00e9\u00edtah geologic unit. The ridgeline has multiple rock formations with a visible downward tilt. With RIMFAX data, Perseverance scientists now know that these angled rock layers continue at the same angle well below the surface. The radargram also shows the S\u00e9\u00edtah rock layers project below those of Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The results further confirm the science team's belief that the creation of S\u00e9\u00edtah preceded Crater Floor Fractured Rough. The ability to observe geologic features even below the surface adds a new dimension to the team's geologic mapping capabilities at Mars.

Over the previous weekend, and earlier this week, operational sequences were developed and tested to remove these rocky interlopers. With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On January 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more - from our bit carousel - join them in the not-so-distant future. With this below-chassis, preliminary imaging, in hand, the team embarked on a maneuver with our robotic arm I never imagined we would perform - ever. Simply put, we are returning the remaining contents of Sample Tube 261 back to its planet of origin. Although this scenario was never designed or planned for prior to launch, it turns out dumping a core from an open tube is a fairly straightforward process . We sent commands up yesterday, and later on today the rover's robotic arm will simply point the open end of the sample tube toward the surface of Mars and let gravity do the rest. I imagine your next question is, \"Why are you dumping out the contents of the sample tube?\" The answer is that, at present, we are not certain how much cored rock continues to reside in Tube 261. And while this rock will never make my holiday card list, the science team really seems to like it. So if our plans go well with our pebble mitigation , we may very well attempt to core \"Issole\" again. This brings me to the next steps in our pebble mitigation strategy: we're sending up commands to the rover later today, ordering it to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel. These tests will execute this weekend. Our expectations are that these rotations - and any subsequent pebble movement - will help guide our team, providing them the necessary information on how to proceed. Still, to be thorough, we are also commanding the rover to take a second set of under- chassis images, just in case one or more pebbles happen to pop free. We expect the data and imagery from these two rotation tests to be sent to Earth by next Tuesday, January 18. From there, we'll analyze and further refine our plans. If I had to ballpark it, I would estimate we'll be at our current location another week or so - or even more if we decide to re-sample Issole. So there you have it. The Perseverance team is exploring every facet of the issue to ensure that we not only get rid of this rocky debris but also prevent a similar reoccurrence during future sampling. Essentially, we are leaving no rock unturned in the pursuit of these four pebbles.

Short for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, OPTIMISM is more generically known as a vehicle system test bed. The twin of the Perseverance rover that is exploring Jezero Crater on Mars is performing a crucial job: navigating the Mars Yard's slopes and hazards, drilling sample cores from boulders, and storing the samples in metal tubes - just like Perseverance is doing in its hunt for signs of ancient microbial life. The recently upgraded rover has already begun testing out new equipment. The tests help ensure that OPTIMISM's twin on Mars can safely execute the commands sent by controllers on Earth. They also could potentially reveal unexpected problems Perseverance might encounter. \"The size and shape of rocks in the visual field - will they turn into obstacles or not?\" said Bryan Martin, the flight software and test beds manager at JPL. \"We test a lot of that, figure out what kinds of things to avoid. What we have safely traversed around here has informed rover drivers in planning their traverses on Mars. We've done so much testing on the ground we can be confident in it. It works.\" About as long as a doubles tennis court and twice as wide, the Mars Yard has served as a testing ground for many a fully-engineered rover twin - from the engineering model of the very first, tiny Sojourner that landed on Mars in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity missions that began in 2004 to the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers exploring Mars today. In each case, a rover double has scaled slopes, dodged obstacles, or helped rover planners puzzle out new paths on the simulated patch of Mars. OPTIMISM first rolled out into the Mars Yard in September 2020, when it conducted mobility tests. But it recently received some key updates to match features available on Perseverance, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the exquisitely complex sample caching system. And while the team has already performed tests using the coring drill at the end of OPTIMISM's robotic arm, they'll be testing the newly installed Adaptive Caching Assembly for the first time in the Mars Yard. The assembly on Perseverance is responsible for storing rock and sediment samples. Some or all of these initial samples could be among those returned to Earth by a future mission. \"Now we can do it end-to-end in the test bed,\" said the Vehicle System Ted Bed systems engineering lead, Jose G. Trujillo-Rojas. \"Drill into the rock, collect the core sample, and now we have the mechanism responsible to cache that sample in the cylinder.\" And if problems arise on Perseverance on Mars, OPTIMISM can be used as a platform to figure out what went wrong and also how to fix it. Drilling core samples from terrestrial rocks in the Mars Yard and sealing them in metal tubes is not as straightforward as it might sound. JPL's Mars team provides a variety of rock types for OPTIMISM to drill through, since the exact nature of the rock Perseverance will encounter often can't be known in advance. Terrain is a variable, too: One previous test with the robotic arm involved parking the rover on a slope, then instructing it to drill. \"There was a possibility that the rover might slip,\" Trujillo-Rojas said. \"We wanted to test that first here on Earth before sending instructions to the rover on Mars. That was scary, because you can imagine if you drill this way, and the rover slightly slipped back, the drill could have gotten stuck.\" OPTIMISM drilled the core successfully, suggesting Perseverance also could pull off drilling on a slope if required. With longer drives in Perseverance's near future, another job for the Earth- bound twin will involve presenting new challenges to the rover's autonomous navigation system, or AutoNav. Perseverance uses a powerful computer to make 3D maps using rover images of the terrain ahead and uses those maps to plan its drive with minimal human assistance. In Mars Yard tests, the twin rover might pause as it \"thinks through\" several possible choices - or even decides, unexpectedly, to avoid obstacles altogether and just go around. Of course, OPTIMISM and its human team must contend with environmental factors very different from those encountered by Perseverance, which is built for freezing temperatures and intense radiation. Earth's stronger gravity required OPTIMISM's metal wheels to be thicker than its Martian counterpart's. And its electronics sometimes must be cooled to avoid damage from Southern California's summer temperatures - the opposite of the problem caused by deep cold on Mars. The rover twin's testing and staffing schedules had to contend with COVID-19. Now, a revamped OPTIMISM is ready to get back to work.

NASA's Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on February 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton , Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet , served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE , the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles. The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor - the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology for the formation of Jezero Crater,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Each one is carefully considered for its scientific value.\" Counting the Eons. Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the \"Ch'al\" rock type , a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative of what's seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero's formation and the lake that once resided there. Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon's surface by counting its impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They've taken those lessons to narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is - and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars' geological history. \"Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and extrapolate that to Mars,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the rover mission. \"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.\" The mission hasn't been without challenges. The rover's first attempt at drilling a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits. Perseverance's airborne companion, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance's team to plan the path ahead. To the west of \" Octavia E. Butler Landing ,\" where Perseverance started its journey, are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic matter and possible biosignatures - signs of life - that may be in the environment. That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a highlight of the year to come.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples. All of this hard work has brought our total sample tube tally to 10 following our investigation of the Jezero crater floor. Up next for Perseverance is a phase we refer to as Rapid Traverse, or, more colloquially, our \"drive, drive, drive\" campaign. As the names suggest, during this phase, it's full-steam ahead; we'll be trying to make as much drive progress on each sol as we can, with the goal of reaching the location of our next science campaign as expeditiously as possible. While Perseverance is driving, the science team is busy pre-planning for our next campaign, which will take place at the Jezero crater delta . As a member of the science operations team, I'm involved in the both the development and execution of our sampling strategy and the campaign planning process for our upcoming delta campaign. I feel a deep sense of connection to the samples that Perseverance collects in Jezero crater, and I'm very excited to see what the delta holds for us!

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet. Studying Phobos' orbit also allows scientists to refine predictions of when the doomed moon will crash into Mars. A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology , including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith . Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA , would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago. Its exploration tops the Perseverance science team's wish list because all the fine-grained sediment deposited at its base long ago is the mission's best bet for finding the preserved remnants of ancient microbial life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system , Perseverance is gathering rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"We've been eyeing the delta from a distance for more than a year while we explored the crater floor,\" said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"At the end of our fast traverse , we are finally able to get close to it, obtaining images of ever-greater detail revealing where we can best explore these important rocks.\" Sticking a Fork in Three Forks. The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks. The rover's six flight-grade-aluminum wheels completed 3,116.25 revolutions during the 16,617-foot journey to Three Forks. Averaging 692 feet per drive , the rover's artificial- intelligence-assisted autonavigation capability, or AutoNav , assessed 10,744 navigation camera images during the road trip and commanded the rover to halt and turn in place to negotiate surface hazards 55 times.

We are back to standard operations now, and the team is beginning our Delta Front Campaign . For more on why exploring the delta is so thrilling, check out last week's article . We haven't left the Crater Floor Campaign totally behind us though, as we'll investigate the contact between the rocks of the crater floor and those that make up the delta, as well as between different types of crater floor rocks named 'M\u00e1az' and 'S\u00e9\u00edtah.' Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks. Was the transition from one type of rock to another gradual or abrupt? Is the contact indicative of a change in the environment or how the rocks were deposited? Was there a long period of time between the different kinds of rocks? All of these are questions that we can look into at contacts, and they will help us better understand the history of Jezero crater. Analyzing rover data is one way we learn about Mars' geologic past, but planetary geologists can also study \"terrestrial analogs.\" These are locations on Earth where we can make valuable comparisons to what we see on other planetary bodies, such as Mars, to help us understand their landscapes. I've enjoyed hearing comparisons between Jezero and Earth from members of our Science Team; most recently we discussed how the Jezero delta sediments might be similar to those in Greece. As a British-Greek member of the team, I used to drive through the Gulf of Corinth each summer to visit family in \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 . Little did I know that I was gazing out the window at a wonderful analog for some of the deltaic features we're seeing in Jezero today! Over the next few months, we'll use the entire suite of Perseverance instruments to explore the delta. We expect to find rocks that will be rather different from the igneous rocks of the crater floor. During that exploration, we will also take samples of some of the most interesting and astrobiologically promising rocks. I can't wait to see what Perseverance will find!

Among the highest priority rocks to sample are those that make up the well-preserved delta located on the western side of Jezero Crater . This delta was one of the key features that drew researchers to this landing site in their search for ancient Martian life. A close examination of deltaic rocks is essential for understanding their depositional environment and determining whether this paleoenvironment may have been habitable. Since landing in Jezero crater last year, the rover has been investigating and drilling crater floor rocks to add to the sample cache. But the rover hadn't yet had access to the coveted deltaic rocks-until now, that is. After conducting a \"rapid traverse\" toward the delta , Perseverance finally arrived at the delta front. Last week the rover parked at a site called Enchanted Lake , where the team was hopeful we might sample deltaic rocks for the very first time. However, because the rover can only collect a limited number of samples, the team must carefully weigh all options, keeping in mind what has already been sampled as well as attempting to predict what we may encounter along the rest of the traverse. Even though we are eager to drill into the delta, we must exercise caution. So, our first action item at Enchanted Lake was to examine the rocks there using the rover's remote science instruments in order to decide whether they fit the desired criteria for sampling. The rocks at this site displayed many distinct-and interesting!-characteristics compared to the others we have studied thus far in Jezero. Yet after a thorough assessment, the team decided to forego sampling at this location. It was a tough decision to make, but we feel optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. The data collected at Enchanted Lake will be used instead to build context for future investigations of the delta. The rover is now headed east toward a location called Hawksbill Gap, another promising location for sampling the delta. While traversing along the delta front, Perseverance will continue to collect data to help characterize the contact between the crater floor and deltaic rocks before ascending onto the delta itself.

Perseverance serves as the base station for Ingenuity, allowing the helicopter to send data to and receive commands from Earth. While more data downlinks and analysis are required, the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams believe they have identified the source of the anomaly and devised a plan to resume normal operations. Ingenuity became the first powered aircraft to operate on another world on April 19, 2021. Designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over a span of 30 Martian days , or close to 31 Earth days, the rotorcraft has now flown over 4.2 miles across 28 sorties while operating from the surface of the Red Planet for over a year. Data downlinked indicates that the communications dropout on May 3, Sol 427 of the Perseverance rover's mission at Mars, was a result of the solar-powered helicopter entering a low-power state, potentially due to the seasonal increase in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere and lower temperatures as winter approaches. The dust diminishes the amount of sunlight hitting the solar array, reducing Ingenuity's ability to recharge its six lithium-ion batteries. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's field-programmable gate array was powered down. The FPGA manages Ingenuity's operational state, switching the other avionics elements on and off as needed to maximize power conservation. It also operates the heaters that enable the helicopter to survive frigid Martian nights, maintains precise spacecraft time, and controls when the helicopter is scheduled to wake up for communications sessions with Perseverance. When the FPGA lost power during the Martian night, the helicopter's onboard clock - which designates the time that communications with Perseverance occur - reset. And Ingenuity's heaters, so vital to keeping electronics and other components within operational temperatures - turned off. When the Sun rose the next morning and the solar array began to charge the batteries, the helicopter's clock was no longer in sync with the clock aboard the rover. Essentially, when Ingenuity thought it was time to contact Perseverance, the rover's base station wasn't listening. To make sure Perseverance would hear a call, Perseverance mission controllers at JPL commanded the rover to spend almost all of Sol 429 listening for the helicopter's signal. It came at 11:45 a.m. local Mars time. The data transmitted was limited to deliberately preserve battery charge, but the helicopter's critical health and safety data were nominal. The radio link between Ingenuity and Perseverance was stable, spacecraft temperatures were within expectation, the solar array was recharging the battery at a rate expected for this season, and the battery was healthy, containing 41% of a full charge. But one radio communications session does not mean Ingenuity is out of the woods. The increased dust in the air means charging the helicopter's batteries to a level that will allow important components to remain energized throughout the night presents a significant challenge. Each night for the past three sols, Ingenuity's heaters have kicked in when its battery temperature was below 5 degrees Fahrenheit . While on, the heaters kept the temperature of vital helicopter components from dropping farther - down to the ambient environmental temperature of minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit . But the team believes that the battery couldn't sustain the energy draw of the onboard heaters throughout the night. \"We have always known that Martian winter and dust storm season would present new challenges for Ingenuity, specifically colder sols, an increase in atmospheric dust, and more frequent dust storms,\" said Ingenuity Team Lead Teddy Tzanetos of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Every flight and every mile of distance flown beyond our original 30-sol mission has pushed the spacecraft to its limits each and every sol on Mars.\" The Ingenuity and Perseverance teams have designed a plan they hope will make a difference. Their goal is to help the helicopter's battery accumulate enough of a charge during the next few sols so that it could support all necessary spacecraft systems during the cold Martian night. Uplinked yesterday, the new commands lower the point at which the helicopter energizes its heaters from when the battery falls below 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . The helicopter then shuts down quickly, rather than consuming the battery charge with the heaters. The team hopes this strategy will allow the battery to retain whatever charge it collected during the day. The Ingenuity engineers hope that after several days of the helicopter's array soaking in the limited rays, the battery will have reached a point where the spacecraft can return to normal operations. Allowing the heaters to remain off overnight will conserve a great deal of battery energy but will also expose components to the cold of Martian night. Developed as a technology demonstration to prove that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible, the 4-pound rotorcraft carries many commercial off-the-shelf parts that weren't designed for the extreme cold of deep space operations. \"Our top priority is to maintain communications with Ingenuity in the next few sols, but even then, we know that there will be significant challenges ahead,\" said Tzanetos. \"I could not be prouder of our team's performance over the last year, let alone our aircraft's incredible achievements on Mars. We are hopeful that we can accumulate battery charge in order to return to nominal operations and continue our mission into the weeks ahead.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover: Next Stop, Hawksbill Gap", "date": "2022-05-19", "content": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover was on the move this past week after finishing up remote science activities at Enchanted Lake , an exposure of finely layered rocks that may represent some of the lowest deposits of the delta. The rover threaded its way east around large sandy dune ripples before heading north en route to Hawksbill Gap, where the team hopes to collect our first set of delta samples and eventually ascend the delta front. Planning this past week at Jezero crater has mostly focused on making drive progress with additional reconnaissance imaging to scout our upcoming walkabout and support future planning for Mars Sample Return. The team was able to reestablish communications with Ingenuity after the recent anomaly and is continuing to gather and analyze the data. Perseverance is expected to arrive at our first planned location, named Devils Tanyard, within the next few sols. There, we plan on abrading a fresh surface and getting our eyes and instruments up close to investigate the rocks and identify potential sampling sites. This will be the first of likely five proximity science stops as we ascend Hawksbill Gap up the delta stratigraphy towards a location named Rocky Top. After completing this first half of our walkabout, we plan on descending to sample at three of our favorite sites. With these three sample pairs, the team hopes to add to our Martian collectibles a set of fine-grained clay-bearing mudstones that are good candidates for preserving organics and potential ancient microbes, as well as coarser-grained sandstones to investigate material washed down from beyond Jezero and to constrain the timing of past lake activity. With each rover drive and sample, the team continues to learn more about this once watery crater and piece together the story written in the Martian rocks.

Over the previous weekend, and earlier this week, operational sequences were developed and tested to remove these rocky interlopers. With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On January 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more - from our bit carousel - join them in the not-so-distant future. With this below-chassis, preliminary imaging, in hand, the team embarked on a maneuver with our robotic arm I never imagined we would perform - ever. Simply put, we are returning the remaining contents of Sample Tube 261 back to its planet of origin. Although this scenario was never designed or planned for prior to launch, it turns out dumping a core from an open tube is a fairly straightforward process . We sent commands up yesterday, and later on today the rover's robotic arm will simply point the open end of the sample tube toward the surface of Mars and let gravity do the rest. I imagine your next question is, \"Why are you dumping out the contents of the sample tube?\" The answer is that, at present, we are not certain how much cored rock continues to reside in Tube 261. And while this rock will never make my holiday card list, the science team really seems to like it. So if our plans go well with our pebble mitigation , we may very well attempt to core \"Issole\" again. This brings me to the next steps in our pebble mitigation strategy: we're sending up commands to the rover later today, ordering it to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel. These tests will execute this weekend. Our expectations are that these rotations - and any subsequent pebble movement - will help guide our team, providing them the necessary information on how to proceed. Still, to be thorough, we are also commanding the rover to take a second set of under- chassis images, just in case one or more pebbles happen to pop free. We expect the data and imagery from these two rotation tests to be sent to Earth by next Tuesday, January 18. From there, we'll analyze and further refine our plans. If I had to ballpark it, I would estimate we'll be at our current location another week or so - or even more if we decide to re-sample Issole. So there you have it. The Perseverance team is exploring every facet of the issue to ensure that we not only get rid of this rocky debris but also prevent a similar reoccurrence during future sampling. Essentially, we are leaving no rock unturned in the pursuit of these four pebbles.

Short for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, OPTIMISM is more generically known as a vehicle system test bed. The twin of the Perseverance rover that is exploring Jezero Crater on Mars is performing a crucial job: navigating the Mars Yard's slopes and hazards, drilling sample cores from boulders, and storing the samples in metal tubes - just like Perseverance is doing in its hunt for signs of ancient microbial life. The recently upgraded rover has already begun testing out new equipment. The tests help ensure that OPTIMISM's twin on Mars can safely execute the commands sent by controllers on Earth. They also could potentially reveal unexpected problems Perseverance might encounter. \"The size and shape of rocks in the visual field - will they turn into obstacles or not?\" said Bryan Martin, the flight software and test beds manager at JPL. \"We test a lot of that, figure out what kinds of things to avoid. What we have safely traversed around here has informed rover drivers in planning their traverses on Mars. We've done so much testing on the ground we can be confident in it. It works.\" About as long as a doubles tennis court and twice as wide, the Mars Yard has served as a testing ground for many a fully-engineered rover twin - from the engineering model of the very first, tiny Sojourner that landed on Mars in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity missions that began in 2004 to the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers exploring Mars today. In each case, a rover double has scaled slopes, dodged obstacles, or helped rover planners puzzle out new paths on the simulated patch of Mars. OPTIMISM first rolled out into the Mars Yard in September 2020, when it conducted mobility tests. But it recently received some key updates to match features available on Perseverance, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the exquisitely complex sample caching system. And while the team has already performed tests using the coring drill at the end of OPTIMISM's robotic arm, they'll be testing the newly installed Adaptive Caching Assembly for the first time in the Mars Yard. The assembly on Perseverance is responsible for storing rock and sediment samples. Some or all of these initial samples could be among those returned to Earth by a future mission. \"Now we can do it end-to-end in the test bed,\" said the Vehicle System Ted Bed systems engineering lead, Jose G. Trujillo-Rojas. \"Drill into the rock, collect the core sample, and now we have the mechanism responsible to cache that sample in the cylinder.\" And if problems arise on Perseverance on Mars, OPTIMISM can be used as a platform to figure out what went wrong and also how to fix it. Drilling core samples from terrestrial rocks in the Mars Yard and sealing them in metal tubes is not as straightforward as it might sound. JPL's Mars team provides a variety of rock types for OPTIMISM to drill through, since the exact nature of the rock Perseverance will encounter often can't be known in advance. Terrain is a variable, too: One previous test with the robotic arm involved parking the rover on a slope, then instructing it to drill. \"There was a possibility that the rover might slip,\" Trujillo-Rojas said. \"We wanted to test that first here on Earth before sending instructions to the rover on Mars. That was scary, because you can imagine if you drill this way, and the rover slightly slipped back, the drill could have gotten stuck.\" OPTIMISM drilled the core successfully, suggesting Perseverance also could pull off drilling on a slope if required. With longer drives in Perseverance's near future, another job for the Earth- bound twin will involve presenting new challenges to the rover's autonomous navigation system, or AutoNav. Perseverance uses a powerful computer to make 3D maps using rover images of the terrain ahead and uses those maps to plan its drive with minimal human assistance. In Mars Yard tests, the twin rover might pause as it \"thinks through\" several possible choices - or even decides, unexpectedly, to avoid obstacles altogether and just go around. Of course, OPTIMISM and its human team must contend with environmental factors very different from those encountered by Perseverance, which is built for freezing temperatures and intense radiation. Earth's stronger gravity required OPTIMISM's metal wheels to be thicker than its Martian counterpart's. And its electronics sometimes must be cooled to avoid damage from Southern California's summer temperatures - the opposite of the problem caused by deep cold on Mars. The rover twin's testing and staffing schedules had to contend with COVID-19. Now, a revamped OPTIMISM is ready to get back to work.

NASA's Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on February 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton , Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet , served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE , the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles. The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor - the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology for the formation of Jezero Crater,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Each one is carefully considered for its scientific value.\" Counting the Eons. Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the \"Ch'al\" rock type , a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative of what's seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero's formation and the lake that once resided there. Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon's surface by counting its impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They've taken those lessons to narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is - and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars' geological history. \"Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and extrapolate that to Mars,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the rover mission. \"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.\" The mission hasn't been without challenges. The rover's first attempt at drilling a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits. Perseverance's airborne companion, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance's team to plan the path ahead. To the west of \" Octavia E. Butler Landing ,\" where Perseverance started its journey, are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic matter and possible biosignatures - signs of life - that may be in the environment. That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a highlight of the year to come.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples. All of this hard work has brought our total sample tube tally to 10 following our investigation of the Jezero crater floor. Up next for Perseverance is a phase we refer to as Rapid Traverse, or, more colloquially, our \"drive, drive, drive\" campaign. As the names suggest, during this phase, it's full-steam ahead; we'll be trying to make as much drive progress on each sol as we can, with the goal of reaching the location of our next science campaign as expeditiously as possible. While Perseverance is driving, the science team is busy pre-planning for our next campaign, which will take place at the Jezero crater delta . As a member of the science operations team, I'm involved in the both the development and execution of our sampling strategy and the campaign planning process for our upcoming delta campaign. I feel a deep sense of connection to the samples that Perseverance collects in Jezero crater, and I'm very excited to see what the delta holds for us!

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet. Studying Phobos' orbit also allows scientists to refine predictions of when the doomed moon will crash into Mars. A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology , including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith . Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA , would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago. Its exploration tops the Perseverance science team's wish list because all the fine-grained sediment deposited at its base long ago is the mission's best bet for finding the preserved remnants of ancient microbial life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system , Perseverance is gathering rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"We've been eyeing the delta from a distance for more than a year while we explored the crater floor,\" said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"At the end of our fast traverse , we are finally able to get close to it, obtaining images of ever-greater detail revealing where we can best explore these important rocks.\" Sticking a Fork in Three Forks. The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks. The rover's six flight-grade-aluminum wheels completed 3,116.25 revolutions during the 16,617-foot journey to Three Forks. Averaging 692 feet per drive , the rover's artificial- intelligence-assisted autonavigation capability, or AutoNav , assessed 10,744 navigation camera images during the road trip and commanded the rover to halt and turn in place to negotiate surface hazards 55 times.

We are back to standard operations now, and the team is beginning our Delta Front Campaign . For more on why exploring the delta is so thrilling, check out last week's article . We haven't left the Crater Floor Campaign totally behind us though, as we'll investigate the contact between the rocks of the crater floor and those that make up the delta, as well as between different types of crater floor rocks named 'M\u00e1az' and 'S\u00e9\u00edtah.' Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks. Was the transition from one type of rock to another gradual or abrupt? Is the contact indicative of a change in the environment or how the rocks were deposited? Was there a long period of time between the different kinds of rocks? All of these are questions that we can look into at contacts, and they will help us better understand the history of Jezero crater. Analyzing rover data is one way we learn about Mars' geologic past, but planetary geologists can also study \"terrestrial analogs.\" These are locations on Earth where we can make valuable comparisons to what we see on other planetary bodies, such as Mars, to help us understand their landscapes. I've enjoyed hearing comparisons between Jezero and Earth from members of our Science Team; most recently we discussed how the Jezero delta sediments might be similar to those in Greece. As a British-Greek member of the team, I used to drive through the Gulf of Corinth each summer to visit family in \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 . Little did I know that I was gazing out the window at a wonderful analog for some of the deltaic features we're seeing in Jezero today! Over the next few months, we'll use the entire suite of Perseverance instruments to explore the delta. We expect to find rocks that will be rather different from the igneous rocks of the crater floor. During that exploration, we will also take samples of some of the most interesting and astrobiologically promising rocks. I can't wait to see what Perseverance will find!

Among the highest priority rocks to sample are those that make up the well-preserved delta located on the western side of Jezero Crater . This delta was one of the key features that drew researchers to this landing site in their search for ancient Martian life. A close examination of deltaic rocks is essential for understanding their depositional environment and determining whether this paleoenvironment may have been habitable. Since landing in Jezero crater last year, the rover has been investigating and drilling crater floor rocks to add to the sample cache. But the rover hadn't yet had access to the coveted deltaic rocks-until now, that is. After conducting a \"rapid traverse\" toward the delta , Perseverance finally arrived at the delta front. Last week the rover parked at a site called Enchanted Lake , where the team was hopeful we might sample deltaic rocks for the very first time. However, because the rover can only collect a limited number of samples, the team must carefully weigh all options, keeping in mind what has already been sampled as well as attempting to predict what we may encounter along the rest of the traverse. Even though we are eager to drill into the delta, we must exercise caution. So, our first action item at Enchanted Lake was to examine the rocks there using the rover's remote science instruments in order to decide whether they fit the desired criteria for sampling. The rocks at this site displayed many distinct-and interesting!-characteristics compared to the others we have studied thus far in Jezero. Yet after a thorough assessment, the team decided to forego sampling at this location. It was a tough decision to make, but we feel optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. The data collected at Enchanted Lake will be used instead to build context for future investigations of the delta. The rover is now headed east toward a location called Hawksbill Gap, another promising location for sampling the delta. While traversing along the delta front, Perseverance will continue to collect data to help characterize the contact between the crater floor and deltaic rocks before ascending onto the delta itself. But our long-awaited sample of delta rocks? For that, we'll have to wait just a little bit longer.

Earlier in the week, the rotorcraft had missed a planned communications session with the rover - for the first time in over a year of operations on the surface of Mars. Perseverance serves as the base station for Ingenuity, allowing the helicopter to send data to and receive commands from Earth. While more data downlinks and analysis are required, the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams believe they have identified the source of the anomaly and devised a plan to resume normal operations. Ingenuity became the first powered aircraft to operate on another world on April 19, 2021. Designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over a span of 30 Martian days , or close to 31 Earth days, the rotorcraft has now flown over 4.2 miles across 28 sorties while operating from the surface of the Red Planet for over a year. Data downlinked indicates that the communications dropout on May 3, Sol 427 of the Perseverance rover's mission at Mars, was a result of the solar-powered helicopter entering a low-power state, potentially due to the seasonal increase in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere and lower temperatures as winter approaches. The dust diminishes the amount of sunlight hitting the solar array, reducing Ingenuity's ability to recharge its six lithium-ion batteries. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's field-programmable gate array was powered down. The FPGA manages Ingenuity's operational state, switching the other avionics elements on and off as needed to maximize power conservation. It also operates the heaters that enable the helicopter to survive frigid Martian nights, maintains precise spacecraft time, and controls when the helicopter is scheduled to wake up for communications sessions with Perseverance. When the FPGA lost power during the Martian night, the helicopter's onboard clock - which designates the time that communications with Perseverance occur - reset. And Ingenuity's heaters, so vital to keeping electronics and other components within operational temperatures - turned off. When the Sun rose the next morning and the solar array began to charge the batteries, the helicopter's clock was no longer in sync with the clock aboard the rover. Essentially, when Ingenuity thought it was time to contact Perseverance, the rover's base station wasn't listening. To make sure Perseverance would hear a call, Perseverance mission controllers at JPL commanded the rover to spend almost all of Sol 429 listening for the helicopter's signal. It came at 11:45 a.m. local Mars time. The data transmitted was limited to deliberately preserve battery charge, but the helicopter's critical health and safety data were nominal. The radio link between Ingenuity and Perseverance was stable, spacecraft temperatures were within expectation, the solar array was recharging the battery at a rate expected for this season, and the battery was healthy, containing 41% of a full charge. But one radio communications session does not mean Ingenuity is out of the woods. The increased dust in the air means charging the helicopter's batteries to a level that will allow important components to remain energized throughout the night presents a significant challenge. Each night for the past three sols, Ingenuity's heaters have kicked in when its battery temperature was below 5 degrees Fahrenheit . While on, the heaters kept the temperature of vital helicopter components from dropping farther - down to the ambient environmental temperature of minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit . But the team believes that the battery couldn't sustain the energy draw of the onboard heaters throughout the night. \"We have always known that Martian winter and dust storm season would present new challenges for Ingenuity, specifically colder sols, an increase in atmospheric dust, and more frequent dust storms,\" said Ingenuity Team Lead Teddy Tzanetos of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Every flight and every mile of distance flown beyond our original 30-sol mission has pushed the spacecraft to its limits each and every sol on Mars.\" The Ingenuity and Perseverance teams have designed a plan they hope will make a difference. Their goal is to help the helicopter's battery accumulate enough of a charge during the next few sols so that it could support all necessary spacecraft systems during the cold Martian night. Uplinked yesterday, the new commands lower the point at which the helicopter energizes its heaters from when the battery falls below 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . The helicopter then shuts down quickly, rather than consuming the battery charge with the heaters. The team hopes this strategy will allow the battery to retain whatever charge it collected during the day. The Ingenuity engineers hope that after several days of the helicopter's array soaking in the limited rays, the battery will have reached a point where the spacecraft can return to normal operations. Allowing the heaters to remain off overnight will conserve a great deal of battery energy but will also expose components to the cold of Martian night. Developed as a technology demonstration to prove that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible, the 4-pound rotorcraft carries many commercial off-the-shelf parts that weren't designed for the extreme cold of deep space operations. \"Our top priority is to maintain communications with Ingenuity in the next few sols, but even then, we know that there will be significant challenges ahead,\" said Tzanetos. \"I could not be prouder of our team's performance over the last year, let alone our aircraft's incredible achievements on Mars. We are hopeful that we can accumulate battery charge in order to return to nominal operations and continue our mission into the weeks ahead.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover: Next Stop, Hawksbill Gap", "date": "2022-05-19", "content": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover was on the move this past week after finishing up remote science activities at Enchanted Lake , an exposure of finely layered rocks that may represent some of the lowest deposits of the delta.

Planning this past week at Jezero crater has mostly focused on making drive progress with additional reconnaissance imaging to scout our upcoming walkabout and support future planning for Mars Sample Return. The team was able to reestablish communications with Ingenuity after the recent anomaly and is continuing to gather and analyze the data. Perseverance is expected to arrive at our first planned location, named Devils Tanyard, within the next few sols. There, we plan on abrading a fresh surface and getting our eyes and instruments up close to investigate the rocks and identify potential sampling sites. This will be the first of likely five proximity science stops as we ascend Hawksbill Gap up the delta stratigraphy towards a location named Rocky Top. After completing this first half of our walkabout, we plan on descending to sample at three of our favorite sites. With these three sample pairs, the team hopes to add to our Martian collectibles a set of fine-grained clay-bearing mudstones that are good candidates for preserving organics and potential ancient microbes, as well as coarser-grained sandstones to investigate material washed down from beyond Jezero and to constrain the timing of past lake activity.

Short for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, OPTIMISM is more generically known as a vehicle system test bed. The twin of the Perseverance rover that is exploring Jezero Crater on Mars is performing a crucial job: navigating the Mars Yard's slopes and hazards, drilling sample cores from boulders, and storing the samples in metal tubes - just like Perseverance is doing in its hunt for signs of ancient microbial life. The recently upgraded rover has already begun testing out new equipment. The tests help ensure that OPTIMISM's twin on Mars can safely execute the commands sent by controllers on Earth. They also could potentially reveal unexpected problems Perseverance might encounter. \"The size and shape of rocks in the visual field - will they turn into obstacles or not?\" said Bryan Martin, the flight software and test beds manager at JPL. \"We test a lot of that, figure out what kinds of things to avoid. What we have safely traversed around here has informed rover drivers in planning their traverses on Mars. We've done so much testing on the ground we can be confident in it. It works.\" About as long as a doubles tennis court and twice as wide, the Mars Yard has served as a testing ground for many a fully-engineered rover twin - from the engineering model of the very first, tiny Sojourner that landed on Mars in 1997 to the Spirit and Opportunity missions that began in 2004 to the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers exploring Mars today. In each case, a rover double has scaled slopes, dodged obstacles, or helped rover planners puzzle out new paths on the simulated patch of Mars. OPTIMISM first rolled out into the Mars Yard in September 2020, when it conducted mobility tests. But it recently received some key updates to match features available on Perseverance, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the exquisitely complex sample caching system. And while the team has already performed tests using the coring drill at the end of OPTIMISM's robotic arm, they'll be testing the newly installed Adaptive Caching Assembly for the first time in the Mars Yard. The assembly on Perseverance is responsible for storing rock and sediment samples. Some or all of these initial samples could be among those returned to Earth by a future mission. \"Now we can do it end-to-end in the test bed,\" said the Vehicle System Ted Bed systems engineering lead, Jose G. Trujillo-Rojas. \"Drill into the rock, collect the core sample, and now we have the mechanism responsible to cache that sample in the cylinder.\" And if problems arise on Perseverance on Mars, OPTIMISM can be used as a platform to figure out what went wrong and also how to fix it. Drilling core samples from terrestrial rocks in the Mars Yard and sealing them in metal tubes is not as straightforward as it might sound. JPL's Mars team provides a variety of rock types for OPTIMISM to drill through, since the exact nature of the rock Perseverance will encounter often can't be known in advance. Terrain is a variable, too: One previous test with the robotic arm involved parking the rover on a slope, then instructing it to drill. \"There was a possibility that the rover might slip,\" Trujillo-Rojas said. \"We wanted to test that first here on Earth before sending instructions to the rover on Mars. That was scary, because you can imagine if you drill this way, and the rover slightly slipped back, the drill could have gotten stuck.\" OPTIMISM drilled the core successfully, suggesting Perseverance also could pull off drilling on a slope if required. With longer drives in Perseverance's near future, another job for the Earth- bound twin will involve presenting new challenges to the rover's autonomous navigation system, or AutoNav. Perseverance uses a powerful computer to make 3D maps using rover images of the terrain ahead and uses those maps to plan its drive with minimal human assistance. In Mars Yard tests, the twin rover might pause as it \"thinks through\" several possible choices - or even decides, unexpectedly, to avoid obstacles altogether and just go around. Of course, OPTIMISM and its human team must contend with environmental factors very different from those encountered by Perseverance, which is built for freezing temperatures and intense radiation. Earth's stronger gravity required OPTIMISM's metal wheels to be thicker than its Martian counterpart's. And its electronics sometimes must be cooled to avoid damage from Southern California's summer temperatures - the opposite of the problem caused by deep cold on Mars. The rover twin's testing and staffing schedules had to contend with COVID-19. Now, a revamped OPTIMISM is ready to get back to work.

NASA's Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on February 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton , Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet , served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE , the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet on February 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles. The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor - the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology for the formation of Jezero Crater,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Each one is carefully considered for its scientific value.\" Counting the Eons. Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the \"Ch'al\" rock type , a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative of what's seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero's formation and the lake that once resided there. Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon's surface by counting its impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They've taken those lessons to narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is - and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars' geological history. \"Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and extrapolate that to Mars,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance's deputy project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the rover mission. \"Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.\" The mission hasn't been without challenges. The rover's first attempt at drilling a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits. Perseverance's airborne companion, NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance's team to plan the path ahead. To the west of \" Octavia E. Butler Landing ,\" where Perseverance started its journey, are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic matter and possible biosignatures - signs of life - that may be in the environment. That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a highlight of the year to come.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples.

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet. Studying Phobos' orbit also allows scientists to refine predictions of when the doomed moon will crash into Mars. A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology , including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith .

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago. Its exploration tops the Perseverance science team's wish list because all the fine-grained sediment deposited at its base long ago is the mission's best bet for finding the preserved remnants of ancient microbial life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system , Perseverance is gathering rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"We've been eyeing the delta from a distance for more than a year while we explored the crater floor,\" said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"At the end of our fast traverse , we are finally able to get close to it, obtaining images of ever-greater detail revealing where we can best explore these important rocks.\" Sticking a Fork in Three Forks. The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks.

Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks. Was the transition from one type of rock to another gradual or abrupt? Is the contact indicative of a change in the environment or how the rocks were deposited? Was there a long period of time between the different kinds of rocks? All of these are questions that we can look into at contacts, and they will help us better understand the history of Jezero crater. Analyzing rover data is one way we learn about Mars' geologic past, but planetary geologists can also study \"terrestrial analogs.\" These are locations on Earth where we can make valuable comparisons to what we see on other planetary bodies, such as Mars, to help us understand their landscapes. I've enjoyed hearing comparisons between Jezero and Earth from members of our Science Team; most recently we discussed how the Jezero delta sediments might be similar to those in Greece. As a British-Greek member of the team, I used to drive through the Gulf of Corinth each summer to visit family in \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 . Little did I know that I was gazing out the window at a wonderful analog for some of the deltaic features we're seeing in Jezero today! Over the next few months, we'll use the entire suite of Perseverance instruments to explore the delta. We expect to find rocks that will be rather different from the igneous rocks of the crater floor. During that exploration, we will also take samples of some of the most interesting and astrobiologically promising rocks. I can't wait to see what Perseverance will find!

Among the highest priority rocks to sample are those that make up the well-preserved delta located on the western side of Jezero Crater . This delta was one of the key features that drew researchers to this landing site in their search for ancient Martian life. A close examination of deltaic rocks is essential for understanding their depositional environment and determining whether this paleoenvironment may have been habitable. Since landing in Jezero crater last year, the rover has been investigating and drilling crater floor rocks to add to the sample cache. But the rover hadn't yet had access to the coveted deltaic rocks-until now, that is. After conducting a \"rapid traverse\" toward the delta , Perseverance finally arrived at the delta front. Last week the rover parked at a site called Enchanted Lake , where the team was hopeful we might sample deltaic rocks for the very first time. However, because the rover can only collect a limited number of samples, the team must carefully weigh all options, keeping in mind what has already been sampled as well as attempting to predict what we may encounter along the rest of the traverse. Even though we are eager to drill into the delta, we must exercise caution. So, our first action item at Enchanted Lake was to examine the rocks there using the rover's remote science instruments in order to decide whether they fit the desired criteria for sampling. The rocks at this site displayed many distinct-and interesting!-characteristics compared to the others we have studied thus far in Jezero. Yet after a thorough assessment, the team decided to forego sampling at this location. It was a tough decision to make, but we feel optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. The data collected at Enchanted Lake will be used instead to build context for future investigations of the delta. The rover is now headed east toward a location called Hawksbill Gap, another promising location for sampling the delta. While traversing along the delta front, Perseverance will continue to collect data to help characterize the contact between the crater floor and deltaic rocks before ascending onto the delta itself. But our long-awaited sample of delta rocks? For that, we'll have to wait just a little bit longer.

Earlier in the week, the rotorcraft had missed a planned communications session with the rover - for the first time in over a year of operations on the surface of Mars. Perseverance serves as the base station for Ingenuity, allowing the helicopter to send data to and receive commands from Earth. While more data downlinks and analysis are required, the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams believe they have identified the source of the anomaly and devised a plan to resume normal operations. Ingenuity became the first powered aircraft to operate on another world on April 19, 2021. Designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over a span of 30 Martian days , or close to 31 Earth days, the rotorcraft has now flown over 4.2 miles across 28 sorties while operating from the surface of the Red Planet for over a year. Data downlinked indicates that the communications dropout on May 3, Sol 427 of the Perseverance rover's mission at Mars, was a result of the solar-powered helicopter entering a low-power state, potentially due to the seasonal increase in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere and lower temperatures as winter approaches. The dust diminishes the amount of sunlight hitting the solar array, reducing Ingenuity's ability to recharge its six lithium-ion batteries. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's field-programmable gate array was powered down. The FPGA manages Ingenuity's operational state, switching the other avionics elements on and off as needed to maximize power conservation. It also operates the heaters that enable the helicopter to survive frigid Martian nights, maintains precise spacecraft time, and controls when the helicopter is scheduled to wake up for communications sessions with Perseverance. When the FPGA lost power during the Martian night, the helicopter's onboard clock - which designates the time that communications with Perseverance occur - reset. And Ingenuity's heaters, so vital to keeping electronics and other components within operational temperatures - turned off. When the Sun rose the next morning and the solar array began to charge the batteries, the helicopter's clock was no longer in sync with the clock aboard the rover. Essentially, when Ingenuity thought it was time to contact Perseverance, the rover's base station wasn't listening. To make sure Perseverance would hear a call, Perseverance mission controllers at JPL commanded the rover to spend almost all of Sol 429 listening for the helicopter's signal. It came at 11:45 a.m. local Mars time. The data transmitted was limited to deliberately preserve battery charge, but the helicopter's critical health and safety data were nominal. The radio link between Ingenuity and Perseverance was stable, spacecraft temperatures were within expectation, the solar array was recharging the battery at a rate expected for this season, and the battery was healthy, containing 41% of a full charge. But one radio communications session does not mean Ingenuity is out of the woods. The increased dust in the air means charging the helicopter's batteries to a level that will allow important components to remain energized throughout the night presents a significant challenge. Each night for the past three sols, Ingenuity's heaters have kicked in when its battery temperature was below 5 degrees Fahrenheit . While on, the heaters kept the temperature of vital helicopter components from dropping farther - down to the ambient environmental temperature of minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit . But the team believes that the battery couldn't sustain the energy draw of the onboard heaters throughout the night. \"We have always known that Martian winter and dust storm season would present new challenges for Ingenuity, specifically colder sols, an increase in atmospheric dust, and more frequent dust storms,\" said Ingenuity Team Lead Teddy Tzanetos of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Every flight and every mile of distance flown beyond our original 30-sol mission has pushed the spacecraft to its limits each and every sol on Mars.\" The Ingenuity and Perseverance teams have designed a plan they hope will make a difference. Their goal is to help the helicopter's battery accumulate enough of a charge during the next few sols so that it could support all necessary spacecraft systems during the cold Martian night. Uplinked yesterday, the new commands lower the point at which the helicopter energizes its heaters from when the battery falls below 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . The helicopter then shuts down quickly, rather than consuming the battery charge with the heaters. The team hopes this strategy will allow the battery to retain whatever charge it collected during the day. The Ingenuity engineers hope that after several days of the helicopter's array soaking in the limited rays, the battery will have reached a point where the spacecraft can return to normal operations. Allowing the heaters to remain off overnight will conserve a great deal of battery energy but will also expose components to the cold of Martian night. Developed as a technology demonstration to prove that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible, the 4-pound rotorcraft carries many commercial off-the-shelf parts that weren't designed for the extreme cold of deep space operations. \"Our top priority is to maintain communications with Ingenuity in the next few sols, but even then, we know that there will be significant challenges ahead,\" said Tzanetos. \"I could not be prouder of our team's performance over the last year, let alone our aircraft's incredible achievements on Mars. We are hopeful that we can accumulate battery charge in order to return to nominal operations and continue our mission into the weeks ahead.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover: Next Stop, Hawksbill Gap", "date": "2022-05-19", "content": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover was on the move this past week after finishing up remote science activities at Enchanted Lake , an exposure of finely layered rocks that may represent some of the lowest deposits of the delta.

Planning this past week at Jezero crater has mostly focused on making drive progress with additional reconnaissance imaging to scout our upcoming walkabout and support future planning for Mars Sample Return. The team was able to reestablish communications with Ingenuity after the recent anomaly and is continuing to gather and analyze the data. Perseverance is expected to arrive at our first planned location, named Devils Tanyard, within the next few sols. There, we plan on abrading a fresh surface and getting our eyes and instruments up close to investigate the rocks and identify potential sampling sites. This will be the first of likely five proximity science stops as we ascend Hawksbill Gap up the delta stratigraphy towards a location named Rocky Top. After completing this first half of our walkabout, we plan on descending to sample at three of our favorite sites. With these three sample pairs, the team hopes to add to our Martian collectibles a set of fine-grained clay-bearing mudstones that are good candidates for preserving organics and potential ancient microbes, as well as coarser-grained sandstones to investigate material washed down from beyond Jezero and to constrain the timing of past lake activity.

Since arriving at the delta, \"Percy\" has been observing and abrading different rocks to investigate whether they are a good candidate for our first core sample in this area. It wasn't an easy start, as the first few rocks that were assessed either fractured too easily or had surfaces that were too rough to safely place the drill . What the team needed was a rock that met the following criteria: 1. scientifically interesting, 2. a manageable amount of surface topography, 3. large enough to fit an abrasion and two cores, and 4. predicted to be robust to drilling. The best candidate was a rock called Skinner Ridge. The first activity the rover conducted on this rock was an abrasion called Thornton Gap, and immediately the team became excited. The abrasion was very successful, exposing the inner surface of the rock without fracturing the surrounding area. Furthermore, it revealed that this rock contained individual clasts with clear boundaries. Perseverance's full instrument suite was used to investigate and document the abraded patch, then it was time to core. It turned out to be a fantastic choice. Collecting the core went very smoothly, and it was named Swift Run. At 6.70 cm long, it is our longest core of the mission so far . Perhaps even more exciting was to see that those same clasts visible in the abraded patch were also visible in the core. The drill data showed that the rock was one of the softer ones we have cored so far. It only required low levels of percussion to make progress through the rock, occasionally turning off percussion altogether when rotary-only drilling was sufficient. One last note for anyone wondering where these names come from. The Perseverance mission names areas after different national parks on Earth . Rocks, abrasions, and cores are given names related to the current area. The rover is currently in the Shenandoah quadrangle, named for the U.S. National Park in Virginia. Skinner Ridge, Thornton Gap, and Swift Run are all features in Shenandoah.

On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"The delta is so important that we've actually decided to minimize science activities and focus on driving to get there more quickly,\" said Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist. \"We'll be taking lots of images of the delta during that drive. The closer we get, the more impressive those images will be.\" The science team will be searching these images for the rocks they'll eventually want to study in closer detail using the instruments on Perseverance's arm. They'll also hunt for the best routes the rover can take to ascend the 130-foot-high delta. But first, Perseverance needs to get there. The rover will do this by relying on its self-driving AutoNav system, which has already set impressive distance records . While all of NASA's Mars rovers have had self-driving abilities, Perseverance has the most advanced one yet. \"Self-driving processes that took minutes on a rover like Opportunity happen in less than a second on Perseverance,\" said veteran rover planner and flight software developer Mark Maimone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. \"Because autonomous driving is now faster, we can cover more ground than if humans programmed every drive.\" How Rover Planning Works. Before the rover rolls, a team of mobility planning experts writes the driving commands the robotic explorer will carry out. The commands reach Mars via NASA's Deep Space Network , and Perseverance sends back data so the planners can confirm the rover's progress. Multiple days are required to complete some plans, as with a recent drive that spanned about 1,673 feet and included thousands of individual rover commands. Some drives require more human input than others. AutoNav is useful for drives over flat terrain with simple potential hazards - for instance, large rocks and slopes - that are easy for the rover to detect and work around. Thinking While Driving. AutoNav reflects an evolution of self-driving tools previously developed for NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers. What's different for AutoNav is \"thinking while driving\" - allowing Perseverance to take and process images while on the move. The rover then navigates based on those images. Is that boulder too close? Will its belly be able to clear that rock? What if the rover wheels were to slip? Upgraded hardware allows \"thinking while driving\" to happen. Faster cameras mean Perseverance can take images quickly enough to process its route in real- time. And unlike its predecessors, Perseverance has an additional computer dedicated entirely to image processing. The computer relies on a single- purpose, super-efficient microchip called a field-programmable gate array that is great for computer vision processing. \"On past rovers, autonomy meant slowing down because data had to be processed on a single computer,\" Maimone said. \"This extra computer is insanely fast compared to what we had in the past, and having it dedicated for driving means you don't have to share computing resources with over 100 other tasks.\" Of course, humans aren't completely out of the picture during AutoNav drives. They still plan the basic route using images taken from space by missions like NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Then, they mark obstacles such as potential sand traps for Perseverance to avoid, drawing \"keep out\" and \"keep in\" zones that help it navigate. Another big difference is Perseverance's sense of space. Curiosity's autonomous navigation program keeps the rover in a safety bubble that is 16 feet wide. If Curiosity spots two rocks that are, say, 15 feet apart - a gap it could easily navigate - it will still stop or travel around them rather than risk passing through. But Perseverance's bubble is much smaller: A virtual box is centered on each of the rover's six wheels. Mars' newest rover has a more sensitive understanding of the terrain and can get around boulders on its own. \"When we first looked at Jezero Crater as a landing site, we were concerned about the dense fields of rocks we saw scattered across the crater floor,\" Maimone said. \"Now we're able to skirt or even straddle rocks that we couldn't have approached before.\" While previous rover missions took a slower pace exploring along their path, AutoNav provides the science team with the ability to zip to the locations they prioritize the most. That means the mission is more focused on its primary objective: finding the samples that scientists will eventually want to return to Earth.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples. All of this hard work has brought our total sample tube tally to 10 following our investigation of the Jezero crater floor.

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet.

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago.

The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks. The rover's six flight-grade-aluminum wheels completed 3,116.25 revolutions during the 16,617-foot journey to Three Forks. Averaging 692 feet per drive , the rover's artificial- intelligence-assisted autonavigation capability, or AutoNav , assessed 10,744 navigation camera images during the road trip and commanded the rover to halt and turn in place to negotiate surface hazards 55 times.

Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks.

Earlier in the week, the rotorcraft had missed a planned communications session with the rover - for the first time in over a year of operations on the surface of Mars. Perseverance serves as the base station for Ingenuity, allowing the helicopter to send data to and receive commands from Earth. While more data downlinks and analysis are required, the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams believe they have identified the source of the anomaly and devised a plan to resume normal operations. Ingenuity became the first powered aircraft to operate on another world on April 19, 2021. Designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over a span of 30 Martian days , or close to 31 Earth days, the rotorcraft has now flown over 4.2 miles across 28 sorties while operating from the surface of the Red Planet for over a year. Data downlinked indicates that the communications dropout on May 3, Sol 427 of the Perseverance rover's mission at Mars, was a result of the solar-powered helicopter entering a low-power state, potentially due to the seasonal increase in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere and lower temperatures as winter approaches. The dust diminishes the amount of sunlight hitting the solar array, reducing Ingenuity's ability to recharge its six lithium-ion batteries. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's field-programmable gate array was powered down. The FPGA manages Ingenuity's operational state, switching the other avionics elements on and off as needed to maximize power conservation. It also operates the heaters that enable the helicopter to survive frigid Martian nights, maintains precise spacecraft time, and controls when the helicopter is scheduled to wake up for communications sessions with Perseverance. When the FPGA lost power during the Martian night, the helicopter's onboard clock - which designates the time that communications with Perseverance occur - reset. And Ingenuity's heaters, so vital to keeping electronics and other components within operational temperatures - turned off. When the Sun rose the next morning and the solar array began to charge the batteries, the helicopter's clock was no longer in sync with the clock aboard the rover. Essentially, when Ingenuity thought it was time to contact Perseverance, the rover's base station wasn't listening. To make sure Perseverance would hear a call, Perseverance mission controllers at JPL commanded the rover to spend almost all of Sol 429 listening for the helicopter's signal. It came at 11:45 a.m. local Mars time. The data transmitted was limited to deliberately preserve battery charge, but the helicopter's critical health and safety data were nominal. The radio link between Ingenuity and Perseverance was stable, spacecraft temperatures were within expectation, the solar array was recharging the battery at a rate expected for this season, and the battery was healthy, containing 41% of a full charge. But one radio communications session does not mean Ingenuity is out of the woods. The increased dust in the air means charging the helicopter's batteries to a level that will allow important components to remain energized throughout the night presents a significant challenge. Each night for the past three sols, Ingenuity's heaters have kicked in when its battery temperature was below 5 degrees Fahrenheit . While on, the heaters kept the temperature of vital helicopter components from dropping farther - down to the ambient environmental temperature of minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit . But the team believes that the battery couldn't sustain the energy draw of the onboard heaters throughout the night. \"We have always known that Martian winter and dust storm season would present new challenges for Ingenuity, specifically colder sols, an increase in atmospheric dust, and more frequent dust storms,\" said Ingenuity Team Lead Teddy Tzanetos of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Every flight and every mile of distance flown beyond our original 30-sol mission has pushed the spacecraft to its limits each and every sol on Mars.\" The Ingenuity and Perseverance teams have designed a plan they hope will make a difference. Their goal is to help the helicopter's battery accumulate enough of a charge during the next few sols so that it could support all necessary spacecraft systems during the cold Martian night. Uplinked yesterday, the new commands lower the point at which the helicopter energizes its heaters from when the battery falls below 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . The helicopter then shuts down quickly, rather than consuming the battery charge with the heaters. The team hopes this strategy will allow the battery to retain whatever charge it collected during the day. The Ingenuity engineers hope that after several days of the helicopter's array soaking in the limited rays, the battery will have reached a point where the spacecraft can return to normal operations. Allowing the heaters to remain off overnight will conserve a great deal of battery energy but will also expose components to the cold of Martian night. Developed as a technology demonstration to prove that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible, the 4-pound rotorcraft carries many commercial off-the-shelf parts that weren't designed for the extreme cold of deep space operations. \"Our top priority is to maintain communications with Ingenuity in the next few sols, but even then, we know that there will be significant challenges ahead,\" said Tzanetos. \"I could not be prouder of our team's performance over the last year, let alone our aircraft's incredible achievements on Mars.

Since arriving at the delta, \"Percy\" has been observing and abrading different rocks to investigate whether they are a good candidate for our first core sample in this area. It wasn't an easy start, as the first few rocks that were assessed either fractured too easily or had surfaces that were too rough to safely place the drill . What the team needed was a rock that met the following criteria: 1. scientifically interesting, 2. a manageable amount of surface topography, 3. large enough to fit an abrasion and two cores, and 4. predicted to be robust to drilling. The best candidate was a rock called Skinner Ridge. The first activity the rover conducted on this rock was an abrasion called Thornton Gap, and immediately the team became excited. The abrasion was very successful, exposing the inner surface of the rock without fracturing the surrounding area. Furthermore, it revealed that this rock contained individual clasts with clear boundaries. Perseverance's full instrument suite was used to investigate and document the abraded patch, then it was time to core. It turned out to be a fantastic choice. Collecting the core went very smoothly, and it was named Swift Run. At 6.70 cm long, it is our longest core of the mission so far . Perhaps even more exciting was to see that those same clasts visible in the abraded patch were also visible in the core. The drill data showed that the rock was one of the softer ones we have cored so far. It only required low levels of percussion to make progress through the rock, occasionally turning off percussion altogether when rotary-only drilling was sufficient. One last note for anyone wondering where these names come from. The Perseverance mission names areas after different national parks on Earth . Rocks, abrasions, and cores are given names related to the current area. The rover is currently in the Shenandoah quadrangle, named for the U.S. National Park in Virginia.

This site has enchanted our science team since we first visited it back April. The drive to \"Enchanted Lake\" is expected to begin in the next few days with arrival in early September. Before beginning the drive, we'll continue efforts to assess the two small, string-like pieces of foreign object debris detected on one of the rover's coring bits. The rover team feels comfortable moving forward due to progress made in its FOD investigation . Since first identified Aug. 5 in imagery of the rover's sample collection system after a 12th rock core sample was taken, the FOD has been the focus of several methodical diagnostic activities in an attempt to better understand the nature of the debris. We've commanded the rover to move, rotate, or vibrate components we think could harbor FOD. And we've obtained multiple sets of images of the components from different angles and in different lighting conditions from rover cameras: Mastcam-Z, Navcam, Hazcam, Supercam, and even the WATSON camera located on the rover's turret. Finally, a thorough review of recent coring and bit-exchange activities confirm that they all executed nominally with no indication of interference from the FOD. Analysis of the latest round of imaging, downlinked earlier today, indicates that while the two small pieces remain visible in the upper part of the drill chuck, no new FOD has been observed. In addition, imagery taken of the ground beneath the robotic arm and turret, as well as the rover deck, also showed no new FOD. Our present status reminds me of another FOD issue we encountered in January of this year. Back then, it was small pebbles in the bit carousel . Even though we knew the carousel was robust and built to operate in a dirty environment, we took our time to better understand the situation before moving on. I think the same will hold here. Our drill is also robust and designed for dirty environments. That, combined with the fact that we have detected no new debris, gives us confidence that we can begin to move forward with our Jezero Delta science investigation while continuing to do all we can to better understand the origin of the debris.

In the last week, the team reached a very special milestone as we officially completed our first science campaign focused on the Jezero crater floor. During our crater floor campaign, we kept Perseverance busy! As we learned more about our surroundings, we characterized the rocks that make up the crater floor into two formations, both of which we believe to be igneous in origin. A formation is a geologic term for a sequence of rock large enough to be mapped at the surface and be distinguishable from other formations. The first formation that Perseverance encountered is the M\u00e1az formation, and within it, we abraded 4 rocks and sealed 6 sample tubes. These tubes contain 4 rock core samples, an atmospheric sample, and a witness sample . From the second crater floor formation, the S\u00e9\u00edtah formation, we performed abrasions on 3 rocks and filled 4 sample tubes, all of which contain rock core samples. All of this hard work has brought our total sample tube tally to 10 following our investigation of the Jezero crater floor. Up next for Perseverance is a phase we refer to as Rapid Traverse, or, more colloquially, our \"drive, drive, drive\" campaign. As the names suggest, during this phase, it's full-steam ahead; we'll be trying to make as much drive progress on each sol as we can, with the goal of reaching the location of our next science campaign as expeditiously as possible.

It's the most zoomed-in, highest-frame-rate observation of a Phobos solar eclipse ever taken from the Martian surface. Several Mars rovers have observed Phobos crossing in front of the Sun over the past 18 years. Spirit and Opportunity made the first observations in 2004; Curiosity in 2019 was the first to record video of the event. Each time these eclipses are observed, they allow scientists to measure subtle shifts in Phobos' orbit over time. The moon's tidal forces pull on the deep interior crust and mantle of the Red Planet; studying how much Phobos shifts over time reveals something about how resistant the crust and mantle are, and thus what kinds of materials they're made of. It's long been known that Phobos is drifting toward the Martian surface year by year; tens of millions of years from now, it is expected to crash into the planet or fragment into chunks that will impact the planet. Studying Phobos' orbit also allows scientists to refine predictions of when the doomed moon will crash into Mars.

Dubbed \"Three Forks\" by the Perseverance team , the location serves as the staging area for the rover's second science expedition, the \"Delta Front Campaign.\" \"The delta at Jezero Crater promises to be a veritable geologic feast and one of the best locations on Mars to look for signs of past microscopic life,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"The answers are out there - and Team Perseverance is ready to find them.\" The delta, a massive fan-shaped collection of rocks and sediment at the western edge of Jezero Crater, formed at the convergence of a Martian river and a crater lake billions of years ago. Its exploration tops the Perseverance science team's wish list because all the fine-grained sediment deposited at its base long ago is the mission's best bet for finding the preserved remnants of ancient microbial life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system , Perseverance is gathering rock cores for return to Earth - the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign . \"We've been eyeing the delta from a distance for more than a year while we explored the crater floor,\" said Ken Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena. \"At the end of our fast traverse , we are finally able to get close to it, obtaining images of ever-greater detail revealing where we can best explore these important rocks.\" Sticking a Fork in Three Forks. The Delta Front Campaign kicked off Monday, April 18, with about a week's worth of driving to the southwest and then west. One goal of this excursion is to scope out the best route to ascend the delta, which rises about 130 feet above the crater floor. Two options, called \"Cape Nukshak\" and \"Hawksbill Gap,\" look traversable. The science team is leaning toward Hawksbill Gap because of the shorter drive time needed to reach the top of the delta, but that may change as the rover acquires additional information on the two options. Whichever route Perseverance takes to the plateau atop the delta, the team will perform detailed science investigations, including taking rock core samples, on the way up, then turn around and do the same thing on the way back down. The rover is expected to collect around eight samples over about half an Earth year during the Delta Front Campaign. After completing the descent, Perseverance will, according to current plans, again ascend the delta to begin the \"Delta Top Campaign,\" which will last about half an Earth year as well. \"The delta is why Perseverance was sent to Jezero Crater: It has so many interesting features,\" said Farley. \"We will look for signs of ancient life in the rocks at the base of the delta, rocks that we think were once mud on the bottom of 'Lake Jezero.' Higher up the delta, we can look at sand and rock fragments that came from upstream, perhaps from miles away. These are locations the rover will never visit. We can take advantage of an ancient Martian river that brought the planet's geological secrets to us.\" Perseverance is kicking off its second science campaign more than a month earlier than planned due to the rover's ability to autonomously negotiate Jezero Crater's sandpits, craters, boulders, and fields of sharp rocks. The rover's six flight-grade-aluminum wheels completed 3,116.25 revolutions during the 16,617-foot journey to Three Forks. Averaging 692 feet per drive , the rover's artificial- intelligence-assisted autonavigation capability, or AutoNav , assessed 10,744 navigation camera images during the road trip and commanded the rover to halt and turn in place to negotiate surface hazards 55 times.

We are back to standard operations now, and the team is beginning our Delta Front Campaign . For more on why exploring the delta is so thrilling, check out last week's article . We haven't left the Crater Floor Campaign totally behind us though, as we'll investigate the contact between the rocks of the crater floor and those that make up the delta, as well as between different types of crater floor rocks named 'M\u00e1az' and 'S\u00e9\u00edtah.' Geologists can learn a lot about the course of events by looking at contacts, which are the boundaries between different types of rocks. Was the transition from one type of rock to another gradual or abrupt? Is the contact indicative of a change in the environment or how the rocks were deposited? Was there a long period of time between the different kinds of rocks? All of these are questions that we can look into at contacts, and they will help us better understand the history of Jezero crater. Analyzing rover data is one way we learn about Mars' geologic past, but planetary geologists can also study \"terrestrial analogs.\" These are locations on Earth where we can make valuable comparisons to what we see on other planetary bodies, such as Mars, to help us understand their landscapes. I've enjoyed hearing comparisons between Jezero and Earth from members of our Science Team; most recently we discussed how the Jezero delta sediments might be similar to those in Greece. As a British-Greek member of the team, I used to drive through the Gulf of Corinth each summer to visit family in \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1 . Little did I know that I was gazing out the window at a wonderful analog for some of the deltaic features we're seeing in Jezero today! Over the next few months, we'll use the entire suite of Perseverance instruments to explore the delta. We expect to find rocks that will be rather different from the igneous rocks of the crater floor. During that exploration, we will also take samples of some of the most interesting and astrobiologically promising rocks. I can't wait to see what Perseverance will find!

Among the highest priority rocks to sample are those that make up the well-preserved delta located on the western side of Jezero Crater . This delta was one of the key features that drew researchers to this landing site in their search for ancient Martian life. A close examination of deltaic rocks is essential for understanding their depositional environment and determining whether this paleoenvironment may have been habitable. Since landing in Jezero crater last year, the rover has been investigating and drilling crater floor rocks to add to the sample cache. But the rover hadn't yet had access to the coveted deltaic rocks-until now, that is. After conducting a \"rapid traverse\" toward the delta , Perseverance finally arrived at the delta front. Last week the rover parked at a site called Enchanted Lake , where the team was hopeful we might sample deltaic rocks for the very first time. However, because the rover can only collect a limited number of samples, the team must carefully weigh all options, keeping in mind what has already been sampled as well as attempting to predict what we may encounter along the rest of the traverse. Even though we are eager to drill into the delta, we must exercise caution. So, our first action item at Enchanted Lake was to examine the rocks there using the rover's remote science instruments in order to decide whether they fit the desired criteria for sampling. The rocks at this site displayed many distinct-and interesting!-characteristics compared to the others we have studied thus far in Jezero. Yet after a thorough assessment, the team decided to forego sampling at this location. It was a tough decision to make, but we feel optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. The data collected at Enchanted Lake will be used instead to build context for future investigations of the delta. The rover is now headed east toward a location called Hawksbill Gap, another promising location for sampling the delta. While traversing along the delta front, Perseverance will continue to collect data to help characterize the contact between the crater floor and deltaic rocks before ascending onto the delta itself.

Since arriving at the delta, \"Percy\" has been observing and abrading different rocks to investigate whether they are a good candidate for our first core sample in this area. It wasn't an easy start, as the first few rocks that were assessed either fractured too easily or had surfaces that were too rough to safely place the drill . What the team needed was a rock that met the following criteria: 1. scientifically interesting, 2. a manageable amount of surface topography, 3. large enough to fit an abrasion and two cores, and 4. predicted to be robust to drilling. The best candidate was a rock called Skinner Ridge. The first activity the rover conducted on this rock was an abrasion called Thornton Gap, and immediately the team became excited. The abrasion was very successful, exposing the inner surface of the rock without fracturing the surrounding area. Furthermore, it revealed that this rock contained individual clasts with clear boundaries. Perseverance's full instrument suite was used to investigate and document the abraded patch, then it was time to core. It turned out to be a fantastic choice. Collecting the core went very smoothly, and it was named Swift Run. At 6.70 cm long, it is our longest core of the mission so far . Perhaps even more exciting was to see that those same clasts visible in the abraded patch were also visible in the core. The drill data showed that the rock was one of the softer ones we have cored so far. It only required low levels of percussion to make progress through the rock, occasionally turning off percussion altogether when rotary-only drilling was sufficient.

Among the highest priority rocks to sample are those that make up the well-preserved delta located on the western side of Jezero Crater . This delta was one of the key features that drew researchers to this landing site in their search for ancient Martian life. A close examination of deltaic rocks is essential for understanding their depositional environment and determining whether this paleoenvironment may have been habitable. Since landing in Jezero crater last year, the rover has been investigating and drilling crater floor rocks to add to the sample cache. But the rover hadn't yet had access to the coveted deltaic rocks-until now, that is. After conducting a \"rapid traverse\" toward the delta , Perseverance finally arrived at the delta front. Last week the rover parked at a site called Enchanted Lake , where the team was hopeful we might sample deltaic rocks for the very first time. However, because the rover can only collect a limited number of samples, the team must carefully weigh all options, keeping in mind what has already been sampled as well as attempting to predict what we may encounter along the rest of the traverse. Even though we are eager to drill into the delta, we must exercise caution. So, our first action item at Enchanted Lake was to examine the rocks there using the rover's remote science instruments in order to decide whether they fit the desired criteria for sampling. The rocks at this site displayed many distinct-and interesting!-characteristics compared to the others we have studied thus far in Jezero. Yet after a thorough assessment, the team decided to forego sampling at this location. It was a tough decision to make, but we feel optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. The data collected at Enchanted Lake will be used instead to build context for future investigations of the delta. The rover is now headed east toward a location called Hawksbill Gap, another promising location for sampling the delta. While traversing along the delta front, Perseverance will continue to collect data to help characterize the contact between the crater floor and deltaic rocks before ascending onto the delta itself. But our long-awaited sample of delta rocks? For that, we'll have to wait just a little bit longer.

Earlier in the week, the rotorcraft had missed a planned communications session with the rover - for the first time in over a year of operations on the surface of Mars. Perseverance serves as the base station for Ingenuity, allowing the helicopter to send data to and receive commands from Earth. While more data downlinks and analysis are required, the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams believe they have identified the source of the anomaly and devised a plan to resume normal operations. Ingenuity became the first powered aircraft to operate on another world on April 19, 2021. Designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over a span of 30 Martian days , or close to 31 Earth days, the rotorcraft has now flown over 4.2 miles across 28 sorties while operating from the surface of the Red Planet for over a year. Data downlinked indicates that the communications dropout on May 3, Sol 427 of the Perseverance rover's mission at Mars, was a result of the solar-powered helicopter entering a low-power state, potentially due to the seasonal increase in the amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere and lower temperatures as winter approaches. The dust diminishes the amount of sunlight hitting the solar array, reducing Ingenuity's ability to recharge its six lithium-ion batteries. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's field-programmable gate array was powered down. The FPGA manages Ingenuity's operational state, switching the other avionics elements on and off as needed to maximize power conservation. It also operates the heaters that enable the helicopter to survive frigid Martian nights, maintains precise spacecraft time, and controls when the helicopter is scheduled to wake up for communications sessions with Perseverance. When the FPGA lost power during the Martian night, the helicopter's onboard clock - which designates the time that communications with Perseverance occur - reset. And Ingenuity's heaters, so vital to keeping electronics and other components within operational temperatures - turned off. When the Sun rose the next morning and the solar array began to charge the batteries, the helicopter's clock was no longer in sync with the clock aboard the rover. Essentially, when Ingenuity thought it was time to contact Perseverance, the rover's base station wasn't listening. To make sure Perseverance would hear a call, Perseverance mission controllers at JPL commanded the rover to spend almost all of Sol 429 listening for the helicopter's signal. It came at 11:45 a.m. local Mars time. The data transmitted was limited to deliberately preserve battery charge, but the helicopter's critical health and safety data were nominal. The radio link between Ingenuity and Perseverance was stable, spacecraft temperatures were within expectation, the solar array was recharging the battery at a rate expected for this season, and the battery was healthy, containing 41% of a full charge. But one radio communications session does not mean Ingenuity is out of the woods. The increased dust in the air means charging the helicopter's batteries to a level that will allow important components to remain energized throughout the night presents a significant challenge. Each night for the past three sols, Ingenuity's heaters have kicked in when its battery temperature was below 5 degrees Fahrenheit . While on, the heaters kept the temperature of vital helicopter components from dropping farther - down to the ambient environmental temperature of minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit . But the team believes that the battery couldn't sustain the energy draw of the onboard heaters throughout the night. \"We have always known that Martian winter and dust storm season would present new challenges for Ingenuity, specifically colder sols, an increase in atmospheric dust, and more frequent dust storms,\" said Ingenuity Team Lead Teddy Tzanetos of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Every flight and every mile of distance flown beyond our original 30-sol mission has pushed the spacecraft to its limits each and every sol on Mars.\" The Ingenuity and Perseverance teams have designed a plan they hope will make a difference. Their goal is to help the helicopter's battery accumulate enough of a charge during the next few sols so that it could support all necessary spacecraft systems during the cold Martian night. Uplinked yesterday, the new commands lower the point at which the helicopter energizes its heaters from when the battery falls below 5 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . The helicopter then shuts down quickly, rather than consuming the battery charge with the heaters. The team hopes this strategy will allow the battery to retain whatever charge it collected during the day. The Ingenuity engineers hope that after several days of the helicopter's array soaking in the limited rays, the battery will have reached a point where the spacecraft can return to normal operations. Allowing the heaters to remain off overnight will conserve a great deal of battery energy but will also expose components to the cold of Martian night. Developed as a technology demonstration to prove that powered, controlled flight on Mars is possible, the 4-pound rotorcraft carries many commercial off-the-shelf parts that weren't designed for the extreme cold of deep space operations. \"Our top priority is to maintain communications with Ingenuity in the next few sols, but even then, we know that there will be significant challenges ahead,\" said Tzanetos. \"I could not be prouder of our team's performance over the last year, let alone our aircraft's incredible achievements on Mars. We are hopeful that we can accumulate battery charge in order to return to nominal operations and continue our mission into the weeks ahead.\" ", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-in-contact-with-perseverance-rover-after-communications-dropout/"}, {"title": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover: Next Stop, Hawksbill Gap", "date": "2022-05-19", "content": "NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover was on the move this past week after finishing up remote science activities at Enchanted Lake , an exposure of finely layered rocks that may represent some of the lowest deposits of the delta.
