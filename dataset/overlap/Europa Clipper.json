[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Eyes Mission to Jupiter Moon Europa", "date": "2012-12-13", "content": "Though NASA is devoting many of its exploration resources to Mars these days, the agency still has its eye on an icy moon of Jupiter that may be capable of supporting life as we know it. Last week, NASA officials announced that they plan to launch a $1.5 billion rover to Mars in 2020, adding to a string of Red Planet missions already on the docket. The Curiosity rover just landed this past August, for example, and an orbiter called Maven and a lander named InSight are slated to blast off in 2013 and 2016, respectively. But NASA is also thinking about ways to investigate the possible habitability of Europa, Jupiter's fourth-largest moon. One concept that may be gaining traction is a so-called \"clipper\" probe that would make multiple flybys of the moon, studying its icy shell and suspected subsurface ocean as it zooms past. \"We briefed NASA headquarters on Monday, and they responded very positively,\" mission proponent David Senske, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said here Dec. 7 at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. The $2 billion unmanned Europa Clipper, which could be ready to launch by 2021 or so, would also do vital reconnaissance work for a potential lander mission in the future, Senske told SPACE.com. Astrobiologists regard Europa, which is about 1,900 miles wide, as one of the best bets in our solar system to host life beyond Earth. The moon is believed to harbor a large ocean of liquid water beneath its icy shell. Further, this ocean is likely in direct contact with Europa's rocky mantle, raising the possibility of all sorts of interesting chemical reactions, Senske said. The irradiation of Europa's surface and tidal heating of its interior also mean the moon likely has ample energy sources - another key requirement for life as we know it. NASA has long been interested in exploring the icy moon and its ocean. Several years back, the agency drew up an ambitious mission concept called the Jupiter Europa Orbiter, which would have made detailed studies of Europa and the incredibly volcanic Jupiter moon Io. The science returns from such a mission would have been impressive, according to the 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey, which outlined the scientific community's goals in the field over the coming decade. The decadal survey ranked JEO as the second-highest priority among large-scale missions, just behind Mars sample-return. But the report said its $4.7 billion price tag was just too high. \"The recommendation was, immediately go and do a de-scope,\" said Senske, who was also involved in JEO. \"They loved the science; the science was great. But focus it.\" So researchers got to work developing a leaner, cheaper Europa mission that would fit under a firm $2 billion cost cap. They came up with two main options: the clipper and a Europa orbiter. Because of the intense radiation environment around Europa, the orbiter would have to be heavily shielded, adding weight and cost. Even with this armor, the concept initially called for a nominal design life at Europa of just 30 days, with later versions boosting that up to 109 days, Senske said. While the orbiter would gather a great deal of interesting and valuable information, it falls short of what the flyby concept could deliver on a dollar-to-dollar basis, Senske said. For example, a $2 billion orbiter would not be able to carry an instrument that could investigate the composition and chemistry of Europa's surface and atmosphere. \"In terms of an apples-to-apples comparison, Clipper really does rise to the top,\" Senske said. The Clipper would carry a number of scientific instruments, including ice- penetrating radar, a topographical imager, a magnetometer, an infrared spectrometer, a neutral mass spectrometer and a high-gain antenna. To squeeze all of this gear aboard and still stay under the $2 billion cap, Clipper may need to be powered by solar arrays rather than advanced stirling radioisotope generators as originally envisioned, Senske said. Solar panels are considerably cheaper than ASRGs, which convert the heat from plutonium-238's radioactive decay into eletricity. NASA's Jupiter-bound Juno probe also sports solar arrays, so there is precedent for sending a solar-powered spacecraft so far from the sun. But a Europa mission would present some additional challenges to address, including eclipses and radiation doses about two times higher than Juno will receive. \"We have some things that we need to test,\" Senske said. The Clipper would enter into orbit around Jupiter, then study Europa during dozens of flybys over the course of 2.3 years. On its closest passes, it would come within just 15 miles of the moon's frozen surface. These close encounters should help the probe crack some of Europa's most intriguing mysteries, such as the thickness of its ice shell and the saltiness and approximate depth of its ocean, Senske said. This information, along with the spacecraft's detailed imagery of the moon's surface, could help guide a potential lander mission that would search for signs of Europan life sometime down the road. The Clipper could probably be ready to launch between 2020 and 2022, Senske said. Its journey to Europa would take about six years. The Europa Clipper is not on NASA's books yet, but agency higher-ups and advisory committees both inside and outside the agency have given it high marks thus far, Senske said. He and the rest of the team will continue developing the mission concept and see what happens. \"In April, we want to do what we're calling a preliminary concept review, start working out the bugs, and then working with headquarters to define when we would have what's known as a mission concept review that would start getting us on the road as a full-up mission,\" Senske said. Some scientists who want close-up studies of potentially habitable moons such as Europa and the Saturn satellite Enceladus were disappointed that NASA selected another Mars rover mission for 2020. But Senske said the agency's mounting successes at the Red Planet - and the public interest missions such as Curiosity have generated - could eventually make more far-flung exploration efforts possible. \"It could potentially be the tide that raises all ships,\" Senske said.

The bill outlines how the government will spend its money for the remainder of the fiscal year. Included in the spending package is an increase in funding for NASA's planetary science research program as well as $75 million for a Europa mission. Although it's not yet clear how the money will be allocated - perhaps it will fund instrument development? - it is very exciting news for all of us at Destination: Europa. It's much easier to make noise when we are angry than when we are pleased, but we can't forget to show our appreciation when people go out of their way to support our cause. So, first and foremost, we want to THANK YOU for your participation. Together with organizations like The Planetary Society and professional societies like AAS and AGU, you helped show Congress that the American people support outer solar system science! And just as we acknowledge the vital role that you all played in getting the Europa mission into this bill, we are asking each of you to contact your Senators and Representatives to thank them for supporting the Europa mission. The members of the committees on science and space-related policy are listed at \"Europa Goes To Congress\". If these are your elected officials, please give them a call or even mail them a thank-you card! You may also want to thank your Senators or Representatives who voted in favor of the bill (links go to voting records). If your elected officials voted no, it is especially important that you let them know that you support funding for Europa! Last, but not least, we need to thank the President for signing this legislation into law. Although he has been an ardent supporter of STEM careers and has often spoken of returning America to the cutting edge of technological innovation, President Obama's initial budget request would have held NASA's budget flat while saddling planetary science with a 20% reduction in funding. Meeting those budget constraints would have required massive cuts to R&A, a longer waiting period between smaller space missions, and no funding for any strategic missions, including the Europa mission. The passage of this bill shows that, when the public is vocal and passionate about a cause, Congress and the President listen. We have made terrific progress towards restoring NASA funding to operational levels, but there is more work to be done. Fiscal planning for the coming year kicks off with the President's budget request, which he is expected to release in the first week of April. That means NOW is the time to be vocal and passionate in your support of Europa Clipper. Please take the time to write or call the President and your Senators and Representatives, both to thank them and encourage their continued support for Europa science and the Clipper mission in the 2014 budget. The tide is turning, but we need you to hoist the sails!", "url": "https://europa.seti.org/one-small-step-for-a-mission/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Update", "date": "2013-05-06", "content": "Planetary geologist Philip Horzempa returns with a new post giving an update on the proposed Europa Clipper mission. President Obama's recently released FY2014 budget proposal, unfortunately, contains no funding for a mission to Europa. In fact, the budget document states that NASA not only is not funding such a mission, but that it cannot fund it. Several sources of budget constraints appear to be stalling any new start. In addition to the sequester, NASA's Science Mission Directorate has the ongoing money drain of the Jams Webb Space Telescope (JWST). That funding burden will not lessen until about 2017 - 2018. One could imagine that NASA may see a funding wedge appear at about that time, with a new start for a Europa mission possible in FY 2015 or 2016. The early years of a space project require minimal funding, allowing a program to begin Phase A and Phase B (design and definition) a few years before the fiscal \"heavy-lifting\" of Phases C and D (detailed design, construction and testing) .In the meantime, the Europa team has continued to refine the design of what they refer to as the Europa Clipper (see Van's post of September 24, 2012). Whenever they are given the \"go-ahead\" from the White House, they will have a mission ready to proceed to implementation. The Europa science community believe they have developed a cost-effective, yet scientifically compelling, mission to the ice-covered Galilean satellite. After considering an orbiter, the consensus is that a multi-flyby spacecraft would return more science for the same cost ceiling. The Europa Clipper embodies the modified FBC (faster, better, cheaper) approach. It is seeking to capture as much of the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) flagship science as possible using a smart, elegant, lower-cost design. This past January, the Europa team presented the results of their latest \"scrub\" of the Clipper mission. This Europa Clipper design refinement can be seen here. The plan is to launch in 2021, followed by one Venus and two Earth gravity assists. Six years after launch, with the gravity assist of a Ganymede flyby, the Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter. Over the next 2.5 years, it will perform 32 flybys during its prime mission, with closest approach altitudes of 25 - 100 kilometers (actually 34 total flybys will occur, but only 32 are optimal for science). In order to reduce planning costs, the timeline of each flyby will be essentially identical. (Figure 1) However, the trajectory of each flyby will bring it over a different sector of Europa. This will provide global medium-resolution coverage from the Topographic Imager. It was felt that the Europa Clipper mission should also provide data that would feed-forward to a future soft lander. This concept of reconnaissance has seen a rebirth at NASA, with ongoing orbital missions at the Moon and Mars. The addition of a Reconnaissance Camera was deemed to be essential for providing images for landing site surveys ( lander-scale characterization of the surface is needed). The Recon camera (a push-broom design) will produce 20 x n km images at resolutions of as fine as 0.5 meters. The limitation on the number of such high-resolution images comes from the large amount of data in each photo. In turn, the swath length will be determined by the amount of down-link time available. The Recon camera will utilize an innovative flip-mirror to enable stereo imaging of a scene in a single pass. It will be able to obtain views 15 degrees from nadir (Figure 2) It is believed that about 15 candidate landing sites will need to be surveyed in order to be able to down-select to 2, a primary and a backup. That selection will be done by some future team of Europa Lander scientists and engineers. A separate, smaller, and gimbaled gravity science antenna will allow the collection of gravity data during flybys. (Figure 3). Because the cameras and other remote sensing instruments are mounted to the spacecraft body, the main antenna cannot be pointed to Earth during flybys to allow tracking for gravity measurements. The separate antenna will be kept pointed at Earth during flybys to permit the important gravity measurements that will reveal much of the internal structure of Europa. During this latest iteration, the Europa team was allowed to raise the cost cap from $1.7 billion to a total of $2.0 billion. (This is still less than half the estimated cost of the previously proposed Jupiter Europa Orbiter.) This increase allowed the addition of a Magnetometer and Langmuir Probes to the payload suite. Rounding out the instrument complement are an Ice-Penetrating Radar, a Thermal Imager, a Neutral-Mass Spectrometer and a Short-Wave Infra-Red Spectrometer. Figure 4 shows some of the payload complement and where they will sit on the spacecraft. The highly-capable instrument suite is one reason that the Europa Clipper would cost more than missions such as JUICE or the proposed Io Observer. The scope and resilience of the Clipper mission means that it must survive an intense radiation exposure over its 2.5-year mission. This data-intensive mission must also use a reliable, high-energy power source. The Europa Clipper spacecraft benefits from the heritage of the Galileo and Juno Jupiter Orbiters in its approach to radiation protection.The Clipper will utilize 150 kg. of dedicated radiation shielding which is one-half of that planned for the earlier JEO (Jupiter Europa Orbiter) proposal. The Clipper will use a scheme of nested radiation protection for its electronics (Figure 5). For example, the Spacecraft structure and propulsion system will provide a measure of radiation protection, essentially for free. With intelligent placement, the project will utilize much less expensive 100 and 300 kilo-rad hard parts. Individual payload electronics have their own shielding, while the use of a central electronics vault is also part of the protection plan. As a result of this approach, the Clipper team will not need to fund an expensive development effort to build mega-rad hard avionics. The Europa Clipper mission will be data-intensive. In order to downlink this data efficiently and cheaply, the Clipper will use mass-memory-storage. The spacecraft will leisurely downlink the data from each close encounter with Europa during the two weeks between flybys. This will avoid the more costly, and power-hungry, approach of near-real-time broadcast during flyby. Over the course of its prime mission, the Clipper will return a Terabit of data, including high-resolution images, radar soundings, magnetic field measurements, compostion spectra, and gravity science. In order to return all of this date, a robust energy source is required. There are three energy supply options, two of which are thermal-electric and one solar. Solar panels would be the lowest cost, highest mass option. However, they pose the risk of not providing enough power over the lifetime of the mission. The Europa Clipper's orbit has a low inclination causing it to pass through the most intense radiation environment in the solar system.This would cause aggressive degradation of solar cells, such that their power output would be increasingly compromised as the mission progressed. The Juno orbiter is able to use solar power because its high-inclination polar trajectory enables it to avoid most of the high radiation zones that are concentrated over Jupiter's equator. This is true even though it flies much closer to the gas giant than the Clipper ever will. ESA's JUICE spacecraft is able to use solar energy mainly because it only flies near Europa twice during its mission. The proposed Io Observer would also use solar panels. It avoids high doses of radiation by orbiting Jupiter in an inclined orbit. Europa Clipper is unable to utilize such a high-inclination orbit because that would result in flyby velocities too great to allow its Infra-Red and Ice-Penetrating Radar to gather useful data. This leaves the two thermal-electric options. These power systems utilize the heat generated by the decay of Plutonium-238 to drive thermal-electric power conversion units. One of these, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) design is actually still in development, although at a high level of maturity. NASA chose not to pursue a Discovery mission that would have utilized one of these units. In light of that decision, the agency will still take the two ASRG development units to flight status this year. They will then be placed in storage, awaiting a mission. If this power source is chosen, then the Clipper would utilize four ASRG units. However, before the ASRG design would be approved for the Europa Clipper, more work would need to be done. The radiation hardness of the Generation-1 ASRG units is not sufficient for the Europa mission and there are also lifetime demonstration issues. The other thermal-electric option is the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal-electric Generator design (MMRTG). This system is the 1st new radioisotope power system developed in over 20 years.It has advanced to actual flight status, with the first MMRTG flight unit, F-1, now sitting on the surface of Mars, powering the MSL rover. Its backup, F-2, is in bonded storage at the Rocketdyne plant in Canoga Park. It has been operated and has shown good performance. It is now slated to fly onboard the 2020 Mars Rover, i.e., MSL-2. The next unit, F-3, is the flight spare for Mars 2020.It is now under construction, with completion set for this month. If not needed for the Mars 2020 rover, then F-3 would be available for a mission to Europa.In addition to F-3, three more MMRTG units would be needed for the Clipper. There are plans for infusing new technologies in the next generation of MMRTG.These would produce 150, or even 180 watts, as compared to 120 watts for the 1st generation. There are a number of issues that need to be considered if one of the thermal-electric options is chosen. ASRG development seems to have begun during the short-lived Prometheus program. An engineering unit at NASA Glenn has accumulated over 10,000 hours (14 months) of operation so far. The maturity level for the ASRG units is high, but they are more expensive than an MMRTG and have yet to fly in space. On the other hand, their power conversion efficiency of 30% means that they are more frugal than MMRTG units (9% efficiency) with the Plutonium supply. The MMRTG design has several advantages over the ASRG. First, as noted, an MMRTG is now in space. The design has high reliability and low cost. In addition, the ASRG utilizes kinetic energy as one stage in it power conversion. It is still to be determined whether the resulting vibrations would make it incompatible with a Europa mission. If so, then the vibration-free MMRTG would be at an advantage. In addition, the re-start of Plutonium production in the U.S. may make the use of an MMRTG for Europa more plausible. One factor that had favored the use of ASRG units for space missions was the shrinking inventory of Pu-238 in this country. However, if the goal of producing 1.5 - 2.0 kg of Pu-238 per year is met, then that concern will be eased.America now has about 10 kg of older, aging Pu-238. The new Pu-238 can be blended with the old material producing the desired power density. Over the next 18 months the Europa project team will be conducting a comprehensive trade study, comparing all viable energy options. The variables to be considered include cost, risk, robustness, design compatibility, and implementation feasibility. This effort will go a long way towards choosing the most appropriate system for the Clipper. The Clipper team is very interested in the idea of hosting several nanosats that would be deployed in the vicinity of Europa. This is contingent upon the use of the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lifter. Only that rocket would provide the needed mass margin required if the Clipper is to carry small satellite payload elements. However, if pursued, the working concept for the Clipper could provide the necessary housekeeping, deployment and radio-relay capabilities. In addition, thought is being given to utilizing an intermediate orbit insertion module that would allow several nanosats to enter orbit around Europa. If these nanosats can be accommodated, then the Europa team would like to cooperate with the growing American small-sat community. There is a desire to get feedback from engineers and scientists on the best way to use these probes. There are a variety of options that could use a single smallsat, or a network, with instruments such as magnetometers or cameras. These probes could be orbiters, \"Ranger-style\" crash landers, or even hard landers that might operate for a short time after impact. Resource and cost constraints will be tight, but if these mini-probes could fit, then the Europa team is interested. Still to be decided this year is how, or if, a total of $75 million of new funding is to be spent. In this year's budget, Congress specifically earmarked that sum for development of a Europa mission. There have been rumors that NASA's operating plan for this year's budget, due to be delivered to Congress soon, will seek to spend that money on other agency projects. In response to such concerns, Senators Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer joined with Congressmen Adam Schiff and John Culberson in sending a letter to NASA. They point out to NASA that funding levels for its science programs \"will remain consistent with the structure directed by Congress.\" Essentially, they are reminding the agency that the Constitution gives the power to say how the nation's money is spent to the Congress. The Executive branch has limited leeway in how it interprets Congress' appropriations legislation. How this will turn out is difficult to gauge. This is not the first time such a struggle has occurred. For years, the Congress earmarked funds for development of a Solar Probe mission. Eventually, NASA got the message and awarded a new start for the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. About 10 years ago, when NASA was trying to eliminate funding for the New Horizons Pluto probe, Congress specifically earmarked funding for that mission, enabling it to proceed.More recently, after the Obama Administration canceled the Ares 5 heavy lift rocket in its FY 2011 budget proposal, the Congress (especially the Senate) was not pleased. They directed NASA to pursue an alternate heavy lifter, the SLS (Space Launch System), which is essentially a scaled-back version of the Ares 5.That launcher is now on track for its first mission in 2017. If NASA does agree to spend the $75 million (more like $70 million after sequestration) this year for Europa mission preparation, there are several ways that the money could be usefully spent. Instrument development, launch vehicle requirements and power system options could be funded, as well as studies to define the loads on the Clipper during launch. Much will also depend on whether Congress again earmarks funds for a Europa mission in the new FY 2014 budget. If it does, then the tug-of-war with the Administration will continue with the future of Europa exploration hanging in the balance.

NASA chose not to pursue a Discovery mission that would have utilized one of these units. In light of that decision, the agency will still take the two ASRG development units to flight status this year. They will then be placed in storage, awaiting a mission. If this power source is chosen, then the Clipper would utilize four ASRG units. However, before the ASRG design would be approved for the Europa Clipper, more work would need to be done. The radiation hardness of the Generation-1 ASRG units is not sufficient for the Europa mission and there are also lifetime demonstration issues. The other thermal-electric option is the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal-electric Generator design (MMRTG). This system is the 1st new radioisotope power system developed in over 20 years.It has advanced to actual flight status, with the first MMRTG flight unit, F-1, now sitting on the surface of Mars, powering the MSL rover. Its backup, F-2, is in bonded storage at the Rocketdyne plant in Canoga Park. It has been operated and has shown good performance. It is now slated to fly onboard the 2020 Mars Rover, i.e., MSL-2. The next unit, F-3, is the flight spare for Mars 2020.It is now under construction, with completion set for this month. If not needed for the Mars 2020 rover, then F-3 would be available for a mission to Europa.In addition to F-3, three more MMRTG units would be needed for the Clipper. There are plans for infusing new technologies in the next generation of MMRTG.These would produce 150, or even 180 watts, as compared to 120 watts for the 1st generation. There are a number of issues that need to be considered if one of the thermal-electric options is chosen. ASRG development seems to have begun during the short-lived Prometheus program. An engineering unit at NASA Glenn has accumulated over 10,000 hours (14 months) of operation so far. The maturity level for the ASRG units is high, but they are more expensive than an MMRTG and have yet to fly in space. On the other hand, their power conversion efficiency of 30% means that they are more frugal than MMRTG units (9% efficiency) with the Plutonium supply. The MMRTG design has several advantages over the ASRG. First, as noted, an MMRTG is now in space. The design has high reliability and low cost. In addition, the ASRG utilizes kinetic energy as one stage in it power conversion. It is still to be determined whether the resulting vibrations would make it incompatible with a Europa mission. If so, then the vibration-free MMRTG would be at an advantage. In addition, the re-start of Plutonium production in the U.S. may make the use of an MMRTG for Europa more plausible. One factor that had favored the use of ASRG units for space missions was the shrinking inventory of Pu-238 in this country. However, if the goal of producing 1.5 - 2.0 kg of Pu-238 per year is met, then that concern will be eased.America now has about 10 kg of older, aging Pu-238. The new Pu-238 can be blended with the old material producing the desired power density. Over the next 18 months the Europa project team will be conducting a comprehensive trade study, comparing all viable energy options. The variables to be considered include cost, risk, robustness, design compatibility, and implementation feasibility. This effort will go a long way towards choosing the most appropriate system for the Clipper. The Clipper team is very interested in the idea of hosting several nanosats that would be deployed in the vicinity of Europa. This is contingent upon the use of the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lifter. Only that rocket would provide the needed mass margin required if the Clipper is to carry small satellite payload elements. However, if pursued, the working concept for the Clipper could provide the necessary housekeeping, deployment and radio-relay capabilities. In addition, thought is being given to utilizing an intermediate orbit insertion module that would allow several nanosats to enter orbit around Europa. If these nanosats can be accommodated, then the Europa team would like to cooperate with the growing American small-sat community. There is a desire to get feedback from engineers and scientists on the best way to use these probes. There are a variety of options that could use a single smallsat, or a network, with instruments such as magnetometers or cameras. These probes could be orbiters, \"Ranger-style\" crash landers, or even hard landers that might operate for a short time after impact. Resource and cost constraints will be tight, but if these mini-probes could fit, then the Europa team is interested. Still to be decided this year is how, or if, a total of $75 million of new funding is to be spent. In this year's budget, Congress specifically earmarked that sum for development of a Europa mission. There have been rumors that NASA's operating plan for this year's budget, due to be delivered to Congress soon, will seek to spend that money on other agency projects. In response to such concerns, Senators Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer joined with Congressmen Adam Schiff and John Culberson in sending a letter to NASA. They point out to NASA that funding levels for its science programs \"will remain consistent with the structure directed by Congress.\" Essentially, they are reminding the agency that the Constitution gives the power to say how the nation's money is spent to the Congress. The Executive branch has limited leeway in how it interprets Congress' appropriations legislation. How this will turn out is difficult to gauge. This is not the first time such a struggle has occurred. For years, the Congress earmarked funds for development of a Solar Probe mission. Eventually, NASA got the message and awarded a new start for the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. About 10 years ago, when NASA was trying to eliminate funding for the New Horizons Pluto probe, Congress specifically earmarked funding for that mission, enabling it to proceed.More recently, after the Obama Administration canceled the Ares 5 heavy lift rocket in its FY 2011 budget proposal, the Congress (especially the Senate) was not pleased. They directed NASA to pursue an alternate heavy lifter, the SLS (Space Launch System), which is essentially a scaled-back version of the Ares 5.That launcher is now on track for its first mission in 2017. If NASA does agree to spend the $75 million (more like $70 million after sequestration) this year for Europa mission preparation, there are several ways that the money could be usefully spent. Instrument development, launch vehicle requirements and power system options could be funded, as well as studies to define the loads on the Clipper during launch. Much will also depend on whether Congress again earmarks funds for a Europa mission in the new FY 2014 budget. If it does, then the tug-of-war with the Administration will continue with the future of Europa exploration hanging in the balance.

The bill outlines how the government will spend its money for the remainder of the fiscal year. Included in the spending package is an increase in funding for NASA's planetary science research program as well as $75 million for a Europa mission. Although it's not yet clear how the money will be allocated - perhaps it will fund instrument development? - it is very exciting news for all of us at Destination: Europa. It's much easier to make noise when we are angry than when we are pleased, but we can't forget to show our appreciation when people go out of their way to support our cause. So, first and foremost, we want to THANK YOU for your participation. Together with organizations like The Planetary Society and professional societies like AAS and AGU, you helped show Congress that the American people support outer solar system science! And just as we acknowledge the vital role that you all played in getting the Europa mission into this bill, we are asking each of you to contact your Senators and Representatives to thank them for supporting the Europa mission. The members of the committees on science and space-related policy are listed at \"Europa Goes To Congress\". If these are your elected officials, please give them a call or even mail them a thank-you card! You may also want to thank your Senators or Representatives who voted in favor of the bill (links go to voting records). If your elected officials voted no, it is especially important that you let them know that you support funding for Europa! Last, but not least, we need to thank the President for signing this legislation into law. Although he has been an ardent supporter of STEM careers and has often spoken of returning America to the cutting edge of technological innovation, President Obama's initial budget request would have held NASA's budget flat while saddling planetary science with a 20% reduction in funding. Meeting those budget constraints would have required massive cuts to R&A, a longer waiting period between smaller space missions, and no funding for any strategic missions, including the Europa mission. The passage of this bill shows that, when the public is vocal and passionate about a cause, Congress and the President listen. We have made terrific progress towards restoring NASA funding to operational levels, but there is more work to be done. Fiscal planning for the coming year kicks off with the President's budget request, which he is expected to release in the first week of April. That means NOW is the time to be vocal and passionate in your support of Europa Clipper. Please take the time to write or call the President and your Senators and Representatives, both to thank them and encourage their continued support for Europa science and the Clipper mission in the 2014 budget. The tide is turning, but we need you to hoist the sails!", "url": "https://europa.seti.org/one-small-step-for-a-mission/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Update", "date": "2013-05-06", "content": "Planetary geologist Philip Horzempa returns with a new post giving an update on the proposed Europa Clipper mission. President Obama's recently released FY2014 budget proposal, unfortunately, contains no funding for a mission to Europa. In fact, the budget document states that NASA not only is not funding such a mission, but that it cannot fund it. Several sources of budget constraints appear to be stalling any new start. In addition to the sequester, NASA's Science Mission Directorate has the ongoing money drain of the Jams Webb Space Telescope (JWST). That funding burden will not lessen until about 2017 - 2018. One could imagine that NASA may see a funding wedge appear at about that time, with a new start for a Europa mission possible in FY 2015 or 2016. The early years of a space project require minimal funding, allowing a program to begin Phase A and Phase B (design and definition) a few years before the fiscal \"heavy-lifting\" of Phases C and D (detailed design, construction and testing) .In the meantime, the Europa team has continued to refine the design of what they refer to as the Europa Clipper (see Van's post of September 24, 2012). Whenever they are given the \"go-ahead\" from the White House, they will have a mission ready to proceed to implementation. The Europa science community believe they have developed a cost-effective, yet scientifically compelling, mission to the ice-covered Galilean satellite. After considering an orbiter, the consensus is that a multi-flyby spacecraft would return more science for the same cost ceiling. The Europa Clipper embodies the modified FBC (faster, better, cheaper) approach. It is seeking to capture as much of the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) flagship science as possible using a smart, elegant, lower-cost design. This past January, the Europa team presented the results of their latest \"scrub\" of the Clipper mission. This Europa Clipper design refinement can be seen here. The plan is to launch in 2021, followed by one Venus and two Earth gravity assists. Six years after launch, with the gravity assist of a Ganymede flyby, the Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter. Over the next 2.5 years, it will perform 32 flybys during its prime mission, with closest approach altitudes of 25 - 100 kilometers (actually 34 total flybys will occur, but only 32 are optimal for science). In order to reduce planning costs, the timeline of each flyby will be essentially identical. (Figure 1) However, the trajectory of each flyby will bring it over a different sector of Europa. This will provide global medium-resolution coverage from the Topographic Imager. It was felt that the Europa Clipper mission should also provide data that would feed-forward to a future soft lander. This concept of reconnaissance has seen a rebirth at NASA, with ongoing orbital missions at the Moon and Mars. The addition of a Reconnaissance Camera was deemed to be essential for providing images for landing site surveys ( lander-scale characterization of the surface is needed). The Recon camera (a push-broom design) will produce 20 x n km images at resolutions of as fine as 0.5 meters. The limitation on the number of such high-resolution images comes from the large amount of data in each photo. In turn, the swath length will be determined by the amount of down-link time available. The Recon camera will utilize an innovative flip-mirror to enable stereo imaging of a scene in a single pass. It will be able to obtain views 15 degrees from nadir (Figure 2) It is believed that about 15 candidate landing sites will need to be surveyed in order to be able to down-select to 2, a primary and a backup. That selection will be done by some future team of Europa Lander scientists and engineers. A separate, smaller, and gimbaled gravity science antenna will allow the collection of gravity data during flybys. (Figure 3). Because the cameras and other remote sensing instruments are mounted to the spacecraft body, the main antenna cannot be pointed to Earth during flybys to allow tracking for gravity measurements. The separate antenna will be kept pointed at Earth during flybys to permit the important gravity measurements that will reveal much of the internal structure of Europa. During this latest iteration, the Europa team was allowed to raise the cost cap from $1.7 billion to a total of $2.0 billion. (This is still less than half the estimated cost of the previously proposed Jupiter Europa Orbiter.) This increase allowed the addition of a Magnetometer and Langmuir Probes to the payload suite. Rounding out the instrument complement are an Ice-Penetrating Radar, a Thermal Imager, a Neutral-Mass Spectrometer and a Short-Wave Infra-Red Spectrometer. Figure 4 shows some of the payload complement and where they will sit on the spacecraft. The highly-capable instrument suite is one reason that the Europa Clipper would cost more than missions such as JUICE or the proposed Io Observer. The scope and resilience of the Clipper mission means that it must survive an intense radiation exposure over its 2.5-year mission. This data-intensive mission must also use a reliable, high-energy power source. The Europa Clipper spacecraft benefits from the heritage of the Galileo and Juno Jupiter Orbiters in its approach to radiation protection.The Clipper will utilize 150 kg. of dedicated radiation shielding which is one-half of that planned for the earlier JEO (Jupiter Europa Orbiter) proposal. The Clipper will use a scheme of nested radiation protection for its electronics (Figure 5). For example, the Spacecraft structure and propulsion system will provide a measure of radiation protection, essentially for free. With intelligent placement, the project will utilize much less expensive 100 and 300 kilo-rad hard parts. Individual payload electronics have their own shielding, while the use of a central electronics vault is also part of the protection plan. As a result of this approach, the Clipper team will not need to fund an expensive development effort to build mega-rad hard avionics. The Europa Clipper mission will be data-intensive. In order to downlink this data efficiently and cheaply, the Clipper will use mass-memory-storage. The spacecraft will leisurely downlink the data from each close encounter with Europa during the two weeks between flybys. This will avoid the more costly, and power-hungry, approach of near-real-time broadcast during flyby. Over the course of its prime mission, the Clipper will return a Terabit of data, including high-resolution images, radar soundings, magnetic field measurements, compostion spectra, and gravity science. In order to return all of this date, a robust energy source is required. There are three energy supply options, two of which are thermal-electric and one solar. Solar panels would be the lowest cost, highest mass option. However, they pose the risk of not providing enough power over the lifetime of the mission. The Europa Clipper's orbit has a low inclination causing it to pass through the most intense radiation environment in the solar system.This would cause aggressive degradation of solar cells, such that their power output would be increasingly compromised as the mission progressed. The Juno orbiter is able to use solar power because its high-inclination polar trajectory enables it to avoid most of the high radiation zones that are concentrated over Jupiter's equator. This is true even though it flies much closer to the gas giant than the Clipper ever will. ESA's JUICE spacecraft is able to use solar energy mainly because it only flies near Europa twice during its mission. The proposed Io Observer would also use solar panels. It avoids high doses of radiation by orbiting Jupiter in an inclined orbit. Europa Clipper is unable to utilize such a high-inclination orbit because that would result in flyby velocities too great to allow its Infra-Red and Ice-Penetrating Radar to gather useful data. This leaves the two thermal-electric options. These power systems utilize the heat generated by the decay of Plutonium-238 to drive thermal-electric power conversion units. One of these, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) design is actually still in development, although at a high level of maturity.

The study money, being sought by \"a variety of institutions\" that responded to NASA's Instrument Concepts for Europa Exploration (ICEE) solicitation in June, is expected to be awarded in mid-August, said Curt Niebur, lead program scientist for NASA's New Frontiers program. Speaking here July 15 at a meeting of the NASA-chartered Outer Planets Assessment Group, Niebur said the funds will be provided in one-year grants. The money came from a $75 million appropriation Congress provided especially for Europa exploration in the continuing resolution that, until Oct. 1, will fund NASA and the rest of the federal government at 2012 levels, minus cuts imposed by the ongoing budget sequester. In some cases, proposers had ideas for entire instruments for the probe, dubbed Europa Clipper, Niebur said. Other proposals are \"just for subsystems,\" he said. \"Some [instruments] need one specific component matured so that the end-to-end instrument is viable.\" Given the mission's estimated $2 billion development price tag, the Europa Clipper team is not interested in taking big risks. Above all, proposers were encouraged to focus on technology that has already proved its mettle in a space environment on some other project's dime, Niebur said. The team set the same standard for noninstrument spacecraft components, including avionics and radiation shielding. \"The avionics that we would like to use ... need to be avionics that currently exist, that are currently qualified, and somebody else has paid to qualify them,\" Brian Cooke, Europa Clipper's project system engineer, said during the meeting. \"Our target radiation dose is no bigger than 300 kilorads. We'd like to push that down to 100 kilorads, if we can. But we know there exists a class of commercial parts, commercial space-grade parts, that someone has already paid to qualify, typically for use in geosynchronous satellites.\" Because the 2013 appropriations bill with the Europa Clipper funding was signed halfway through the fiscal year, NASA will not be able to spend it all before the year ends Oct. 1, Niebur said. \"As a result, a lot of that 70-ish million is going to be carried forward in 2014 and keep the team going,\" he said. Personnel involved with Europa Clipper at this point include a science definition team chaired by Louise Proctor at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and a Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team led by Project Manager Barry Goldstein. NASA has not committed to flying Europa Clipper, but the mission enjoys support in Congress. The House Appropriations Committee is especially keen on the project and has, as part of a $47.4 billion commerce, justice, science appropriations bill that holds spending to sequestered levels, approved another $80 million for Europa in 2014. The committee's bill passed July 17 and is awaiting vote by the full House. The Senate Appropriations Committee moved a NASA spending bill to the floor July 18, but it included no specific mention of Europa. The money in the proposed 2014 legislation is \"for pre-formulation and/or formulation activities including an Announcement of Opportunity for instrument development in support of a mission that meets the scientific goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the Planetary Science decadal survey,\" the report accompanying the bill said. That language dovetails with NASA's plan for the $15 million worth of instrument maturation contracts due to be awarded in August. \"The goal of the ICEE program is to ... be ready to propose an instrument [announcement of opportunity] should the stars align and it be released in the near future,\" Niebur said July 15. \"Near future\" in this case likely means three to five years, Niebur said. According to the current mission plan from JPL, Clipper would notionally launch in 2021 aboard the most powerful variant of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5, the 551. The craft would arrive at the Jovian system in spring 2028, according to JPL's preliminary mission design, dropping into orbit around Jupiter, rather than Europa. Clipper would piece together data gathered through a series of Europa flybys, rather than by orbiting the planet directly. It is not clear when the estimated $2 billion the mission requires might become available, but launch opportunities to Jupiter would come annually due to the flightpath mission planners have honed in on. Mission planners have also considered whether the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket NASA is building would be suitable for the mission. Assuming that vehicle is available - and it is not clear that it would be, given its projected low flight rate, and Congress' desire to utilize it for crewed missions - the length of Clipper's cruise could be cut in half. If launched aboard the heavy lifter in 2022, the probe would arrive at Jupiter by 2025, according to estimates by the JPL team.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/36388nasas-europa-mission-concept-progresses-on-the-back-burner/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Europa Clipper Update", "date": "2013-05-06", "content": "Planetary geologist Philip Horzempa returns with a new post giving an update on the proposed Europa Clipper mission.

Rounding out the instrument complement are an Ice-Penetrating Radar, a Thermal Imager, a Neutral-Mass Spectrometer and a Short-Wave Infra-Red Spectrometer. Figure 4 shows some of the payload complement and where they will sit on the spacecraft. The highly-capable instrument suite is one reason that the Europa Clipper would cost more than missions such as JUICE or the proposed Io Observer. The scope and resilience of the Clipper mission means that it must survive an intense radiation exposure over its 2.5-year mission. This data-intensive mission must also use a reliable, high-energy power source. The Europa Clipper spacecraft benefits from the heritage of the Galileo and Juno Jupiter Orbiters in its approach to radiation protection.The Clipper will utilize 150 kg. of dedicated radiation shielding which is one-half of that planned for the earlier JEO (Jupiter Europa Orbiter) proposal. The Clipper will use a scheme of nested radiation protection for its electronics (Figure 5). For example, the Spacecraft structure and propulsion system will provide a measure of radiation protection, essentially for free. With intelligent placement, the project will utilize much less expensive 100 and 300 kilo-rad hard parts. Individual payload electronics have their own shielding, while the use of a central electronics vault is also part of the protection plan. As a result of this approach, the Clipper team will not need to fund an expensive development effort to build mega-rad hard avionics. The Europa Clipper mission will be data-intensive. In order to downlink this data efficiently and cheaply, the Clipper will use mass-memory-storage. The spacecraft will leisurely downlink the data from each close encounter with Europa during the two weeks between flybys. This will avoid the more costly, and power-hungry, approach of near-real-time broadcast during flyby. Over the course of its prime mission, the Clipper will return a Terabit of data, including high-resolution images, radar soundings, magnetic field measurements, compostion spectra, and gravity science. In order to return all of this date, a robust energy source is required. There are three energy supply options, two of which are thermal-electric and one solar. Solar panels would be the lowest cost, highest mass option. However, they pose the risk of not providing enough power over the lifetime of the mission. The Europa Clipper's orbit has a low inclination causing it to pass through the most intense radiation environment in the solar system.This would cause aggressive degradation of solar cells, such that their power output would be increasingly compromised as the mission progressed. The Juno orbiter is able to use solar power because its high-inclination polar trajectory enables it to avoid most of the high radiation zones that are concentrated over Jupiter's equator. This is true even though it flies much closer to the gas giant than the Clipper ever will. ESA's JUICE spacecraft is able to use solar energy mainly because it only flies near Europa twice during its mission. The proposed Io Observer would also use solar panels. It avoids high doses of radiation by orbiting Jupiter in an inclined orbit. Europa Clipper is unable to utilize such a high-inclination orbit because that would result in flyby velocities too great to allow its Infra-Red and Ice-Penetrating Radar to gather useful data. This leaves the two thermal-electric options. These power systems utilize the heat generated by the decay of Plutonium-238 to drive thermal-electric power conversion units. One of these, the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) design is actually still in development, although at a high level of maturity. NASA chose not to pursue a Discovery mission that would have utilized one of these units. In light of that decision, the agency will still take the two ASRG development units to flight status this year. They will then be placed in storage, awaiting a mission. If this power source is chosen, then the Clipper would utilize four ASRG units. However, before the ASRG design would be approved for the Europa Clipper, more work would need to be done. The radiation hardness of the Generation-1 ASRG units is not sufficient for the Europa mission and there are also lifetime demonstration issues. The other thermal-electric option is the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal-electric Generator design (MMRTG). This system is the 1st new radioisotope power system developed in over 20 years.It has advanced to actual flight status, with the first MMRTG flight unit, F-1, now sitting on the surface of Mars, powering the MSL rover. Its backup, F-2, is in bonded storage at the Rocketdyne plant in Canoga Park. It has been operated and has shown good performance. It is now slated to fly onboard the 2020 Mars Rover, i.e., MSL-2. The next unit, F-3, is the flight spare for Mars 2020.It is now under construction, with completion set for this month. If not needed for the Mars 2020 rover, then F-3 would be available for a mission to Europa.In addition to F-3, three more MMRTG units would be needed for the Clipper. There are plans for infusing new technologies in the next generation of MMRTG.These would produce 150, or even 180 watts, as compared to 120 watts for the 1st generation. There are a number of issues that need to be considered if one of the thermal-electric options is chosen. ASRG development seems to have begun during the short-lived Prometheus program. An engineering unit at NASA Glenn has accumulated over 10,000 hours (14 months) of operation so far. The maturity level for the ASRG units is high, but they are more expensive than an MMRTG and have yet to fly in space. On the other hand, their power conversion efficiency of 30% means that they are more frugal than MMRTG units (9% efficiency) with the Plutonium supply. The MMRTG design has several advantages over the ASRG. First, as noted, an MMRTG is now in space. The design has high reliability and low cost. In addition, the ASRG utilizes kinetic energy as one stage in it power conversion. It is still to be determined whether the resulting vibrations would make it incompatible with a Europa mission. If so, then the vibration-free MMRTG would be at an advantage. In addition, the re-start of Plutonium production in the U.S. may make the use of an MMRTG for Europa more plausible. One factor that had favored the use of ASRG units for space missions was the shrinking inventory of Pu-238 in this country. However, if the goal of producing 1.5 - 2.0 kg of Pu-238 per year is met, then that concern will be eased.America now has about 10 kg of older, aging Pu-238. The new Pu-238 can be blended with the old material producing the desired power density. Over the next 18 months the Europa project team will be conducting a comprehensive trade study, comparing all viable energy options. The variables to be considered include cost, risk, robustness, design compatibility, and implementation feasibility. This effort will go a long way towards choosing the most appropriate system for the Clipper. The Clipper team is very interested in the idea of hosting several nanosats that would be deployed in the vicinity of Europa. This is contingent upon the use of the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lifter. Only that rocket would provide the needed mass margin required if the Clipper is to carry small satellite payload elements. However, if pursued, the working concept for the Clipper could provide the necessary housekeeping, deployment and radio-relay capabilities. In addition, thought is being given to utilizing an intermediate orbit insertion module that would allow several nanosats to enter orbit around Europa. If these nanosats can be accommodated, then the Europa team would like to cooperate with the growing American small-sat community. There is a desire to get feedback from engineers and scientists on the best way to use these probes. There are a variety of options that could use a single smallsat, or a network, with instruments such as magnetometers or cameras. These probes could be orbiters, \"Ranger-style\" crash landers, or even hard landers that might operate for a short time after impact. Resource and cost constraints will be tight, but if these mini-probes could fit, then the Europa team is interested. Still to be decided this year is how, or if, a total of $75 million of new funding is to be spent. In this year's budget, Congress specifically earmarked that sum for development of a Europa mission. There have been rumors that NASA's operating plan for this year's budget, due to be delivered to Congress soon, will seek to spend that money on other agency projects. In response to such concerns, Senators Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer joined with Congressmen Adam Schiff and John Culberson in sending a letter to NASA. They point out to NASA that funding levels for its science programs \"will remain consistent with the structure directed by Congress.\" Essentially, they are reminding the agency that the Constitution gives the power to say how the nation's money is spent to the Congress. The Executive branch has limited leeway in how it interprets Congress' appropriations legislation. How this will turn out is difficult to gauge. This is not the first time such a struggle has occurred. For years, the Congress earmarked funds for development of a Solar Probe mission. Eventually, NASA got the message and awarded a new start for the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. About 10 years ago, when NASA was trying to eliminate funding for the New Horizons Pluto probe, Congress specifically earmarked funding for that mission, enabling it to proceed.More recently, after the Obama Administration canceled the Ares 5 heavy lift rocket in its FY 2011 budget proposal, the Congress (especially the Senate) was not pleased. They directed NASA to pursue an alternate heavy lifter, the SLS (Space Launch System), which is essentially a scaled-back version of the Ares 5.That launcher is now on track for its first mission in 2017. If NASA does agree to spend the $75 million (more like $70 million after sequestration) this year for Europa mission preparation, there are several ways that the money could be usefully spent. Instrument development, launch vehicle requirements and power system options could be funded, as well as studies to define the loads on the Clipper during launch. Much will also depend on whether Congress again earmarks funds for a Europa mission in the new FY 2014 budget. If it does, then the tug-of-war with the Administration will continue with the future of Europa exploration hanging in the balance.

We'd like to push that down to 100 kilorads, if we can.

The Senate Appropriations Committee moved a NASA spending bill to the floor July 18, but it included no specific mention of Europa.

The White House's 2015 federal budget request, which was released Tuesday, allocates $15 million to help develop a mission to Europa, which harbors a potentially life-supporting ocean of liquid water beneath its icy shell. \"Europa is a very challenging mission operating in a really high radiation environment, and there's lots to do to prepare for it,\" NASA chief financial officer Beth Robinson told reporters Tuesday. \"We're looking for a launch some time in the mid-2020s.\" The $15 million - which represents a tiny fraction of the $17.5 billion allocated to the space agency in the 2015 request - would fund very early \"pre-formulation\" work for a potential Europa mission, Robinson added. \"I know people have asked about the total size of the possible mission, and we're frankly just not sure at this point,\" she said, adding that agency officials will reach out to the scientific community to help map out the mission. Though the 2015 proposal marks the first time Europa was included in a federal budget request, NASA has received funding to study a possible mission to the 1,900-mile-wide moon in the past. Congress allocated the space agency a total of $155 million toward this end over the last two years. Though statements by Robinson and other NASA officials suggest that the Europa mission space is wide open at this point, the best candidate to get off the ground in 2025 or so may be a concept called the Europa Clipper. NASA researchers have been developing the Europa Clipper idea for years. The probe would orbit Jupiter but make dozens of flybys of Europa, using a variety of science instruments to study the moon's ice shell and subsurface ocean. The Europa Clipper could conceivably cruise through the plumes of water vapor erupting from the moon's south pole - intriguing features that were discovered late last year and have helped build momentum for a Europa mission, since they offer a possible way to sample the ocean from afar. It would probably cost about $2 billion to get the Europa Clipper off the ground, officials have estimated. That's a pretty high price tag in these tough fiscal times, so some rethinking may be required to take the Clipper - or something like it - from concept to reality. The Europa Clipper \"is what we would call a flagship, and right now the budget horizon is such that we're deferring that kind of mission until later in the decade,\" Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division, said in December at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

The White House's 2015 federal budget request, which was released Tuesday, allocates $15 million to help develop a mission to Europa, which harbors a potentially life-supporting ocean of liquid water beneath its icy shell. \"Europa is a very challenging mission operating in a really high radiation environment, and there's lots to do to prepare for it,\" NASA chief financial officer Beth Robinson told reporters Tuesday. \"We're looking for a launch some time in the mid-2020s.\" The $15 million - which represents a tiny fraction of the $17.5 billion allocated to the space agency in the 2015 request - would fund very early \"pre-formulation\" work for a potential Europa mission, Robinson added. \"I know people have asked about the total size of the possible mission, and we're frankly just not sure at this point,\" she said, adding that agency officials will reach out to the scientific community to help map out the mission. Though the 2015 proposal marks the first time Europa was included in a federal budget request, NASA has received funding to study a possible mission to the 1,900-mile-wide moon in the past. Congress allocated the space agency a total of $155 million toward this end over the last two years.

NASA researchers have been developing the Europa Clipper idea for years. The probe would orbit Jupiter but make dozens of flybys of Europa, using a variety of science instruments to study the moon's ice shell and subsurface ocean. The Europa Clipper could conceivably cruise through the plumes of water vapor erupting from the moon's south pole - intriguing features that were discovered late last year and have helped build momentum for a Europa mission, since they offer a possible way to sample the ocean from afar.

Researchers announced their discovery of the deep watery ocean on Enceladus on Thursday in the journal Science, confirming suspicions held by many scientists since 2005, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft spied geysers of ice and water vapor erupting from Enceladus' south pole. The discovery vaults Enceladus into the top tier of life-hosting candidates along with Europa, an ice-sheathed moon of Jupiter that also hosts a subterranean ocean. Both frigid satellites bear much closer investigation, researchers say. Enceladus has an extensive water ocean under its icy crust, feeding water jets that emerge from near the south pole.

Enceladus' geysers blast material hundreds of miles into space, offering a way to sample the moon's subsurface ocean from afar. Cassini has already done some of this work with its mass spectrometer, detecting salts and organic compounds - the carbon-based building blocks of life as we know it - in Enceladus' plumes during flybys of the moon. But Cassini's mass spectrometer can detect only relatively light organics. A follow-up mission to Enceladus should sport a more advanced and more sensitive version of this instrument that could spot a wider range of organics, Lunine said. \"You could actually do this by making flybys of Enceladus, the way that Cassini does now,\" he said. \"I think you could learn quite a bit about the organic inventory in the plume by flying this device.\" Interestingly, astronomers announced in December that they had discovered plumes of water vapor erupting from Europa's south polar region as well. So that moon's ocean could be sampled during flybys, too - perhaps by a mission called the Europa Clipper. NASA is developing the Europa Clipper as a concept mission at the moment. Recent estimates have pegged the mission's cost at around $2 billion. That's pretty steep in these tough economic times, so a scaled-down version might have the best chance of getting it off the ground, NASA officials have said. Enceladus and Europa aren't the only icy moons that harbor subsurface oceans; Jupiter's enormous moon Ganymede also has one, for example.

NASA said that at the conclusion of this formulation phase, it is planned that a subset of these investigations may be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA also wrote about some key facts about Europa and why it is such a potentially interesting system for further exploration. If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel and Europa would be the size of the dome on the back of the nickel. One day on Europa takes about 3.5 Earth days. The length of Europa's day is the same as the amount of time it takes Europa to orbit Jupiter. Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the sun in about 12 Earth years. Like many other moons, Europa is locked by gravity to its planet so that the same side always faces toward Jupiter. Europa's surface is mostly solid water ice. It is extremely smooth and crisscrossed by fractures. Europa has an extremely thin oxygen atmosphere -- far too thin to breathe. Europa and Jupiter have been visited by eight spacecraft, which have performed flybys. Galileo is the only mission to make repeated visits to Europa. With abundant liquid water, and energy and chemistry provided by tidal heating, Europa could be the best place in the solar system to look for present day life beyond Earth. If Europa's ocean is proven to exist, it would possess more than twice as much water as Earth.

The Decadal Survey: Mars, Europa, and Uranus Stemming from recommendations of the 2013-2022 Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science report, also known as the Decadal Survey, published on 7 March 2011, NASA has taken the next step toward the realization of a mission to Europa - a destination that received prominent billing in the Decadal Survey. The mission to Jupiter's moon received second priority behind a new Mars rover mission and ahead of a mission to Uranus and its moons, all of which were classified as part of NASA's Flagship Mission series. Following the initial release of the Decadal Survey recommendations, NASA immediately took steps to begin studying a mission to Europa. In late 2011, NASA commissioned a Europa lander concept study along with concept missions for a Europa flyby mission and a Europa orbiter mission. For the flyby mission, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Applied Physics Laboratory received a presentation dubbing the mission Europa Clipper. The mission would orbit Jupiter itself, not Europa, but would be inserted into a Jovian orbit that would allow for a minimum of 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa over the course of the mission. The proposal calls for the Europa Clipper spacecraft to carry ice penetrating radar, a shortwave infrared spectrometer, a topographical imager, and an ion and neutral mass spectrometer to study the habitability aspects of Europa and help select sites for a future Europa lander mission. The Europa Orbiter mission would instead help characterize the subterranean ocean of Europa and also help reveal the moon's interior structures. Under this proposed mission, the Europa Orbiter would carry a mapping camera, a laser altimeter, a radio subsystem suite of instruments, a magnetometer, and a Langmuir probe to determine the electron temperature, electron density, and the electric potential of plasma around Europa. The third and final of the Europa mission concept studies is the Europa Lander, which would help determine the moon's habitability and characterize its astrobiological potential by confirming the presence and determining the characteristics of water within and below Europa's icy outer crust. Pointedly, all three of these concept missions are long-term orbital missions in the Jovian system - meaning NASA's commitment to a mission at Europa would be a long-term, in-situ exploration mission, not a flyby mission. In the United States fiscal year 2014 budget, Congress authorized $80 million in funding for the Europa mission concept studies, and NASA's fiscal year 2015 budget request asks for an additional $15 million for continuation of the concept studies. The Request for Information: The specifics of the Request for Information, released 28 April 2014, ask for concepts for a Europa mission costing less than $1 billion, a figure that excludes the launch vehicle. Specifically, the RFI lists the five major scientific objectives of the proposed Europa mission. These objectives include characterization of the extent of Europa's ocean and its relation to the deeper interior of the moon as well as characterization of the ice shell and any subsurface water, including their heterogeneity, and the nature of the surface-ice-ocean exchange. Furthermore, the mission will need to determine global surface compositions and chemistry, especially as related to habitability; help scientists understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity; identify and characterize candidate sites for future detailed exploration; and understand Europa's space environment and interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. \"This is an opportunity to hear from those creative teams that have ideas on how we can achieve the most science at minimum cost,\" said John Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Europa is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond Earth. The drive to explore Europa has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts.\" Interest in Europa has steadily increased in previous years as scientific findings have pointed to the existence of a liquid water ocean under the moon's icy crust - an ocean containing more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Furthering those findings, the Hubble Space Telescope, in December 2013, observed water vapor above Europa's frigid south polar region, providing the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface. While the RFI is not a request for proposal or formal procurement, and is therefore not a solicitation or commitment by the United States government, it does signify a subtle growth in NASA's focus toward the outer solar system. For Europa, the mission concept studies, if they come to fruition, would make the moon only the second moon in the outer pantheon of the solar system to receive a dedicated mission. Saturn's moon Titan was the first outer solar system moon to receive a dedicated mission when the Huygens lander, piggybacking with the Cassini spacecraf t, landed on the surface of Titan on January 15, 2005. The historical lack of, but importance of, exploration of the outer solar system: This week's step forward for the Europa mission represents a slowly growing focus for NASA toward exploration of the outer solar system - a region of the solar system that is seemingly routinely forgotten in terms of robotic exploration mission funding and execution. But also factoring into the equation is the sheer amount of time and energy it takes to get a spacecraft to those regions. To place a probe into orbit of one of the outer planets, it is not simply a matter of aiming the spacecraft directly at the point where the planet will be at the time of spacecraft arrival. Mission planners and engineers must take into account the relative velocity and trajectory at which a probe must approach one of the outer giants to be captured by the planet's gravity and pulled into a stable orbit. This becomes a very tricky balance when selecting missions for the outer reaches of the solar system: either you have to sacrifice in-situ exploration at the target to get the probe there as quickly as possible or you have to sacrifice science time for a multi-year and sometimes hazardous trek through the solar system for gravity assist maneuvers in order to get the probe to one of the outer planets at a low enough velocity and on the correct low-angle-of-encounter trajectory to be captured by that planet's gravitational field. Thus, exploration of the outer solar system has been confined primarily to flyby missions performed principally by the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes and the two Voyagers. To date, only the Galileo and Cassini missions have been long-term, in-situ exploration missions at Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Uranus and Neptune have received no in-situ exploration missions, and have only been flown-by once, by Voyager 2 in 1986 and 1989. Beyond that, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the New Horizons mission to Pluto are the only two new, but-not-yet-arrived-at-their-destination missions of NASA's in the outer solar system. New Horizons is itself a high-velocity fly-by only mission of Pluto while Juno will be only the third long-term in-situ explorer mission of the outer solar system when it arrives at Jupiter in August 2016. Thus, the NASA Europa mission, if realized, will become only the fourth or fifth such long-term, in-situ mission of the outer solar system. Thus, with two of the world's principal space agencies setting their sights on long-term missions to the Jovian system's moons, and a yet-to-be-addressed proposal for a Uranian exploration mission, the prominence of robotic exploration of the outer solar system is slowly rising - exploration that could have a profound influence on our knowledge of the development of life on worlds other than Earth.

But Europa's fractured brownish-colored surface also suggests activity beneath its icy shell. In fact, some astrobiologists think that underneath this frozen veneer, there may be an ocean of salty liquid water capable of spawning everything from microbial life to extraterrestrial squids. NASA is even talking about sending a planetary orbiter there to learn more about whether it might currently harbor life. About the size of our own moon, Europa is gravitationally-locked with Jupiter and orbits our solar system's largest planet every 3.5 days. At the bottom of its 100 km-deep ocean, the moon is thought to have an iron core surrounded by a rocky mantle. NASA says with abundant liquid water, and energy and chemistry provided by gravity-driven tidal heating, \"Europa could be the best place in the solar system to look for present day life beyond earth.\" But as NASA JPL astrobiologist Kevin Hand points out, for life to evolve it needs at least three major quotients --- liquid water; a handful of essential elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur; and energy that it can harness. Europa likely has a large subsurface ocean which some planetary scientists may harbor life. \"Everything we've learned about life on Earth points toward Europa's ocean being habitable and potentially inhabitated,\" said Hand. \"A null result at Europa would be almost equally or more profound than finding life there.\" Everyone loves a good yarn and while it's tempting to run with this one, here are a few reasons why Europa may not harbor life. \"Because Europa's not making use of sunlight, it's very unlikely to have advanced octopuses\" said Kevin Zahnle, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center. Even though Zahnle says he's not convinced that there is life on Europa, he says people who do presume that the rocky interior interacts with the ocean in such a way to create conditions under which organic compounds can form. The idea is that such interactions, both at the top and bottom of its vast depths, could generate the building blocks for microbial life. Europa's orbital distance from Jupiter varies enough to create gravity-induced tidal flexing on its icy surface and perhaps even on its rocky subsurface. These gravitational tides could also create seafloor volcanic or hydrothermal activity that would in theory offer any burgeoning subsurface life a steady supply of nutrients. That is, if Europa's tectonics are what some researchers hope. \"But there may be no energy source,\" said Norm Sleep, a geophysicist at Stanford University. \"The inner rock seafloor may be tectonically inactive and without tectonics and volcanism, hydrothermal circulation would be weak. Tides may not be enough to maintain cracks in the rock.\" As a result, Zahnle says on Europa, organic molecules might be very scarce. \"You can imagine that you had fewer chances to roll the astrobiological die on Europa than you would have on early earth,\" said Zahnle. On Earth, Hand says the basis of our food chain is driven by photosynthesis. But Europa's ice shell is going to make photosynthesis out of the question. So Hand says \"chemosynthesis,\" energy derived from the interaction of Europa's rocky seafloor and its ocean, may fill an entirely viable niche in an ocean beneath an ice shell. Hand also says energetic particles that hit Europa's would split surface water. He says these particles would likely create compounds like hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, sulfate and carbon dioxide trapped in Europa's surface ice. \"But too much oxygen and it could create an ocean that's full of oxygen bleach in the form of hydrogen peroxide,\" said Hand. \"That could have been a problem for the origin of life on Europa.\" And as Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Maryland, points out, there is more to life than water. \"It may be that Europa has too much water,\" said Lorenz. \"The depth of Europa's internal ocean is 25 times earth's average. That means that these essential elements are very dilute, which makes it hard to bring all the functions of life together.\" In contrast, life here on Earth may have started in coastal tidal pools where the ebb and flow of concentrations of vital organic compounds helped spark the evolution of our planet's first microbial mats. As Lorenz points out, life's metabolism, growth, information storage and replication requires molecules that act together. For this, they have to be physically in proximity. Rather than being a \"rich soup,\" says Lorenz, Europa's ocean may be just mineral water. Even so, NASA is studying the idea of a $2 billion plus Jupiter-orbiting Europa Clipper mission that, if selected, could see launch by the end of the next decade; arriving at Europa by the 2030s. \"We're hoping to get a lander on board but as designed the Clipper has no lander,\" said Hand, who is on the Clipper's science definition team. \"It will fly by Europa more than 40 times and will likely have cameras, spectrometers, and ice penetrating radar.\" Such a mission would pass by Europa at altitudes ranging from 2700 to 25 km, in hopes of characterizing how Europa's ocean and icy surface might interact. However Sleep says the ice at Europa's surface is likely to be tens of km thick. To sample Europa's putative ocean, researchers would first have to find a place where the water has erupted through the ice. \"I'm skeptical that there's even microbial life on Europa,\" said Sleep. \"It's like looking for platinum; a competent mining geologist may work for decades and not find a single economical ore deposit.\" Although Hand thinks Europa does harbor life, he points out that a negative result there would send shivers throughout the astrobiological community. \"If we were to go to Europa and not find life there, to me,\" said Hand, \"that would indicate the origin of life itself is very hard.\" Eight spacecraft have already flown by Europa over the past few decades, and before we head there again, it might behoove us to first put the final nails in Mars' astrobiological coffin. For his part, Hand says \"it's quite likely\" that Mars may have had life in the past and \"may have life today.\" Thus, before spending billions in an attempt to further characterize Europa, it might make more sense to once and for all, determine whether Mars ever had life. After Mars has finally been checked off the list, then by all means proceed to Europa posthaste.

Researchers announced their discovery of the deep watery ocean on Enceladus on Thursday in the journal Science, confirming suspicions held by many scientists since 2005, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft spied geysers of ice and water vapor erupting from Enceladus' south pole. The discovery vaults Enceladus into the top tier of life-hosting candidates along with Europa, an ice-sheathed moon of Jupiter that also hosts a subterranean ocean. Both frigid satellites bear much closer investigation, researchers say. Enceladus has an extensive water ocean under its icy crust, feeding water jets that emerge from near the south pole. See how Enceladus works, and how its water geysers erupt, in this Space.com infographic.

See how Enceladus works, and how its water geysers erupt, in this Space.com infographic. \"I don't know which of the two is going to be more likely to have life. It might be both; it could be neither,\" study co-author Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University told reporters yesterday. \"I think what this discovery tells us is that we just need to be more aggressive in getting the next generation of spacecraft both to Europa and to the Saturn system once the Cassini mission is over.\" Cassini arrived in orbit around Saturn in 2004 and is currently scheduled to go out in a blaze of glory in September 2017, when it will dive headlong into the giant planet's thick atmosphere. Enceladus' geysers blast material hundreds of miles into space, offering a way to sample the moon's subsurface ocean from afar. Cassini has already done some of this work with its mass spectrometer, detecting salts and organic compounds - the carbon-based building blocks of life as we know it - in Enceladus' plumes during flybys of the moon. But Cassini's mass spectrometer can detect only relatively light organics. A follow-up mission to Enceladus should sport a more advanced and more sensitive version of this instrument that could spot a wider range of organics, Lunine said. \"You could actually do this by making flybys of Enceladus, the way that Cassini does now,\" he said. \"I think you could learn quite a bit about the organic inventory in the plume by flying this device.\" Interestingly, astronomers announced in December that they had discovered plumes of water vapor erupting from Europa's south polar region as well. So that moon's ocean could be sampled during flybys, too - perhaps by a mission called the Europa Clipper. NASA is developing the Europa Clipper as a concept mission at the moment. Recent estimates have pegged the mission's cost at around $2 billion. That's pretty steep in these tough economic times, so a scaled-down version might have the best chance of getting it off the ground, NASA officials have said. Enceladus and Europa aren't the only icy moons that harbor subsurface oceans; Jupiter's enormous moon Ganymede also has one, for example. But Ganymede's appears to be sandwiched between layers of ice, while the seas of Enceladus and Europa are in contact with rocky seafloors, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions, researchers say.

NASA said in December the Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapor above the frigid south polar region of Jupiter's moon Europa, providing the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface. In the 2011 National Research Council's decadal survey which guides NASA future mission planning, scientists said a mission to explore Europa and its subsurface ocean offer \"one of the most promising environments in the solar system for supporting life -- should be the second priority for NASA's large- scale planetary science missions. \"This moon, with its probable vast subsurface ocean sandwiched between a potentially active silicate interior and a highly dynamic surface ice shell, offers one of the most promising extraterrestrial habitable environments in our solar system and a plausible model for habitable environments outside it. The Jupiter system in which Europa resides hosts an astonishing diversity of phenomena, illuminating fundamental planetary processes. While Voyager and Galileo taught us much about Europa and the Jupiter system, the relatively primitive instrumentation of those missions, and the low data volumes returned, left many questions unanswered. Major discoveries surely remain to be made,\" the report states. However, the NRC's study said NASA should fly the Jupiter Europa Orbiter only if NASA's budget for planetary science is increased, the report says, and JEO's mission scope is made more affordable. The independent estimate put the overall price tag at a Europa mission at $4.7 billion. The White House 2015 NASA budget request includes $15 million to begin to develop a mission to Europa, so there are no guarantees even that will make is through the congressional financial ringer. Other \"cheaper\" Europa ideas are on the board too and are outlined nicely in this Space Review story. Beyond the potential budgetary battles, NASA's Science Mission Directorate said it will soon issue three components to begin making up a Europa trip. The first announcement will be a Request For Information soliciting brief descriptions of mission concepts that address Decadal Survey science objectives for Europa via missions costing less than $1 billion. Upon review of the RFI responses, NASA may solicit and award funds for further study of credible concepts that are judged to be technically feasible, to fit within the 1B cost cap, and to provide adequate science return. This RFI is targeted for release by the end of April. The second announcement, forecasted here for the end of April 2014, will be a preview Community Announcement describing the planned key parameters of the mission plan or Program Element Appendix. The Community Announcement is intended to convey similar information of interest to potential proposers. The third announcement will be the Europa science instrument investigations itself, currently planned for release by July 2014, to solicit proposals for instrument investigations conducted by a Principal Investigator as part of a robotic mission to explore Europa. NASA said that at the conclusion of this formulation phase, it is planned that a subset of these investigations may be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA also wrote about some key facts about Europa and why it is such a potentially interesting system for further exploration. If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel and Europa would be the size of the dome on the back of the nickel. One day on Europa takes about 3.5 Earth days. The length of Europa's day is the same as the amount of time it takes Europa to orbit Jupiter. Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the sun in about 12 Earth years. Like many other moons, Europa is locked by gravity to its planet so that the same side always faces toward Jupiter. Europa's surface is mostly solid water ice. It is extremely smooth and crisscrossed by fractures. Europa has an extremely thin oxygen atmosphere -- far too thin to breathe. Europa and Jupiter have been visited by eight spacecraft, which have performed flybys. Galileo is the only mission to make repeated visits to Europa. With abundant liquid water, and energy and chemistry provided by tidal heating, Europa could be the best place in the solar system to look for present day life beyond Earth. If Europa's ocean is proven to exist, it would possess more than twice as much water as Earth.

The Decadal Survey: Mars, Europa, and Uranus Stemming from recommendations of the 2013-2022 Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science report, also known as the Decadal Survey, published on 7 March 2011, NASA has taken the next step toward the realization of a mission to Europa - a destination that received prominent billing in the Decadal Survey. The mission to Jupiter's moon received second priority behind a new Mars rover mission and ahead of a mission to Uranus and its moons, all of which were classified as part of NASA's Flagship Mission series. Following the initial release of the Decadal Survey recommendations, NASA immediately took steps to begin studying a mission to Europa. In late 2011, NASA commissioned a Europa lander concept study along with concept missions for a Europa flyby mission and a Europa orbiter mission. For the flyby mission, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Applied Physics Laboratory received a presentation dubbing the mission Europa Clipper. The mission would orbit Jupiter itself, not Europa, but would be inserted into a Jovian orbit that would allow for a minimum of 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa over the course of the mission. The proposal calls for the Europa Clipper spacecraft to carry ice penetrating radar, a shortwave infrared spectrometer, a topographical imager, and an ion and neutral mass spectrometer to study the habitability aspects of Europa and help select sites for a future Europa lander mission. The Europa Orbiter mission would instead help characterize the subterranean ocean of Europa and also help reveal the moon's interior structures. Under this proposed mission, the Europa Orbiter would carry a mapping camera, a laser altimeter, a radio subsystem suite of instruments, a magnetometer, and a Langmuir probe to determine the electron temperature, electron density, and the electric potential of plasma around Europa. The third and final of the Europa mission concept studies is the Europa Lander, which would help determine the moon's habitability and characterize its astrobiological potential by confirming the presence and determining the characteristics of water within and below Europa's icy outer crust. Pointedly, all three of these concept missions are long-term orbital missions in the Jovian system - meaning NASA's commitment to a mission at Europa would be a long-term, in-situ exploration mission, not a flyby mission. In the United States fiscal year 2014 budget, Congress authorized $80 million in funding for the Europa mission concept studies, and NASA's fiscal year 2015 budget request asks for an additional $15 million for continuation of the concept studies. The Request for Information: The specifics of the Request for Information, released 28 April 2014, ask for concepts for a Europa mission costing less than $1 billion, a figure that excludes the launch vehicle. Specifically, the RFI lists the five major scientific objectives of the proposed Europa mission. These objectives include characterization of the extent of Europa's ocean and its relation to the deeper interior of the moon as well as characterization of the ice shell and any subsurface water, including their heterogeneity, and the nature of the surface-ice-ocean exchange. Furthermore, the mission will need to determine global surface compositions and chemistry, especially as related to habitability; help scientists understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity; identify and characterize candidate sites for future detailed exploration; and understand Europa's space environment and interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. \"This is an opportunity to hear from those creative teams that have ideas on how we can achieve the most science at minimum cost,\" said John Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Europa is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond Earth. The drive to explore Europa has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts.\" Interest in Europa has steadily increased in previous years as scientific findings have pointed to the existence of a liquid water ocean under the moon's icy crust - an ocean containing more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Furthering those findings, the Hubble Space Telescope, in December 2013, observed water vapor above Europa's frigid south polar region, providing the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface. While the RFI is not a request for proposal or formal procurement, and is therefore not a solicitation or commitment by the United States government, it does signify a subtle growth in NASA's focus toward the outer solar system. For Europa, the mission concept studies, if they come to fruition, would make the moon only the second moon in the outer pantheon of the solar system to receive a dedicated mission. Saturn's moon Titan was the first outer solar system moon to receive a dedicated mission when the Huygens lander, piggybacking with the Cassini spacecraf t, landed on the surface of Titan on January 15, 2005. The historical lack of, but importance of, exploration of the outer solar system: This week's step forward for the Europa mission represents a slowly growing focus for NASA toward exploration of the outer solar system - a region of the solar system that is seemingly routinely forgotten in terms of robotic exploration mission funding and execution. But also factoring into the equation is the sheer amount of time and energy it takes to get a spacecraft to those regions. To place a probe into orbit of one of the outer planets, it is not simply a matter of aiming the spacecraft directly at the point where the planet will be at the time of spacecraft arrival. Mission planners and engineers must take into account the relative velocity and trajectory at which a probe must approach one of the outer giants to be captured by the planet's gravity and pulled into a stable orbit.

The drive to explore Europa has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts.\" Interest in Europa has steadily increased in previous years as scientific findings have pointed to the existence of a liquid water ocean under the moon's icy crust - an ocean containing more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Furthering those findings, the Hubble Space Telescope, in December 2013, observed water vapor above Europa's frigid south polar region, providing the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface. While the RFI is not a request for proposal or formal procurement, and is therefore not a solicitation or commitment by the United States government, it does signify a subtle growth in NASA's focus toward the outer solar system. For Europa, the mission concept studies, if they come to fruition, would make the moon only the second moon in the outer pantheon of the solar system to receive a dedicated mission. Saturn's moon Titan was the first outer solar system moon to receive a dedicated mission when the Huygens lander, piggybacking with the Cassini spacecraf t, landed on the surface of Titan on January 15, 2005. The historical lack of, but importance of, exploration of the outer solar system: This week's step forward for the Europa mission represents a slowly growing focus for NASA toward exploration of the outer solar system - a region of the solar system that is seemingly routinely forgotten in terms of robotic exploration mission funding and execution. But also factoring into the equation is the sheer amount of time and energy it takes to get a spacecraft to those regions. To place a probe into orbit of one of the outer planets, it is not simply a matter of aiming the spacecraft directly at the point where the planet will be at the time of spacecraft arrival. Mission planners and engineers must take into account the relative velocity and trajectory at which a probe must approach one of the outer giants to be captured by the planet's gravity and pulled into a stable orbit. This becomes a very tricky balance when selecting missions for the outer reaches of the solar system: either you have to sacrifice in-situ exploration at the target to get the probe there as quickly as possible or you have to sacrifice science time for a multi-year and sometimes hazardous trek through the solar system for gravity assist maneuvers in order to get the probe to one of the outer planets at a low enough velocity and on the correct low-angle-of-encounter trajectory to be captured by that planet's gravitational field. Thus, exploration of the outer solar system has been confined primarily to flyby missions performed principally by the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes and the two Voyagers. To date, only the Galileo and Cassini missions have been long-term, in-situ exploration missions at Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Uranus and Neptune have received no in-situ exploration missions, and have only been flown-by once, by Voyager 2 in 1986 and 1989. Beyond that, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the New Horizons mission to Pluto are the only two new, but-not-yet-arrived-at-their-destination missions of NASA's in the outer solar system. New Horizons is itself a high-velocity fly-by only mission of Pluto while Juno will be only the third long-term in-situ explorer mission of the outer solar system when it arrives at Jupiter in August 2016. Thus, the NASA Europa mission, if realized, will become only the fourth or fifth such long-term, in-situ mission of the outer solar system. Thus, with two of the world's principal space agencies setting their sights on long-term missions to the Jovian system's moons, and a yet-to-be-addressed proposal for a Uranian exploration mission, the prominence of robotic exploration of the outer solar system is slowly rising - exploration that could have a profound influence on our knowledge of the development of life on worlds other than Earth.

But Europa's fractured brownish-colored surface also suggests activity beneath its icy shell. In fact, some astrobiologists think that underneath this frozen veneer, there may be an ocean of salty liquid water capable of spawning everything from microbial life to extraterrestrial squids. NASA is even talking about sending a planetary orbiter there to learn more about whether it might currently harbor life. About the size of our own moon, Europa is gravitationally-locked with Jupiter and orbits our solar system's largest planet every 3.5 days. At the bottom of its 100 km-deep ocean, the moon is thought to have an iron core surrounded by a rocky mantle. NASA says with abundant liquid water, and energy and chemistry provided by gravity-driven tidal heating, \"Europa could be the best place in the solar system to look for present day life beyond earth.\" But as NASA JPL astrobiologist Kevin Hand points out, for life to evolve it needs at least three major quotients --- liquid water; a handful of essential elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur; and energy that it can harness. Europa likely has a large subsurface ocean which some planetary scientists may harbor life. \"Everything we've learned about life on Earth points toward Europa's ocean being habitable and potentially inhabitated,\" said Hand. \"A null result at Europa would be almost equally or more profound than finding life there.\" Everyone loves a good yarn and while it's tempting to run with this one, here are a few reasons why Europa may not harbor life. \"Because Europa's not making use of sunlight, it's very unlikely to have advanced octopuses\" said Kevin Zahnle, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center. Even though Zahnle says he's not convinced that there is life on Europa, he says people who do presume that the rocky interior interacts with the ocean in such a way to create conditions under which organic compounds can form. The idea is that such interactions, both at the top and bottom of its vast depths, could generate the building blocks for microbial life. Europa's orbital distance from Jupiter varies enough to create gravity-induced tidal flexing on its icy surface and perhaps even on its rocky subsurface. These gravitational tides could also create seafloor volcanic or hydrothermal activity that would in theory offer any burgeoning subsurface life a steady supply of nutrients. That is, if Europa's tectonics are what some researchers hope. \"But there may be no energy source,\" said Norm Sleep, a geophysicist at Stanford University. \"The inner rock seafloor may be tectonically inactive and without tectonics and volcanism, hydrothermal circulation would be weak. Tides may not be enough to maintain cracks in the rock.\" As a result, Zahnle says on Europa, organic molecules might be very scarce. \"You can imagine that you had fewer chances to roll the astrobiological die on Europa than you would have on early earth,\" said Zahnle. On Earth, Hand says the basis of our food chain is driven by photosynthesis. But Europa's ice shell is going to make photosynthesis out of the question. So Hand says \"chemosynthesis,\" energy derived from the interaction of Europa's rocky seafloor and its ocean, may fill an entirely viable niche in an ocean beneath an ice shell. Hand also says energetic particles that hit Europa's would split surface water. He says these particles would likely create compounds like hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, sulfate and carbon dioxide trapped in Europa's surface ice. \"But too much oxygen and it could create an ocean that's full of oxygen bleach in the form of hydrogen peroxide,\" said Hand. \"That could have been a problem for the origin of life on Europa.\" And as Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Maryland, points out, there is more to life than water. \"It may be that Europa has too much water,\" said Lorenz. \"The depth of Europa's internal ocean is 25 times earth's average. That means that these essential elements are very dilute, which makes it hard to bring all the functions of life together.\" In contrast, life here on Earth may have started in coastal tidal pools where the ebb and flow of concentrations of vital organic compounds helped spark the evolution of our planet's first microbial mats. As Lorenz points out, life's metabolism, growth, information storage and replication requires molecules that act together. For this, they have to be physically in proximity. Rather than being a \"rich soup,\" says Lorenz, Europa's ocean may be just mineral water. Even so, NASA is studying the idea of a $2 billion plus Jupiter-orbiting Europa Clipper mission that, if selected, could see launch by the end of the next decade; arriving at Europa by the 2030s. \"We're hoping to get a lander on board but as designed the Clipper has no lander,\" said Hand, who is on the Clipper's science definition team. \"It will fly by Europa more than 40 times and will likely have cameras, spectrometers, and ice penetrating radar.\" Such a mission would pass by Europa at altitudes ranging from 2700 to 25 km, in hopes of characterizing how Europa's ocean and icy surface might interact. However Sleep says the ice at Europa's surface is likely to be tens of km thick. To sample Europa's putative ocean, researchers would first have to find a place where the water has erupted through the ice. \"I'm skeptical that there's even microbial life on Europa,\" said Sleep. \"It's like looking for platinum; a competent mining geologist may work for decades and not find a single economical ore deposit.\" Although Hand thinks Europa does harbor life, he points out that a negative result there would send shivers throughout the astrobiological community. \"If we were to go to Europa and not find life there, to me,\" said Hand, \"that would indicate the origin of life itself is very hard.\" Eight spacecraft have already flown by Europa over the past few decades, and before we head there again, it might behoove us to first put the final nails in Mars' astrobiological coffin. For his part, Hand says \"it's quite likely\" that Mars may have had life in the past and \"may have life today.\" Thus, before spending billions in an attempt to further characterize Europa, it might make more sense to once and for all, determine whether Mars ever had life. After Mars has finally been checked off the list, then by all means proceed to Europa posthaste.

Magner said after his presentation that using solar power would increase the spacecraft's mass in order to accommodate the panels and structures, although it remained well within current design margins. A few other tweaks would be needed to the spacecraft's design to incorporate the solar panels, he said. While NASA has not yet decided to develop Europa Clipper or any other mission to Europa, Magner said the project passed a NASA-sponsored mission concept review in September \"with flying colors\" and predicted the agency would move ahead with it. \"We expect later this year for NASA to select us as the mission they want to go forward with to Europa, and we'll get a new start early next year,\" he said. If NASA does choose to proceed with Europa Clipper, it will defer a choice of launch vehicle for several years. One mission design could use an existing rocket, such as the workhorse Atlas 5.

An alternative approach would use NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket to send Europa Clipper on a direct trajectory to Jupiter. A mid-2022 launch would allow the spacecraft to reach Jupiter in fewer than three years, without the need of any flybys. Launching on SLS, Magner said, would reduce the costs of operating Europa Clipper given the much shorter travel time to Jupiter, and also simplify the thermal design since the spacecraft would not have to perform a Venus flyby in order to reach Jupiter. However, it was unclear how much more Europa Clipper would have to pay for an SLS launch. Steve Creech, NASA's SLS assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships, said here that the agency was still evaluating how much of SLS's fixed costs a science mission like Europa Clipper would have to pay for a launch. \"That's a decision above our pay grade,\" he said.

The White House's fiscal year 2016 budget request for NASA, which was released Monday, allocates $18.5 billion to the space agency, including $30 million to formulate a mission to Europa, perhaps the solar system's best bet to host alien life. NASA has been studying a potential Europa mission for a while now, but the new budget proposal signals a commitment from the White House that wasn't there before. \"For the first time, the budget supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission, allowing NASA to begin project formulation, Phase A,\" NASA officials wrote in a summary of the proposed budget. Indeed, the new budget request assumes multiple years of funding for a Europa mission, said NASA Chief Financial Officer David Radzanowski. \"The current funding profile would assume a launch in the mid-2020s,\" Radzanowski told reporters during a conference call Monday. It's unclear at the moment just how much NASA and the Europa project will actually get in the 2016 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 2015. Congress must approve the final budget, which often looks quite different than the one proposed by the White House. For example, the Obama administration allocated $15 million for early work on a potential Europa mission in its FY 2015 budget request, but Congress later upped that to $100 million. NASA appears to be zeroing in on a mission that would feature multiple flybys of Europa - perhaps something along the lines of the Europa Clipper, a concept being developed by agency scientists and engineers. Once in orbit around Jupiter, the Clipper would make 45 flybys of the 1,900-mile-wide Europa over the course of 3.5 years, as the concept is currently envisioned. Europa is thought to possess an ocean of liquid water under its icy shell. During its many flybys, the Clipper would confirm and study that ocean, yielding insights about its depth, salinity and conductivity, among other characteristics. The Clipper would also measure and map Europa's ice shell, returning data that could be useful for a potential future mission to the moon's surface. \"Sounding the ice shell would be key,\" said David Senske of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Europa Clipper pre-project deputy project scientist. \"We have a preconceived notion of what a lander looks like,\" Senske told Space.com in December at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. \"What we find may not support our preconceived notion.\" If everything goes according to plan, the Europa Clipper could be ready to launch as early as 2022, Senske said. The mission would probably cost about $2 billion.

Embedded in that budget is a small-yet significant-detail: About $30 million will be allocated to fund a robotic mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. For the scientific community, that's huge news, as Europa is probably the top candidate for finding potential life elsewhere in our solar system. Scientists theorize that underneath Europa's icy surface, there lies a vast salty ocean, holding more than twice the amount of water as all the oceans of Earth. And if that ocean does exist, its conditions may be just right for it to be home to an entire ecosystem. \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the keystones for habitability.\" \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the three keystones for habitability,\" Kevin Hand, the deputy chief scientist of solar system exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tells Popular Science. \"And that is of liquid water, access to the elements needed to build life, and potentially the energy needed to power life.\" NASA has been contemplating a trip to Europa for a couple of years, and Congress recently gave the project $100 million for 2015. While the White House proposal only allots $30 million, the fact that it's coming from the president is important. NASA is an executive branch agency, in need of White House support, and the administration's new budget \"supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission.\" That means NASA engineers can finally put their planning into action. \"They want us to move into the next phase of the mission,\" says Robert Pappalardo, the Europa Clipper pre-project scientist at JPL. \"So we're moving to Phase A, where you become a real mission, not just a concept.\" What's So Special About Europa? Europa is a bit of an anomaly within our solar system. The moon's outer layer consists of an icy sheet, somewhere between 1 mile and 18 miles thick. Due to the ice's smooth surface and lack of impact craters, researchers believe that this layer is relatively young and active, meaning something-such as an icy, volcanic flow underneath-is constantly renewing the ice and erasing past imperfections. This has led many experts to support the theory that there's an ocean underneath the icy crust. The idea was further solidified in 1995 during NASA's Galileo mission, in which a probe entered orbit around Jupiter. As it passed by the moons, the Galileo spacecraft found that Jupiter's magnetic field was disrupted in the area around Europa. The disruption indicates that an electrically conductive fluid beneath the moon's surface is inducing a special kind of magnetic field around the satellite. And given Europa's icy outer shell, that substance is most likely water. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. Europa isn't the only extraterrestrial body in our solar system thought to house a liquid ocean, but the moon holds a number of other key properties that particularly titillate experts-notably, its constant radiation bath. Jupiter bombards Europa with intense radiation, which breaks up compounds on the ice's surface into essential elements. \"That radiation is deadly to us, but that same radiation bombarding the water, it liberates the hydrogen and leaves oxygen behind, making oxidants,\" says Pappalardo. \"And those are great for life.\" The free hydrogen and oxygen combine with other surface materials to make important building blocks for life, including hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and more. Along with creating these compounds, Europa may also provide the energy needed to sustain life, as well. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. This direct interaction between the water and heated rock could be just what the planet needs to trigger the energy needed for life.\"On Earth's ocean floors, the interior is hot, and the water comes in contact with the heated rock below, and that water gets charged,\" says Pappalardo. \"There's chemical energy there, and those areas are teaming with life.\" If the compounds from Europa's surface are warmed by the energetic ocean floor below, the combination could spark the growth of aliens right here within our solar system. Of course, all of these features of Europa are purely hypothetical. NASA has no direct evidence of an ocean, but engineers at the space agency are really eager to verify that it exists. Now, with the most recent announcement from the White House, they will finally get that chance. NASA has been mulling over different ways to get to Europa for years, but finding the right method has been difficult. Because of the high radiation environment surrounding the moon, sending a spacecraft into orbit would require a lot of extra hardware and heat shielding to protect the vehicle from all the charged particles. And that adds up cost-wise. One scrapped idea to visit Europa along with two other Jupiter moons was estimated to cost $27 billion. \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive,\" says Pappalardo. \"Now we think it's just right.\" The idea moving forward is the Europa Clipper mission. Rather than send a probe into constant orbit around Europa, NASA wants to send a spacecraft to \"clip\" Europa, performing 45 flybys of the moon over a long period of time. \"Most of the time we'd be far from Europa and Jupiter, then we'd swoop in every couple of weeks, gather lots of data and then get out,\" says Pappalardo. \"We call it a toe dip; you get your feet in the water and then run back out on the sand.\" \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive. Now we think it's just right. During these flybys, the radiation-tolerant spacecraft will travel to varying altitudes above Europa and use different instruments to study the moon's composition. Although the exact instruments for the payload haven't been determined yet, Pappalardo says the main thing the probe will be studying is the gravitational pull on the spacecraft by Europa. This tugging and pulling can help confirm the presence of an ocean. \"If there is an ocean, Europa's ice shell will flex by 100 feet every time it orbits Jupiter\" say Pappalardo, \"...So when we encounter Europa, and it's all stretched out, then it indicates water underneath. If there's no liquid water, that icy shell is kind of glued to the rock below, so it'll only flex by about 1 foot.\" Since the scientific community is pretty well convinced that an ocean awaits, Pappalardo's team wants to go one step further and analyze what those waters are like. By equipping the spacecraft with a magnetometer, the researchers can measure the changing magnetic field around Europa, which indicates the thickness and the saltiness of the subsurface sea. Radar on the spacecraft will also determine the thickness of the outer ice shell. Additional instruments under consideration for use include a topographic camera, a neutral mass spectrometer to sniff out Europa's atmosphere, and an infrared spectrometer to study the composition of Europa's surface. Right now, Pappalardo's team is working toward a launch date of 2022, hoping to send the spacecraft aboard NASA's Space Launch System, the mega-rocket currently in development at the Michoud Assembly Facility. On that rocket, travel time to the Jupiter system would take just three years. Overall, the main goal of this mission is to see if Europa is a place where life could be present. If Europa Clipper does indeed find life-sustaining conditions, the discovery could lead to a follow-up mission that look for more direct evidence of alien microbes. \"All life on earth uses the DNA, RNA, protein paradigm, and so part of why we want to go to Europa is to essentially test the biology hypothesis to see if life arises wherever conditions are right.\" says Hand. If we do find life on Europa someday, the finding will change everything. It answers that all-powerful question: Are we alone? Just a few microbes on Europa mean that life is probably pretty common throughout the universe. And if there are no traces of life on Europa, even when conditions are ideal, that too denotes a huge finding. \"If the ingredients are there and there's no life,\" says Pappalardo, \"then wow, life must be even more special and rare than we imagined.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/look-inside-nasas-future-europa-clipper-mission/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa mission to search for alien life", "date": "2015-02-22", "content": "NASA is planning a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to search for signs of alien life on the icy, ocean-harbouring world. NASA has asked scientists to consider ways that a Europa mission could search for evidence of alien life in the plumes of water vapour that apparently blast into space from Europa's south polar region. These plumes, which NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted in December 2012, provide a possible way to sample Europa's ocean of liquid water, which is buried beneath the moon's icy shell, researchers said. NASA is zeroing in on a flyby mission design, something along the lines of a long-studied concept called the Europa Clipper. As currently envisioned, Clipper would travel to Jupiter orbit, then make 45 flybys of Europa over 3.5 years, at altitudes ranging from 25 km to 2,700 km. The USD 2.1 billion mission would study Europa's subsurface ocean, giving researchers a better understanding of the water's depth, salinity and other characteristics. NASA also wants to add plume sampling to the Europa mission's task list, if possible. During a Europa plume workshop at the Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley earlier this week, NASA science chief John Grunsfeld urged attendees to \"think outside the box\" and come up with feasible ways to study the moon's plumes. Researchers would want to analyse bits of Europa material in well-equipped labs here on Earth, but bringing samples back is likely beyond the scope of the flyby mission currently under consideration. However, it may be possible to detect biomolecules onsite, using gear aboard a Clipper-like probe, researchers said. Spotting a set of amino acids that all display the same chirality, or handedness, in plume material would be strong evidence of Europan life, astrobiologist Chris McKay, of NASA Ames, said at the workshop. Collecting enough plume material to perform such analyses will likely prove extremely challenging, 'SPACE.com' reported. It may require flying so low and so slowly that it makes more sense to send a lander down to the Europa surface through the plume, said astrobiologist Kevin Hand of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. However, first the spacecraft should be able to find the water vapour when it gets to Europa. At the moment, the plume remains unconfirmed; scientists have pointed Hubble at Europa repeatedly since the initial 2012 detection, but have come up empty in attempts to spot it again. So, if the plume exists, it is apparently sporadic or episodic, not continuous like the powerhouse geysers that erupt from the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, researchers said.

In an Oct. 3 presentation at the 65th International Astronautical Congress here, Europa Clipper Deputy Project Manager Thomas Magner of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, said that using large solar panels for the mission was both technically viable and less expensive than a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). \"For the last two years, we did extensive risk reduction work looking at whether solar is feasible,\" Magner said. \"We found that solar works fine, so our final decision about two months ago was to go to solar.\" Those tests included subjecting solar cells to a range of temperatures and radiation conditions the spacecraft would experience during the mission. Engineers also examined whether the large solar panels, with an area of 50 square meters, would cause jitter that would adversely affect the spacecraft's scientific instruments. Europa Clipper would not be the first solar-powered Jupiter mission: NASA's Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011 and scheduled to go into orbit around Jupiter in July 2016, also uses solar panels. Magner said they tested solar cells used for Juno, exposing them to a wider range of temperatures to reflect the different trajectory that Europa Clipper would take to reach Jupiter. A solar-powered Europa Clipper would be less expensive than one that used an RTG, Magner said, although he did not quantify the difference in costs. It would eliminate the need for an environmental impact statement that is required for nuclear-powered spacecraft and launch approval from the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It would also free up constrained supplies of plutonium-238, the isotope used in RTGs, for other potential missions. Magner said after his presentation that using solar power would increase the spacecraft's mass in order to accommodate the panels and structures, although it remained well within current design margins. A few other tweaks would be needed to the spacecraft's design to incorporate the solar panels, he said. While NASA has not yet decided to develop Europa Clipper or any other mission to Europa, Magner said the project passed a NASA-sponsored mission concept review in September \"with flying colors\" and predicted the agency would move ahead with it. \"We expect later this year for NASA to select us as the mission they want to go forward with to Europa, and we'll get a new start early next year,\" he said. If NASA does choose to proceed with Europa Clipper, it will defer a choice of launch vehicle for several years. One mission design could use an existing rocket, such as the workhorse Atlas 5. In that scenario, Europa Clipper would launch in mid-2022 and, after a series of gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, arrive at Jupiter in early 2030. An alternative approach would use NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket to send Europa Clipper on a direct trajectory to Jupiter. A mid-2022 launch would allow the spacecraft to reach Jupiter in fewer than three years, without the need of any flybys. Launching on SLS, Magner said, would reduce the costs of operating Europa Clipper given the much shorter travel time to Jupiter, and also simplify the thermal design since the spacecraft would not have to perform a Venus flyby in order to reach Jupiter. However, it was unclear how much more Europa Clipper would have to pay for an SLS launch. Steve Creech, NASA's SLS assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships, said here that the agency was still evaluating how much of SLS's fixed costs a science mission like Europa Clipper would have to pay for a launch. \"That's a decision above our pay grade,\" he said. Magner said he anticipated that NASA would hold off on making a launch vehicle choice until the program completes its preliminary design review (PDR), currently scheduled for 2018. \"Our intention is to maintain dual launch capability through PDR,\" he said, \"and then, based on [NASA] headquarters direction, proceed with just one launch vehicle.\"", "url": "https://spacenews.com/42121europa-clipper-opts-for-solar-power-over-nuclear/"}, {"title": "To Europa! Mission to Jupiter's Moon Gains Support in Congress", "date": "2014-11-06", "content": "Scientists who want to explore Jupiter's ocean-harboring moon Europa have some allies in high places. Several influential congresspeople are among those calling for a mission to Europa, which is regarded by many scientists as the best place to search for life beyond Earth. \"We don't need to wait to go find life in another solar system,\" Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, said in July. \"It's right here in our own backyard.\" 'Defining moment in our lifetime': Culberson spoke at \"The Lure of Europa,\" a public meeting organized in Washington, D.C., by nonprofit group The Planetary Society. His words came just one day after NASA scientist Kevin Hand stated at a public NASA forum that he thought humans would find life in the universe in the next two decades, and on the same day that NASA released its call for scientific instruments for a planned Europa mission. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House of Representatives' Science, Space and Technology Committee, kicked things off at \"The Lure of Europa\" by wishing the world could see how excited attendees were about the Jupiter moon. Some members of the audience remained standing, while others sat on the floor. \"There is a general apparent interest in the subject of space in the American people,\" Smith said. He went on to discuss the special interest people have in exoplanets, particularly Earth-like planets, with an even keener emphasis on finding Earth-like planets that might have indications of life. \"Just the mere idea of the forms of those lives is enough to keep us exploring for several years,\" Smith said. [5 Bold Claims of Alien Life] Culberson called the future discovery of extraterrestrial life \"the defining moment in our lifetime.\" \"It will define our civilization,\" he said. Europa is a particularly good place to hunt for potential alien life, Culberson added. Scientists think that, beneath its icy crust, Europa contains three to four times more water than Earth does, and that its seafloor may be heated by geologic activity. Radiation from Jupiter helps produce some of the chemicals required for life on the moon's surface. Recently, scientists discovered geysers in Europa's southern hemisphere - a finding that could potentially allow for the exploration of the underground ocean without the need to pierce the icy crust. In 2013, the U.S. National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Review issued its 10-year recommendation for planetary exploration for NASA and the National Science Foundation. The report ranked an exploration of Europa as the highest-priority mission. Past budget cuts had endangered funding for studying the Jovian moon - a problem that the representatives hope to rectify in the future. \"It's our job to make sure there's enough funding to fund these exciting missions,\" Culberson said, referring to his role as a member of the House Committee on Appropriations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is also on the House Committee on Appropriations, spoke at the \"Lure of Europa\" event as well. \"It's clearly a priority for us, and will continue to be a priority for us,\" he said, referring to the long-standing interest in Jupiter's icy moon. Schiff's district is home to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the lead NASA center for building and operating robotic planetary explorers, including the Mars rover Curiosity. Congress allocated NASA $155 million over the last two years to study a possible mission to Europa, and the White House allocated $15 million toward this end in its 2015 federal budget request. NASA officials say they hope to launch a roughly $1 billion Europa mission in the mid-2020s or so. Supporting the mission: NASA's current plans consist of launching a probe that will do multiple flybys, as there is not yet enough data to select a safe landing site on the moon. This initial mission could help pave the way to put a probe down on Europa someday, NASA officials say. \"We have a lot more challenges on the way to Europa, both here and in space,\" Schiff warned. But overcoming those challenges could result in exciting discoveries, he added. \"I don't know what we'll find there, but I know it will be amazing,\" Schiff said of Europa. Culberson added that the taxpayers who fund the exploration of Europa will play a role in the results - a responsibility that will be especially important if scientists find life on Europa. \"[Imagine if] we had some role, some part to play in finding life on another world and changing mankind for the better,\" Culberson said. \"What better legacy could we possibly leave?\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/27660-jupiter-moon-europa-exploration-congress.html"}, {"title": "NASA Europa Mission Gets White House Approval", "date": "2015-02-03", "content": "The quest to explore Jupiter's ocean-harboring moon Europa has taken a big step forward. The White House's fiscal year 2016 budget request for NASA, which was released Monday, allocates $18.5 billion to the space agency, including $30 million to formulate a mission to Europa, perhaps the solar system's best bet to host alien life. NASA has been studying a potential Europa mission for a while now, but the new budget proposal signals a commitment from the White House that wasn't there before. \"For the first time, the budget supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission, allowing NASA to begin project formulation, Phase A,\" NASA officials wrote in a summary of the proposed budget. Indeed, the new budget request assumes multiple years of funding for a Europa mission, said NASA Chief Financial Officer David Radzanowski. \"The current funding profile would assume a launch in the mid-2020s,\" Radzanowski told reporters during a conference call Monday. It's unclear at the moment just how much NASA and the Europa project will actually get in the 2016 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 2015. Congress must approve the final budget, which often looks quite different than the one proposed by the White House. For example, the Obama administration allocated $15 million for early work on a potential Europa mission in its FY 2015 budget request, but Congress later upped that to $100 million.

However, first the spacecraft should be able to find the water vapour when it gets to Europa. At the moment, the plume remains unconfirmed; scientists have pointed Hubble at Europa repeatedly since the initial 2012 detection, but have come up empty in attempts to spot it again. So, if the plume exists, it is apparently sporadic or episodic, not continuous like the powerhouse geysers that erupt from the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, researchers said.

One concept led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is the favorite to win NASA's backing. The Europa Clipper mission came out of a multi-year study to slash the cost of a mission to study the enigmatic moon, eventually settling on a projected price tag near $2 billion - excluding launch costs - less than half the estimated cost of a Europa probe published in a decadal survey report by the National Research Council in 2011. Scientists and engineers found savings in switching the probe from a nuclear-powered design to a solar power source and crafting a mission to fly by Europa dozens of times instead of entering orbit around the icy moon. Officials say the Europa Clipper concept may need some tweaks, but it gives NASA a good starting point for development expected to start after it wins programmatic approval in a milestone expected as soon as mid-2015. The milestone, known as Key Decision Point A (KDP-A) in NASA's parlance, will mark the start of full-scale development of the Europa probe. Decisions on scientific instrumentation, mission design, a launch vehicle and launch date, and international partnerships will follow. \"Europa Clipper has had quite an important evolution,\" Green said in a Feb. 19 meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group. \"It is a proof of concept that says we can do it, and it's not a $4 billion mission as we studied and discussed at the decadal, so it has made major progress.\" Barry Goldstein, who leads the Europa Clipper studies as pre-project manager at JPL, said the mission passed a major hurdle in September, when reviewers deemed the concept mature enough for consideration in NASA's mission portfolio. Congress has backed the Europa mission with $255 million over the last three years, an order of magnitude more than the White House requested over the same period. \"Given the fact that we have this funding, we're proceeding on this path and not slowing down,\" Goldstein told the OPAG meeting Feb. 19. The Obama administration is asking Congress for $30 million - enough to formally turn on development of a Europa mission - in fiscal year 2016, which begins Oct. 1. \"Congress has been quite generous,\" Green said, adding the funding approved by lawmakers the last three years gives the Europa project a \"really rich start\" compared to the beginnings of most of NASA's other robotic science missions. \"It is highly unsuual that the mission concepts that enter (formulation and development) are as mature as we have in looking at Europa,\" Green said. NASA plans to take the first step at selecting instruments to fly on the Europa mission in April, when the space agency will award funding to the top-rated science teams to refine their proposals and reduce the risks of developing the sensors. Final instrument decisions are expected in 2016, giving NASA time to evaluate what set of sensors should be flown to Europa in hopes of probing the ocean thought to lie below the moon's global ice sheet. The mission could also sample watery plumes that may exist over Europa's south pole, where a flyby probe could dash through material lofted from below the surface. Scientists announced in 2013 that the Hubble Space Telescope detected evidence for the plumes, thrusting a mission to Europa back on the science community's agenda after being overshadowed by NASA's push toward Mars. Follow-up observations by Hubble are planned to try and confirm the plume detection. \"I can't overemphasize the importance of the Hubble observations (of the plumes) that allowed us to renew the conversation about Europa being an active world,\" Green said. While Green said the Europa Clipper study has \"popped to the top\" of the Europa mission concepts considered by NASA, the design could require some fine-tuning to accommodate all the objectives the agency wants to accomplish. \"Perhaps additional instruments need to be brought on to investigate the plume,\" Green said, adding that NASA is examining ideas to deploy CubeSats or drop a lander or impactor to Europe's surface. Green said NASA has asked the European Space Agency if it is interested in contributing to the Europa mission. ESA plans to launch its own probe to Jupiter in 2022 to conduct multiple flybys of the giant planet's moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa before eventually looping into orbit around Ganymede. While ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission will fly by Europa twice, NASA's Europa Clipper concept could zip past it 45 times. ESA participated in NASA's last flagship-class mission to the outer solar system. The European-built Huygens lander accompanied the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn, then parachuted to a landing on the moon Titan in 2005. NASA and ESA planned to partner on a joint mission to the Jupiter comprising two spacecraft, one to orbit Europa and another to circle Ganymede. But budget limitations kept the U.S. space agency from going forward with its part of the mission, which had a projected cost of nearly $5 billion. ESA moved forward with the European-led JUICE mission, and NASA went back to the drawing board before eventually coming up with the Europa Clipper proposal. \"ESA's really been our best partner,\" Green said. \"They've been fabulous working with us. We've had ups and downs in the past, but all seems to be forgiven and we're right back together. I want to give them an opportunity to be part of this mission. We shouldn't let that go, and we have to let that evolve. \"There are a number of concepts that we've asked them to look at, and they've started to look at them,\" Green said. NASA is officially targeting launch of the Europa probe in the mid-2020s, but Goldstein said the Europa Clipper concept is far enough along to potentially be ready for flight by June 2022, when the positions of Earth and Jupiter make the journey possible. \"We're a mission that will launch some time in the early-to-mid-2020s,\" Goldstein said. \"Our best case scenario is launching in an opportunity that opens up in May to June of 2022, and we're holding that.\" Goldstein said engineers have studied launching Europa Clipper on NASA's Space Launch System - a behemoth rocket designed to launch astronauts into deep space - or the most powerful version of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket with five strap-on solid rocket boosters. The mission concept review board in September concluded the SLS launch option was \"far superior\" to other alternatives because it would allow the probe to fly directly to Jupiter in less than two years. Launching on a smaller rocket would require gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, adding three-and-a-half years to the voyage. But lifting off aboard the SLS would be more costly - the Europa Clipper study assumed $500 million - and NASA would have to insert the Europa launch into the heavy-lift rocket's manifest between launches with crews. The Europa Clipper team opted to go with a solar-powered design instead of using a plutonium power generator, a decision Goldstein said saves money and still leaves plenty of margin for growth if the spacecraft needs more electricity or gets bigger. Goldstein said the Europa team is following the progress of NASA's Juno mission, which is fitted with solar panels and on the way to Jupiter, with arrival in orbit set for July 2016. Juno will study Jupiter's magnetic field and internal structure, and the probe will set a record for the most distant mission to rely on solar energy. Solar cells at Jupiter's distance from the sun produce a fraction of the electricity as they do at Earth. Officials are still evaluating whether it will be better to use solar cells flown on Juno or switch to a more high-tech design to give out more power. \"We can either cash that in with less area for the (solar) arrays or more power for the system, to be determined at this point,\" Goldstein said. \"But we're not counting on that new technology. We wanted existence proof to show that we had what we needed to make the jump away from (nuclear power).\" Officials hope to decide between the old or new solar cell technology by the middle of 2015, then NASA could begin buying test and flight units as part of the mission's long-lead purchases, according to Goldstein. Other upcoming milestones include the build-up of a testbed to test the spacecraft's avionics, and tests of components for the mission's thermal control system. \"We don't have significant engineering risks on the baseline engineering subsystems,\" Goldstein said. But Europa Clipper's instrument package, expected to include spectrometers, cameras, an ice-penetrating radar and potential daughter probes, could have a tough time handling the harsh radiation environment at Jupiter. \"When the instruments are selected, they are subjected to a much more harsh environment than the rest of the engineering system,\" Goldstein said. \"Where I think our biggest challenges are going to be is in the sensors and the other elements that are not cocooned inside the vault that we've created in this architecture. I'm really worried about the challenges the instruments are going to have in development.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/10/europa-clipper-concept-team-aims-for-launch-in-2022/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "To Europa! Mission to Jupiter's Moon Gains Support in Congress", "date": "2014-11-06", "content": "Scientists who want to explore Jupiter's ocean-harboring moon Europa have some allies in high places. Several influential congresspeople are among those calling for a mission to Europa, which is regarded by many scientists as the best place to search for life beyond Earth. \"We don't need to wait to go find life in another solar system,\" Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, said in July. \"It's right here in our own backyard.\" 'Defining moment in our lifetime': Culberson spoke at \"The Lure of Europa,\" a public meeting organized in Washington, D.C., by nonprofit group The Planetary Society. His words came just one day after NASA scientist Kevin Hand stated at a public NASA forum that he thought humans would find life in the universe in the next two decades, and on the same day that NASA released its call for scientific instruments for a planned Europa mission. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House of Representatives' Science, Space and Technology Committee, kicked things off at \"The Lure of Europa\" by wishing the world could see how excited attendees were about the Jupiter moon. Some members of the audience remained standing, while others sat on the floor. \"There is a general apparent interest in the subject of space in the American people,\" Smith said. He went on to discuss the special interest people have in exoplanets, particularly Earth-like planets, with an even keener emphasis on finding Earth-like planets that might have indications of life. \"Just the mere idea of the forms of those lives is enough to keep us exploring for several years,\" Smith said. [5 Bold Claims of Alien Life] Culberson called the future discovery of extraterrestrial life \"the defining moment in our lifetime.\" \"It will define our civilization,\" he said. Europa is a particularly good place to hunt for potential alien life, Culberson added. Scientists think that, beneath its icy crust, Europa contains three to four times more water than Earth does, and that its seafloor may be heated by geologic activity. Radiation from Jupiter helps produce some of the chemicals required for life on the moon's surface. Recently, scientists discovered geysers in Europa's southern hemisphere - a finding that could potentially allow for the exploration of the underground ocean without the need to pierce the icy crust. In 2013, the U.S. National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Review issued its 10-year recommendation for planetary exploration for NASA and the National Science Foundation. The report ranked an exploration of Europa as the highest-priority mission. Past budget cuts had endangered funding for studying the Jovian moon - a problem that the representatives hope to rectify in the future. \"It's our job to make sure there's enough funding to fund these exciting missions,\" Culberson said, referring to his role as a member of the House Committee on Appropriations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is also on the House Committee on Appropriations, spoke at the \"Lure of Europa\" event as well. \"It's clearly a priority for us, and will continue to be a priority for us,\" he said, referring to the long-standing interest in Jupiter's icy moon. Schiff's district is home to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the lead NASA center for building and operating robotic planetary explorers, including the Mars rover Curiosity. Congress allocated NASA $155 million over the last two years to study a possible mission to Europa, and the White House allocated $15 million toward this end in its 2015 federal budget request. NASA officials say they hope to launch a roughly $1 billion Europa mission in the mid-2020s or so. Supporting the mission: NASA's current plans consist of launching a probe that will do multiple flybys, as there is not yet enough data to select a safe landing site on the moon. This initial mission could help pave the way to put a probe down on Europa someday, NASA officials say. \"We have a lot more challenges on the way to Europa, both here and in space,\" Schiff warned. But overcoming those challenges could result in exciting discoveries, he added. \"I don't know what we'll find there, but I know it will be amazing,\" Schiff said of Europa. Culberson added that the taxpayers who fund the exploration of Europa will play a role in the results - a responsibility that will be especially important if scientists find life on Europa. \"[Imagine if] we had some role, some part to play in finding life on another world and changing mankind for the better,\" Culberson said. \"What better legacy could we possibly leave?\"", "url": "https://www.space.com/27660-jupiter-moon-europa-exploration-congress.html"}, {"title": "NASA Europa Mission Gets White House Approval", "date": "2015-02-03", "content": "The quest to explore Jupiter's ocean-harboring moon Europa has taken a big step forward. The White House's fiscal year 2016 budget request for NASA, which was released Monday, allocates $18.5 billion to the space agency, including $30 million to formulate a mission to Europa, perhaps the solar system's best bet to host alien life. NASA has been studying a potential Europa mission for a while now, but the new budget proposal signals a commitment from the White House that wasn't there before. \"For the first time, the budget supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission, allowing NASA to begin project formulation, Phase A,\" NASA officials wrote in a summary of the proposed budget. Indeed, the new budget request assumes multiple years of funding for a Europa mission, said NASA Chief Financial Officer David Radzanowski. \"The current funding profile would assume a launch in the mid-2020s,\" Radzanowski told reporters during a conference call Monday. It's unclear at the moment just how much NASA and the Europa project will actually get in the 2016 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 2015. Congress must approve the final budget, which often looks quite different than the one proposed by the White House. For example, the Obama administration allocated $15 million for early work on a potential Europa mission in its FY 2015 budget request, but Congress later upped that to $100 million. NASA appears to be zeroing in on a mission that would feature multiple flybys of Europa - perhaps something along the lines of the Europa Clipper, a concept being developed by agency scientists and engineers. Once in orbit around Jupiter, the Clipper would make 45 flybys of the 1,900-mile-wide Europa over the course of 3.5 years, as the concept is currently envisioned. Europa is thought to possess an ocean of liquid water under its icy shell. During its many flybys, the Clipper would confirm and study that ocean, yielding insights about its depth, salinity and conductivity, among other characteristics. The Clipper would also measure and map Europa's ice shell, returning data that could be useful for a potential future mission to the moon's surface. \"Sounding the ice shell would be key,\" said David Senske of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Europa Clipper pre-project deputy project scientist. \"We have a preconceived notion of what a lander looks like,\" Senske told Space.com in December at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. \"What we find may not support our preconceived notion.\" If everything goes according to plan, the Europa Clipper could be ready to launch as early as 2022, Senske said. The mission would probably cost about $2 billion. The Europa mission will really start coming into focus just a few months from now: NASA aims to select science instruments for the mission this spring, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Monday.

Embedded in that budget is a small-yet significant-detail: About $30 million will be allocated to fund a robotic mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. For the scientific community, that's huge news, as Europa is probably the top candidate for finding potential life elsewhere in our solar system. Scientists theorize that underneath Europa's icy surface, there lies a vast salty ocean, holding more than twice the amount of water as all the oceans of Earth. And if that ocean does exist, its conditions may be just right for it to be home to an entire ecosystem. \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the keystones for habitability.\" \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the three keystones for habitability,\" Kevin Hand, the deputy chief scientist of solar system exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tells Popular Science. \"And that is of liquid water, access to the elements needed to build life, and potentially the energy needed to power life.\" NASA has been contemplating a trip to Europa for a couple of years, and Congress recently gave the project $100 million for 2015. While the White House proposal only allots $30 million, the fact that it's coming from the president is important. NASA is an executive branch agency, in need of White House support, and the administration's new budget \"supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission.\" That means NASA engineers can finally put their planning into action. \"They want us to move into the next phase of the mission,\" says Robert Pappalardo, the Europa Clipper pre-project scientist at JPL. \"So we're moving to Phase A, where you become a real mission, not just a concept.\" What's So Special About Europa? Europa is a bit of an anomaly within our solar system. The moon's outer layer consists of an icy sheet, somewhere between 1 mile and 18 miles thick. Due to the ice's smooth surface and lack of impact craters, researchers believe that this layer is relatively young and active, meaning something-such as an icy, volcanic flow underneath-is constantly renewing the ice and erasing past imperfections. This has led many experts to support the theory that there's an ocean underneath the icy crust. The idea was further solidified in 1995 during NASA's Galileo mission, in which a probe entered orbit around Jupiter. As it passed by the moons, the Galileo spacecraft found that Jupiter's magnetic field was disrupted in the area around Europa. The disruption indicates that an electrically conductive fluid beneath the moon's surface is inducing a special kind of magnetic field around the satellite. And given Europa's icy outer shell, that substance is most likely water. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. Europa isn't the only extraterrestrial body in our solar system thought to house a liquid ocean, but the moon holds a number of other key properties that particularly titillate experts-notably, its constant radiation bath. Jupiter bombards Europa with intense radiation, which breaks up compounds on the ice's surface into essential elements. \"That radiation is deadly to us, but that same radiation bombarding the water, it liberates the hydrogen and leaves oxygen behind, making oxidants,\" says Pappalardo. \"And those are great for life.\" The free hydrogen and oxygen combine with other surface materials to make important building blocks for life, including hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and more. Along with creating these compounds, Europa may also provide the energy needed to sustain life, as well. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. This direct interaction between the water and heated rock could be just what the planet needs to trigger the energy needed for life.\"On Earth's ocean floors, the interior is hot, and the water comes in contact with the heated rock below, and that water gets charged,\" says Pappalardo. \"There's chemical energy there, and those areas are teaming with life.\" If the compounds from Europa's surface are warmed by the energetic ocean floor below, the combination could spark the growth of aliens right here within our solar system. Of course, all of these features of Europa are purely hypothetical. NASA has no direct evidence of an ocean, but engineers at the space agency are really eager to verify that it exists. Now, with the most recent announcement from the White House, they will finally get that chance. NASA has been mulling over different ways to get to Europa for years, but finding the right method has been difficult. Because of the high radiation environment surrounding the moon, sending a spacecraft into orbit would require a lot of extra hardware and heat shielding to protect the vehicle from all the charged particles. And that adds up cost-wise. One scrapped idea to visit Europa along with two other Jupiter moons was estimated to cost $27 billion. \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive,\" says Pappalardo. \"Now we think it's just right.\" The idea moving forward is the Europa Clipper mission. Rather than send a probe into constant orbit around Europa, NASA wants to send a spacecraft to \"clip\" Europa, performing 45 flybys of the moon over a long period of time. \"Most of the time we'd be far from Europa and Jupiter, then we'd swoop in every couple of weeks, gather lots of data and then get out,\" says Pappalardo. \"We call it a toe dip; you get your feet in the water and then run back out on the sand.\" \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive. Now we think it's just right. During these flybys, the radiation-tolerant spacecraft will travel to varying altitudes above Europa and use different instruments to study the moon's composition. Although the exact instruments for the payload haven't been determined yet, Pappalardo says the main thing the probe will be studying is the gravitational pull on the spacecraft by Europa. This tugging and pulling can help confirm the presence of an ocean. \"If there is an ocean, Europa's ice shell will flex by 100 feet every time it orbits Jupiter\" say Pappalardo, \"...So when we encounter Europa, and it's all stretched out, then it indicates water underneath. If there's no liquid water, that icy shell is kind of glued to the rock below, so it'll only flex by about 1 foot.\" Since the scientific community is pretty well convinced that an ocean awaits, Pappalardo's team wants to go one step further and analyze what those waters are like. By equipping the spacecraft with a magnetometer, the researchers can measure the changing magnetic field around Europa, which indicates the thickness and the saltiness of the subsurface sea. Radar on the spacecraft will also determine the thickness of the outer ice shell. Additional instruments under consideration for use include a topographic camera, a neutral mass spectrometer to sniff out Europa's atmosphere, and an infrared spectrometer to study the composition of Europa's surface. Right now, Pappalardo's team is working toward a launch date of 2022, hoping to send the spacecraft aboard NASA's Space Launch System, the mega-rocket currently in development at the Michoud Assembly Facility. On that rocket, travel time to the Jupiter system would take just three years. Overall, the main goal of this mission is to see if Europa is a place where life could be present. If Europa Clipper does indeed find life-sustaining conditions, the discovery could lead to a follow-up mission that look for more direct evidence of alien microbes. \"All life on earth uses the DNA, RNA, protein paradigm, and so part of why we want to go to Europa is to essentially test the biology hypothesis to see if life arises wherever conditions are right.\" says Hand. If we do find life on Europa someday, the finding will change everything. It answers that all-powerful question: Are we alone? Just a few microbes on Europa mean that life is probably pretty common throughout the universe. And if there are no traces of life on Europa, even when conditions are ideal, that too denotes a huge finding. \"If the ingredients are there and there's no life,\" says Pappalardo, \"then wow, life must be even more special and rare than we imagined.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/look-inside-nasas-future-europa-clipper-mission/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa mission to search for alien life", "date": "2015-02-22", "content": "NASA is planning a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to search for signs of alien life on the icy, ocean-harbouring world. NASA has asked scientists to consider ways that a Europa mission could search for evidence of alien life in the plumes of water vapour that apparently blast into space from Europa's south polar region. These plumes, which NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted in December 2012, provide a possible way to sample Europa's ocean of liquid water, which is buried beneath the moon's icy shell, researchers said. NASA is zeroing in on a flyby mission design, something along the lines of a long-studied concept called the Europa Clipper. As currently envisioned, Clipper would travel to Jupiter orbit, then make 45 flybys of Europa over 3.5 years, at altitudes ranging from 25 km to 2,700 km. The USD 2.1 billion mission would study Europa's subsurface ocean, giving researchers a better understanding of the water's depth, salinity and other characteristics. NASA also wants to add plume sampling to the Europa mission's task list, if possible. During a Europa plume workshop at the Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley earlier this week, NASA science chief John Grunsfeld urged attendees to \"think outside the box\" and come up with feasible ways to study the moon's plumes. Researchers would want to analyse bits of Europa material in well-equipped labs here on Earth, but bringing samples back is likely beyond the scope of the flyby mission currently under consideration. However, it may be possible to detect biomolecules onsite, using gear aboard a Clipper-like probe, researchers said. Spotting a set of amino acids that all display the same chirality, or handedness, in plume material would be strong evidence of Europan life, astrobiologist Chris McKay, of NASA Ames, said at the workshop. Collecting enough plume material to perform such analyses will likely prove extremely challenging, 'SPACE.com' reported.

We shouldn't let that go, and we have to let that evolve. \"There are a number of concepts that we've asked them to look at, and they've started to look at them,\" Green said. NASA is officially targeting launch of the Europa probe in the mid-2020s, but Goldstein said the Europa Clipper concept is far enough along to potentially be ready for flight by June 2022, when the positions of Earth and Jupiter make the journey possible. \"We're a mission that will launch some time in the early-to-mid-2020s,\" Goldstein said. \"Our best case scenario is launching in an opportunity that opens up in May to June of 2022, and we're holding that.\" Goldstein said engineers have studied launching Europa Clipper on NASA's Space Launch System - a behemoth rocket designed to launch astronauts into deep space - or the most powerful version of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket with five strap-on solid rocket boosters. The mission concept review board in September concluded the SLS launch option was \"far superior\" to other alternatives because it would allow the probe to fly directly to Jupiter in less than two years. Launching on a smaller rocket would require gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, adding three-and-a-half years to the voyage. But lifting off aboard the SLS would be more costly - the Europa Clipper study assumed $500 million - and NASA would have to insert the Europa launch into the heavy-lift rocket's manifest between launches with crews. The Europa Clipper team opted to go with a solar-powered design instead of using a plutonium power generator, a decision Goldstein said saves money and still leaves plenty of margin for growth if the spacecraft needs more electricity or gets bigger. Goldstein said the Europa team is following the progress of NASA's Juno mission, which is fitted with solar panels and on the way to Jupiter, with arrival in orbit set for July 2016. Juno will study Jupiter's magnetic field and internal structure, and the probe will set a record for the most distant mission to rely on solar energy. Solar cells at Jupiter's distance from the sun produce a fraction of the electricity as they do at Earth. Officials are still evaluating whether it will be better to use solar cells flown on Juno or switch to a more high-tech design to give out more power. \"We can either cash that in with less area for the (solar) arrays or more power for the system, to be determined at this point,\" Goldstein said. \"But we're not counting on that new technology. We wanted existence proof to show that we had what we needed to make the jump away from (nuclear power).\" Officials hope to decide between the old or new solar cell technology by the middle of 2015, then NASA could begin buying test and flight units as part of the mission's long-lead purchases, according to Goldstein. Other upcoming milestones include the build-up of a testbed to test the spacecraft's avionics, and tests of components for the mission's thermal control system. \"We don't have significant engineering risks on the baseline engineering subsystems,\" Goldstein said. But Europa Clipper's instrument package, expected to include spectrometers, cameras, an ice-penetrating radar and potential daughter probes, could have a tough time handling the harsh radiation environment at Jupiter. \"When the instruments are selected, they are subjected to a much more harsh environment than the rest of the engineering system,\" Goldstein said. \"Where I think our biggest challenges are going to be is in the sensors and the other elements that are not cocooned inside the vault that we've created in this architecture. I'm really worried about the challenges the instruments are going to have in development.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/10/europa-clipper-concept-team-aims-for-launch-in-2022/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Europa Mission Gets White House Approval", "date": "2015-02-03", "content": "The quest to explore Jupiter's ocean-harboring moon Europa has taken a big step forward. The White House's fiscal year 2016 budget request for NASA, which was released Monday, allocates $18.5 billion to the space agency, including $30 million to formulate a mission to Europa, perhaps the solar system's best bet to host alien life. NASA has been studying a potential Europa mission for a while now, but the new budget proposal signals a commitment from the White House that wasn't there before. \"For the first time, the budget supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission, allowing NASA to begin project formulation, Phase A,\" NASA officials wrote in a summary of the proposed budget. Indeed, the new budget request assumes multiple years of funding for a Europa mission, said NASA Chief Financial Officer David Radzanowski. \"The current funding profile would assume a launch in the mid-2020s,\" Radzanowski told reporters during a conference call Monday. It's unclear at the moment just how much NASA and the Europa project will actually get in the 2016 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, 2015. Congress must approve the final budget, which often looks quite different than the one proposed by the White House. For example, the Obama administration allocated $15 million for early work on a potential Europa mission in its FY 2015 budget request, but Congress later upped that to $100 million. NASA appears to be zeroing in on a mission that would feature multiple flybys of Europa - perhaps something along the lines of the Europa Clipper, a concept being developed by agency scientists and engineers. Once in orbit around Jupiter, the Clipper would make 45 flybys of the 1,900-mile-wide Europa over the course of 3.5 years, as the concept is currently envisioned. Europa is thought to possess an ocean of liquid water under its icy shell. During its many flybys, the Clipper would confirm and study that ocean, yielding insights about its depth, salinity and conductivity, among other characteristics. The Clipper would also measure and map Europa's ice shell, returning data that could be useful for a potential future mission to the moon's surface. \"Sounding the ice shell would be key,\" said David Senske of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Europa Clipper pre-project deputy project scientist. \"We have a preconceived notion of what a lander looks like,\" Senske told Space.com in December at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. \"What we find may not support our preconceived notion.\" If everything goes according to plan, the Europa Clipper could be ready to launch as early as 2022, Senske said. The mission would probably cost about $2 billion. The Europa mission will really start coming into focus just a few months from now: NASA aims to select science instruments for the mission this spring, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Monday.

Embedded in that budget is a small-yet significant-detail: About $30 million will be allocated to fund a robotic mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. For the scientific community, that's huge news, as Europa is probably the top candidate for finding potential life elsewhere in our solar system. Scientists theorize that underneath Europa's icy surface, there lies a vast salty ocean, holding more than twice the amount of water as all the oceans of Earth. And if that ocean does exist, its conditions may be just right for it to be home to an entire ecosystem. \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the keystones for habitability.\" \"From an astrobiology perspective, Europa really brings together the three keystones for habitability,\" Kevin Hand, the deputy chief scientist of solar system exploration at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tells Popular Science. \"And that is of liquid water, access to the elements needed to build life, and potentially the energy needed to power life.\" NASA has been contemplating a trip to Europa for a couple of years, and Congress recently gave the project $100 million for 2015. While the White House proposal only allots $30 million, the fact that it's coming from the president is important. NASA is an executive branch agency, in need of White House support, and the administration's new budget \"supports the formulation and development of a Europa Mission.\" That means NASA engineers can finally put their planning into action. \"They want us to move into the next phase of the mission,\" says Robert Pappalardo, the Europa Clipper pre-project scientist at JPL. \"So we're moving to Phase A, where you become a real mission, not just a concept.\" What's So Special About Europa? Europa is a bit of an anomaly within our solar system. The moon's outer layer consists of an icy sheet, somewhere between 1 mile and 18 miles thick. Due to the ice's smooth surface and lack of impact craters, researchers believe that this layer is relatively young and active, meaning something-such as an icy, volcanic flow underneath-is constantly renewing the ice and erasing past imperfections. This has led many experts to support the theory that there's an ocean underneath the icy crust. The idea was further solidified in 1995 during NASA's Galileo mission, in which a probe entered orbit around Jupiter. As it passed by the moons, the Galileo spacecraft found that Jupiter's magnetic field was disrupted in the area around Europa. The disruption indicates that an electrically conductive fluid beneath the moon's surface is inducing a special kind of magnetic field around the satellite. And given Europa's icy outer shell, that substance is most likely water. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. Europa isn't the only extraterrestrial body in our solar system thought to house a liquid ocean, but the moon holds a number of other key properties that particularly titillate experts-notably, its constant radiation bath. Jupiter bombards Europa with intense radiation, which breaks up compounds on the ice's surface into essential elements. \"That radiation is deadly to us, but that same radiation bombarding the water, it liberates the hydrogen and leaves oxygen behind, making oxidants,\" says Pappalardo. \"And those are great for life.\" The free hydrogen and oxygen combine with other surface materials to make important building blocks for life, including hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and more. Along with creating these compounds, Europa may also provide the energy needed to sustain life, as well. Researchers believe the bottom of the moon's ocean likely comes in contact with a hot rocky mantle surrounding Europa's core. This direct interaction between the water and heated rock could be just what the planet needs to trigger the energy needed for life.\"On Earth's ocean floors, the interior is hot, and the water comes in contact with the heated rock below, and that water gets charged,\" says Pappalardo. \"There's chemical energy there, and those areas are teaming with life.\" If the compounds from Europa's surface are warmed by the energetic ocean floor below, the combination could spark the growth of aliens right here within our solar system. Of course, all of these features of Europa are purely hypothetical. NASA has no direct evidence of an ocean, but engineers at the space agency are really eager to verify that it exists. Now, with the most recent announcement from the White House, they will finally get that chance. NASA has been mulling over different ways to get to Europa for years, but finding the right method has been difficult. Because of the high radiation environment surrounding the moon, sending a spacecraft into orbit would require a lot of extra hardware and heat shielding to protect the vehicle from all the charged particles. And that adds up cost-wise. One scrapped idea to visit Europa along with two other Jupiter moons was estimated to cost $27 billion. \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive,\" says Pappalardo. \"Now we think it's just right.\" The idea moving forward is the Europa Clipper mission. Rather than send a probe into constant orbit around Europa, NASA wants to send a spacecraft to \"clip\" Europa, performing 45 flybys of the moon over a long period of time. \"Most of the time we'd be far from Europa and Jupiter, then we'd swoop in every couple of weeks, gather lots of data and then get out,\" says Pappalardo. \"We call it a toe dip; you get your feet in the water and then run back out on the sand.\" \"Some ideas have been too small, some too big, some too expensive. Now we think it's just right. During these flybys, the radiation-tolerant spacecraft will travel to varying altitudes above Europa and use different instruments to study the moon's composition. Although the exact instruments for the payload haven't been determined yet, Pappalardo says the main thing the probe will be studying is the gravitational pull on the spacecraft by Europa. This tugging and pulling can help confirm the presence of an ocean. \"If there is an ocean, Europa's ice shell will flex by 100 feet every time it orbits Jupiter\" say Pappalardo, \"...So when we encounter Europa, and it's all stretched out, then it indicates water underneath. If there's no liquid water, that icy shell is kind of glued to the rock below, so it'll only flex by about 1 foot.\" Since the scientific community is pretty well convinced that an ocean awaits, Pappalardo's team wants to go one step further and analyze what those waters are like. By equipping the spacecraft with a magnetometer, the researchers can measure the changing magnetic field around Europa, which indicates the thickness and the saltiness of the subsurface sea. Radar on the spacecraft will also determine the thickness of the outer ice shell. Additional instruments under consideration for use include a topographic camera, a neutral mass spectrometer to sniff out Europa's atmosphere, and an infrared spectrometer to study the composition of Europa's surface. Right now, Pappalardo's team is working toward a launch date of 2022, hoping to send the spacecraft aboard NASA's Space Launch System, the mega-rocket currently in development at the Michoud Assembly Facility. On that rocket, travel time to the Jupiter system would take just three years. Overall, the main goal of this mission is to see if Europa is a place where life could be present. If Europa Clipper does indeed find life-sustaining conditions, the discovery could lead to a follow-up mission that look for more direct evidence of alien microbes. \"All life on earth uses the DNA, RNA, protein paradigm, and so part of why we want to go to Europa is to essentially test the biology hypothesis to see if life arises wherever conditions are right.\" says Hand. If we do find life on Europa someday, the finding will change everything. It answers that all-powerful question: Are we alone? Just a few microbes on Europa mean that life is probably pretty common throughout the universe. And if there are no traces of life on Europa, even when conditions are ideal, that too denotes a huge finding. \"If the ingredients are there and there's no life,\" says Pappalardo, \"then wow, life must be even more special and rare than we imagined.\" ", "url": "https://www.popsci.com/look-inside-nasas-future-europa-clipper-mission/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa mission to search for alien life", "date": "2015-02-22", "content": "NASA is planning a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to search for signs of alien life on the icy, ocean-harbouring world. NASA has asked scientists to consider ways that a Europa mission could search for evidence of alien life in the plumes of water vapour that apparently blast into space from Europa's south polar region. These plumes, which NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted in December 2012, provide a possible way to sample Europa's ocean of liquid water, which is buried beneath the moon's icy shell, researchers said. NASA is zeroing in on a flyby mission design, something along the lines of a long-studied concept called the Europa Clipper. As currently envisioned, Clipper would travel to Jupiter orbit, then make 45 flybys of Europa over 3.5 years, at altitudes ranging from 25 km to 2,700 km. The USD 2.1 billion mission would study Europa's subsurface ocean, giving researchers a better understanding of the water's depth, salinity and other characteristics. NASA also wants to add plume sampling to the Europa mission's task list, if possible. During a Europa plume workshop at the Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley earlier this week, NASA science chief John Grunsfeld urged attendees to \"think outside the box\" and come up with feasible ways to study the moon's plumes. Researchers would want to analyse bits of Europa material in well-equipped labs here on Earth, but bringing samples back is likely beyond the scope of the flyby mission currently under consideration. However, it may be possible to detect biomolecules onsite, using gear aboard a Clipper-like probe, researchers said. Spotting a set of amino acids that all display the same chirality, or handedness, in plume material would be strong evidence of Europan life, astrobiologist Chris McKay, of NASA Ames, said at the workshop. Collecting enough plume material to perform such analyses will likely prove extremely challenging, 'SPACE.com' reported. It may require flying so low and so slowly that it makes more sense to send a lander down to the Europa surface through the plume, said astrobiologist Kevin Hand of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. However, first the spacecraft should be able to find the water vapour when it gets to Europa. At the moment, the plume remains unconfirmed; scientists have pointed Hubble at Europa repeatedly since the initial 2012 detection, but have come up empty in attempts to spot it again. So, if the plume exists, it is apparently sporadic or episodic, not continuous like the powerhouse geysers that erupt from the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, researchers said.

One concept led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is the favorite to win NASA's backing. The Europa Clipper mission came out of a multi-year study to slash the cost of a mission to study the enigmatic moon, eventually settling on a projected price tag near $2 billion - excluding launch costs - less than half the estimated cost of a Europa probe published in a decadal survey report by the National Research Council in 2011. Scientists and engineers found savings in switching the probe from a nuclear-powered design to a solar power source and crafting a mission to fly by Europa dozens of times instead of entering orbit around the icy moon. Officials say the Europa Clipper concept may need some tweaks, but it gives NASA a good starting point for development expected to start after it wins programmatic approval in a milestone expected as soon as mid-2015. The milestone, known as Key Decision Point A (KDP-A) in NASA's parlance, will mark the start of full-scale development of the Europa probe. Decisions on scientific instrumentation, mission design, a launch vehicle and launch date, and international partnerships will follow. \"Europa Clipper has had quite an important evolution,\" Green said in a Feb. 19 meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group. \"It is a proof of concept that says we can do it, and it's not a $4 billion mission as we studied and discussed at the decadal, so it has made major progress.\" Barry Goldstein, who leads the Europa Clipper studies as pre-project manager at JPL, said the mission passed a major hurdle in September, when reviewers deemed the concept mature enough for consideration in NASA's mission portfolio. Congress has backed the Europa mission with $255 million over the last three years, an order of magnitude more than the White House requested over the same period. \"Given the fact that we have this funding, we're proceeding on this path and not slowing down,\" Goldstein told the OPAG meeting Feb. 19. The Obama administration is asking Congress for $30 million - enough to formally turn on development of a Europa mission - in fiscal year 2016, which begins Oct. 1. \"Congress has been quite generous,\" Green said, adding the funding approved by lawmakers the last three years gives the Europa project a \"really rich start\" compared to the beginnings of most of NASA's other robotic science missions. \"It is highly unsuual that the mission concepts that enter (formulation and development) are as mature as we have in looking at Europa,\" Green said. NASA plans to take the first step at selecting instruments to fly on the Europa mission in April, when the space agency will award funding to the top-rated science teams to refine their proposals and reduce the risks of developing the sensors. Final instrument decisions are expected in 2016, giving NASA time to evaluate what set of sensors should be flown to Europa in hopes of probing the ocean thought to lie below the moon's global ice sheet. The mission could also sample watery plumes that may exist over Europa's south pole, where a flyby probe could dash through material lofted from below the surface. Scientists announced in 2013 that the Hubble Space Telescope detected evidence for the plumes, thrusting a mission to Europa back on the science community's agenda after being overshadowed by NASA's push toward Mars. Follow-up observations by Hubble are planned to try and confirm the plume detection. \"I can't overemphasize the importance of the Hubble observations (of the plumes) that allowed us to renew the conversation about Europa being an active world,\" Green said. While Green said the Europa Clipper study has \"popped to the top\" of the Europa mission concepts considered by NASA, the design could require some fine-tuning to accommodate all the objectives the agency wants to accomplish. \"Perhaps additional instruments need to be brought on to investigate the plume,\" Green said, adding that NASA is examining ideas to deploy CubeSats or drop a lander or impactor to Europe's surface. Green said NASA has asked the European Space Agency if it is interested in contributing to the Europa mission. ESA plans to launch its own probe to Jupiter in 2022 to conduct multiple flybys of the giant planet's moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa before eventually looping into orbit around Ganymede. While ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission will fly by Europa twice, NASA's Europa Clipper concept could zip past it 45 times. ESA participated in NASA's last flagship-class mission to the outer solar system. The European-built Huygens lander accompanied the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn, then parachuted to a landing on the moon Titan in 2005. NASA and ESA planned to partner on a joint mission to the Jupiter comprising two spacecraft, one to orbit Europa and another to circle Ganymede. But budget limitations kept the U.S. space agency from going forward with its part of the mission, which had a projected cost of nearly $5 billion. ESA moved forward with the European-led JUICE mission, and NASA went back to the drawing board before eventually coming up with the Europa Clipper proposal. \"ESA's really been our best partner,\" Green said. \"They've been fabulous working with us. We've had ups and downs in the past, but all seems to be forgiven and we're right back together. I want to give them an opportunity to be part of this mission.

The Europa probe - which is scheduled to launch in the early to mid-2020s - will carry supersharp cameras, a heat detector, ice-penetrating radar and a variety of other gear that will shed light on the satellite's surface composition and the nature of its salty subsurface sea, among other things, NASA officials said. The newly announced scientific payload \"will help us take great strides forward in understanding the habitability of Europa,\" Curt Niebur, Europa program scientist at NASA's Washington headquarters, said during a news conference today. Haven for life? Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host extraterrestrial life. Europa possesses a salty ocean beneath its ice shell, and this sea is apparently in contact with the moon's rocky mantle, making possible a number of complex chemical reactions, scientists say. In addition, scientists think that Europa's seafloor also features hydrothermal vents, providing a potential energy source for life-forms, if any exist in the dark depths. Most of what scientists know about Europa is based on data gathered by NASA's Galileo mission, which orbited Jupiter in the 1990s and early 2000s and made about a dozen flybys of Europa during that time. The new mission, which will cost roughly $2 billion, aims to build upon and increase that knowledge significantly, specifically investigating the icy world's life-hosting potential. The current plan calls for sending a solar- powered spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter; from there, the probe would make about 45 flybys of Europa over the course of two and a half years or so. \"We find that multiple flybys can allow us to get a complete picture of Europa,\" said Jim Green, head of NASA's Planetary Science division. In July 2014, NASA asked researchers around the world to propose scientific instruments for the Europa mission. The space agency received 33 submissions and has now selected nine to go on the spacecraft, Niebur said today. The Europa flyby probe's imaging system will consist of one wide-angle camera and one narrow-angle one, Niebur said. These two cameras will map almost 90 percent of Europa's surface down to a resolution of 164 feet, and will image parts of the moon 100 times more sharply than that. Galileo, by contrast, imaged just 10 percent of Europa's surface down to a resolution of 650 feet, Niebur said. \"If we've seen such amazing things on only 10 percent of the surface, it's hard to even imagine the amazing things we'll see when we look at the rest of Europa at even better resolution,\" Niebur said. Two other instruments - a magnetometer and a magnetic sounder - will work together to determine the thickness of Europa's ice shell and the depth and salinity of its ocean. The ice-penetrating radar equipment will provide even more detail about the moon's icy crust. The probe will also carry a heat detector to pinpoint active sites on Europa - for example, places where plumes of water vapor may be erupting into space. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted signs of such geysers erupting in 2012, but further searches have not yet confirmed their existence. The Europa spacecraft will carry a plume-hunting spectrograph, to both find and chacterize these elusive features. Furthermore, an infrared spectrometer will allow the probe to map out the composition of Europa's surface. Scientists are especially keen to know exactly what makes up the reddish-brown \"gunk\" that coats large fractures on the moon, since the stuff likely erupts onto the surface from the ocean below. \"If we can determine what that brown gunk is, we can then understand what is in the water - what is in the oceans of Europa - and that is an incredibly important question to answer if we're trying to figure out if this place is habitable,\" Niebur said. The final two instruments - a mass spectrometer and a dust analyzer - will characterize gases and small solid particles that get blasted off Europa's surface into space, allowing mission scientists to study the moon's surface composition without touching down. The Europa flyby mission is dedicated to probing the moon's habitability, not actively seeking out signs of life. \"Building a life detecor is incredibly difficult,\" Niebur said. \"We're not even sure how to go about building it yet. But it's something that has received renewed interest and vigor lately because of the Europa mission, so that's something that we're going to be poking into a lot more aggressively in the near future.\" Many astrobiologists would love to get a probe down on Europa's surface - and, ideally, into the underground ocean. The data gathered by the flyby spacecraft could help pave the way for such an ambitious effort, NASA officials said. \"It'd be great to think that the results from this particular mission would lead, in the next decade, to some new and exciting concepts about potentially getting underneath the ice shell,\" Green said. More information is needed to determine if Europa \"can be penetrated in a way to be able to get under the ice shell,\" he added. \"But that's, indeed, in the distant future.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29487-nasa-europa-mission-science.html"}, {"title": "NASA Selects 9 Instruments for Europa Mission", "date": "2015-05-26", "content": "NASA announced the selection of nine instruments it plans to fly on a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa May 26, but agency officials were vague about whether the instruments, or the overall mission, could meet an aggressive schedule sought by some in Congress. NASA said the nine instrument concepts, selected from 33 proposals submitted by scientists last year, will be flown together on a spacecraft with the goal of determining whether Europa can support life, although not necessarily if the icy moon hosts life today. \"All of these instruments are designed to increase our rather limited knowledge of Europa,\" said Curt Niebur, Europa program scientist at NASA Headquarters, during a briefing about the instrument selection. \"They're doing that by helping us probe the big question, which is, 'Is Europa habitable?'\" The nine instruments include cameras to provide high resolution images of the moon's surface, magnetometers to measure the depth and salinity of the moon's subsurface ocean, a radar to probe Europa's icy crust, and spectrometers to determine the composition of the surface as well as material ejected by plumes. In addition to the nine instruments chosen for the mission, NASA selected a tenth instrument, a mass spectrometer, for additional technology development. This instrument will not be flown on the mission but will instead be developed for potential use on other spacecraft. Niebur said NASA anticipates spending about $10 million on the instruments in the next year, and $110 million over the next three years. \"That will get us to a key decision point where we decide if we're going to continue on with the instruments,\" he said, as well as calculate a full cost estimate for the instrument suite.

That mission will likely be based on a concept that has been under study at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory known as Europa Clipper. In that mission, the spacecraft would go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of flybys of Europa, a less expensive approach than going directly into orbit around the moon. Green said the Europa mission should enter its formulation phase by Oct. 1, the start of the U.S. government's 2016 fiscal year. Although work on the mission is just beginning, NASA said they selected the instruments now because they typically have long development schedules. \"We wanted to get a head start on the instruments as they're often the long poles in the development of something as complex as a mission to Europa,\" John Grunsfeld, NASA associate administrator for science, said at the briefing. NASA's announcement comes as the agency is facing new pressure from Congress to accelerate the mission's schedule. While NASA sought $30 million for the mission in its fiscal year 2016 budget request in February, a spending bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee May 20 provides $140 million for the mission, and also requires the mission to launch no later than 2022, using the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket. NASA officials hedged when asked if the instruments, or the mission itself, could meet that schedule. \"They could be ready in the early 2020s,\" Niebur said of the selected instruments, \"but that's also dependent upon how much money is in the budget for us to give them for that work.\" \"We expect it to be launched in the 2020s,\" Green said of the mission. \"Whether it's mid, or a little early or a little later, needs to be worked out based on a much firmer cost estimate and a profile that would support it.\" Niebur emphasized that the goal of the mission, whenever it is launched, is to determine whether Europa could support life, not to detect life itself. \"We don't have a 'life detector,'\" he said. \"We currently don't even have consensus among the scientific community as to what we would measure that tell everybody with confidence that this thing you're looking at is alive.\" Green, though, said he knew what he would do if the mission somehow detected life on Europa. \"I would immediately retire,\" he said.

One concept led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is the favorite to win NASA's backing. The Europa Clipper mission came out of a multi-year study to slash the cost of a mission to study the enigmatic moon, eventually settling on a projected price tag near $2 billion - excluding launch costs - less than half the estimated cost of a Europa probe published in a decadal survey report by the National Research Council in 2011. Scientists and engineers found savings in switching the probe from a nuclear-powered design to a solar power source and crafting a mission to fly by Europa dozens of times instead of entering orbit around the icy moon. Officials say the Europa Clipper concept may need some tweaks, but it gives NASA a good starting point for development expected to start after it wins programmatic approval in a milestone expected as soon as mid-2015. The milestone, known as Key Decision Point A (KDP-A) in NASA's parlance, will mark the start of full-scale development of the Europa probe. Decisions on scientific instrumentation, mission design, a launch vehicle and launch date, and international partnerships will follow. \"Europa Clipper has had quite an important evolution,\" Green said in a Feb. 19 meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group. \"It is a proof of concept that says we can do it, and it's not a $4 billion mission as we studied and discussed at the decadal, so it has made major progress.\" Barry Goldstein, who leads the Europa Clipper studies as pre-project manager at JPL, said the mission passed a major hurdle in September, when reviewers deemed the concept mature enough for consideration in NASA's mission portfolio. Congress has backed the Europa mission with $255 million over the last three years, an order of magnitude more than the White House requested over the same period. \"Given the fact that we have this funding, we're proceeding on this path and not slowing down,\" Goldstein told the OPAG meeting Feb. 19. The Obama administration is asking Congress for $30 million - enough to formally turn on development of a Europa mission - in fiscal year 2016, which begins Oct. 1. \"Congress has been quite generous,\" Green said, adding the funding approved by lawmakers the last three years gives the Europa project a \"really rich start\" compared to the beginnings of most of NASA's other robotic science missions. \"It is highly unsuual that the mission concepts that enter (formulation and development) are as mature as we have in looking at Europa,\" Green said. NASA plans to take the first step at selecting instruments to fly on the Europa mission in April, when the space agency will award funding to the top-rated science teams to refine their proposals and reduce the risks of developing the sensors. Final instrument decisions are expected in 2016, giving NASA time to evaluate what set of sensors should be flown to Europa in hopes of probing the ocean thought to lie below the moon's global ice sheet. The mission could also sample watery plumes that may exist over Europa's south pole, where a flyby probe could dash through material lofted from below the surface. Scientists announced in 2013 that the Hubble Space Telescope detected evidence for the plumes, thrusting a mission to Europa back on the science community's agenda after being overshadowed by NASA's push toward Mars. Follow-up observations by Hubble are planned to try and confirm the plume detection. \"I can't overemphasize the importance of the Hubble observations (of the plumes) that allowed us to renew the conversation about Europa being an active world,\" Green said. While Green said the Europa Clipper study has \"popped to the top\" of the Europa mission concepts considered by NASA, the design could require some fine-tuning to accommodate all the objectives the agency wants to accomplish. \"Perhaps additional instruments need to be brought on to investigate the plume,\" Green said, adding that NASA is examining ideas to deploy CubeSats or drop a lander or impactor to Europe's surface. Green said NASA has asked the European Space Agency if it is interested in contributing to the Europa mission. ESA plans to launch its own probe to Jupiter in 2022 to conduct multiple flybys of the giant planet's moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa before eventually looping into orbit around Ganymede. While ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission will fly by Europa twice, NASA's Europa Clipper concept could zip past it 45 times. ESA participated in NASA's last flagship-class mission to the outer solar system. The European-built Huygens lander accompanied the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn, then parachuted to a landing on the moon Titan in 2005. NASA and ESA planned to partner on a joint mission to the Jupiter comprising two spacecraft, one to orbit Europa and another to circle Ganymede. But budget limitations kept the U.S. space agency from going forward with its part of the mission, which had a projected cost of nearly $5 billion. ESA moved forward with the European-led JUICE mission, and NASA went back to the drawing board before eventually coming up with the Europa Clipper proposal. \"ESA's really been our best partner,\" Green said. \"They've been fabulous working with us. We've had ups and downs in the past, but all seems to be forgiven and we're right back together. I want to give them an opportunity to be part of this mission. We shouldn't let that go, and we have to let that evolve. \"There are a number of concepts that we've asked them to look at, and they've started to look at them,\" Green said. NASA is officially targeting launch of the Europa probe in the mid-2020s, but Goldstein said the Europa Clipper concept is far enough along to potentially be ready for flight by June 2022, when the positions of Earth and Jupiter make the journey possible. \"We're a mission that will launch some time in the early-to-mid-2020s,\" Goldstein said. \"Our best case scenario is launching in an opportunity that opens up in May to June of 2022, and we're holding that.\" Goldstein said engineers have studied launching Europa Clipper on NASA's Space Launch System - a behemoth rocket designed to launch astronauts into deep space - or the most powerful version of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket with five strap-on solid rocket boosters. The mission concept review board in September concluded the SLS launch option was \"far superior\" to other alternatives because it would allow the probe to fly directly to Jupiter in less than two years. Launching on a smaller rocket would require gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, adding three-and-a-half years to the voyage. But lifting off aboard the SLS would be more costly - the Europa Clipper study assumed $500 million - and NASA would have to insert the Europa launch into the heavy-lift rocket's manifest between launches with crews. The Europa Clipper team opted to go with a solar-powered design instead of using a plutonium power generator, a decision Goldstein said saves money and still leaves plenty of margin for growth if the spacecraft needs more electricity or gets bigger. Goldstein said the Europa team is following the progress of NASA's Juno mission, which is fitted with solar panels and on the way to Jupiter, with arrival in orbit set for July 2016. Juno will study Jupiter's magnetic field and internal structure, and the probe will set a record for the most distant mission to rely on solar energy. Solar cells at Jupiter's distance from the sun produce a fraction of the electricity as they do at Earth. Officials are still evaluating whether it will be better to use solar cells flown on Juno or switch to a more high-tech design to give out more power. \"We can either cash that in with less area for the (solar) arrays or more power for the system, to be determined at this point,\" Goldstein said. \"But we're not counting on that new technology. We wanted existence proof to show that we had what we needed to make the jump away from (nuclear power).\" Officials hope to decide between the old or new solar cell technology by the middle of 2015, then NASA could begin buying test and flight units as part of the mission's long-lead purchases, according to Goldstein. Other upcoming milestones include the build-up of a testbed to test the spacecraft's avionics, and tests of components for the mission's thermal control system. \"We don't have significant engineering risks on the baseline engineering subsystems,\" Goldstein said. But Europa Clipper's instrument package, expected to include spectrometers, cameras, an ice-penetrating radar and potential daughter probes, could have a tough time handling the harsh radiation environment at Jupiter. \"When the instruments are selected, they are subjected to a much more harsh environment than the rest of the engineering system,\" Goldstein said. \"Where I think our biggest challenges are going to be is in the sensors and the other elements that are not cocooned inside the vault that we've created in this architecture. I'm really worried about the challenges the instruments are going to have in development.\" ", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/10/europa-clipper-concept-team-aims-for-launch-in-2022/"}, {"title": "NASA Mission to Europa Will Seek Conditions for Life", "date": "2015-05-26", "content": "NASA's Europa spacecraft will use nine scientific instruments to assess the icy, ocean-harboring Jupiter moon's ability to support life, space agency officials announced today. The Europa probe - which is scheduled to launch in the early to mid-2020s - will carry supersharp cameras, a heat detector, ice-penetrating radar and a variety of other gear that will shed light on the satellite's surface composition and the nature of its salty subsurface sea, among other things, NASA officials said. The newly announced scientific payload \"will help us take great strides forward in understanding the habitability of Europa,\" Curt Niebur, Europa program scientist at NASA's Washington headquarters, said during a news conference today. Haven for life? Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host extraterrestrial life. Europa possesses a salty ocean beneath its ice shell, and this sea is apparently in contact with the moon's rocky mantle, making possible a number of complex chemical reactions, scientists say. In addition, scientists think that Europa's seafloor also features hydrothermal vents, providing a potential energy source for life-forms, if any exist in the dark depths. Most of what scientists know about Europa is based on data gathered by NASA's Galileo mission, which orbited Jupiter in the 1990s and early 2000s and made about a dozen flybys of Europa during that time. The new mission, which will cost roughly $2 billion, aims to build upon and increase that knowledge significantly, specifically investigating the icy world's life-hosting potential. The current plan calls for sending a solar- powered spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter; from there, the probe would make about 45 flybys of Europa over the course of two and a half years or so. \"We find that multiple flybys can allow us to get a complete picture of Europa,\" said Jim Green, head of NASA's Planetary Science division. In July 2014, NASA asked researchers around the world to propose scientific instruments for the Europa mission. The space agency received 33 submissions and has now selected nine to go on the spacecraft, Niebur said today. The Europa flyby probe's imaging system will consist of one wide-angle camera and one narrow-angle one, Niebur said. These two cameras will map almost 90 percent of Europa's surface down to a resolution of 164 feet, and will image parts of the moon 100 times more sharply than that. Galileo, by contrast, imaged just 10 percent of Europa's surface down to a resolution of 650 feet, Niebur said. \"If we've seen such amazing things on only 10 percent of the surface, it's hard to even imagine the amazing things we'll see when we look at the rest of Europa at even better resolution,\" Niebur said. Two other instruments - a magnetometer and a magnetic sounder - will work together to determine the thickness of Europa's ice shell and the depth and salinity of its ocean. The ice-penetrating radar equipment will provide even more detail about the moon's icy crust. The probe will also carry a heat detector to pinpoint active sites on Europa - for example, places where plumes of water vapor may be erupting into space. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted signs of such geysers erupting in 2012, but further searches have not yet confirmed their existence. The Europa spacecraft will carry a plume-hunting spectrograph, to both find and chacterize these elusive features. Furthermore, an infrared spectrometer will allow the probe to map out the composition of Europa's surface. Scientists are especially keen to know exactly what makes up the reddish-brown \"gunk\" that coats large fractures on the moon, since the stuff likely erupts onto the surface from the ocean below. \"If we can determine what that brown gunk is, we can then understand what is in the water - what is in the oceans of Europa - and that is an incredibly important question to answer if we're trying to figure out if this place is habitable,\" Niebur said. The final two instruments - a mass spectrometer and a dust analyzer - will characterize gases and small solid particles that get blasted off Europa's surface into space, allowing mission scientists to study the moon's surface composition without touching down. The Europa flyby mission is dedicated to probing the moon's habitability, not actively seeking out signs of life. \"Building a life detecor is incredibly difficult,\" Niebur said. \"We're not even sure how to go about building it yet. But it's something that has received renewed interest and vigor lately because of the Europa mission, so that's something that we're going to be poking into a lot more aggressively in the near future.\" Many astrobiologists would love to get a probe down on Europa's surface - and, ideally, into the underground ocean. The data gathered by the flyby spacecraft could help pave the way for such an ambitious effort, NASA officials said. \"It'd be great to think that the results from this particular mission would lead, in the next decade, to some new and exciting concepts about potentially getting underneath the ice shell,\" Green said. More information is needed to determine if Europa \"can be penetrated in a way to be able to get under the ice shell,\" he added. \"But that's, indeed, in the distant future.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/29487-nasa-europa-mission-science.html"}, {"title": "NASA Selects 9 Instruments for Europa Mission", "date": "2015-05-26", "content": "NASA announced the selection of nine instruments it plans to fly on a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa May 26, but agency officials were vague about whether the instruments, or the overall mission, could meet an aggressive schedule sought by some in Congress.

NASA has already selected the nine primary science instruments for the Europa spacecraft, whose core mission involves performing dozens of flybys to gauge the Jovian satellite's life-hosting potential. But the probe should be able to accommodate an additional 550 lbs. (250 kilograms) of payload, and NASA would rather not let that \"excess\" go to waste. \"There's a variety of things that we can do,\" Jim Green, the head of NASA's Planetary Science division, said here Tuesday during a town hall presentation at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. \"Perhaps plume probes, perhaps penetrators, or even a small lander.\" Researchers are studying these various possibilities, and will present their findings to NASA Headquarters \"in the January time frame,\" Green added. There's no guarantee that any additional instruments or miniprobes will make it onboard the Europa spacecraft. But the smart money may be on one or two ultimately being selected. \"We're pretty hot on doing something,\" Green told Space.com after his presentation. The 1,900-mile-wide Europa is regarded as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Though Europa is covered by an ice shell perhaps 50 miles thick, the satellite also harbors a huge subsurface ocean that contains more water than all of Earth's seas combined. This ocean is in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible a range of interesting and complex chemical reactions, researchers say. The $2 billion Europa mission, which does not have an official name yet, aims to investigate the habitability of the moon and its ocean. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in the early to mid-2020s and reach the Jupiter system 8 years later, if a \"standard\" rocket such as United Launch Alliance's Atlas V serves as the launch vehicle. The probe would then perform 45 flybys of Europa over the next 2.5 years or so, studying the satellite with high-resolution cameras, a heat detector, ice-penetrating radar and other scientific gear. None of the nine already-announced instruments were designed to hunt for signs of life. But it's possible that a small deployable plume probe - which would fly through putative plumes of water vapor near Europa's south pole, which were detected in December 2012 but have yet to be confirmed by follow-up observations - could carry life-detecting gear.

In discussions Feb. 1 at a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group in San Antonio, Texas, agency officials said they are considering how to add a lander to a mission under development to make multiple flybys of Europa, even though the lander will weigh significantly more than the main \"clipper\" spacecraft. Curt Niebur, outer planets program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said at the meeting that the biggest challenge of adding the lander to the Europa mission is its mass: about 8,000 kilograms, to accommodate the propellant needed to land the spacecraft softly on the surface. He added that estimate was \"very rough\" based on the limited studies of lander concepts to date. By comparison, the clipper spacecraft alone would have a mass of only about 5,000 kilograms. That additional mass would drive the selection of the launch vehicle, requiring the use of the Space Launch System. \"If we co-manifest the lander and clipper, we're only on SLS,\" he said. \"It's still a slow boat, so to speak: you'd still do inner solar system gravity assists.\" NASA planning for a Europa clipper alone has examined using an Atlas 5 launch and flybys to reach Europa, or an SLS launch on a direct trajectory. The SLS would be more expensive than an Atlas 5, but the direct trajectory would allow the mission to reach Europa several years sooner. Niebur said an alternative under study would be to launch the clipper spacecraft and the lander separately. \"It's an option that we've been kicking around, and we need to make a decision on that preferably soon,\" he said. Splitting the mission into two launches could allow the clipper spacecraft to remain on a fast track. Niebur said that, given current funding trends where Congress has allocated significantly more for the mission than NASA has requested, a clipper spacecraft alone could be technically ready for launch as soon as 2022. \"If you put a very capable lander on there, I think that's going to slow things down a bit,\" he added. \"Do you put them all on the same spacecraft and launch them on the same rocket, or do you split them onto separate rockets? That's also an option we could consider.\" Splitting the clipper and lander spacecraft, though, could run afoul of the congressional language that is forcing NASA to consider flying the lander in the first place. The fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill passed in December provided NASA with $175 million for work on a Europa mission, with direction that such a mission consist of \"an orbiter with a lander\" and \"plan for a launch no later than 2022\" on an SLS. Robert Pappalardo, the Europa project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there is a \"strawman\" schedule for accommodating a Europa lander on the planned clipper mission, although he did not disclose it at the meeting. \"That said, the plan is for the clipper portion, the multiple flyby portion, to go full steam ahead,\" he said. That includes holding the mission's next major review, a system requirements review, this summer regardless of any decision to add a lander. Niebur said that, separate from the discussion about a lander, NASA was examining several smaller \"augmentations\" to the clipper spacecraft. One example he mentioned is a cubesat-sized spacecraft that would fly through plumes of water ice ejected by Europa. Other additions to the clipper spacecraft could address studies of Europa's gravitational field. The current spacecraft design has about 250 kilograms of spare mass to support those or other additions to the clipper spacecraft separate from the lander. Those augmentations, he said, would not affect the primary science mission of the main spacecraft and its suite of 10 instruments NASA announced last year. \"Whatever we do in terms of these enhancements, I want to stress that we are fully committed to the multiple flyby mission,\" he said. \"For any other decisions on enhancements, our drivers are going to be to protect the science of the multiple flyby mission.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-weighing-dual-launches-of-europa-orbiter-and-lander/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa Mission May Not Launch Until Late 2020s", "date": "2016-02-10", "content": "NASA's highly anticipated mission to the potentially life-supporting Jupiter moon Europa may not get off the ground until the late 2020s, agency officials say. Last year, Congress granted NASA $175 million to continue developing its Europa mission, which will perform dozens of flybys to gauge the life- hosting potential of the icy moon's huge subsurface ocean. In that allocation, Congress declared that NASA must have the Europa mission ready to launch by 2022. But NASA's fiscal year 2017 budget request, which was released Tuesday, includes just $49.6 million for the Europa effort - a level that, when combined with predicted funding in the coming years, \"supports a Europa mission launch in the late 2020s,\" NASA chief financial officer David Radzanowski said during a news conference Tuesday. Getting the Europa flyby spacecraft ready to launch by 2022 would probably require a 2017 investment of about $194 million, Radzanowski said. The space agency has provided this estimate to Congress, he added. \"Within our $19 billion request, to find an additional $150 million - whether within the science portfolio or abroad - we felt would upset the balance of the overall portfolio,\" Radzanowski said. \"So we do not think it's prudent to support a 2022 launch at the funding level requested.\" Scientists regard Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host life beyond Earth. The moon's vast ocean - which harbors more water than all of Earth's seas combined - is in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions, researchers say. So astrobiologists are eager to explore Europa - and they're not the only ones. Congress shares this enthusiasm, in large part because of John Culberson, who chairs the House of Representatives' Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and has a longstanding interest in the search for alien life. Indeed, in the 2016 budget deal, Congress directed NASA to make its Europa mission more ambitious, ordering the agency to add a component that would actually touch down on the icy moon. The deal also stipulated that NASA use the agency's in-development Space Launch System megarocket, as opposed to a currently available booster. NASA is still assessing how it can incorporate these directives, and how doing so would change the Europa mission's pricetag, Radzanowski said. It's too soon to know exactly what's going to happen with the Europa mission, which is still in the early-development phase. For example, Congress may end up giving NASA far more for the project than the $49.6 million it requested this year, bringing a 2022 liftoff back into the realm of possibility. In fact, that will probably happen, if precedent is any indication. NASA didn't ask for any Europa-mission funding in 2013 or 2014 but ended up getting more than $120 million for those two years combined. And in 2015 and 2016, NASA requested a total of $45 million for the Europa project, and Congress allocated $275 million.

The space agency has provided this estimate to Congress, he added. \"Within our $19 billion request, to find an additional $150 million - whether within the science portfolio or abroad - we felt would upset the balance of the overall portfolio,\" Radzanowski said. \"So we do not think it's prudent to support a 2022 launch at the funding level requested.\" Scientists regard Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host life beyond Earth. The moon's vast ocean - which harbors more water than all of Earth's seas combined - is in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions, researchers say. So astrobiologists are eager to explore Europa - and they're not the only ones. Congress shares this enthusiasm, in large part because of John Culberson, who chairs the House of Representatives' Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and has a longstanding interest in the search for alien life. Indeed, in the 2016 budget deal, Congress directed NASA to make its Europa mission more ambitious, ordering the agency to add a component that would actually touch down on the icy moon. The deal also stipulated that NASA use the agency's in-development Space Launch System megarocket, as opposed to a currently available booster. NASA is still assessing how it can incorporate these directives, and how doing so would change the Europa mission's pricetag, Radzanowski said. It's too soon to know exactly what's going to happen with the Europa mission, which is still in the early-development phase. For example, Congress may end up giving NASA far more for the project than the $49.6 million it requested this year, bringing a 2022 liftoff back into the realm of possibility. In fact, that will probably happen, if precedent is any indication. NASA didn't ask for any Europa-mission funding in 2013 or 2014 but ended up getting more than $120 million for those two years combined. And in 2015 and 2016, NASA requested a total of $45 million for the Europa project, and Congress allocated $275 million.

The goal of the SDT, the letter stated, is \"defining the science objectives and feasibility of specific lander mission concept focused on assessing the habitability of and searching for life on Europa.\" NASA expects to form the SDT later in March, to be followed by a series of teleconferences and face-to-face meetings.

However, the SDT could complete their work much earlier. \"They should be able to get that work done, I would say, by early summer,\" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at a March 3 hearing of a House appropriations subcommittee on NASA's \"Ocean Worlds\" program. The completion of the SDT report would allow NASA to move ahead on an announcement of opportunity for instruments for the lander to achieve those scientific objectives. \"In my mind, earlier is better\" for issuing such a call for instrument proposals, Elachi said, noting that, for past missions, it's taken six to seven years from the time a instrument payload is selected until a mission is ready for launch. JPL has been carrying out internal studies of a lander, which could accompany a \"Europa Clipper\" mission that would orbit Jupiter and make multiple close flybys of the moon. The lab hasn't released details about those lander concepts, but at the hearing Elachi suggested it would make use of technology developed at JPL for Mars landers. \"That lander will capitalize very heavily on what we have done on Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity,\" he said.

Elachi said that even if they are flown together, the orbiter would study Europa first and identify potential landing sites before the lander attempts to set down at one of them.

In the 2017 budget request, NASA included nearly $50 million for a Europa mission. Culberson asked Elachi what level of funding NASA's planetary sciences program should receive to keep a Europa mission and other programs on track. \"That's a better question to ask NASA,\" Elachi responded. \"Clearly, it depends on when you want these missions to happen.\" He suggested, though, that the Europa mission will need even more funding than what Congress has granted so far to support a launch in the early 2020s. \"If you want to launch in the early '20s, the present level is not sufficient to do that,\" he said.

NASA has already selected the nine primary science instruments for the Europa spacecraft, whose core mission involves performing dozens of flybys to gauge the Jovian satellite's life-hosting potential. But the probe should be able to accommodate an additional 550 lbs. (250 kilograms) of payload, and NASA would rather not let that \"excess\" go to waste. \"There's a variety of things that we can do,\" Jim Green, the head of NASA's Planetary Science division, said here Tuesday during a town hall presentation at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. \"Perhaps plume probes, perhaps penetrators, or even a small lander.\" Researchers are studying these various possibilities, and will present their findings to NASA Headquarters \"in the January time frame,\" Green added. There's no guarantee that any additional instruments or miniprobes will make it onboard the Europa spacecraft. But the smart money may be on one or two ultimately being selected. \"We're pretty hot on doing something,\" Green told Space.com after his presentation. The 1,900-mile-wide Europa is regarded as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Though Europa is covered by an ice shell perhaps 50 miles thick, the satellite also harbors a huge subsurface ocean that contains more water than all of Earth's seas combined. This ocean is in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible a range of interesting and complex chemical reactions, researchers say. The $2 billion Europa mission, which does not have an official name yet, aims to investigate the habitability of the moon and its ocean. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in the early to mid-2020s and reach the Jupiter system 8 years later, if a \"standard\" rocket such as United Launch Alliance's Atlas V serves as the launch vehicle. The probe would then perform 45 flybys of Europa over the next 2.5 years or so, studying the satellite with high-resolution cameras, a heat detector, ice-penetrating radar and other scientific gear. None of the nine already-announced instruments were designed to hunt for signs of life. But it's possible that a small deployable plume probe - which would fly through putative plumes of water vapor near Europa's south pole, which were detected in December 2012 but have yet to be confirmed by follow-up observations - could carry life-detecting gear. So could a penetrator, which would slam into Europa's ice shell at high speeds, or a lander, which would touch down softly. Europa's rough and rugged terrain - a complex jumble of big ice cliffs and crevasses - would make a soft landing extremely challenging, Green said, and surface work would be tough in the moon's high-radiation environment. We'll all just have to wait and see if NASA will add these challenges to its Europa to-do list.", "url": "https://www.space.com/31407-nasa-europa-mission-lander.html"}, {"title": "About NASA's fascinating Europa mission", "date": "2016-01-08", "content": "Now, after years of studies to determine which spacecraft is best for the job, NASA is taking steps toward a $2 billion Europa mission - called the Europa Multi-Flyby Mission - that could launch some time in the 2020s and finally settle the debate over whether alien Europans exist. Mission scientists are still finalizing the design, but at its simplest, the mission will involve a spacecraft that performs dozens of flybys above Europa's surface. \"Anything else we can add to the flyby mission, whether it's a lander or any kind of probe, will make it even more fantastic, but even without those things this is going to be a mission that's one of the best that NASA's ever done in terms of the science return and the excitement it generates,\" Curt Niebur, who is the lead program scientist for NASA's New Frontiers Program, told Business Insider. More than anything else, NASA wants to determine whether Europa is habitable. Scientists know that it has a giant ocean beneath its surface that could contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. But does that water harbor the conditions for life? \"What if the ocean has a pH of 1, or what if it doesn't have the basic building blocks that life needs?\" Niebur said. \"What Europa flyby mission is going to do is answer that question and tell us what are the conditions inside the ocean.\" In addition to studying the ocean, the spacecraft will collect unprecedented data from the surface. Since 1997, the Galileo spacecraft that is orbiting Jupiter has been taking the occasional visit to Europa. But what Galileo has shown us of Europa's ice- cracked surface pales in comparison to the upcoming mission NASA has planned. \"It's going to map all of Europa at a resolution of about 25 to 50 meters,\" Niebur said. \"It blows Galileo out of the water. Galileo maps Europa globally at about a 500-meter resolution.\" Ten times better resolution is the difference between seeing cities and seeing parking lots, Niebur said. And it's this kind of high-res mapping that's going to get us to the surface to test the ice for signs of life. Ultimately, it might take landing a robot on Europa, which can analyze material on the surface, to detect an alien presence. But NASA's Europa mission only involved a spacecraft that would hover over Europa - until recently. Touching down on Europa's surface. \"The challenge with any mission is always balancing cost, science return, and risk,\" Niebur told us. \"We spent years on the flyby mission balancing those things. Now in just the past three to six months we've been presented with the challenge of, 'Oh, could you do the same thing with a lander?'\" Leading that request is US Rep. John Culberson, who is the chairman of the House of Appropriations Subcommittee, with oversight of NASA's budget. For this year, Culberson helped NASA gain $175 million in funding toward its Europa mission, which was $145 million more than the agency had requested. And he's dead-set on seeing a lander go up with the mission. In fact, in the budget legislation he ordered that the funds must be used toward a design that includes a lander, basically making it illegal to fly the mission without one, Ars Technica reported. Niebur is not sure how much a lander will add to the $2 billion mission. And while he admits a lander would be fantastic, there's something about Europa that worries him. \"Europa is unknown territory,\" he said. \"It's conceivable that we could get a lander close to Europa and simply never find a smooth flat place in which to land ... landing on an unknown surface with unknown hazards - that keeps me up at night.\" Right now, the Europa team is calculating the extra money a lander would cost to the mission. Once that's settled, NASA can move forward with construction.

In discussions Feb. 1 at a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group in San Antonio, Texas, agency officials said they are considering how to add a lander to a mission under development to make multiple flybys of Europa, even though the lander will weigh significantly more than the main \"clipper\" spacecraft. Curt Niebur, outer planets program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said at the meeting that the biggest challenge of adding the lander to the Europa mission is its mass: about 8,000 kilograms, to accommodate the propellant needed to land the spacecraft softly on the surface. He added that estimate was \"very rough\" based on the limited studies of lander concepts to date. By comparison, the clipper spacecraft alone would have a mass of only about 5,000 kilograms. That additional mass would drive the selection of the launch vehicle, requiring the use of the Space Launch System. \"If we co-manifest the lander and clipper, we're only on SLS,\" he said. \"It's still a slow boat, so to speak: you'd still do inner solar system gravity assists.\" NASA planning for a Europa clipper alone has examined using an Atlas 5 launch and flybys to reach Europa, or an SLS launch on a direct trajectory. The SLS would be more expensive than an Atlas 5, but the direct trajectory would allow the mission to reach Europa several years sooner. Niebur said an alternative under study would be to launch the clipper spacecraft and the lander separately. \"It's an option that we've been kicking around, and we need to make a decision on that preferably soon,\" he said. Splitting the mission into two launches could allow the clipper spacecraft to remain on a fast track. Niebur said that, given current funding trends where Congress has allocated significantly more for the mission than NASA has requested, a clipper spacecraft alone could be technically ready for launch as soon as 2022. \"If you put a very capable lander on there, I think that's going to slow things down a bit,\" he added. \"Do you put them all on the same spacecraft and launch them on the same rocket, or do you split them onto separate rockets? That's also an option we could consider.\" Splitting the clipper and lander spacecraft, though, could run afoul of the congressional language that is forcing NASA to consider flying the lander in the first place. The fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill passed in December provided NASA with $175 million for work on a Europa mission, with direction that such a mission consist of \"an orbiter with a lander\" and \"plan for a launch no later than 2022\" on an SLS. Robert Pappalardo, the Europa project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there is a \"strawman\" schedule for accommodating a Europa lander on the planned clipper mission, although he did not disclose it at the meeting. \"That said, the plan is for the clipper portion, the multiple flyby portion, to go full steam ahead,\" he said. That includes holding the mission's next major review, a system requirements review, this summer regardless of any decision to add a lander. Niebur said that, separate from the discussion about a lander, NASA was examining several smaller \"augmentations\" to the clipper spacecraft. One example he mentioned is a cubesat-sized spacecraft that would fly through plumes of water ice ejected by Europa. Other additions to the clipper spacecraft could address studies of Europa's gravitational field. The current spacecraft design has about 250 kilograms of spare mass to support those or other additions to the clipper spacecraft separate from the lander. Those augmentations, he said, would not affect the primary science mission of the main spacecraft and its suite of 10 instruments NASA announced last year. \"Whatever we do in terms of these enhancements, I want to stress that we are fully committed to the multiple flyby mission,\" he said. \"For any other decisions on enhancements, our drivers are going to be to protect the science of the multiple flyby mission.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-weighing-dual-launches-of-europa-orbiter-and-lander/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa Mission May Not Launch Until Late 2020s", "date": "2016-02-10", "content": "NASA's highly anticipated mission to the potentially life-supporting Jupiter moon Europa may not get off the ground until the late 2020s, agency officials say.

A new study published just this week, authored by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, found that conditions in the oceans on Europa may indeed be Earth-like and capable of harboring life. Despite the wishes of the planetary science community to further investigate Europa, NASA has been wary of mounting such a mission because of the high cost-well above $1 billion. Additionally, planetary science hasn't been a priority in President Obama's NASA budgets, and the space agency has preferred to focus most of its robotic solar system exploration on Mars. The red planet is easier to reach, and NASA says it wants to explore Mars further to enable future human missions. Congress has been more interested in planetary science, however. And in particular, the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA's budget, John Culberson, has fancied Europa. Even when NASA wasn't asking for Europa funds, the congressman was funneling money to the scientists at the California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Between the 2013 and 2016 fiscal years, NASA requested just $45 million in Europa funding, but Congress appropriated $395 million. For fiscal year 2017, NASA requested $49.6 million in Europa funding, but a House appropriations bill released this week by Culberson's committee proposes $260 million for mission planning and development. As part of the mission to Europa, Culberson would also like to send a lander to the surface of the heaving, ice-encrusted world. This would allow scientists to better characterize the oceans below and, if the lander touches down near a fissure, possibly even sample the ocean. However, there has been some concern that having both an orbital spacecraft and a lander in a single mission would prove too challenging for a single rocket to deliver. Advertisement So as part of the new House bill, the Europa mission is broken into two parts: an orbiter and, two years later, a lander. The plan would be for the orbiter spacecraft to swoop down into the harsh radiation environment near Europa and out again to relay data back to Earth. The nominal mission would perform at least 45 flybys of Europa at altitudes varying from 2,700km all the way down to 25km above the surface. By assessing this data, scientists on Earth could determine where best to set their lander down on the surface two years later. \"We have increased funding for planetary programs and made sure we are going to complete the incredibly important mission to Europa that the planetary decadal survey mapped out because of the very high likelihood that life will be discovered in those oceans,\" Culberson said during a hearing Tuesday. \"This will be a transformative moment in the history of humanity and the country.\" In its documents about the Europa mission, NASA has not formally approved a lander, and it says only that the flyby mission will launch \"sometime in the 2020s.\" The House bill is much more specific, calling for an orbiter launch no later than 2022 and a lander launch no later than 2024. Senior officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have told Culberson that those dates are attainable. Additionally, the bill specifies that NASA's next budget, for fiscal year 2018, includes a five-year funding profile to support those two launches. NASA last visited the Jupiter system in the 1990s and early 2000s with the Galileo spacecraft. Galileo snapped images of Europa during 11 flybys, but the best of those pictures had a resolution of only about 10 meters per pixel. The spacecraft stored those images on a tape recorder with a capacity of 114 megabytes, but a flawed rewind mode hampered even that modest device. Yet this limited data was enough to tantalize scientists, and Europa has been a target of high interest for planetary scientists ever since.

Splitting the mission into two launches could allow the clipper spacecraft to remain on a fast track. Niebur said that, given current funding trends where Congress has allocated significantly more for the mission than NASA has requested, a clipper spacecraft alone could be technically ready for launch as soon as 2022. \"If you put a very capable lander on there, I think that's going to slow things down a bit,\" he added. \"Do you put them all on the same spacecraft and launch them on the same rocket, or do you split them onto separate rockets? That's also an option we could consider.\" Splitting the clipper and lander spacecraft, though, could run afoul of the congressional language that is forcing NASA to consider flying the lander in the first place. The fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill passed in December provided NASA with $175 million for work on a Europa mission, with direction that such a mission consist of \"an orbiter with a lander\" and \"plan for a launch no later than 2022\" on an SLS. Robert Pappalardo, the Europa project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said there is a \"strawman\" schedule for accommodating a Europa lander on the planned clipper mission, although he did not disclose it at the meeting. \"That said, the plan is for the clipper portion, the multiple flyby portion, to go full steam ahead,\" he said. That includes holding the mission's next major review, a system requirements review, this summer regardless of any decision to add a lander. Niebur said that, separate from the discussion about a lander, NASA was examining several smaller \"augmentations\" to the clipper spacecraft. One example he mentioned is a cubesat-sized spacecraft that would fly through plumes of water ice ejected by Europa. Other additions to the clipper spacecraft could address studies of Europa's gravitational field. The current spacecraft design has about 250 kilograms of spare mass to support those or other additions to the clipper spacecraft separate from the lander. Those augmentations, he said, would not affect the primary science mission of the main spacecraft and its suite of 10 instruments NASA announced last year. \"Whatever we do in terms of these enhancements, I want to stress that we are fully committed to the multiple flyby mission,\" he said. \"For any other decisions on enhancements, our drivers are going to be to protect the science of the multiple flyby mission.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-weighing-dual-launches-of-europa-orbiter-and-lander/"}, {"title": "NASA Europa Mission May Not Launch Until Late 2020s", "date": "2016-02-10", "content": "NASA's highly anticipated mission to the potentially life-supporting Jupiter moon Europa may not get off the ground until the late 2020s, agency officials say. Last year, Congress granted NASA $175 million to continue developing its Europa mission, which will perform dozens of flybys to gauge the life- hosting potential of the icy moon's huge subsurface ocean. In that allocation, Congress declared that NASA must have the Europa mission ready to launch by 2022. But NASA's fiscal year 2017 budget request, which was released Tuesday, includes just $49.6 million for the Europa effort - a level that, when combined with predicted funding in the coming years, \"supports a Europa mission launch in the late 2020s,\" NASA chief financial officer David Radzanowski said during a news conference Tuesday. Getting the Europa flyby spacecraft ready to launch by 2022 would probably require a 2017 investment of about $194 million, Radzanowski said. The space agency has provided this estimate to Congress, he added. \"Within our $19 billion request, to find an additional $150 million - whether within the science portfolio or abroad - we felt would upset the balance of the overall portfolio,\" Radzanowski said. \"So we do not think it's prudent to support a 2022 launch at the funding level requested.\" Scientists regard Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host life beyond Earth. The moon's vast ocean - which harbors more water than all of Earth's seas combined - is in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions, researchers say. So astrobiologists are eager to explore Europa - and they're not the only ones. Congress shares this enthusiasm, in large part because of John Culberson, who chairs the House of Representatives' Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and has a longstanding interest in the search for alien life. Indeed, in the 2016 budget deal, Congress directed NASA to make its Europa mission more ambitious, ordering the agency to add a component that would actually touch down on the icy moon. The deal also stipulated that NASA use the agency's in-development Space Launch System megarocket, as opposed to a currently available booster. NASA is still assessing how it can incorporate these directives, and how doing so would change the Europa mission's pricetag, Radzanowski said. It's too soon to know exactly what's going to happen with the Europa mission, which is still in the early-development phase. For example, Congress may end up giving NASA far more for the project than the $49.6 million it requested this year, bringing a 2022 liftoff back into the realm of possibility. In fact, that will probably happen, if precedent is any indication. NASA didn't ask for any Europa-mission funding in 2013 or 2014 but ended up getting more than $120 million for those two years combined. And in 2015 and 2016, NASA requested a total of $45 million for the Europa project, and Congress allocated $275 million.

In late February, NASA's planetary science division sent a letter to scientists requesting applications to join a science definition team for the proposed lander. The goal of the SDT, the letter stated, is \"defining the science objectives and feasibility of specific lander mission concept focused on assessing the habitability of and searching for life on Europa.\" NASA expects to form the SDT later in March, to be followed by a series of teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. The letter doesn't state when the SDT would complete its work and disband, but the letter does request information on applicants' availability over the next 12 months. However, the SDT could complete their work much earlier. \"They should be able to get that work done, I would say, by early summer,\" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at a March 3 hearing of a House appropriations subcommittee on NASA's \"Ocean Worlds\" program. The completion of the SDT report would allow NASA to move ahead on an announcement of opportunity for instruments for the lander to achieve those scientific objectives. \"In my mind, earlier is better\" for issuing such a call for instrument proposals, Elachi said, noting that, for past missions, it's taken six to seven years from the time a instrument payload is selected until a mission is ready for launch. JPL has been carrying out internal studies of a lander, which could accompany a \"Europa Clipper\" mission that would orbit Jupiter and make multiple close flybys of the moon. The lab hasn't released details about those lander concepts, but at the hearing Elachi suggested it would make use of technology developed at JPL for Mars landers. \"That lander will capitalize very heavily on what we have done on Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity,\" he said. That includes making use of the \"sky crane\" technique used for landing Curiosity successfully in 2012. \"So we are very confident, technologically, that with appropriate funding that mission could be done at an acceptable risk.\" The lander, Elachi said, would not be attached to the orbiter spacecraft but would be an independent spacecraft, even if the two spacecraft are launched together. Elachi said that even if they are flown together, the orbiter would study Europa first and identify potential landing sites before the lander attempts to set down at one of them. The issue of appropriate funding, or lack thereof, was an issue the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. John Culberson, raised at the hearing. \"Unfortunately, once again the Office of Management and Budget has given us a 2017 request that cuts the planetary science budget,\" he said. \"It's very disappointing and aggravating.\" The 2016 omnibus spending bill provided $175 million to NASA for work on a Europa mission, including a lander, far more than the administration's request of $30 million. In the 2017 budget request, NASA included nearly $50 million for a Europa mission. Culberson asked Elachi what level of funding NASA's planetary sciences program should receive to keep a Europa mission and other programs on track. \"That's a better question to ask NASA,\" Elachi responded. \"Clearly, it depends on when you want these missions to happen.\" He suggested, though, that the Europa mission will need even more funding than what Congress has granted so far to support a launch in the early 2020s. \"If you want to launch in the early '20s, the present level is not sufficient to do that,\" he said.

A new study published just this week, authored by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, found that conditions in the oceans on Europa may indeed be Earth-like and capable of harboring life. Despite the wishes of the planetary science community to further investigate Europa, NASA has been wary of mounting such a mission because of the high cost-well above $1 billion. Additionally, planetary science hasn't been a priority in President Obama's NASA budgets, and the space agency has preferred to focus most of its robotic solar system exploration on Mars. The red planet is easier to reach, and NASA says it wants to explore Mars further to enable future human missions. Congress has been more interested in planetary science, however. And in particular, the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA's budget, John Culberson, has fancied Europa. Even when NASA wasn't asking for Europa funds, the congressman was funneling money to the scientists at the California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Between the 2013 and 2016 fiscal years, NASA requested just $45 million in Europa funding, but Congress appropriated $395 million. For fiscal year 2017, NASA requested $49.6 million in Europa funding, but a House appropriations bill released this week by Culberson's committee proposes $260 million for mission planning and development. As part of the mission to Europa, Culberson would also like to send a lander to the surface of the heaving, ice-encrusted world. This would allow scientists to better characterize the oceans below and, if the lander touches down near a fissure, possibly even sample the ocean. However, there has been some concern that having both an orbital spacecraft and a lander in a single mission would prove too challenging for a single rocket to deliver. Advertisement So as part of the new House bill, the Europa mission is broken into two parts: an orbiter and, two years later, a lander. The plan would be for the orbiter spacecraft to swoop down into the harsh radiation environment near Europa and out again to relay data back to Earth. The nominal mission would perform at least 45 flybys of Europa at altitudes varying from 2,700km all the way down to 25km above the surface. By assessing this data, scientists on Earth could determine where best to set their lander down on the surface two years later. \"We have increased funding for planetary programs and made sure we are going to complete the incredibly important mission to Europa that the planetary decadal survey mapped out because of the very high likelihood that life will be discovered in those oceans,\" Culberson said during a hearing Tuesday. \"This will be a transformative moment in the history of humanity and the country.\" In its documents about the Europa mission, NASA has not formally approved a lander, and it says only that the flyby mission will launch \"sometime in the 2020s.\" The House bill is much more specific, calling for an orbiter launch no later than 2022 and a lander launch no later than 2024. Senior officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have told Culberson that those dates are attainable. Additionally, the bill specifies that NASA's next budget, for fiscal year 2018, includes a five-year funding profile to support those two launches. NASA last visited the Jupiter system in the 1990s and early 2000s with the Galileo spacecraft. Galileo snapped images of Europa during 11 flybys, but the best of those pictures had a resolution of only about 10 meters per pixel. The spacecraft stored those images on a tape recorder with a capacity of 114 megabytes, but a flawed rewind mode hampered even that modest device. Yet this limited data was enough to tantalize scientists, and Europa has been a target of high interest for planetary scientists ever since.

In discussions Feb. 1 at a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group in San Antonio, Texas, agency officials said they are considering how to add a lander to a mission under development to make multiple flybys of Europa, even though the lander will weigh significantly more than the main \"clipper\" spacecraft. Curt Niebur, outer planets program scientist at NASA Headquarters, said at the meeting that the biggest challenge of adding the lander to the Europa mission is its mass: about 8,000 kilograms, to accommodate the propellant needed to land the spacecraft softly on the surface. He added that estimate was \"very rough\" based on the limited studies of lander concepts to date. By comparison, the clipper spacecraft alone would have a mass of only about 5,000 kilograms. That additional mass would drive the selection of the launch vehicle, requiring the use of the Space Launch System. \"If we co-manifest the lander and clipper, we're only on SLS,\" he said. \"It's still a slow boat, so to speak: you'd still do inner solar system gravity assists.\" NASA planning for a Europa clipper alone has examined using an Atlas 5 launch and flybys to reach Europa, or an SLS launch on a direct trajectory. The SLS would be more expensive than an Atlas 5, but the direct trajectory would allow the mission to reach Europa several years sooner.

By assessing this data, scientists on Earth could determine where best to set their lander down on the surface two years later. \"We have increased funding for planetary programs and made sure we are going to complete the incredibly important mission to Europa that the planetary decadal survey mapped out because of the very high likelihood that life will be discovered in those oceans,\" Culberson said during a hearing Tuesday. \"This will be a transformative moment in the history of humanity and the country.\" In its documents about the Europa mission, NASA has not formally approved a lander, and it says only that the flyby mission will launch \"sometime in the 2020s.\" The House bill is much more specific, calling for an orbiter launch no later than 2022 and a lander launch no later than 2024. Senior officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have told Culberson that those dates are attainable.

The stationary Europa lander would use three different instrument suites to search for signs of alien life in samples collected from just beneath the moon's icy surface, according to a new report by the 21-member \"Science Definition Team\" for the possible mission. These primary instruments would include an \"organic compositional analyzer,\" a microscope system and a \"vibrational spectrometer,\" stated the report, which was submitted to NASA on Tuesday. \"The science return possible from the model payload is such that, if life is present in Europa's ice at a level comparable to one of the most extreme and desolate of environments on Earth, then this mission could detect life in Europa's icy surface,\" the report's authors wrote. Hunting for alien life would be the mission's primary goal. But it would also seek to assess the habitability of the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath Europa's icy shell, and to characterize the moon's surface and near- surface environments to help enable future robotic missions. Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Not only does the satellite host an ocean, but that ocean is thought to be in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions. Scientists are eager to learn if Europa's huge subsurface ocean harbors alien life. See how Jupiter's icy moon Europa works in this SPACE.com infographic. NASA is already developing a flyby mission to Europa, which is scheduled to launch in the 2020s. This solar- powered spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and assess the moon's habitability during the course of 45 close encounters with Europa. In late 2015, Congress ordered NASA to add a surface component to the Europa mission. The agency is currently studying the best ways to make this happen; the new SDT report is part of that process. The current vision for the lander calls for it to be launched separately from the Europa flyby probe, according to the SDT report. The lander and a \"carrier relay orbiter\" would lift off atop NASA's in-development Space Launch System megarocket as early as 2024. The mission would reach Jupiter about five years later, then perform a series of Jovian moon flybys over the next 1.5 years to prepare for arrival at Europa, the SDT report's authors wrote. Once the mission got there, the CRO would stay in Europa orbit. The lander would touch down on the Jovian moon using retrorockets and a \" sky crane \" like the one that lowered NASA's Curiosity rover onto the Martian surface in August 2012. The lander would operate for at least 20 days, until its batteries died. The craft would collect samples from at least 4 inches beneath the Europan surface, to get material that hadn't been destroyed or transformed by the harsh radiation bombarding the moon. It would then relay the data back to Earth via the CRO. The Europan radiation environment would likely limit the CRO's lifetime to about 30 days, according to the SDT team's report, \"thus making a longer-lived lander mission difficult to justify.\" The lander would be quite busy during its brief operational life, as its proposed instrument payload indicates. \"Along with the analytical suite for detailed analyses of samples, the Europa Lander model payload also includes a pair of color stereo imagers for examining the landing site in 3D, and a seismic package for determining Europa's ice shell and ocean thickness through acoustic monitoring of cracking events in the ice shell,\" the SDT report states. The SDT report is far from the last word on the Europa lander mission, which remains just a concept at the moment. For example, NASA will host town hall meetings at two upcoming scientific conferences - one in March and one in April - to get feedback from researchers about the SDT team's findings and recommendations.

If there's life swimming underneath, we might find out very soon. NASA just received a report Tuesday detailing a conceptual landing mission to Europa, which is slightly smaller than Earths moon and has twice as much water as Earth's oceans. Early last year, NASA's Planetary Science Division started assessing the science value and engineering design of a future mission to Europa. In June 2016, a 21-person team assembled to create a report for the mission concept. According to the report, the mission has three goals: To search for evidence of alien life on Europa, to assess its habitability, and to characterize the surface and subsurface for future explorations to this moon and its ocean. The team also had to develop a strategy for finding life - a first for NASA since the Mars Viking missions over 40 years ago. Europa is also one of only two places where the ocean is in contact with a rocky seafloor, which makes Europa a high-priority target for searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. We may find signs of life swimming beneath Europa's crust. In fact, researchers recently developed a chemistry test that's ideal for detecting life on ocean worlds like Europa. Currently, NASA is developing a separate solar-powered Europa flyby mission, which will launch in the early 2020s. After journeying for many years, it will arrive at Jupiter and orbit it every two weeks for a series of 45 close flybys.

Hunting for alien life would be the mission's primary goal. But it would also seek to assess the habitability of the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath Europa's icy shell, and to characterize the moon's surface and near- surface environments to help enable future robotic missions. Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Not only does the satellite host an ocean, but that ocean is thought to be in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions. Scientists are eager to learn if Europa's huge subsurface ocean harbors alien life. See how Jupiter's icy moon Europa works in this SPACE.com infographic. NASA is already developing a flyby mission to Europa, which is scheduled to launch in the 2020s. This solar- powered spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and assess the moon's habitability during the course of 45 close encounters with Europa. In late 2015, Congress ordered NASA to add a surface component to the Europa mission. The agency is currently studying the best ways to make this happen; the new SDT report is part of that process. The current vision for the lander calls for it to be launched separately from the Europa flyby probe, according to the SDT report. The lander and a \"carrier relay orbiter\" would lift off atop NASA's in-development Space Launch System megarocket as early as 2024. The mission would reach Jupiter about five years later, then perform a series of Jovian moon flybys over the next 1.5 years to prepare for arrival at Europa, the SDT report's authors wrote. Once the mission got there, the CRO would stay in Europa orbit. The lander would touch down on the Jovian moon using retrorockets and a \" sky crane \" like the one that lowered NASA's Curiosity rover onto the Martian surface in August 2012. The lander would operate for at least 20 days, until its batteries died. The craft would collect samples from at least 4 inches beneath the Europan surface, to get material that hadn't been destroyed or transformed by the harsh radiation bombarding the moon. It would then relay the data back to Earth via the CRO. The Europan radiation environment would likely limit the CRO's lifetime to about 30 days, according to the SDT team's report, \"thus making a longer-lived lander mission difficult to justify.\" The lander would be quite busy during its brief operational life, as its proposed instrument payload indicates. \"Along with the analytical suite for detailed analyses of samples, the Europa Lander model payload also includes a pair of color stereo imagers for examining the landing site in 3D, and a seismic package for determining Europa's ice shell and ocean thickness through acoustic monitoring of cracking events in the ice shell,\" the SDT report states. The SDT report is far from the last word on the Europa lander mission, which remains just a concept at the moment. For example, NASA will host town hall meetings at two upcoming scientific conferences - one in March and one in April - to get feedback from researchers about the SDT team's findings and recommendations.

Europa is also one of only two places where the ocean is in contact with a rocky seafloor, which makes Europa a high-priority target for searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. We may find signs of life swimming beneath Europa's crust. In fact, researchers recently developed a chemistry test that's ideal for detecting life on ocean worlds like Europa.

Technically, this mission has been called the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission, which is a bit more of a mouthful. The collaboration between NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab will see a craft placed into orbit around Jupiter placed in such a way as to have dozens of encounters with Europa. It also gives plenty of time to transmit data back between encounters. However, Jupiter's radiation is harsh and a Europa orbiter may not survive a direct orbit around it. The craft is tentatively set for a 2022 launch. It was recently moved into Phase B production, where design specifications will be hammered out by the team.

This directive is in keeping with the one issued by advanced aliens in famed sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 book \"2010: Odyssey Two.\" \"All these worlds are yours - except Europa,\" the aliens say in a message sent to Earth. \"Attempt no landing there.\" The blueprint does fund continued development of NASA's $2 billion Europa Clipper mission, which will launch in the 2020s and investigate the habitability of the Jovian moon - widely regarded as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life - during dozens of flybys.

In a presentation at a meeting of the Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science at the National Academies here March 29, Barry Goldstein of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that ongoing studies of the proposed lander are continuing, including a mission concept review scheduled for June. \"We still have enough funding to make it through the end of the year for development,\" he said. \"We're going to pursue the mission concept review and let the chips fall where they may as we proceed.\" The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget blueprint, released March 16, proposed a record-high $1.9 billion for NASA's planetary science program, including support for the Europa Clipper mission that will go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of flybys of Europa. However, the document explicitly ruled out funding for the follow-on lander mission. \"To preserve the balance of NASA's science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community, the Budget provides no funding for a multi-billion- dollar mission to land on Europa,\" the document stated. The lander mission, along with Europa Clipper, has enjoyed strong support from Congress, notably from Rep. John Culberson, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and an advocate of exploration of the icy moon that scientists believe is potentially habitable. Culberson, in recent years, has provided funding for Europa Clipper well above any administration request and at one point called for launching both Europa Clipper and the lander simultaneously. Culberson did not mention the budget proposal in brief comments at the end of the public lecture about Europa exploration here March 29, but did reiterate his support for sending both orbiter and lander missions there. He said he reached final agreement with fellow appropriators for a fiscal year 2017 spending bill that must be passed by April 28, when the continuing resolution that currently funds NASA and other federal agencies at 2016 levels expires. He didn't provide details about the contents of that bill, which has not yet been formally introduced, but said, \"You'll be very pleased with the result.\" Goldstein, at the committee meeting, said the funding the proposed mission has received has helped make major progress on its design. \"We've done an enormous amount of not only technical design, but also programmatic design, evaluating the capabilities and how long it will take to make this mission come to fruition,\" he said. That design, he said, permits a launch no earlier than October to December of 2025 on a Space Launch System rocket. No other launch vehicles, he said, have the performance to launch the lander mission, and even an SLS launch requires the use of an Earth gravity assist that would send the spacecraft to Jupiter, arriving in mid-2030. The choice of launch vehicle and trajectory is driven by the spacecraft's mass of 16.6 metric tons. By comparison, he said, Europa Clipper weighs 6 metric tons, and will be the largest spacecraft JPL has built to date. \"Almost all of that mass is either liquid of solid propellant\" to place the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter and then Europa, and for the landing itself, he said. The lander itself will be able to accommodate a payload of 42.5 kilograms of science instruments, with a notional suite of five instruments proposed by scientists in a report released in February. Those instruments would support the goals of looking for evidence of life on Europa, assess its habitability and characterize the moon to support future missions there. The lander will use a \"skycrane\" landing system similar to that employed to the Mars Curiosity lander. Goldstein said early concepts of the lander looked similar to the 1990s Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, with petals to stabilize the spacecraft. \"The team looked at that quite a bit and realized... that it was very susceptible to 'pathological' landing cases that would end the mission,\" he said, referring to the jagged terrain seen on much of the moon's icy surface. The lander will instead use what Goldstein described as the \"cricket\" design, with four landing legs in lieu of petals. The battery-powered spacecraft is designed for a 20-day mission after landing, although that could be extended depending on how many samples the spacecraft collects and processes with its robotic arm. At the end of the mission, the spacecraft will self-destruct using a \"thermite-based incinerator\" to comply with planetary protection requirements. That system can also be triggered if the spacecraft loses contact with the Earth. \"Like in 'Mission Impossible,' we'll hit the self-destruct button and sterilize,\" he said.

An ocean containing twice as much water as all of Earth's seas is thought to slosh beneath Europa's 10-to-15-mile-thick ice shell. For this reason, astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Jovian moon as one of the solar system's best bets to host extraterrestrial life. Furthermore, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted evidence of water-vapor plumes emanating from Europa's south polar region, suggesting that material from the ocean may fall back onto the moon's icy surface. That's an exciting prospect for NASA, which aims to put a lander on Europa in the 2020s to look for chemical evidence that the moon could support life. However, the very landing could complicate this search greatly. Firing thrusters to slow the spacecraft's descent \"will be like hosing down the ground with ammonia, and this is a very inconvenient thing to do,\" said Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It's inconvenient because ammonia contains nitrogen, he said. \"Everything in our body has nitrogen,\" Lorenz told Space.com. --\"If you are interested in nitrogen as a prerequisite for life, then finding even traces of it at Europa is important, and so even a little thruster contamination matters a lot.\" If such contamination were to occur, scientists would struggle to figure out if nitrogen detected at Europa was native or imported from Earth, he said. In a study published in the journal Planetary and Space Science this past August, Lorenz found that putting a 440-lb. spacecraft down on Europa would disturb the surface out to 30 feet around the lander. He concluded this after studying images of past surface disturbances caused by spacecraft landings on Earth's moon and Mars. Scientists cannot assume that the Europa lander will be able to move away from such a contaminated site. NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has wheels, so it drove away from its Red Planet landing site back in 2012. But scientists know little about the hazards on Europa's surface, Lorenz said. \"The distribution of rocks could cause a lander to tip over, or it could fall into a crevasse,\" Lorenz said. \"In space exploration, it's not good enough to speculate that this will work. Why throw 1 billion or 2 billion dollars into it?\" The issue of nitrogen contamination on Europa is more problematic than it is on Mars or Earth's moon because the Jovian satellite is much colder than these other worlds, Lorenz said. At its warmest, temperatures on Europa don't rise above minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. Under such frigid conditions, ammonia is more likely to stick to Europa's surface, allowing it to interact with other molecules and perhaps make a mess of observations, Lorenz said. Other researchers think that sampling Europa's surface is important, but that the best samples lie deeper. \"We have to go down, beneath the surface,\" said Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has worked on NASA's Europa lander mission concept. This means drilling into Europa's ice. Schmidt thinks a mission needs to drill at least 4 inches down, to a place where the thrusters haven't contaminated the ice and space radiation hasn't destroyed biogenic molecules - the stuff- necessary for life's processes to take place. \"If we get 10 centimeters, or a meter about 3 feet, down, this area hasn't been blasted with the thrusters,\" Schmidt told Space.com. \"Maybe a portion, but the confidence for getting a pristine sample goes up the further you go down.\" The Europa lander won't just be looking for ammonia or nitrogen, stressed Peter Willis, a chemist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Still, he said, the Europa lander mission will take precautions; the lander will likely bore into the ice, Willis said. NASA also plans to employ the sky- crane landing method, which put Curiosity down on Mars, with the Europa craft, he added. --After descending toward Europa, a hovering spacecraft will fire thrusters into the air to stay aloft while it uses a cord to lower the lander down to the surface. Then, it will let go. In such a case, \"the spacecraft actually falls, but we hope not too far,\" Willis said. Limiting the amount of Earthly organics being sprayed on Europa's surface will help NASA's quest to find extraterrestrial life -- even if what researchers are looking for doesn't walk or swim, Schmidt said. \"People want us to drill into Europa and find a fish,\" she said. \"But right now, this is not realistic;- the hope is to land there and detect biogenic molecules, the molecules essential for life.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/35136-jupiter-moon-europa-life-hunt-drill.html"}, {"title": "NASA Maps Out Possible Lander Mission to Jupiter Moon Europa", "date": "2017-02-10", "content": "A potential NASA life-hunting mission to the surface of Jupiter's ocean- harboring moon Europa is really starting to take shape.

The Europa mission spacecraft is being planned for launch in the 2020s, arriving in the Jupiter system after a journey of several years. The spacecraft would orbit Jupiter as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa.

NASA's Europa multiple-flyby mission successfully completed its Key Decision Point-B review on February 15, allowing the mission to continue in its preliminary design phase, known as \"Phase B\", beginning on February 27. During Phase A, 10 scientific instruments were selected to be developed to study Europa. The new mission phase is scheduled to continue through September 2018 and will result in a preliminary design of the spacecraft's systems and subsystems. The testing of some of the spacecraft's components, such as solar cells and science instrument detectors, began during Phase A and will continue into Phase B. During Phase B, subsystem vendors will be chosen as well as prototype elements of the science instruments. Spacecraft subassemblies will also be built and tested during this phase.

The spacecraft will perform up to 45 flybys of Europa during the prime mission, at altitudes varying from 1,700 miles to 16 miles (2,700 kilometers to 25 kilometers) above the surface. The Europa mission spacecraft will study the icy moon's surface at high resolution and investigate the composition and structure of its icy shell and interior. A thermal instrument will study Europa's frozen surface in search of recent eruptions of liquid water at or near the surface, while other instruments will search for evidence of water and tiny particles in the moon's thin atmosphere. In 2012, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted water vapor above the south polar region of Europa, providing possible evidence of water plumes. If the plume do exist, and they're connected to a subsurface ocean, studying their composition would aid scientists in studying the chemical makeup of Europa's potentially habitable environment without having to drill through layers of ice.

That may sound familiar because it's what many people have been calling it that all along, but as Emily Lakdawalla at the Planetary Society points out, it's actually the name of a different mission concept. Technically, this mission has been called the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission, which is a bit more of a mouthful. The collaboration between NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab will see a craft placed into orbit around Jupiter placed in such a way as to have dozens of encounters with Europa. It also gives plenty of time to transmit data back between encounters. However, Jupiter's radiation is harsh and a Europa orbiter may not survive a direct orbit around it. The craft is tentatively set for a 2022 launch. It was recently moved into Phase B production, where design specifications will be hammered out by the team.

The $2 billion mission - which will launch in the 2020s to assess Europa's potential to host life - is called Europa Clipper, which has long been its informal moniker, NASA officials announced Thursday. The name is a nod to the fast, three-masted sailing vessels known as clippers, which delivered a variety of goods around the world in the 19th century, NASA officials said. \"In the grand tradition of these classic ships, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would sail past Europa at a rapid cadence, as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities to investigate the moon up close,\" they wrote in a statement Thursday. \"The prime mission plan includes 40 to 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.\" Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa, along with the Saturn satellite Enceladus, as one of the solar system's best bets to host extraterrestrial life. Both moons harbor oceans of liquid water beneath their icy shells. And both of these oceans are thought to be in contact with the rocky mantle below, making possible a lot of interesting chemical reactions, researchers have said. The solar-powered Europa Clipper probe will set up shop in Jupiter orbit. During the Europa flybys, the spacecraft will use a variety of instruments to study the moon's ice shell and ocean, with the overall aim of assessing Europa's ability to support life as we know it. In late 2015, Congress ordered NASA to develop a surface component for the Europa mission as well. The space agency is now studying the best ways to do that. The current vision calls for a stationary lander that would launch separately from the Clipper probe. Once it reached Europa, the lander would use three science instruments to search for signs of life in the ice just beneath the surface.

This directive is in keeping with the one issued by advanced aliens in famed sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 book \"2010: Odyssey Two.\" \"All these worlds are yours - except Europa,\" the aliens say in a message sent to Earth. \"Attempt no landing there.\" The blueprint does fund continued development of NASA's $2 billion Europa Clipper mission, which will launch in the 2020s and investigate the habitability of the Jovian moon - widely regarded as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life - during dozens of flybys. The budget blueprint also cancels NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission, an effort to pluck a boulder off a space rock and tow the piece to lunar orbit, where it would be visited by astronauts. And the proposal axes four NASA Earth-science projects: The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem satellite, which would monitor Earth's oceans and atmosphere; the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3, which would track atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels from the International Space Station ; the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory pathfinder, another instrument that would be installed on the ISS; and, finally, the Deep Space Climate Observatory.

In a presentation at a meeting of the Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science at the National Academies here March 29, Barry Goldstein of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that ongoing studies of the proposed lander are continuing, including a mission concept review scheduled for June. \"We still have enough funding to make it through the end of the year for development,\" he said. \"We're going to pursue the mission concept review and let the chips fall where they may as we proceed.\" The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget blueprint, released March 16, proposed a record-high $1.9 billion for NASA's planetary science program, including support for the Europa Clipper mission that will go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of flybys of Europa. However, the document explicitly ruled out funding for the follow-on lander mission. \"To preserve the balance of NASA's science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community, the Budget provides no funding for a multi-billion- dollar mission to land on Europa,\" the document stated. The lander mission, along with Europa Clipper, has enjoyed strong support from Congress, notably from Rep. John Culberson, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and an advocate of exploration of the icy moon that scientists believe is potentially habitable. Culberson, in recent years, has provided funding for Europa Clipper well above any administration request and at one point called for launching both Europa Clipper and the lander simultaneously. Culberson did not mention the budget proposal in brief comments at the end of the public lecture about Europa exploration here March 29, but did reiterate his support for sending both orbiter and lander missions there. He said he reached final agreement with fellow appropriators for a fiscal year 2017 spending bill that must be passed by April 28, when the continuing resolution that currently funds NASA and other federal agencies at 2016 levels expires. He didn't provide details about the contents of that bill, which has not yet been formally introduced, but said, \"You'll be very pleased with the result.\" Goldstein, at the committee meeting, said the funding the proposed mission has received has helped make major progress on its design. \"We've done an enormous amount of not only technical design, but also programmatic design, evaluating the capabilities and how long it will take to make this mission come to fruition,\" he said. That design, he said, permits a launch no earlier than October to December of 2025 on a Space Launch System rocket. No other launch vehicles, he said, have the performance to launch the lander mission, and even an SLS launch requires the use of an Earth gravity assist that would send the spacecraft to Jupiter, arriving in mid-2030. The choice of launch vehicle and trajectory is driven by the spacecraft's mass of 16.6 metric tons. By comparison, he said, Europa Clipper weighs 6 metric tons, and will be the largest spacecraft JPL has built to date. \"Almost all of that mass is either liquid of solid propellant\" to place the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter and then Europa, and for the landing itself, he said. The lander itself will be able to accommodate a payload of 42.5 kilograms of science instruments, with a notional suite of five instruments proposed by scientists in a report released in February. Those instruments would support the goals of looking for evidence of life on Europa, assess its habitability and characterize the moon to support future missions there. The lander will use a \"skycrane\" landing system similar to that employed to the Mars Curiosity lander. Goldstein said early concepts of the lander looked similar to the 1990s Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, with petals to stabilize the spacecraft. \"The team looked at that quite a bit and realized... that it was very susceptible to 'pathological' landing cases that would end the mission,\" he said, referring to the jagged terrain seen on much of the moon's icy surface. The lander will instead use what Goldstein described as the \"cricket\" design, with four landing legs in lieu of petals. The battery-powered spacecraft is designed for a 20-day mission after landing, although that could be extended depending on how many samples the spacecraft collects and processes with its robotic arm. At the end of the mission, the spacecraft will self-destruct using a \"thermite-based incinerator\" to comply with planetary protection requirements. That system can also be triggered if the spacecraft loses contact with the Earth. \"Like in 'Mission Impossible,' we'll hit the self-destruct button and sterilize,\" he said.

The jovian satellite has a deep subsurface ocean beneath its ice crust and is considered one of the top targets in the search for alien life. After decades of work, a pair of missions to the moon have been taking shape - and have secured crucial support in Congress. Scientists hope the lander could be launched some time in the 2020s. Although Nasa has yet to approve the mission, the agency said it had funding to begin the search for instrument ideas. Europa: Our best shot at finding alien life? \"The possibility of placing a lander on the surface of this intriguing icy moon, touching and exploring a world that might harbour life is at the heart of the Europa lander mission,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. \"We want the community to be prepared for this announcement of opportunity, because Nasa recognises the immense amount of work involved in preparing proposals for this potential future exploration.\" The announcement is intended to provide notice of a two-step competition for experiments. Science teams are expected to put together proposals which would be evaluated by experts working for Nasa. About 10 proposals could be selected to go forward to the next stage. Last year, in response to a congressional directive, Nasa outlined its concept for how a landing mission would work. The report calls for a four-legged lander that would hunt for evidence of microbial life on Europa's surface. It would touch down with the help of the Sky Crane system used to deliver the Curiosity rover to Mars in 2012, but would use a much longer tether to minimise contamination of the Europan surface with rocket fuel. The lander would carry some heritage from Nasa's Phoenix lander, which touched down in Mars' \"arctic\" in May 2008. That mission used a motorised cutting tool called a rasp to break up the hard, icy soil along with a scooper to retrieve the samples for analysis. The Europa lander will carry a counter-rotating saw in addition to Phoenix's flight-tested rasp and scoop. Scientists want to dig at least 10cm below the radiation-processed ice, but comparatively little is known about Europa's surface properties. With temperatures that dip to -170C, however, engineers have to prepare for the eventuality of steel-hard ice that resists Nasa's best efforts to dig through. However, scientists believe that if there is any life near the surface, they could detect it at concentrations of at least 100 microbial cells per cubic centimetre of ice. Although Europa's icy outer shell is thought to be tens of kilometres thick, studying the surface could provide clues to what's going on deep below. Warm blobs of ice, or diapirs, could well up from the ocean-ice shell interface, eventually reaching the surface over thousands of years - carrying any evidence of microbial life with them. Earlier this year, Nasa programme scientist Curt Niebur told me: \"The lander is all about hitting the freshest, most pristine sample possible. One way to do that is to dig deep, another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface - like a plume - that's dropping very fresh material onto the surface.\" The Hubble telescope has provided tentative evidence for geysers that spew ice out into space from deep beneath Europa's surface. The lander would follow several years after a flyby mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s.

NASA is already working on a $2 billion mission known as Europa Clipper, which will orbit Jupiter and study Europa over the course of dozens of close flybys. The main goals of that mission, which is currently targeted for launch in the early 2020s, involve investigating the structure and composition of Europa and gauging the habitability of its subsurface ocean. In late 2015, Congress requested that NASA study the possibility of adding a lander component to the Europa project. The space agency has since concluded that the lander would be a separate spacecraft that would launch toward the Jupiter system on its own, not with Clipper. But the lander is still just a concept, not an approved mission. And its odds of getting off the ground are tough to gauge; the White House did not allocate any money to a Europa lander in its preliminary 2018 budget request, which was released in March. However, NASA has money in its 2017 budget to fund the \"announcement of opportunity\" activities, agency officials said. The lander-instrument competition will be a two-step process. About 10 proposals will likely be chosen to advance to \"Phase A\"; the investigators behind those proposals will each get about $1.5 million to develop their ideas for 12 months, NASA officials said. \"At the conclusion of these studies, NASA may select some of these concepts to complete Phase A and subsequent mission phases,\" the officials wrote in the same statement.

According to NASA, however, this is fake news. \"An independent fringe researcher presented a paper at this conference a couple of weeks ago that suggested maybe NASA and ESA could work together,\" a NASA spokesman told Fox News. \"It is not the case at all that the two agencies are pursuing a lander mission together .\" \"The submarine is not a part of any approved mission-yet,\" Impey said. \"There is a prototype design, but it is far from being folded into a funded mission. It would be the most direct and exciting way to search for life if it ever moves forward.\" One of Jupiter's 67 moons, Europa has an ocean of liquid water hidden beneath its icy crust. This crust, which NASA estimates to be 10-15 miles thick, shields the water from Jupiter's harsh radiation belts, which makes it one of the best candidates in the solar system for hosting life. \"We think it has all the ingredients that life requires - a large ocean of liquid water, the right chemical elements, and sufficient energy sources,\" Dr. Cynthia Phillips, a Europa scientist working on the Lander concept at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said. \"But just because life could exist on Europa doesn't mean that life does exist there - that's why we need to go there with a mission like a Europa lander to search for direct evidence of life.\" According to a 264-page report the space agency released earlier this year, a lander would launch around 2024 and use retrorockets and a sky crane to touch down on Europa's surface at some point in 2031. It would then dig down at least ten centimeters below the surface to extract samples of the icy crust that have been shielded from radiation. The lander would then analyze the samples' organic and inorganic contents using a powerful microscope capable of distinguishing microbial cells as small as 0.2. microns in diameter. Researchers are also working on an autonomous submarine, developed as part of multi-million dollar grant from NASA, called ARTEMIS. The sub, which is nearly 14 feet long and weighs 2,800 pounds, would be used to explore the pitch-black waters underneath the Europan ice. Stone Aerospace, who developed and ran tests on the sub in Antarctica back in 2015, are also developing a nuclear-powered cryobot to laser through the 10-15 miles of icy crust. Currently, the bot's maximum penetration rate is around 72 feet of ice per hour. While exciting, deploying the tech on Europa won't happen for a long time. Adds Phillips, \"A mission that can melt or drill through Europa's ice to access the ocean directly, perhaps with a submarine like ARTEMIS, is unfortunately a long way off.\"However, just because the two space agencies aren't joining forces doesn't mean that the Europa lander mission isn't going to happen. Despite the Trump administration cutting the mission from the budget, the NASA spokesman explained that the concept is still under consideration and could go forward at a future time. Jupiter's radiation puts the mission under the gun in terms of time. Housed within a radiation vault, the lander can only survive for about 20 days on Europa's surface. \"The harsh radiation environment severely limits the lifetime of a mission to Europa's surface, meaning that all the science has to be accomplished on a timeline of less than a month,\" Phillips told Foxnews.com. Contamination is also a big concern - the spacecraft itself must be sterilized to avoid contaminating the surface with terrestrial microbes. And, according to Phillips, these aren't even the biggest challenges. \"Perhaps the biggest technical challenge is in developing instruments that will be able to detect signs of life,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, we don't have a Star Trek-style tricorder that we can just point at the surface!\" The Trump administration's 2018 federal budget blueprint might have cut the lander mission, but it did leave funding for continued development of NASA's Europa Clipper mission. Scheduled to launch sometime around 2022, the Clipper spacecraft will travel the five years it takes to get to Europa, then fly by the moon 40-45 times to take high resolution images of the moon's icy surface. NASA researchers will then be able to get a better idea of Europa's composition and structure. \"The challenges for the Europa Clipper are the long duration flight, getting enough power so far from the Sun, and the intense radiation environment,\" astrobiology expert Dr. Christopher Impey of the University of Arizona told Foxnews.com. \"The radiation could make the spacecraft toast in a few months. So it will mostly be in Jupiter orbit, protected by Jupiter's magnetic field, and make occasional forays for a week at a time to do multiple passes of Europa and map it.\" Impey also points out that the Clipper instruments will only measure the potential habitability of the moon, not actually detect life. For that, we need the lander. But what would happen if NASA actually did discover life in the salty waters beneath the moon ice? \"If NASA does find life on Europa, this would be a huge scientific accomplishment, and potentially change our understanding of our place in the universe,\" Cynthia Phillips said. \"If life started not just once, but twice, in our very own solar system, then it becomes more probable that a large fraction of the exoplanets that we now know orbit other stars could also be inhabited. The answer could be earth-shaking!\" While acknowledging that the discovery would be dramatic, Impey had to bring the party down. \"The instruments can't look for DNA or RNA, only show that a metabolism is at work,\" he said, \"so it's not a slam dunk detection of Biology 2.0.\" ", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/nasa-says-joint-europa-mission-not-accurate"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Maps Out Possible Lander Mission to Jupiter Moon Europa", "date": "2017-02-10", "content": "A potential NASA life-hunting mission to the surface of Jupiter's ocean- harboring moon Europa is really starting to take shape.

These primary instruments would include an \"organic compositional analyzer,\" a microscope system and a \"vibrational spectrometer,\" stated the report, which was submitted to NASA on Tuesday. \"The science return possible from the model payload is such that, if life is present in Europa's ice at a level comparable to one of the most extreme and desolate of environments on Earth, then this mission could detect life in Europa's icy surface,\" the report's authors wrote. Hunting for alien life would be the mission's primary goal. But it would also seek to assess the habitability of the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath Europa's icy shell, and to characterize the moon's surface and near- surface environments to help enable future robotic missions. Astrobiologists regard the 1,900-mile-wide Europa as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Not only does the satellite host an ocean, but that ocean is thought to be in contact with Europa's rocky mantle, making possible all sorts of interesting chemical reactions. Scientists are eager to learn if Europa's huge subsurface ocean harbors alien life. See how Jupiter's icy moon Europa works in this SPACE.com infographic. NASA is already developing a flyby mission to Europa, which is scheduled to launch in the 2020s. This solar- powered spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and assess the moon's habitability during the course of 45 close encounters with Europa. In late 2015, Congress ordered NASA to add a surface component to the Europa mission. The agency is currently studying the best ways to make this happen; the new SDT report is part of that process. The current vision for the lander calls for it to be launched separately from the Europa flyby probe, according to the SDT report. The lander and a \"carrier relay orbiter\" would lift off atop NASA's in-development Space Launch System megarocket as early as 2024. The mission would reach Jupiter about five years later, then perform a series of Jovian moon flybys over the next 1.5 years to prepare for arrival at Europa, the SDT report's authors wrote. Once the mission got there, the CRO would stay in Europa orbit. The lander would touch down on the Jovian moon using retrorockets and a \" sky crane \" like the one that lowered NASA's Curiosity rover onto the Martian surface in August 2012. The lander would operate for at least 20 days, until its batteries died. The craft would collect samples from at least 4 inches beneath the Europan surface, to get material that hadn't been destroyed or transformed by the harsh radiation bombarding the moon. It would then relay the data back to Earth via the CRO. The Europan radiation environment would likely limit the CRO's lifetime to about 30 days, according to the SDT team's report, \"thus making a longer-lived lander mission difficult to justify.\" The lander would be quite busy during its brief operational life, as its proposed instrument payload indicates. \"Along with the analytical suite for detailed analyses of samples, the Europa Lander model payload also includes a pair of color stereo imagers for examining the landing site in 3D, and a seismic package for determining Europa's ice shell and ocean thickness through acoustic monitoring of cracking events in the ice shell,\" the SDT report states. The SDT report is far from the last word on the Europa lander mission, which remains just a concept at the moment. For example, NASA will host town hall meetings at two upcoming scientific conferences - one in March and one in April - to get feedback from researchers about the SDT team's findings and recommendations.

Early last year, NASA's Planetary Science Division started assessing the science value and engineering design of a future mission to Europa. In June 2016, a 21-person team assembled to create a report for the mission concept. According to the report, the mission has three goals: To search for evidence of alien life on Europa, to assess its habitability, and to characterize the surface and subsurface for future explorations to this moon and its ocean. The team also had to develop a strategy for finding life - a first for NASA since the Mars Viking missions over 40 years ago. Europa is also one of only two places where the ocean is in contact with a rocky seafloor, which makes Europa a high-priority target for searching for signs of extraterrestrial life.

Some testing of spacecraft components, including solar cells and science instrument detectors, has already been underway during Phase A, and this work is planned to continue into Phase B. In addition, during Phase B subsystem vendors will be selected, as well as prototype hardware elements for the science instruments. Spacecraft subassemblies will be built and tested as well. The Europa mission spacecraft is being planned for launch in the 2020s, arriving in the Jupiter system after a journey of several years. The spacecraft would orbit Jupiter as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa. The mission plan includes 40 to 45 flybys in the prime mission, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell. The life cycle of a NASA science mission includes several key phases. At each step, missions must successfully demonstrate that they have met the agency's requirements in order to indicate readiness to move forward into the next phase.

The spacecraft will perform up to 45 flybys of Europa during the prime mission, at altitudes varying from 1,700 miles to 16 miles (2,700 kilometers to 25 kilometers) above the surface. The Europa mission spacecraft will study the icy moon's surface at high resolution and investigate the composition and structure of its icy shell and interior. A thermal instrument will study Europa's frozen surface in search of recent eruptions of liquid water at or near the surface, while other instruments will search for evidence of water and tiny particles in the moon's thin atmosphere. In 2012, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted water vapor above the south polar region of Europa, providing possible evidence of water plumes. If the plume do exist, and they're connected to a subsurface ocean, studying their composition would aid scientists in studying the chemical makeup of Europa's potentially habitable environment without having to drill through layers of ice.

In a presentation at a meeting of the Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science at the National Academies here March 29, Barry Goldstein of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that ongoing studies of the proposed lander are continuing, including a mission concept review scheduled for June. \"We still have enough funding to make it through the end of the year for development,\" he said. \"We're going to pursue the mission concept review and let the chips fall where they may as we proceed.\" The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget blueprint, released March 16, proposed a record-high $1.9 billion for NASA's planetary science program, including support for the Europa Clipper mission that will go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of flybys of Europa. However, the document explicitly ruled out funding for the follow-on lander mission. \"To preserve the balance of NASA's science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community, the Budget provides no funding for a multi-billion- dollar mission to land on Europa,\" the document stated. The lander mission, along with Europa Clipper, has enjoyed strong support from Congress, notably from Rep. John Culberson, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and an advocate of exploration of the icy moon that scientists believe is potentially habitable. Culberson, in recent years, has provided funding for Europa Clipper well above any administration request and at one point called for launching both Europa Clipper and the lander simultaneously. Culberson did not mention the budget proposal in brief comments at the end of the public lecture about Europa exploration here March 29, but did reiterate his support for sending both orbiter and lander missions there. He said he reached final agreement with fellow appropriators for a fiscal year 2017 spending bill that must be passed by April 28, when the continuing resolution that currently funds NASA and other federal agencies at 2016 levels expires. He didn't provide details about the contents of that bill, which has not yet been formally introduced, but said, \"You'll be very pleased with the result.\" Goldstein, at the committee meeting, said the funding the proposed mission has received has helped make major progress on its design. \"We've done an enormous amount of not only technical design, but also programmatic design, evaluating the capabilities and how long it will take to make this mission come to fruition,\" he said. That design, he said, permits a launch no earlier than October to December of 2025 on a Space Launch System rocket. No other launch vehicles, he said, have the performance to launch the lander mission, and even an SLS launch requires the use of an Earth gravity assist that would send the spacecraft to Jupiter, arriving in mid-2030. The choice of launch vehicle and trajectory is driven by the spacecraft's mass of 16.6 metric tons. By comparison, he said, Europa Clipper weighs 6 metric tons, and will be the largest spacecraft JPL has built to date. \"Almost all of that mass is either liquid of solid propellant\" to place the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter and then Europa, and for the landing itself, he said. The lander itself will be able to accommodate a payload of 42.5 kilograms of science instruments, with a notional suite of five instruments proposed by scientists in a report released in February. Those instruments would support the goals of looking for evidence of life on Europa, assess its habitability and characterize the moon to support future missions there. The lander will use a \"skycrane\" landing system similar to that employed to the Mars Curiosity lander. Goldstein said early concepts of the lander looked similar to the 1990s Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, with petals to stabilize the spacecraft. \"The team looked at that quite a bit and realized... that it was very susceptible to 'pathological' landing cases that would end the mission,\" he said, referring to the jagged terrain seen on much of the moon's icy surface. The lander will instead use what Goldstein described as the \"cricket\" design, with four landing legs in lieu of petals. The battery-powered spacecraft is designed for a 20-day mission after landing, although that could be extended depending on how many samples the spacecraft collects and processes with its robotic arm. At the end of the mission, the spacecraft will self-destruct using a \"thermite-based incinerator\" to comply with planetary protection requirements. That system can also be triggered if the spacecraft loses contact with the Earth. \"Like in 'Mission Impossible,' we'll hit the self-destruct button and sterilize,\" he said.

The jovian satellite has a deep subsurface ocean beneath its ice crust and is considered one of the top targets in the search for alien life. After decades of work, a pair of missions to the moon have been taking shape - and have secured crucial support in Congress. Scientists hope the lander could be launched some time in the 2020s. Although Nasa has yet to approve the mission, the agency said it had funding to begin the search for instrument ideas. Europa: Our best shot at finding alien life? \"The possibility of placing a lander on the surface of this intriguing icy moon, touching and exploring a world that might harbour life is at the heart of the Europa lander mission,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. \"We want the community to be prepared for this announcement of opportunity, because Nasa recognises the immense amount of work involved in preparing proposals for this potential future exploration.\" The announcement is intended to provide notice of a two-step competition for experiments. Science teams are expected to put together proposals which would be evaluated by experts working for Nasa. About 10 proposals could be selected to go forward to the next stage. Last year, in response to a congressional directive, Nasa outlined its concept for how a landing mission would work. The report calls for a four-legged lander that would hunt for evidence of microbial life on Europa's surface. It would touch down with the help of the Sky Crane system used to deliver the Curiosity rover to Mars in 2012, but would use a much longer tether to minimise contamination of the Europan surface with rocket fuel. The lander would carry some heritage from Nasa's Phoenix lander, which touched down in Mars' \"arctic\" in May 2008. That mission used a motorised cutting tool called a rasp to break up the hard, icy soil along with a scooper to retrieve the samples for analysis. The Europa lander will carry a counter-rotating saw in addition to Phoenix's flight-tested rasp and scoop. Scientists want to dig at least 10cm below the radiation-processed ice, but comparatively little is known about Europa's surface properties. With temperatures that dip to -170C, however, engineers have to prepare for the eventuality of steel-hard ice that resists Nasa's best efforts to dig through. However, scientists believe that if there is any life near the surface, they could detect it at concentrations of at least 100 microbial cells per cubic centimetre of ice. Although Europa's icy outer shell is thought to be tens of kilometres thick, studying the surface could provide clues to what's going on deep below. Warm blobs of ice, or diapirs, could well up from the ocean-ice shell interface, eventually reaching the surface over thousands of years - carrying any evidence of microbial life with them. Earlier this year, Nasa programme scientist Curt Niebur told me: \"The lander is all about hitting the freshest, most pristine sample possible. One way to do that is to dig deep, another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface - like a plume - that's dropping very fresh material onto the surface.\" The Hubble telescope has provided tentative evidence for geysers that spew ice out into space from deep beneath Europa's surface. The lander would follow several years after a flyby mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s.

Yesterday, the space agency issued a \"community announcement\" about the possible Europa lander mission, telling researchers to get ready for an upcoming science-instrument competition. \"The possibility of placing a lander on the surface of this intriguing icy moon, touching and exploring a world that might harbor life, is at the heart of the Europa lander mission,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. \"We want the community to be prepared for this announcement of opportunity, because NASA recognizes the immense amount of work involved in preparing proposals for this potential future exploration,\" Zurbuchen added. NASA is already working on a $2 billion mission known as Europa Clipper, which will orbit Jupiter and study Europa over the course of dozens of close flybys. The main goals of that mission, which is currently targeted for launch in the early 2020s, involve investigating the structure and composition of Europa and gauging the habitability of its subsurface ocean. In late 2015, Congress requested that NASA study the possibility of adding a lander component to the Europa project. The space agency has since concluded that the lander would be a separate spacecraft that would launch toward the Jupiter system on its own, not with Clipper. But the lander is still just a concept, not an approved mission. And its odds of getting off the ground are tough to gauge; the White House did not allocate any money to a Europa lander in its preliminary 2018 budget request, which was released in March. However, NASA has money in its 2017 budget to fund the \"announcement of opportunity\" activities, agency officials said. The lander-instrument competition will be a two-step process. About 10 proposals will likely be chosen to advance to \"Phase A\"; the investigators behind those proposals will each get about $1.5 million to develop their ideas for 12 months, NASA officials said. \"At the conclusion of these studies, NASA may select some of these concepts to complete Phase A and subsequent mission phases,\" the officials wrote in the same statement.

According to NASA, however, this is fake news. \"An independent fringe researcher presented a paper at this conference a couple of weeks ago that suggested maybe NASA and ESA could work together,\" a NASA spokesman told Fox News. \"It is not the case at all that the two agencies are pursuing a lander mission together .\" \"The submarine is not a part of any approved mission-yet,\" Impey said. \"There is a prototype design, but it is far from being folded into a funded mission. It would be the most direct and exciting way to search for life if it ever moves forward.\" One of Jupiter's 67 moons, Europa has an ocean of liquid water hidden beneath its icy crust. This crust, which NASA estimates to be 10-15 miles thick, shields the water from Jupiter's harsh radiation belts, which makes it one of the best candidates in the solar system for hosting life. \"We think it has all the ingredients that life requires - a large ocean of liquid water, the right chemical elements, and sufficient energy sources,\" Dr. Cynthia Phillips, a Europa scientist working on the Lander concept at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said. \"But just because life could exist on Europa doesn't mean that life does exist there - that's why we need to go there with a mission like a Europa lander to search for direct evidence of life.\" According to a 264-page report the space agency released earlier this year, a lander would launch around 2024 and use retrorockets and a sky crane to touch down on Europa's surface at some point in 2031. It would then dig down at least ten centimeters below the surface to extract samples of the icy crust that have been shielded from radiation. The lander would then analyze the samples' organic and inorganic contents using a powerful microscope capable of distinguishing microbial cells as small as 0.2. microns in diameter. Researchers are also working on an autonomous submarine, developed as part of multi-million dollar grant from NASA, called ARTEMIS. The sub, which is nearly 14 feet long and weighs 2,800 pounds, would be used to explore the pitch-black waters underneath the Europan ice. Stone Aerospace, who developed and ran tests on the sub in Antarctica back in 2015, are also developing a nuclear-powered cryobot to laser through the 10-15 miles of icy crust. Currently, the bot's maximum penetration rate is around 72 feet of ice per hour. While exciting, deploying the tech on Europa won't happen for a long time. Adds Phillips, \"A mission that can melt or drill through Europa's ice to access the ocean directly, perhaps with a submarine like ARTEMIS, is unfortunately a long way off.\"However, just because the two space agencies aren't joining forces doesn't mean that the Europa lander mission isn't going to happen. Despite the Trump administration cutting the mission from the budget, the NASA spokesman explained that the concept is still under consideration and could go forward at a future time. Jupiter's radiation puts the mission under the gun in terms of time. Housed within a radiation vault, the lander can only survive for about 20 days on Europa's surface. \"The harsh radiation environment severely limits the lifetime of a mission to Europa's surface, meaning that all the science has to be accomplished on a timeline of less than a month,\" Phillips told Foxnews.com. Contamination is also a big concern - the spacecraft itself must be sterilized to avoid contaminating the surface with terrestrial microbes. And, according to Phillips, these aren't even the biggest challenges. \"Perhaps the biggest technical challenge is in developing instruments that will be able to detect signs of life,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, we don't have a Star Trek-style tricorder that we can just point at the surface!\" The Trump administration's 2018 federal budget blueprint might have cut the lander mission, but it did leave funding for continued development of NASA's Europa Clipper mission. Scheduled to launch sometime around 2022, the Clipper spacecraft will travel the five years it takes to get to Europa, then fly by the moon 40-45 times to take high resolution images of the moon's icy surface. NASA researchers will then be able to get a better idea of Europa's composition and structure. \"The challenges for the Europa Clipper are the long duration flight, getting enough power so far from the Sun, and the intense radiation environment,\" astrobiology expert Dr. Christopher Impey of the University of Arizona told Foxnews.com. \"The radiation could make the spacecraft toast in a few months. So it will mostly be in Jupiter orbit, protected by Jupiter's magnetic field, and make occasional forays for a week at a time to do multiple passes of Europa and map it.\" Impey also points out that the Clipper instruments will only measure the potential habitability of the moon, not actually detect life. For that, we need the lander. But what would happen if NASA actually did discover life in the salty waters beneath the moon ice? \"If NASA does find life on Europa, this would be a huge scientific accomplishment, and potentially change our understanding of our place in the universe,\" Cynthia Phillips said. \"If life started not just once, but twice, in our very own solar system, then it becomes more probable that a large fraction of the exoplanets that we now know orbit other stars could also be inhabited. The answer could be earth-shaking!\" While acknowledging that the discovery would be dramatic, Impey had to bring the party down. \"The instruments can't look for DNA or RNA, only show that a metabolism is at work,\" he said, \"so it's not a slam dunk detection of Biology 2.0.\" ", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/nasa-says-joint-europa-mission-not-accurate"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA officially names its Europa mission", "date": "2017-03-07", "content": "NASA has been busy readying a mission to Europa, Jupiter's third largest moon.

In a presentation at a meeting of the Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science at the National Academies here March 29, Barry Goldstein of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that ongoing studies of the proposed lander are continuing, including a mission concept review scheduled for June. \"We still have enough funding to make it through the end of the year for development,\" he said. \"We're going to pursue the mission concept review and let the chips fall where they may as we proceed.\" The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget blueprint, released March 16, proposed a record-high $1.9 billion for NASA's planetary science program, including support for the Europa Clipper mission that will go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of flybys of Europa. However, the document explicitly ruled out funding for the follow-on lander mission. \"To preserve the balance of NASA's science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community, the Budget provides no funding for a multi-billion- dollar mission to land on Europa,\" the document stated. The lander mission, along with Europa Clipper, has enjoyed strong support from Congress, notably from Rep. John Culberson, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and an advocate of exploration of the icy moon that scientists believe is potentially habitable. Culberson, in recent years, has provided funding for Europa Clipper well above any administration request and at one point called for launching both Europa Clipper and the lander simultaneously. Culberson did not mention the budget proposal in brief comments at the end of the public lecture about Europa exploration here March 29, but did reiterate his support for sending both orbiter and lander missions there. He said he reached final agreement with fellow appropriators for a fiscal year 2017 spending bill that must be passed by April 28, when the continuing resolution that currently funds NASA and other federal agencies at 2016 levels expires. He didn't provide details about the contents of that bill, which has not yet been formally introduced, but said, \"You'll be very pleased with the result.\" Goldstein, at the committee meeting, said the funding the proposed mission has received has helped make major progress on its design. \"We've done an enormous amount of not only technical design, but also programmatic design, evaluating the capabilities and how long it will take to make this mission come to fruition,\" he said. That design, he said, permits a launch no earlier than October to December of 2025 on a Space Launch System rocket. No other launch vehicles, he said, have the performance to launch the lander mission, and even an SLS launch requires the use of an Earth gravity assist that would send the spacecraft to Jupiter, arriving in mid-2030. The choice of launch vehicle and trajectory is driven by the spacecraft's mass of 16.6 metric tons. By comparison, he said, Europa Clipper weighs 6 metric tons, and will be the largest spacecraft JPL has built to date. \"Almost all of that mass is either liquid of solid propellant\" to place the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter and then Europa, and for the landing itself, he said. The lander itself will be able to accommodate a payload of 42.5 kilograms of science instruments, with a notional suite of five instruments proposed by scientists in a report released in February. Those instruments would support the goals of looking for evidence of life on Europa, assess its habitability and characterize the moon to support future missions there. The lander will use a \"skycrane\" landing system similar to that employed to the Mars Curiosity lander. Goldstein said early concepts of the lander looked similar to the 1990s Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, with petals to stabilize the spacecraft. \"The team looked at that quite a bit and realized... that it was very susceptible to 'pathological' landing cases that would end the mission,\" he said, referring to the jagged terrain seen on much of the moon's icy surface. The lander will instead use what Goldstein described as the \"cricket\" design, with four landing legs in lieu of petals. The battery-powered spacecraft is designed for a 20-day mission after landing, although that could be extended depending on how many samples the spacecraft collects and processes with its robotic arm. At the end of the mission, the spacecraft will self-destruct using a \"thermite-based incinerator\" to comply with planetary protection requirements. That system can also be triggered if the spacecraft loses contact with the Earth. \"Like in 'Mission Impossible,' we'll hit the self-destruct button and sterilize,\" he said.

The jovian satellite has a deep subsurface ocean beneath its ice crust and is considered one of the top targets in the search for alien life. After decades of work, a pair of missions to the moon have been taking shape - and have secured crucial support in Congress. Scientists hope the lander could be launched some time in the 2020s. Although Nasa has yet to approve the mission, the agency said it had funding to begin the search for instrument ideas. Europa: Our best shot at finding alien life? \"The possibility of placing a lander on the surface of this intriguing icy moon, touching and exploring a world that might harbour life is at the heart of the Europa lander mission,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. \"We want the community to be prepared for this announcement of opportunity, because Nasa recognises the immense amount of work involved in preparing proposals for this potential future exploration.\" The announcement is intended to provide notice of a two-step competition for experiments. Science teams are expected to put together proposals which would be evaluated by experts working for Nasa. About 10 proposals could be selected to go forward to the next stage. Last year, in response to a congressional directive, Nasa outlined its concept for how a landing mission would work. The report calls for a four-legged lander that would hunt for evidence of microbial life on Europa's surface. It would touch down with the help of the Sky Crane system used to deliver the Curiosity rover to Mars in 2012, but would use a much longer tether to minimise contamination of the Europan surface with rocket fuel. The lander would carry some heritage from Nasa's Phoenix lander, which touched down in Mars' \"arctic\" in May 2008. That mission used a motorised cutting tool called a rasp to break up the hard, icy soil along with a scooper to retrieve the samples for analysis. The Europa lander will carry a counter-rotating saw in addition to Phoenix's flight-tested rasp and scoop. Scientists want to dig at least 10cm below the radiation-processed ice, but comparatively little is known about Europa's surface properties. With temperatures that dip to -170C, however, engineers have to prepare for the eventuality of steel-hard ice that resists Nasa's best efforts to dig through. However, scientists believe that if there is any life near the surface, they could detect it at concentrations of at least 100 microbial cells per cubic centimetre of ice. Although Europa's icy outer shell is thought to be tens of kilometres thick, studying the surface could provide clues to what's going on deep below. Warm blobs of ice, or diapirs, could well up from the ocean-ice shell interface, eventually reaching the surface over thousands of years - carrying any evidence of microbial life with them. Earlier this year, Nasa programme scientist Curt Niebur told me: \"The lander is all about hitting the freshest, most pristine sample possible. One way to do that is to dig deep, another way is going to where there is some kind of eruption on the surface - like a plume - that's dropping very fresh material onto the surface.\" The Hubble telescope has provided tentative evidence for geysers that spew ice out into space from deep beneath Europa's surface. The lander would follow several years after a flyby mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s.

NASA is already working on a $2 billion mission known as Europa Clipper, which will orbit Jupiter and study Europa over the course of dozens of close flybys. The main goals of that mission, which is currently targeted for launch in the early 2020s, involve investigating the structure and composition of Europa and gauging the habitability of its subsurface ocean. In late 2015, Congress requested that NASA study the possibility of adding a lander component to the Europa project. The space agency has since concluded that the lander would be a separate spacecraft that would launch toward the Jupiter system on its own, not with Clipper. But the lander is still just a concept, not an approved mission. And its odds of getting off the ground are tough to gauge; the White House did not allocate any money to a Europa lander in its preliminary 2018 budget request, which was released in March. However, NASA has money in its 2017 budget to fund the \"announcement of opportunity\" activities, agency officials said. The lander-instrument competition will be a two-step process. About 10 proposals will likely be chosen to advance to \"Phase A\"; the investigators behind those proposals will each get about $1.5 million to develop their ideas for 12 months, NASA officials said. \"At the conclusion of these studies, NASA may select some of these concepts to complete Phase A and subsequent mission phases,\" the officials wrote in the same statement.

It would be the most direct and exciting way to search for life if it ever moves forward.\" One of Jupiter's 67 moons, Europa has an ocean of liquid water hidden beneath its icy crust. This crust, which NASA estimates to be 10-15 miles thick, shields the water from Jupiter's harsh radiation belts, which makes it one of the best candidates in the solar system for hosting life. \"We think it has all the ingredients that life requires - a large ocean of liquid water, the right chemical elements, and sufficient energy sources,\" Dr. Cynthia Phillips, a Europa scientist working on the Lander concept at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said. \"But just because life could exist on Europa doesn't mean that life does exist there - that's why we need to go there with a mission like a Europa lander to search for direct evidence of life.\" According to a 264-page report the space agency released earlier this year, a lander would launch around 2024 and use retrorockets and a sky crane to touch down on Europa's surface at some point in 2031. It would then dig down at least ten centimeters below the surface to extract samples of the icy crust that have been shielded from radiation. The lander would then analyze the samples' organic and inorganic contents using a powerful microscope capable of distinguishing microbial cells as small as 0.2. microns in diameter. Researchers are also working on an autonomous submarine, developed as part of multi-million dollar grant from NASA, called ARTEMIS. The sub, which is nearly 14 feet long and weighs 2,800 pounds, would be used to explore the pitch-black waters underneath the Europan ice. Stone Aerospace, who developed and ran tests on the sub in Antarctica back in 2015, are also developing a nuclear-powered cryobot to laser through the 10-15 miles of icy crust. Currently, the bot's maximum penetration rate is around 72 feet of ice per hour. While exciting, deploying the tech on Europa won't happen for a long time. Adds Phillips, \"A mission that can melt or drill through Europa's ice to access the ocean directly, perhaps with a submarine like ARTEMIS, is unfortunately a long way off.\"However, just because the two space agencies aren't joining forces doesn't mean that the Europa lander mission isn't going to happen. Despite the Trump administration cutting the mission from the budget, the NASA spokesman explained that the concept is still under consideration and could go forward at a future time. Jupiter's radiation puts the mission under the gun in terms of time. Housed within a radiation vault, the lander can only survive for about 20 days on Europa's surface. \"The harsh radiation environment severely limits the lifetime of a mission to Europa's surface, meaning that all the science has to be accomplished on a timeline of less than a month,\" Phillips told Foxnews.com. Contamination is also a big concern - the spacecraft itself must be sterilized to avoid contaminating the surface with terrestrial microbes. And, according to Phillips, these aren't even the biggest challenges. \"Perhaps the biggest technical challenge is in developing instruments that will be able to detect signs of life,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, we don't have a Star Trek-style tricorder that we can just point at the surface!\" The Trump administration's 2018 federal budget blueprint might have cut the lander mission, but it did leave funding for continued development of NASA's Europa Clipper mission. Scheduled to launch sometime around 2022, the Clipper spacecraft will travel the five years it takes to get to Europa, then fly by the moon 40-45 times to take high resolution images of the moon's icy surface. NASA researchers will then be able to get a better idea of Europa's composition and structure. \"The challenges for the Europa Clipper are the long duration flight, getting enough power so far from the Sun, and the intense radiation environment,\" astrobiology expert Dr. Christopher Impey of the University of Arizona told Foxnews.com. \"The radiation could make the spacecraft toast in a few months. So it will mostly be in Jupiter orbit, protected by Jupiter's magnetic field, and make occasional forays for a week at a time to do multiple passes of Europa and map it.\" Impey also points out that the Clipper instruments will only measure the potential habitability of the moon, not actually detect life. For that, we need the lander. But what would happen if NASA actually did discover life in the salty waters beneath the moon ice? \"If NASA does find life on Europa, this would be a huge scientific accomplishment, and potentially change our understanding of our place in the universe,\" Cynthia Phillips said. \"If life started not just once, but twice, in our very own solar system, then it becomes more probable that a large fraction of the exoplanets that we now know orbit other stars could also be inhabited. The answer could be earth-shaking!\" While acknowledging that the discovery would be dramatic, Impey had to bring the party down. \"The instruments can't look for DNA or RNA, only show that a metabolism is at work,\" he said, \"so it's not a slam dunk detection of Biology 2.0.\" ", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/nasa-says-joint-europa-mission-not-accurate"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Nasa seeks experiment ideas for Europa lander", "date": "2017-05-18", "content": "Nasa is seeking the best ideas for experiments to fly on a mission that will land on Jupiter's moon Europa.

At a meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group Sept. 6 in La Jolla, California, Curt Niebur, a program scientist in the planetary science division at NASA Headquarters, said mission planners are continuing to examine several factors, including mission cost and science return, as they evaluate the design of the mission. The lander mission, he said, successfully passed an early-stage review called a mission concept review in June. However, he said the agency had not settled on a specific, single concept for the mission. \"As a result of that mission concept review, what we want to do is essentially continue exploring the different options we have for a Europa lander mission,\" he said. \"We want to continue balancing the trade amongst risk, cost and science return.\" Concepts for the lander presented earlier this year call for a spacecraft launched on a Space Launch System rocket no earlier than late 2025, arriving at Jupiter in mid-2030 and landing on Europa in late 2031. Most of the spacecraft's estimated mass of 16.6 metric tons is propellant needed to first enter orbit around Jupiter and, later, landing on Europa itself. A report released in February by a NASA-chartered science definition team identified the science goals of the lander, as well as a notional suite of five instruments that could be used to achieve those goals and fit within a payload accommodation on the lander of 42.5 kilograms. The battery-powered spacecraft would operate for about 20 days after landing. \"The SDT report is the starting point,\" Niebur said later in the meeting. \"But accomplishing everything in the SDT report is a very expensive mission. What we'd like to see are some less expensive options.\" That could, he acknowledged, mean looking at missions that perform less science but at a lower cost. \"I firmly believe that you can't make substantial cost reductions and maintain the full science return of this mission,\" he said. \"If you really want to see a more streamlined mission concept, you're going to have to be willing to give up some science. So, yes, science is on the table.\" Kevin Hand, a JPL scientist who was one of the leaders of the SDT, said that could mean changes to both the instrument complement on the lander as well as its operations. \"There are the primary things to consider - instruments, et cetera - and there are the secondary items that are influenced by science,\" he said. One option, Hand said, might be to reduce the number of samples the lander collects from Europa's icy surface for analysis. \"Samples take energy, they take time,\" he said. While cost estimates, both done internally by NASA and externally by the Aerospace Corporation, are being developed, Niebur and others at the OPAG meeting did not disclose what ranges those estimates span. Many in the planetary science community, though, estimate that a full-fledged lander mission may cost several billion dollars. Because that analysis of potential lander options is ongoing, NASA is holding off issuing an announcement of opportunity for instruments that would go on the lander. \"Until we finish that exploration, it's premature to release an AO,\" Niebur said. He suggested that no decisions were imminent on an alternative design for the lander. \"We are reconsidering the trade space. That's not something you do over the span of a week or two,\" he said. A further complication for a Europa lander mission is funding. The administration requested no funding for the mission in its fiscal year 2018 budget request. While the Senate version of an appropriations bill that funds NASA is silent on the mission, the House version included $495 million for both the lander mission and the Europa Clipper multiple-flyby mission that is further along in development. \"We'll wait to see what happens with the FY18 budget to come up with a longer- term plan beyond the next month or so for how we'll proceed with this potential mission,\" Niebur said. Progress is going well on Europa Clipper, Niebur and others said at the OPAG meeting. The mission passed a major project milestone called Key Decision Point B in February, allowing it to enter a preliminary design phase. Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for the mission, said at the OPAG meeting that the mission is on schedule to complete a series of preliminary design reviews by next August. One issue with Europa Clipper that Niebur raised is the growth in resources in the spacecraft's instrument payload. \"It wasn't so much that the resources grew, but it was the amount that they grew,\" he said. The mission, he said, has put into place a \"resource monitoring plan\" to track that growth, and understand what instruments are having issues as early as possible. Power demands from those instruments, though, have led to a design change in the spacecraft. The spacecraft's two solar arrays now consist of four and a half panels each, up from four panels from earlier designs. \"We needed to increase the total size of the arrays slightly in order to accommodate the energy demands of the payload,\" Pappalardo said.

However, he said the agency had not settled on a specific, single concept for the mission. \"As a result of that mission concept review, what we want to do is essentially continue exploring the different options we have for a Europa lander mission,\" he said. \"We want to continue balancing the trade amongst risk, cost and science return.\" Concepts for the lander presented earlier this year call for a spacecraft launched on a Space Launch System rocket no earlier than late 2025, arriving at Jupiter in mid-2030 and landing on Europa in late 2031. Most of the spacecraft's estimated mass of 16.6 metric tons is propellant needed to first enter orbit around Jupiter and, later, landing on Europa itself. A report released in February by a NASA-chartered science definition team identified the science goals of the lander, as well as a notional suite of five instruments that could be used to achieve those goals and fit within a payload accommodation on the lander of 42.5 kilograms. The battery-powered spacecraft would operate for about 20 days after landing. \"The SDT report is the starting point,\" Niebur said later in the meeting. \"But accomplishing everything in the SDT report is a very expensive mission. What we'd like to see are some less expensive options.\" That could, he acknowledged, mean looking at missions that perform less science but at a lower cost. \"I firmly believe that you can't make substantial cost reductions and maintain the full science return of this mission,\" he said. \"If you really want to see a more streamlined mission concept, you're going to have to be willing to give up some science. So, yes, science is on the table.\" Kevin Hand, a JPL scientist who was one of the leaders of the SDT, said that could mean changes to both the instrument complement on the lander as well as its operations. \"There are the primary things to consider - instruments, et cetera - and there are the secondary items that are influenced by science,\" he said. One option, Hand said, might be to reduce the number of samples the lander collects from Europa's icy surface for analysis. \"Samples take energy, they take time,\" he said. While cost estimates, both done internally by NASA and externally by the Aerospace Corporation, are being developed, Niebur and others at the OPAG meeting did not disclose what ranges those estimates span. Many in the planetary science community, though, estimate that a full-fledged lander mission may cost several billion dollars. Because that analysis of potential lander options is ongoing, NASA is holding off issuing an announcement of opportunity for instruments that would go on the lander. \"Until we finish that exploration, it's premature to release an AO,\" Niebur said. He suggested that no decisions were imminent on an alternative design for the lander. \"We are reconsidering the trade space. That's not something you do over the span of a week or two,\" he said. A further complication for a Europa lander mission is funding. The administration requested no funding for the mission in its fiscal year 2018 budget request. While the Senate version of an appropriations bill that funds NASA is silent on the mission, the House version included $495 million for both the lander mission and the Europa Clipper multiple-flyby mission that is further along in development. \"We'll wait to see what happens with the FY18 budget to come up with a longer- term plan beyond the next month or so for how we'll proceed with this potential mission,\" Niebur said. Progress is going well on Europa Clipper, Niebur and others said at the OPAG meeting. The mission passed a major project milestone called Key Decision Point B in February, allowing it to enter a preliminary design phase. Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for the mission, said at the OPAG meeting that the mission is on schedule to complete a series of preliminary design reviews by next August. One issue with Europa Clipper that Niebur raised is the growth in resources in the spacecraft's instrument payload. \"It wasn't so much that the resources grew, but it was the amount that they grew,\" he said. The mission, he said, has put into place a \"resource monitoring plan\" to track that growth, and understand what instruments are having issues as early as possible. Power demands from those instruments, though, have led to a design change in the spacecraft. The spacecraft's two solar arrays now consist of four and a half panels each, up from four panels from earlier designs. \"We needed to increase the total size of the arrays slightly in order to accommodate the energy demands of the payload,\" Pappalardo said.

That might even happen as early as Spring of 2022 and would involve a direct two and a half year transfer to our solar system's largest planet. Over a three and a half year period, the spacecraft would use a long orbit around Jupiter to do 46 reconnaissance flybys of Europa at altitudes varying from 2700 to 25 kilometers above the moon's surface. The aim is to use this three and a half year reconnaissance phase of the mission to search Europa for signs of a subsurface liquid ocean and for habitability. Many astrobiologists still think that this beguiling moon offers the best chance of finding life elsewhere in our solar system. And if NASA launches a follow-on Europa lander mission, astrobiologists may find biological treasure in one of its Europa samples long before a Mars sample-return mission could be attempted. But Europa Clipper really isn't designed to detect life. \"A definite detection with Europa Clipper's instrument suite would require taking a picture of say, a breaching whale and, unfortunately, we just don't think that's very likely,\" Kate Craft, a NASA Europa Clipper project staff scientist and a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab in Maryland, told me. To detect life, a mission to Europa would need several instruments looking for biosignatures in either a plume or subsurface sample, says Craft. \"To say Europa is or was habitable, we'd want to confirm there is an ocean; see evidence of chemistry in the ocean that can be a source of energy for life beneath the ice,\" said Craft. \"And see evidence of ice-ocean exchange processes that could enable chemical mixing.\" Europa is about the size of Earth's moon yet has almost the same amount of water as all of earth's surface water bodies. And as noted here in a previous post, Europa is gravitationally-locked with Jupiter and orbits our solar system's largest planet every 3.5 days. It's thought to have a 100-kilometer-deep salty ocean, with an iron core surrounded by a rocky mantle. However, also as noted here previously, for life to evolve on Europa, it would need liquid water; a handful of essential elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur; and some sort of energy to harness. Don't count on photosynthesis, which would be impossible under such a thick layer of ice. Yet because Europa's orbital distance from Jupiter creates gravitational tides, its seafloor may still be undergoing volcanic or hydrothermal activity that would, in theory, offer any burgeoning subsurface life a steady supply of nutrients via chemical synthesis. That is, energy derived from the interaction of Europa's rocky seafloor and its ocean. The Europa Clipper team hopes that the spacecraft may detect all or part of such activity. Once Europa Clipper goes into its cadence of flybys every two weeks or so, Craft says all of its nine instruments --- which span the wavelength range from ultraviolet to radar as well as a magnetometer to measure magnetic fields --- will collect data at every pass by. And once its observations are complete, it will have made criss-cross measurements of much of Europa. Yet Craft says the Europa Clipper's biggest challenge will be the danger of faults and instrument noise when handling high-radiation once it arrives at Europa. The spacecraft will dip into Europa's radiation with every close flyby. \"The team is reducing this risk tremendously by designing a radiation tolerant vault, testing parts and hardware to high radiation levels, and setting up data collection strategies that will be as robust to faults as possible,\" said Craft. Many American taxpayers may wonder why NASA didn't simply design a mission that also includes a lander. But the idea is that by sending the Europa Clipper first, researchers will be able to assess Europa's habitability, possibly find indicators of life, determine the best places that life might have signatures waiting for discovery, and enable a more robust follow-on biosignature-finding mission. NASA is doing a concept study for a future Europa lander, however. If funded, the lander could see launch as early as the middle of the next decade. Meanwhile, there's the Clipper mission. As for the most exciting thing that Europa Clipper might detect? \"Plumes of icy material that would mean Europa is currently active,\" said Craft. The spacecraft might then be able to fly through the plume and analyze its particles' grain sizes and their composition; particularly looking for salts, hydrogen and carbon concentrations. This would enable the team to determine if the plume had come directly from the ocean underneath the ice or from shallow water bodies within the ice. This would be a fantastic discovery that would indicate the ocean's habitability, says Craft. And assuming the plumes were determined to be long- lived, she says they could also provide locations to be sampled by a follow-on lander or plume collector. And if life is there, says Craft, this follow-on lander mission would come equipped with instruments able to detect it.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2017/12/31/nasa-readies-clipper-mission-to-europa/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA studying less expensive options for Europa lander mission", "date": "2017-09-06", "content": "NASA is continuing to examine various, potentially less expensive options for a mission to land on Jupiter's moon Europa even after completing a recent review, postponing a call for instruments for the spacecraft.

The budget request, which was released Monday, allocates $19.9 billion to NASA in 2019 and lays out some details about the agency's plan to return humans to the moon - a key focus that the Trump administration announced this past December. The request axes five Earth-science missions and one high-profile astrophysics project, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. It continues funding for high-profile planetary projects such as the Mars 2020 rover and Europa Clipper, a $2 billion multiple-flyby mission to the icy moon scheduled to launch in the 2020s - but, just like last year, there's no money for the companion Europa lander that NASA is developing. Still, NASA has every intention of seeing that lander fly, based on NASA Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot's remarks. During his State of NASA address at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama on Monday, Lightfoot took a rhetorical trip to 2030, imagining what NASA will have accomplished by then. Among the envisioned achievements: \"We will have explored Europa and be well on our way to landing a probe there and possibly found biological evidence of life elsewhere in our universe.\" In late 2015, Congress directed NASA to study the possibility of adding a lander to the Clipper mission. The agency has now determined that the best route involves launching the lander separately. The lander remains a concept, not an officially approved mission, but work on its development continues. The current thinking envisions a battery-powered spacecraft with perhaps five science instruments that would operate for about three weeks on the frigid, radiation-blasted Europan surface. It's unclear how much the lander would cost, but estimates put it in the same general price range as the Europa Clipper.

One of the topics the participants discussed was a proposed Europa lander mission. The discussion was intended to focus on the science such a spacecraft could conduct, but inevitably turned to the political support for the multi-billion-dollar mission. While many OPAG attendees seemed to be largely in favor of the mission, a few lone voices warned that the mission did not have broad-based support, either within the rest of the science community or politically. The mission primarily exists because a powerful member of Congress, Rep. John Culberson of Texas, has been very enthusiastic about it, providing substantial support for it in NASA budgets. But the expensive mission was not even evaluated, let alone recommended, in the 2011 planetary science decadal survey, Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2023, that established the current science priorities of the planetary science community. On November 6, Culberson lost his bid for re-election, and those lone voices seem much more prophetic. NASA is currently developing the Europa Clipper spacecraft that will orbit Jupiter and perform numerous swingbys of the icy moon. A version of that mission was prioritized in both the 2001 and 2011 planetary decadal surveys, but it likely wouldn't exist if not for Culberson. As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Culberson pushed back against the Obama Administration's Office of Management and Budget, adding money to the budget for a Europa mission to begin development that wasn't included in NASA's budget request. NASA was essentially caught in the middle of the executive and legislative branches. Culberson was persistent, and eventually OMB approved the start of the mission, which should enter its confirmation phase early next year. Culberson then added language to budget bills calling for a Europa lander as well. John Culberson assumed the chairmanship of the House CJS committee in 2014 and wasted no time in pushing NASA toward Europa. In the fiscal year 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Culberson included $80 million \"for pre- formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey.\" NASA had not requested any funds for a Europa mission, though the agency was funding studies on what such a mission might look like. The following year, Culberson included $100 million in the FY 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act using the same language as the FY14 appropriation. NASA had asked for $15 million in its budget request for \"pre-formulation work on the architecture for a potential Europa mission.\" In FY 2016, NASA requested $30 million to begin formulation activities on a Jupiter Europa mission. Instead, Culberson included $175 million in the FY16 omnibus spending bill for a Europa orbiter with a lander, and stipulated that the mission would be flown in 2022 atop NASA's Space Launch System, a vehicle still under development. In FY 2017, Culberson increased funding for Europa to $275 million and included language in the new omnibus spending bill instructing NASA to fly the orbiter and lander separately, in 2022 and 2024, respectively. NASA had requested only $49.6 million in FY17 for the Europa multiple flyby mission and nothing for a lander mission. Furthermore, NASA's budget request stated that the mission would likely launch \"in the late 2020s,\" and the cost estimates included an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle rather than an SLS, as the costs for an SLS were still unknown. The request did include a number allowing for an accelerated 2022 launch: $194 million for FY17. This funding trajectory is quite remarkable. It is rare that Congress provides money for science activities beyond what the community has requested. In the most recent omnibus, the FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Culberson included $595 million for the orbiter and lander missions, insisting on the use of SLS launch vehicles for both, and adhering to the 2022 and 2024 launch dates. NASA requested only $425 million for the Europa Clipper mission with a later launch date, and nothing for the lander mission. The budget request specifically states that the planetary science decadal survey did not recommend a lander mission at Europa. Again, the request included a number for meeting the 2022 launch mandate. It was the same as the FY18 request, but costs increased dramatically in the following four years compared to the projections for a mission with a later launch date. NASA's FY 2019 budget request included $264.7 million for Europa Clipper and stipulated a 2025 launch date aboard an EELV. Again, there was no request for a Europa lander, and the FY19 number included to achieve a 2022 launch date for Clipper was $565 million. The House passed a CJS appropriations bill this year for FY 2019, though the Senate did not. In the House bill, Culberson included $545 million for Europa Clipper and $195 million for the lander. The bill's language erroneously cited the 2011 decadal survey as recommending a lander to meet science goals at Europa. All dollars are in millions. Several sections of the FY19 budget-including CJS-are currently under a continuing resolution until December 7. Given that the Democratic party won back the majority in the recent elections, Republicans will likely be keen to pass the remaining budget items before the start of the new Congress in January. It isn't clear if the President will sign a budget without money for a wall along the Mexican border, and it is not likely that Republicans can pass a budget bill without Democratic support. As a result, the final FY19 funding for Europa remains in flux. Nevertheless, this funding trajectory is quite remarkable. It is rare that Congress provides money for science activities beyond what the community has requested. To have a congressional champion for a project with no direct ties to his district is even more extraordinary. It is unfortunate that more members of Congress aren't willing to support programs they view as being in the national interest even if they are not necessarily within a parochial interest. It is also worth noting that Culberson appropriated funds for Europa in addition to funds for all the other activities recommended in the decadal survey. That is, Europa did not generally come at the expense of other planetary science priorities. But some difficulties arose from his largesse. Why an orbiter? Why a lander? Why now? Culberson's support for a Europa lander presented a problem for NASA. Europa orbiters have been discussed and studied within the American planetary science community since the 1990s, but a lander is a more recent proposal without such a pedigree. Although it has a core group of fervent supporters and is gaining interest from a broader audience, the lander mission has not been discussed at length by the overall planetary science community. Those recommendations resulted from the committee's concern that a large flagship-class mission like Clipper could experience cost overruns that could impact the rest of the planetary science budget. In August, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine produced a new report that touched on that issue. Titled \"Visions into Voyages for Planetary Sciences in the Decade 2013-2022: A Midterm Review,\" the report is a midterm assessment of NASA's progress at achieving the goals established by the decadal survey. Like the decadal survey, the report is mandated by law. The report found that NASA's planetary science program has made excellent progress at meeting most of the goals established in the decadal survey. It appears to be a very well-run program. The report made a couple of recommendations regarding Europa Clipper: Recommendation: NASA should continue to closely monitor the cost and schedule associated with the Europa Clipper to ensure that it remains executable within the approved life cycle cost range approved at Key Decision Point-B without impacting other missions and priorities as defined by the decision rules in Vision and Voyages. If the LCC exceeds this range, NASA should de-scope the mission in order to remain consistent with the Vision and Voyages decision rules. Those recommendations resulted from the committee's concern that a large flagship-class mission like Clipper could experience cost overruns that could impact the rest of the planetary science budget. In this regard the committee had only to look at the astrophysics program, where cost overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope earned it the nickname \"the telescope that ate astronomy.\" But the planetary science community also remembers how the Mars Science Laboratory-now known as the Curiosity rover-vastly exceeded its cost and schedule baselines, sucking up money that could have been used for other Mars missions. Supporting this recommendation, the committee wrote: \"A lander was not prioritized or discussed in detail in Vision and Voyages, where it was referred to as a 'far term' mission. It also did not undergo a cost and technical evaluation like other large missions prioritized in the decadal survey. Given its cost and its potential impact on the rest of the planetary science program, the committee concluded that the mission should be vetted within the decadal survey process.\" Although not as strong as saying \"don't do the lander mission now,\" it was clear that the committee believed that the lander mission needed much broader scientific support, which could really only come from the decadal survey. Without that support, the mission was vulnerable to cancellation, as Culberson's loss is now demonstrating. According to a study presented to NASA in November of 2017 but not yet completely released, the Europa lander would cost at least $2.67 billion. Considering that such cost estimates are based on early assumptions, this number would very likely grow. Thus, the lander is likely to be at least as expensive as the Mars 2020 rover and the Europa Clipper, and possibly a lot more. In addition, the 2011 decadal survey had recommended that if NASA received additional money for planetary science, the next large strategic mission it pursued should be a mission to an ice giant planet, either Uranus or Neptune, depending upon available trajectories. An \"ice giants\" mission has broad scientific support, but a Europa lander does not Further, the decadal survey prioritized research, technology development, and small- and medium-class missions over flagships. The possibility of launching three flagships in a decade, particularly at a time when the small-class Discovery program and the medium-class New Frontiers program are not meeting the recommended cadence of launches, is counter to the consensus of the planetary science community. So is the Europa lander now doomed? For the near-term, probably yes. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. This entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. First, from a workforce and budget standpoint, NASA is already trying to finish Mars 2020 while ramping up spending on Europa Clipper. Flagship-class missions are often like \"the goat that the snake ate,\" in that their budget profile pushes everything else to the side as the project works its way through development, delaying other initiatives. There are rumors that JPL is already straining to provide sufficient technical staff for both Mars 2020 and Europa Clipper. Developing two flagships concurrently, or \"eating two goats,\" places tremendous pressure on the budget. These are very likely contributing reasons for NASA's continued pushback on Culberson's demand for a 2022 launch date for Clipper, though there may have been technical reasons as well. Trying to launch three flagships in four years, as Culberson's legislation mandated, would be a feat NASA has never attempted before and the budget implications are a little terrifying. If any of the projects encountered significant cost growth, the results could be catastrophic to the planetary science community for at least a decade. Second, the schedule NASA was being forced to follow for the lander would have pushed it into construction before Europa Clipper had even reached Jupiter. That would have locked in engineering decisions and even science observations that might not be ideal based upon what the Clipper actually finds at Europa. What would happen if the Clipper found something scientifically interesting that the lander was not designed to study? What if the Clipper discovered that the best landing site on Europa was not a place that the already-designed lander could reach? There is a logical progression towards planetary missions: flyby, orbit, land, rove. But there is also good reason to have reasonable gaps between each mission so that the science can be assessed and the next mission can be designed to take advantage of what is learned. Assuming that Europa Clipper reaches Europa in the second half of the 2020s, it would make sense to not define a lander design before the end of the 2020s, or ten years from now. That seems like a long time, but if the goal is to do the mission properly, learn the most from the data collected, and provide taxpayers with the best return on their investment, then haste can be a bad way to do things. President Eisenhower was reportedly fond of saying, \"Let's not rush to make our mistakes.\" Third, this entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. Coalitions are time-consuming, unwieldy, and often unsatisfying, but they tend to be far more resilient to unexpected change. This is one of the values of the decadal survey process to the scientific community. NASA has often relied on a small band of powerful stakeholders to ensure its political viability-and thus its funding stream-from the vagaries of governance and competition of other interests, but times are changing. Barbara Mikulski has retired, Bill Nelson is fighting to retain his Senate seat, and several prominent NASA supporters in the House lost their re-election bids this month. Other supporters in Congress will not be here forever, so NASA and the science community should be looking to cultivate relationships with a wide coalition of new and old supporters.

The Planetary Science Division reached extraordinary new budgetary heights at $2.8 billion, again directing significant resources to the Europa Clipper mission and $195 million for a yet-to-be-approved lander. Despite receiving a legislative tongue-lashing on overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA received approval to increase the mission's cost cap by $800 million in addition to continued funds. WFIRST, the follow-on mission to JWST, was rescued from cancellation and received a strong $312 million funding commitment for 2019. NASA's Education Division-originally zeroed out in the President's request-instead got a boost to $110 million and a name change to STEM Engagement. The President's lunar initiative was widely supported by the Congress, with nearly all of its funding requests approved, though with a caveat that only 50% could be obligated before NASA provided a milestone-based schedule for a comprehensive lunar exploration program. The Gateway project received $450 million, slightly less than requested. Commercial payload services and the science-focused lunar discovery program both received full approval. NASA's low-Earth orbit commercialization proposal did not fare as well, receiving only $40 million compared to its $150 million request, directed toward a docking node on the ISS dedicated to \"commercial activities\".

Missing was additional funding for Mars activities, though Mars Sample Return receives approximately $50M for project studies. Though the Democratic party took control of the House of Representatives in January, this legislation is very similar to the draft NASA funding bills released last year under full Republican control. This is likely due to the short timeframe in which the congressional committees had to work with, the fact that this legislation was supposed to have passed before the Democrats took control anyway, and the higher level of bipartisan consensus around NASA. Absent the guiding hand of ex-House CJS committee chair John Culberson, things could look a lot different next time around. Now that NASA has its funding for 2019, our eyes turn toward 2020.

The mission primarily exists because a powerful member of Congress, Rep. John Culberson of Texas, has been very enthusiastic about it, providing substantial support for it in NASA budgets. But the expensive mission was not even evaluated, let alone recommended, in the 2011 planetary science decadal survey, Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2023, that established the current science priorities of the planetary science community. On November 6, Culberson lost his bid for re-election, and those lone voices seem much more prophetic. NASA is currently developing the Europa Clipper spacecraft that will orbit Jupiter and perform numerous swingbys of the icy moon. A version of that mission was prioritized in both the 2001 and 2011 planetary decadal surveys, but it likely wouldn't exist if not for Culberson. As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Culberson pushed back against the Obama Administration's Office of Management and Budget, adding money to the budget for a Europa mission to begin development that wasn't included in NASA's budget request. NASA was essentially caught in the middle of the executive and legislative branches. Culberson was persistent, and eventually OMB approved the start of the mission, which should enter its confirmation phase early next year. Culberson then added language to budget bills calling for a Europa lander as well. John Culberson assumed the chairmanship of the House CJS committee in 2014 and wasted no time in pushing NASA toward Europa. In the fiscal year 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Culberson included $80 million \"for pre- formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey.\" NASA had not requested any funds for a Europa mission, though the agency was funding studies on what such a mission might look like. The following year, Culberson included $100 million in the FY 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act using the same language as the FY14 appropriation. NASA had asked for $15 million in its budget request for \"pre-formulation work on the architecture for a potential Europa mission.\" In FY 2016, NASA requested $30 million to begin formulation activities on a Jupiter Europa mission. Instead, Culberson included $175 million in the FY16 omnibus spending bill for a Europa orbiter with a lander, and stipulated that the mission would be flown in 2022 atop NASA's Space Launch System, a vehicle still under development. In FY 2017, Culberson increased funding for Europa to $275 million and included language in the new omnibus spending bill instructing NASA to fly the orbiter and lander separately, in 2022 and 2024, respectively. NASA had requested only $49.6 million in FY17 for the Europa multiple flyby mission and nothing for a lander mission. Furthermore, NASA's budget request stated that the mission would likely launch \"in the late 2020s,\" and the cost estimates included an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle rather than an SLS, as the costs for an SLS were still unknown. The request did include a number allowing for an accelerated 2022 launch: $194 million for FY17. This funding trajectory is quite remarkable. It is rare that Congress provides money for science activities beyond what the community has requested. In the most recent omnibus, the FY 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Culberson included $595 million for the orbiter and lander missions, insisting on the use of SLS launch vehicles for both, and adhering to the 2022 and 2024 launch dates. NASA requested only $425 million for the Europa Clipper mission with a later launch date, and nothing for the lander mission. The budget request specifically states that the planetary science decadal survey did not recommend a lander mission at Europa. Again, the request included a number for meeting the 2022 launch mandate. It was the same as the FY18 request, but costs increased dramatically in the following four years compared to the projections for a mission with a later launch date. NASA's FY 2019 budget request included $264.7 million for Europa Clipper and stipulated a 2025 launch date aboard an EELV. Again, there was no request for a Europa lander, and the FY19 number included to achieve a 2022 launch date for Clipper was $565 million. The House passed a CJS appropriations bill this year for FY 2019, though the Senate did not. In the House bill, Culberson included $545 million for Europa Clipper and $195 million for the lander. The bill's language erroneously cited the 2011 decadal survey as recommending a lander to meet science goals at Europa. All dollars are in millions. Several sections of the FY19 budget-including CJS-are currently under a continuing resolution until December 7. Given that the Democratic party won back the majority in the recent elections, Republicans will likely be keen to pass the remaining budget items before the start of the new Congress in January. It isn't clear if the President will sign a budget without money for a wall along the Mexican border, and it is not likely that Republicans can pass a budget bill without Democratic support. As a result, the final FY19 funding for Europa remains in flux. Nevertheless, this funding trajectory is quite remarkable. It is rare that Congress provides money for science activities beyond what the community has requested. To have a congressional champion for a project with no direct ties to his district is even more extraordinary. It is unfortunate that more members of Congress aren't willing to support programs they view as being in the national interest even if they are not necessarily within a parochial interest. It is also worth noting that Culberson appropriated funds for Europa in addition to funds for all the other activities recommended in the decadal survey. That is, Europa did not generally come at the expense of other planetary science priorities. But some difficulties arose from his largesse. Why an orbiter? Why a lander? Why now? Culberson's support for a Europa lander presented a problem for NASA. Europa orbiters have been discussed and studied within the American planetary science community since the 1990s, but a lander is a more recent proposal without such a pedigree. Although it has a core group of fervent supporters and is gaining interest from a broader audience, the lander mission has not been discussed at length by the overall planetary science community. Those recommendations resulted from the committee's concern that a large flagship-class mission like Clipper could experience cost overruns that could impact the rest of the planetary science budget. In August, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine produced a new report that touched on that issue. Titled \"Visions into Voyages for Planetary Sciences in the Decade 2013-2022: A Midterm Review,\" the report is a midterm assessment of NASA's progress at achieving the goals established by the decadal survey. Like the decadal survey, the report is mandated by law. The report found that NASA's planetary science program has made excellent progress at meeting most of the goals established in the decadal survey. It appears to be a very well-run program. The report made a couple of recommendations regarding Europa Clipper: Recommendation: NASA should continue to closely monitor the cost and schedule associated with the Europa Clipper to ensure that it remains executable within the approved life cycle cost range approved at Key Decision Point-B without impacting other missions and priorities as defined by the decision rules in Vision and Voyages. If the LCC exceeds this range, NASA should de-scope the mission in order to remain consistent with the Vision and Voyages decision rules. Those recommendations resulted from the committee's concern that a large flagship-class mission like Clipper could experience cost overruns that could impact the rest of the planetary science budget. In this regard the committee had only to look at the astrophysics program, where cost overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope earned it the nickname \"the telescope that ate astronomy.\" But the planetary science community also remembers how the Mars Science Laboratory-now known as the Curiosity rover-vastly exceeded its cost and schedule baselines, sucking up money that could have been used for other Mars missions. Supporting this recommendation, the committee wrote: \"A lander was not prioritized or discussed in detail in Vision and Voyages, where it was referred to as a 'far term' mission. It also did not undergo a cost and technical evaluation like other large missions prioritized in the decadal survey. Given its cost and its potential impact on the rest of the planetary science program, the committee concluded that the mission should be vetted within the decadal survey process.\" Although not as strong as saying \"don't do the lander mission now,\" it was clear that the committee believed that the lander mission needed much broader scientific support, which could really only come from the decadal survey. Without that support, the mission was vulnerable to cancellation, as Culberson's loss is now demonstrating. According to a study presented to NASA in November of 2017 but not yet completely released, the Europa lander would cost at least $2.67 billion. Considering that such cost estimates are based on early assumptions, this number would very likely grow. Thus, the lander is likely to be at least as expensive as the Mars 2020 rover and the Europa Clipper, and possibly a lot more. In addition, the 2011 decadal survey had recommended that if NASA received additional money for planetary science, the next large strategic mission it pursued should be a mission to an ice giant planet, either Uranus or Neptune, depending upon available trajectories. An \"ice giants\" mission has broad scientific support, but a Europa lander does not Further, the decadal survey prioritized research, technology development, and small- and medium-class missions over flagships. The possibility of launching three flagships in a decade, particularly at a time when the small-class Discovery program and the medium-class New Frontiers program are not meeting the recommended cadence of launches, is counter to the consensus of the planetary science community. So is the Europa lander now doomed? For the near-term, probably yes. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. This entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. First, from a workforce and budget standpoint, NASA is already trying to finish Mars 2020 while ramping up spending on Europa Clipper. Flagship-class missions are often like \"the goat that the snake ate,\" in that their budget profile pushes everything else to the side as the project works its way through development, delaying other initiatives. There are rumors that JPL is already straining to provide sufficient technical staff for both Mars 2020 and Europa Clipper. Developing two flagships concurrently, or \"eating two goats,\" places tremendous pressure on the budget. These are very likely contributing reasons for NASA's continued pushback on Culberson's demand for a 2022 launch date for Clipper, though there may have been technical reasons as well. Trying to launch three flagships in four years, as Culberson's legislation mandated, would be a feat NASA has never attempted before and the budget implications are a little terrifying. If any of the projects encountered significant cost growth, the results could be catastrophic to the planetary science community for at least a decade. Second, the schedule NASA was being forced to follow for the lander would have pushed it into construction before Europa Clipper had even reached Jupiter. That would have locked in engineering decisions and even science observations that might not be ideal based upon what the Clipper actually finds at Europa. What would happen if the Clipper found something scientifically interesting that the lander was not designed to study? What if the Clipper discovered that the best landing site on Europa was not a place that the already-designed lander could reach? There is a logical progression towards planetary missions: flyby, orbit, land, rove. But there is also good reason to have reasonable gaps between each mission so that the science can be assessed and the next mission can be designed to take advantage of what is learned. Assuming that Europa Clipper reaches Europa in the second half of the 2020s, it would make sense to not define a lander design before the end of the 2020s, or ten years from now. That seems like a long time, but if the goal is to do the mission properly, learn the most from the data collected, and provide taxpayers with the best return on their investment, then haste can be a bad way to do things. President Eisenhower was reportedly fond of saying, \"Let's not rush to make our mistakes.\" Third, this entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. Coalitions are time-consuming, unwieldy, and often unsatisfying, but they tend to be far more resilient to unexpected change. This is one of the values of the decadal survey process to the scientific community. NASA has often relied on a small band of powerful stakeholders to ensure its political viability-and thus its funding stream-from the vagaries of governance and competition of other interests, but times are changing. Barbara Mikulski has retired, Bill Nelson is fighting to retain his Senate seat, and several prominent NASA supporters in the House lost their re-election bids this month. Other supporters in Congress will not be here forever, so NASA and the science community should be looking to cultivate relationships with a wide coalition of new and old supporters.

The Planetary Science Division reached extraordinary new budgetary heights at $2.8 billion, again directing significant resources to the Europa Clipper mission and $195 million for a yet-to-be-approved lander. Despite receiving a legislative tongue-lashing on overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA received approval to increase the mission's cost cap by $800 million in addition to continued funds. WFIRST, the follow-on mission to JWST, was rescued from cancellation and received a strong $312 million funding commitment for 2019. NASA's Education Division-originally zeroed out in the President's request-instead got a boost to $110 million and a name change to STEM Engagement. The President's lunar initiative was widely supported by the Congress, with nearly all of its funding requests approved, though with a caveat that only 50% could be obligated before NASA provided a milestone-based schedule for a comprehensive lunar exploration program. The Gateway project received $450 million, slightly less than requested. Commercial payload services and the science-focused lunar discovery program both received full approval. NASA's low-Earth orbit commercialization proposal did not fare as well, receiving only $40 million compared to its $150 million request, directed toward a docking node on the ISS dedicated to \"commercial activities\". Accounting for inflation, this is the best budget for NASA since the late 2000s, and represents the fifth year in a row that Congress provided funding beyond that which was requested by the executive branch. Many Planetary Society priorities are included in this budget, particularly for Planetary Science. Missing was additional funding for Mars activities, though Mars Sample Return receives approximately $50M for project studies. Though the Democratic party took control of the House of Representatives in January, this legislation is very similar to the draft NASA funding bills released last year under full Republican control. This is likely due to the short timeframe in which the congressional committees had to work with, the fact that this legislation was supposed to have passed before the Democrats took control anyway, and the higher level of bipartisan consensus around NASA. Absent the guiding hand of ex-House CJS committee chair John Culberson, things could look a lot different next time around. Now that NASA has its funding for 2019, our eyes turn toward 2020. The White House is likely to release its formal President's Budget Request in March, at which point the whole process begins anew. Given the political animosity between the House of Representatives and the White House, the growing deficit, and the lack of a broad spending agreement in the Congress, we may look back and consider 2019 as a local maxima of budgetary support for the space program.", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/0215-fy2019-nasa-gets-its-best-budget-in-decades"}, {"title": "NASA to replace Europa Clipper instrument", "date": "2019-03-06", "content": "NASA has removed an instrument previously selected for the Europa Clipper mission, citing cost growth, but will seek ways to replace it with a less complex design. In a March 5 statement, NASA said that it would no longer pursue development of the Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry instrument, a magnetometer designed to measure the magnetic field around the icy moon of Jupiter. ICEMAG was one of nine instruments originally selected by NASA in 2015 for development for the Europa Clipper mission. NASA said that the increasing cost of ICEMAG, still in its preliminary design phase, led to its removal from the mission. \"I believe this decision was necessary as a result of continued, significant cost growth and remaining high cost risk for this investigation,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a memo. In that memo, he said that ICEMAG exceeded a \"cost trigger\" last summer that had been put in place for it and other instruments to keep costs under control. That cost trigger escalated reviews of the instrument all the way to NASA Headquarters, including a briefing there Feb. 14. The key problem with the instrument was accommodating its \"scalar vector helium sensors,\" used to measure the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. Zurbuchen said in the memo that, at the time of the February review, ICEMAG's estimated cost has grown to $45.6 million, $16 million above its original cost trigger and $8.3 million above a revised cost trigger established just a month earlier. That cost was also three times above the original estimate in the ICEMAG proposal. \"The level of cost growth on ICEMAG is not acceptable, and NASA considers the investigation to possess significant potential for additional cost growth,\" Zurbuchen wrote in the memo. \"As a result, I decided to terminate the ICEMAG investigation.\" NASA will instead pursue options for \"a simpler, less complex\" magnetometer on Europa Clipper, although the announcement contained few details about how that will be accomplished. Scientists who were part of the ICEMAG team will be invited to remain on the overall mission science team. \"A magnetometer investigation brings significant value to Europa science and exploration,\" Zurbchen said in the statement about ICEMAG's removal. \"We have enough time before launch to find such a replacement and will move quickly to implement this.\" Scientists consider the inclusion of a magnetometer particularly valuable for probing the interior of Europa, thought to contain a global ocean of liquid water. Data from the magnetometer on the Galileo spacecraft, which performed many flybys of Europa, detected variations in Jupiter's magnetic field in the vicinity of the moon that scientists said were likely caused by the presence of an electrically conductive fluid, like water, beneath the surface. Scientists had hoped ICEMAG would provide more detailed magnetic field measurements that could constrain the depth, thickness and salinity of the ocean. That would help scientists assess the potential habitability of Europa, a key goal of the overall Europa Clipper mission. \"The nature of the subsurface ocean and how it interacts with the surface is critical to evaluating Europa's potential habitability,\" Carol Raymond of JPL, the principal investigator for ICEMAG, said in a 2015 statement about the instrument's selection. \"Knowledge of the ocean properties helps us understand Europa's evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface.\" Zurbuchen said that NASA was still committed to the overall Europa Clipper mission, but instituted the cost trigger process to manage the mission's overall costs and avoid increases that could upset the overall balance of the agency's planetary science programs. \"We consider it a critical part of the mission portfolio of NASA Science, and am looking forward to see this development mature towards flight,\" he wrote in the memo. The Europa Clipper mission benefitted for years from the patronage of Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who became chairman of the subcommittee that funds NASA four years ago. Culberson was an unusually staunch advocate for both Europa Clipper and a follow-on lander, providing funding for the mission far above any NASA request for them. In the final fiscal year 2019 funding bill, passed in February but whose NASA provisions were finalized late last year, Europa Clipper received $545 million, more than double NASA's request of $264.7 million. Culberson, though, lost re-election last November. While NASA says it remains committed to flying Europa Clipper, the mission is unlikely to see the increased funding provided to accelerate its development. The 2019 spending bill set a 2023 deadline for launching the mission, a year later than previous bills, but NASA's statement about the removal of ICEMAG said only that it plans to launch Europa Clipper \"in the 2020s.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-replace-europa-clipper-instrument/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter Gets $600M in NASA's 2020 Budget Request", "date": "2019-03-12", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission could receive $600 million for the fiscal year that begins in October, according to budget request documents released Monday by President Donald Trump's administration. Those documents also suggest that NASA will look to launch the spacecraft on a commercial rocket, rather than on a government rocket, which the administration states would save more than $700 million. The Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will explore Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons and one of scientists' top contenders for a spot to find life beyond Earth. Researchers believe the moon hides a global liquid ocean beneath its icy shell; if the rocky surface below that ocean is geologically active, it could tick all the boxes that life seems to require. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether those requirements are present. The funding news comes in the wake of a NASA decision to remove one of the previously approved instruments from the spacecraft, a magnetometer called Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry. NASA cited cost concerns as its motivation and noted that it would look for a new, simpler magnetometer to fly on the probe. Such an instrument would be crucial for confirming that Europa features a global liquid ocean, characterizing that water and measuring the thickness of the ice shell above it. The spacecraft design is currently undergoing its final review and is not yet being built. The budget request may address one of the team's lingering uncertainties in planning the mission: what rocket NASA would use to launch the probe. The mission requires the heft of either a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which has flown once, or NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, which has never flown. Rocket choice will affect both the project's budget and its mission schedule: Riding by SLS, the probe would arrive within about three years; by Falcon Heavy, it would get there within five or six years. The Europa Clipper funding is part of a $2.6 billion budget request for planetary science. These documents represent only what NASA and the Trump administration would like to prioritize and accomplish in the coming year; actual budgets must be determined by Congress.

The magnetometer, known as ICEMAG, was intended to collect data that could help to determine whether Europa's ice-covered ocean is capable of hosting life, in part by measuring the water's salt content. But on 5 March, NASA said that it had cancelled plans to build ICEMAG, citing increased costs. \"This is a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever,\" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who is on the Europa Clipper science team. \"Why throw it off?\" NASA plans to replace ICEMAG with a simpler, and cheaper, magnetometer that would gather less-detailed observations of Europa's ocean. The decision stoked outrage this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas - especially when it emerged that NASA's planetary-science division, which is developing the Europa Clipper, is also facing large increases in the cost of its next Mars mission. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's planetary-science division, said the agency was trying to reduce risk by eliminating ICEMAG from the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch in 2023. NASA says that ICEMAG's estimated price tag grew from nearly US$30 million in February 2017 to more than $45 million two years later. Others dispute those numbers, saying they include costs that should not have been charged to ICEMAG - and note that the team working on the magnetometer had offered alternative designs that would have been simpler and cheaper to build. But NASA decided to work with another, as-yet-unnamed group of scientists to build the simpler instrument. The decision to cut ICEMAG \"is the hammer coming down a lot faster than anyone expected,\" says Schmidt. Several scientists at the planetary-science conference questioned why the Europa mission was losing out even as the budget of another flagship NASA mission, the $2.4-billion rover planned to launch to Mars in 2020, has ballooned, mostly because of delays in instrument development. \"The Europa mission as a whole is doing great,\" said Kurt Retherford, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, to Glaze. Yet \"you didn't say anything about the cost problems on Mars2020\". Glaze said that Mars2020 had overrun its budget by less than 15%, but woudl not give an exact figure. The added cost probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, compared with increases in the tens of millions for the Europa magnetometer. But there are crucial differences between the missions: the Mars2020 project is much further along in development, at a stage at which instruments have already been built and are being installed on the spacecraft. By contrast, NASA is still designing the Europa Clipper mission. And as Glaze noted, an August report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine singled out the Europa Clipper mission as needing to be carefully tracked to stay within budget. \"The intent here is to show that NASA is taking the National Academies' direction seriously,\" Glaze said. But some feel the Europa mission is being made too much of an example. \"To those not involved in the process, this news came as a complete surprise,\" said a 13 March statement from a group of scientists that consults with NASA on missions to the outer Solar System. NASA also recently cut nearly all of the $10 million allocated to analyse the last bits of data collected by another mission, the Cassini spacecraft that plunged to its death in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017. Finishing the analysis of data from Cassini's final year would have supported a number of graduate students and early-career scientists, the group said.

Titled \"Visions into Voyages for Planetary Sciences in the Decade 2013-2022: A Midterm Review,\" the report is a midterm assessment of NASA's progress at achieving the goals established by the decadal survey. Like the decadal survey, the report is mandated by law. The report found that NASA's planetary science program has made excellent progress at meeting most of the goals established in the decadal survey. It appears to be a very well-run program. The report made a couple of recommendations regarding Europa Clipper: Recommendation: NASA should continue to closely monitor the cost and schedule associated with the Europa Clipper to ensure that it remains executable within the approved life cycle cost range approved at Key Decision Point-B without impacting other missions and priorities as defined by the decision rules in Vision and Voyages. If the LCC exceeds this range, NASA should de-scope the mission in order to remain consistent with the Vision and Voyages decision rules. Those recommendations resulted from the committee's concern that a large flagship-class mission like Clipper could experience cost overruns that could impact the rest of the planetary science budget. In this regard the committee had only to look at the astrophysics program, where cost overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope earned it the nickname \"the telescope that ate astronomy.\" But the planetary science community also remembers how the Mars Science Laboratory-now known as the Curiosity rover-vastly exceeded its cost and schedule baselines, sucking up money that could have been used for other Mars missions. Supporting this recommendation, the committee wrote: \"A lander was not prioritized or discussed in detail in Vision and Voyages, where it was referred to as a 'far term' mission. It also did not undergo a cost and technical evaluation like other large missions prioritized in the decadal survey. Given its cost and its potential impact on the rest of the planetary science program, the committee concluded that the mission should be vetted within the decadal survey process.\" Although not as strong as saying \"don't do the lander mission now,\" it was clear that the committee believed that the lander mission needed much broader scientific support, which could really only come from the decadal survey. Without that support, the mission was vulnerable to cancellation, as Culberson's loss is now demonstrating. According to a study presented to NASA in November of 2017 but not yet completely released, the Europa lander would cost at least $2.67 billion. Considering that such cost estimates are based on early assumptions, this number would very likely grow. Thus, the lander is likely to be at least as expensive as the Mars 2020 rover and the Europa Clipper, and possibly a lot more. In addition, the 2011 decadal survey had recommended that if NASA received additional money for planetary science, the next large strategic mission it pursued should be a mission to an ice giant planet, either Uranus or Neptune, depending upon available trajectories. An \"ice giants\" mission has broad scientific support, but a Europa lander does not Further, the decadal survey prioritized research, technology development, and small- and medium-class missions over flagships. The possibility of launching three flagships in a decade, particularly at a time when the small-class Discovery program and the medium-class New Frontiers program are not meeting the recommended cadence of launches, is counter to the consensus of the planetary science community. So is the Europa lander now doomed? For the near-term, probably yes. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. This entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. First, from a workforce and budget standpoint, NASA is already trying to finish Mars 2020 while ramping up spending on Europa Clipper. Flagship-class missions are often like \"the goat that the snake ate,\" in that their budget profile pushes everything else to the side as the project works its way through development, delaying other initiatives. There are rumors that JPL is already straining to provide sufficient technical staff for both Mars 2020 and Europa Clipper. Developing two flagships concurrently, or \"eating two goats,\" places tremendous pressure on the budget. These are very likely contributing reasons for NASA's continued pushback on Culberson's demand for a 2022 launch date for Clipper, though there may have been technical reasons as well. Trying to launch three flagships in four years, as Culberson's legislation mandated, would be a feat NASA has never attempted before and the budget implications are a little terrifying. If any of the projects encountered significant cost growth, the results could be catastrophic to the planetary science community for at least a decade. Second, the schedule NASA was being forced to follow for the lander would have pushed it into construction before Europa Clipper had even reached Jupiter. That would have locked in engineering decisions and even science observations that might not be ideal based upon what the Clipper actually finds at Europa. What would happen if the Clipper found something scientifically interesting that the lander was not designed to study? What if the Clipper discovered that the best landing site on Europa was not a place that the already-designed lander could reach? There is a logical progression towards planetary missions: flyby, orbit, land, rove. But there is also good reason to have reasonable gaps between each mission so that the science can be assessed and the next mission can be designed to take advantage of what is learned. Assuming that Europa Clipper reaches Europa in the second half of the 2020s, it would make sense to not define a lander design before the end of the 2020s, or ten years from now. That seems like a long time, but if the goal is to do the mission properly, learn the most from the data collected, and provide taxpayers with the best return on their investment, then haste can be a bad way to do things. President Eisenhower was reportedly fond of saying, \"Let's not rush to make our mistakes.\" Third, this entire episode serves as a lesson on the value of building coalitions. Reliance on a single important stakeholder can reduce the burden and time required to acquire necessary resources, but it also adds tremendous risk that said resources could disappear for reasons completely unrelated to a program or project. Coalitions are time-consuming, unwieldy, and often unsatisfying, but they tend to be far more resilient to unexpected change. This is one of the values of the decadal survey process to the scientific community. NASA has often relied on a small band of powerful stakeholders to ensure its political viability-and thus its funding stream-from the vagaries of governance and competition of other interests, but times are changing. Barbara Mikulski has retired, Bill Nelson is fighting to retain his Senate seat, and several prominent NASA supporters in the House lost their re-election bids this month. Other supporters in Congress will not be here forever, so NASA and the science community should be looking to cultivate relationships with a wide coalition of new and old supporters.

The Planetary Science Division reached extraordinary new budgetary heights at $2.8 billion, again directing significant resources to the Europa Clipper mission and $195 million for a yet-to-be-approved lander. Despite receiving a legislative tongue-lashing on overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA received approval to increase the mission's cost cap by $800 million in addition to continued funds. WFIRST, the follow-on mission to JWST, was rescued from cancellation and received a strong $312 million funding commitment for 2019. NASA's Education Division-originally zeroed out in the President's request-instead got a boost to $110 million and a name change to STEM Engagement. The President's lunar initiative was widely supported by the Congress, with nearly all of its funding requests approved, though with a caveat that only 50% could be obligated before NASA provided a milestone-based schedule for a comprehensive lunar exploration program. The Gateway project received $450 million, slightly less than requested. Commercial payload services and the science-focused lunar discovery program both received full approval. NASA's low-Earth orbit commercialization proposal did not fare as well, receiving only $40 million compared to its $150 million request, directed toward a docking node on the ISS dedicated to \"commercial activities\". Accounting for inflation, this is the best budget for NASA since the late 2000s, and represents the fifth year in a row that Congress provided funding beyond that which was requested by the executive branch. Many Planetary Society priorities are included in this budget, particularly for Planetary Science. Missing was additional funding for Mars activities, though Mars Sample Return receives approximately $50M for project studies. Though the Democratic party took control of the House of Representatives in January, this legislation is very similar to the draft NASA funding bills released last year under full Republican control. This is likely due to the short timeframe in which the congressional committees had to work with, the fact that this legislation was supposed to have passed before the Democrats took control anyway, and the higher level of bipartisan consensus around NASA. Absent the guiding hand of ex-House CJS committee chair John Culberson, things could look a lot different next time around. Now that NASA has its funding for 2019, our eyes turn toward 2020. The White House is likely to release its formal President's Budget Request in March, at which point the whole process begins anew.

In a March 5 statement, NASA said that it would no longer pursue development of the Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry instrument, a magnetometer designed to measure the magnetic field around the icy moon of Jupiter. ICEMAG was one of nine instruments originally selected by NASA in 2015 for development for the Europa Clipper mission. NASA said that the increasing cost of ICEMAG, still in its preliminary design phase, led to its removal from the mission. \"I believe this decision was necessary as a result of continued, significant cost growth and remaining high cost risk for this investigation,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a memo. In that memo, he said that ICEMAG exceeded a \"cost trigger\" last summer that had been put in place for it and other instruments to keep costs under control. That cost trigger escalated reviews of the instrument all the way to NASA Headquarters, including a briefing there Feb. 14. The key problem with the instrument was accommodating its \"scalar vector helium sensors,\" used to measure the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. Zurbuchen said in the memo that, at the time of the February review, ICEMAG's estimated cost has grown to $45.6 million, $16 million above its original cost trigger and $8.3 million above a revised cost trigger established just a month earlier. That cost was also three times above the original estimate in the ICEMAG proposal. \"The level of cost growth on ICEMAG is not acceptable, and NASA considers the investigation to possess significant potential for additional cost growth,\" Zurbuchen wrote in the memo. \"As a result, I decided to terminate the ICEMAG investigation.\" NASA will instead pursue options for \"a simpler, less complex\" magnetometer on Europa Clipper, although the announcement contained few details about how that will be accomplished. Scientists who were part of the ICEMAG team will be invited to remain on the overall mission science team. \"A magnetometer investigation brings significant value to Europa science and exploration,\" Zurbchen said in the statement about ICEMAG's removal. \"We have enough time before launch to find such a replacement and will move quickly to implement this.\" Scientists consider the inclusion of a magnetometer particularly valuable for probing the interior of Europa, thought to contain a global ocean of liquid water. Data from the magnetometer on the Galileo spacecraft, which performed many flybys of Europa, detected variations in Jupiter's magnetic field in the vicinity of the moon that scientists said were likely caused by the presence of an electrically conductive fluid, like water, beneath the surface. Scientists had hoped ICEMAG would provide more detailed magnetic field measurements that could constrain the depth, thickness and salinity of the ocean. That would help scientists assess the potential habitability of Europa, a key goal of the overall Europa Clipper mission. \"The nature of the subsurface ocean and how it interacts with the surface is critical to evaluating Europa's potential habitability,\" Carol Raymond of JPL, the principal investigator for ICEMAG, said in a 2015 statement about the instrument's selection. \"Knowledge of the ocean properties helps us understand Europa's evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface.\" Zurbuchen said that NASA was still committed to the overall Europa Clipper mission, but instituted the cost trigger process to manage the mission's overall costs and avoid increases that could upset the overall balance of the agency's planetary science programs. \"We consider it a critical part of the mission portfolio of NASA Science, and am looking forward to see this development mature towards flight,\" he wrote in the memo. The Europa Clipper mission benefitted for years from the patronage of Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who became chairman of the subcommittee that funds NASA four years ago. Culberson was an unusually staunch advocate for both Europa Clipper and a follow-on lander, providing funding for the mission far above any NASA request for them. In the final fiscal year 2019 funding bill, passed in February but whose NASA provisions were finalized late last year, Europa Clipper received $545 million, more than double NASA's request of $264.7 million. Culberson, though, lost re-election last November. While NASA says it remains committed to flying Europa Clipper, the mission is unlikely to see the increased funding provided to accelerate its development. The 2019 spending bill set a 2023 deadline for launching the mission, a year later than previous bills, but NASA's statement about the removal of ICEMAG said only that it plans to launch Europa Clipper \"in the 2020s.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-replace-europa-clipper-instrument/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter Gets $600M in NASA's 2020 Budget Request", "date": "2019-03-12", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission could receive $600 million for the fiscal year that begins in October, according to budget request documents released Monday by President Donald Trump's administration. Those documents also suggest that NASA will look to launch the spacecraft on a commercial rocket, rather than on a government rocket, which the administration states would save more than $700 million. The Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will explore Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons and one of scientists' top contenders for a spot to find life beyond Earth. Researchers believe the moon hides a global liquid ocean beneath its icy shell; if the rocky surface below that ocean is geologically active, it could tick all the boxes that life seems to require. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether those requirements are present. The funding news comes in the wake of a NASA decision to remove one of the previously approved instruments from the spacecraft, a magnetometer called Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry. NASA cited cost concerns as its motivation and noted that it would look for a new, simpler magnetometer to fly on the probe. Such an instrument would be crucial for confirming that Europa features a global liquid ocean, characterizing that water and measuring the thickness of the ice shell above it. The spacecraft design is currently undergoing its final review and is not yet being built. The budget request may address one of the team's lingering uncertainties in planning the mission: what rocket NASA would use to launch the probe. The mission requires the heft of either a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which has flown once, or NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, which has never flown. Rocket choice will affect both the project's budget and its mission schedule: Riding by SLS, the probe would arrive within about three years; by Falcon Heavy, it would get there within five or six years. The Europa Clipper funding is part of a $2.6 billion budget request for planetary science. These documents represent only what NASA and the Trump administration would like to prioritize and accomplish in the coming year; actual budgets must be determined by Congress.

The magnetometer, known as ICEMAG, was intended to collect data that could help to determine whether Europa's ice-covered ocean is capable of hosting life, in part by measuring the water's salt content. But on 5 March, NASA said that it had cancelled plans to build ICEMAG, citing increased costs. \"This is a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever,\" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who is on the Europa Clipper science team. \"Why throw it off?\" NASA plans to replace ICEMAG with a simpler, and cheaper, magnetometer that would gather less-detailed observations of Europa's ocean. The decision stoked outrage this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas - especially when it emerged that NASA's planetary-science division, which is developing the Europa Clipper, is also facing large increases in the cost of its next Mars mission. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's planetary-science division, said the agency was trying to reduce risk by eliminating ICEMAG from the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch in 2023. NASA says that ICEMAG's estimated price tag grew from nearly US$30 million in February 2017 to more than $45 million two years later. Others dispute those numbers, saying they include costs that should not have been charged to ICEMAG - and note that the team working on the magnetometer had offered alternative designs that would have been simpler and cheaper to build. But NASA decided to work with another, as-yet-unnamed group of scientists to build the simpler instrument. The decision to cut ICEMAG \"is the hammer coming down a lot faster than anyone expected,\" says Schmidt. Several scientists at the planetary-science conference questioned why the Europa mission was losing out even as the budget of another flagship NASA mission, the $2.4-billion rover planned to launch to Mars in 2020, has ballooned, mostly because of delays in instrument development. \"The Europa mission as a whole is doing great,\" said Kurt Retherford, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, to Glaze. Yet \"you didn't say anything about the cost problems on Mars2020\". Glaze said that Mars2020 had overrun its budget by less than 15%, but woudl not give an exact figure. The added cost probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, compared with increases in the tens of millions for the Europa magnetometer. But there are crucial differences between the missions: the Mars2020 project is much further along in development, at a stage at which instruments have already been built and are being installed on the spacecraft. By contrast, NASA is still designing the Europa Clipper mission. And as Glaze noted, an August report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine singled out the Europa Clipper mission as needing to be carefully tracked to stay within budget. \"The intent here is to show that NASA is taking the National Academies' direction seriously,\" Glaze said. But some feel the Europa mission is being made too much of an example. \"To those not involved in the process, this news came as a complete surprise,\" said a 13 March statement from a group of scientists that consults with NASA on missions to the outer Solar System. NASA also recently cut nearly all of the $10 million allocated to analyse the last bits of data collected by another mission, the Cassini spacecraft that plunged to its death in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017. Finishing the analysis of data from Cassini's final year would have supported a number of graduate students and early-career scientists, the group said. Some of the final Cassini data products, it wrote, \"may simply not be developed\".

In fact, it's not a satellite dish at all. It's a high-gain antenna, and a future version of it will send and receive signals to and from Earth from a looping orbit around Jupiter. The antenna will take that long journey aboard NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa to see whether the icy orb could harbor conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe there's a massive salty ocean beneath Europa's icy surface. The antenna will beam back high-resolution images and scientific data from Europa Clipper's cameras and science instruments.

The HGA will be used to keep the Clipper in contact with mission control as it conducts a series of flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scheduled to launch sometime between 2022 and 2025, the Europa Clipper mission, as its name suggests, is tasked with making the first up-close, detailed study of the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it's believed to possess an ocean sealed beneath its icy crust that is twice the volume of all of Earth's seas and is arguably the most likely place in the solar system to find life outside of our planet. The problem is that studying Europa is actually a much more complex job than visiting, for example, Mars, so the Europa Clipper is still undergoing a lot of basic design work as NASA determines exactly what its mission objectives and parameters will be. However, one thing is clear, the Clipper will not go into orbit around Europa. Not only would that be much too expensive in terms of propellant, but the area is far too radioactive for the probe's electronics. Instead, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and carry out a series of 45 close flybys of the moon, during which it will study the characteristics and chemistry of the ice crust and the Europan world ocean, as well as the general geology of the moon. One of the most important bits of equipment on the Clipper is the HGA, which will act as the primary communications link with Earth as the unmanned probe takes up to seven years to reach Jupiter and conducts its over three-year science mission after arrival. Resembling a domestic satellite dish, the HGA is 10 ft tall and is being tested by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley. The goal is to make sure that the HGA is built to standard and has the required accuracy to keep pointed at Earth across 460 million mi. The ETR was chosen to ascertain this because it has the ability to make the close tests required. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"says Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" NASA says that the current tests will end soon, but will resume next year as the design matures.

Notably hidden among the budget items, however, was a $100 million allocation to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Nuclear rocket propulsion has long been theorized and researched, but no fully-produced version exists yet today. A nuclear thermal rocket, as the name suggests, is a rocket motor powered by a nuclear reactor. Aboard the spacecraft, a tank of hydrogen fuel is stored at supercool temperatures at -252 K. When the rocket is ready to be turned on, the hydrogen is pumped from its tank through a series of pipes into the nuclear reactor vessel where the hydrogen is heated into plasma and expelled through the rocket nozzle at high velocities. The amount of thrust a rocket can produce depends on both the temperature and the molecular weight of the expelled molecule; in both regards, a nuclear rocket is superior to a chemical rocket because of its higher exhaust temperature and lower molecular weight of fuel. Nuclear rockets, depending on design, can achieve exhaust temperatures ranging from 2750 K to as high as 21,000 K. For reference, most chemical rockets only go as high as 5,555 K. Because chemical rockets involve reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, the exhaust gas is mainly water vapor, while the exhaust gas of a nuclear rocket is pure hydrogen. This means that even the coolest form of a nuclear rocket can produce twice the power of a chemical rocket. NASA has experimented with nuclear propulsion in the past. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program was a nuclear experimentation program run jointly by NASA and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. The program's goal was to establish a technological baseline for nuclear propulsion; several engines were test-fired in configurations that could be adapted to production-ready spaceflight. However, the program was canceled in 1972 when public support waivered and plans to send humans to Mars were canceled by Congress. Any plans to use a nuclear rocket focused on utilizing it as a second stage once the craft had entered deep space; this would avoid contaminating Earth's atmosphere with the radioactive byproduct. While we don't know exactly what NASA will produce with its $100 million allocation, a flight demonstration mission has been planned for 2024.

That would help scientists assess the potential habitability of Europa, a key goal of the overall Europa Clipper mission. \"The nature of the subsurface ocean and how it interacts with the surface is critical to evaluating Europa's potential habitability,\" Carol Raymond of JPL, the principal investigator for ICEMAG, said in a 2015 statement about the instrument's selection. \"Knowledge of the ocean properties helps us understand Europa's evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface.\" Zurbuchen said that NASA was still committed to the overall Europa Clipper mission, but instituted the cost trigger process to manage the mission's overall costs and avoid increases that could upset the overall balance of the agency's planetary science programs. \"We consider it a critical part of the mission portfolio of NASA Science, and am looking forward to see this development mature towards flight,\" he wrote in the memo. The Europa Clipper mission benefitted for years from the patronage of Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who became chairman of the subcommittee that funds NASA four years ago. Culberson was an unusually staunch advocate for both Europa Clipper and a follow-on lander, providing funding for the mission far above any NASA request for them. In the final fiscal year 2019 funding bill, passed in February but whose NASA provisions were finalized late last year, Europa Clipper received $545 million, more than double NASA's request of $264.7 million. Culberson, though, lost re-election last November. While NASA says it remains committed to flying Europa Clipper, the mission is unlikely to see the increased funding provided to accelerate its development. The 2019 spending bill set a 2023 deadline for launching the mission, a year later than previous bills, but NASA's statement about the removal of ICEMAG said only that it plans to launch Europa Clipper \"in the 2020s.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-replace-europa-clipper-instrument/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter Gets $600M in NASA's 2020 Budget Request", "date": "2019-03-12", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission could receive $600 million for the fiscal year that begins in October, according to budget request documents released Monday by President Donald Trump's administration. Those documents also suggest that NASA will look to launch the spacecraft on a commercial rocket, rather than on a government rocket, which the administration states would save more than $700 million. The Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will explore Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons and one of scientists' top contenders for a spot to find life beyond Earth. Researchers believe the moon hides a global liquid ocean beneath its icy shell; if the rocky surface below that ocean is geologically active, it could tick all the boxes that life seems to require. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether those requirements are present. The funding news comes in the wake of a NASA decision to remove one of the previously approved instruments from the spacecraft, a magnetometer called Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry. NASA cited cost concerns as its motivation and noted that it would look for a new, simpler magnetometer to fly on the probe. Such an instrument would be crucial for confirming that Europa features a global liquid ocean, characterizing that water and measuring the thickness of the ice shell above it. The spacecraft design is currently undergoing its final review and is not yet being built. The budget request may address one of the team's lingering uncertainties in planning the mission: what rocket NASA would use to launch the probe. The mission requires the heft of either a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which has flown once, or NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, which has never flown. Rocket choice will affect both the project's budget and its mission schedule: Riding by SLS, the probe would arrive within about three years; by Falcon Heavy, it would get there within five or six years. The Europa Clipper funding is part of a $2.6 billion budget request for planetary science. These documents represent only what NASA and the Trump administration would like to prioritize and accomplish in the coming year; actual budgets must be determined by Congress.

The magnetometer, known as ICEMAG, was intended to collect data that could help to determine whether Europa's ice-covered ocean is capable of hosting life, in part by measuring the water's salt content. But on 5 March, NASA said that it had cancelled plans to build ICEMAG, citing increased costs. \"This is a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever,\" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who is on the Europa Clipper science team. \"Why throw it off?\" NASA plans to replace ICEMAG with a simpler, and cheaper, magnetometer that would gather less-detailed observations of Europa's ocean. The decision stoked outrage this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas - especially when it emerged that NASA's planetary-science division, which is developing the Europa Clipper, is also facing large increases in the cost of its next Mars mission. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's planetary-science division, said the agency was trying to reduce risk by eliminating ICEMAG from the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch in 2023. NASA says that ICEMAG's estimated price tag grew from nearly US$30 million in February 2017 to more than $45 million two years later. Others dispute those numbers, saying they include costs that should not have been charged to ICEMAG - and note that the team working on the magnetometer had offered alternative designs that would have been simpler and cheaper to build. But NASA decided to work with another, as-yet-unnamed group of scientists to build the simpler instrument. The decision to cut ICEMAG \"is the hammer coming down a lot faster than anyone expected,\" says Schmidt. Several scientists at the planetary-science conference questioned why the Europa mission was losing out even as the budget of another flagship NASA mission, the $2.4-billion rover planned to launch to Mars in 2020, has ballooned, mostly because of delays in instrument development. \"The Europa mission as a whole is doing great,\" said Kurt Retherford, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, to Glaze. Yet \"you didn't say anything about the cost problems on Mars2020\". Glaze said that Mars2020 had overrun its budget by less than 15%, but woudl not give an exact figure. The added cost probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, compared with increases in the tens of millions for the Europa magnetometer. But there are crucial differences between the missions: the Mars2020 project is much further along in development, at a stage at which instruments have already been built and are being installed on the spacecraft. By contrast, NASA is still designing the Europa Clipper mission. And as Glaze noted, an August report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine singled out the Europa Clipper mission as needing to be carefully tracked to stay within budget. \"The intent here is to show that NASA is taking the National Academies' direction seriously,\" Glaze said. But some feel the Europa mission is being made too much of an example. \"To those not involved in the process, this news came as a complete surprise,\" said a 13 March statement from a group of scientists that consults with NASA on missions to the outer Solar System. NASA also recently cut nearly all of the $10 million allocated to analyse the last bits of data collected by another mission, the Cassini spacecraft that plunged to its death in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017. Finishing the analysis of data from Cassini's final year would have supported a number of graduate students and early-career scientists, the group said. Some of the final Cassini data products, it wrote, \"may simply not be developed\".

In fact, it's not a satellite dish at all. It's a high-gain antenna, and a future version of it will send and receive signals to and from Earth from a looping orbit around Jupiter. The antenna will take that long journey aboard NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa to see whether the icy orb could harbor conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe there's a massive salty ocean beneath Europa's icy surface. The antenna will beam back high-resolution images and scientific data from Europa Clipper's cameras and science instruments. The full-scale prototype antenna, which at 10 feet tall is the same height as a standard basketball hoop, is in the Experimental Test Range at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley are testing the prototype in the ETR in order to assess its performance and demonstrate the high pointing accuracies required for the Europa Clipper mission. The ETR is an indoor electromagnetic test facility that allows researchers to characterize transmitters, receivers, antennas and other electromagnetic components and subsystems in a scientifically controlled environment. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"said Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" Tests on this prototype antenna are scheduled to wrap up soon; however, researchers plan to return to the ETR in 2020 to conduct additional tests on Europa Clipper's high-gain antenna flight article.

The HGA will be used to keep the Clipper in contact with mission control as it conducts a series of flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scheduled to launch sometime between 2022 and 2025, the Europa Clipper mission, as its name suggests, is tasked with making the first up-close, detailed study of the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it's believed to possess an ocean sealed beneath its icy crust that is twice the volume of all of Earth's seas and is arguably the most likely place in the solar system to find life outside of our planet. The problem is that studying Europa is actually a much more complex job than visiting, for example, Mars, so the Europa Clipper is still undergoing a lot of basic design work as NASA determines exactly what its mission objectives and parameters will be. However, one thing is clear, the Clipper will not go into orbit around Europa. Not only would that be much too expensive in terms of propellant, but the area is far too radioactive for the probe's electronics. Instead, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and carry out a series of 45 close flybys of the moon, during which it will study the characteristics and chemistry of the ice crust and the Europan world ocean, as well as the general geology of the moon. One of the most important bits of equipment on the Clipper is the HGA, which will act as the primary communications link with Earth as the unmanned probe takes up to seven years to reach Jupiter and conducts its over three-year science mission after arrival. Resembling a domestic satellite dish, the HGA is 10 ft tall and is being tested by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley. The goal is to make sure that the HGA is built to standard and has the required accuracy to keep pointed at Earth across 460 million mi. The ETR was chosen to ascertain this because it has the ability to make the close tests required. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"says Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" NASA says that the current tests will end soon, but will resume next year as the design matures.

Notably hidden among the budget items, however, was a $100 million allocation to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Nuclear rocket propulsion has long been theorized and researched, but no fully-produced version exists yet today. A nuclear thermal rocket, as the name suggests, is a rocket motor powered by a nuclear reactor. Aboard the spacecraft, a tank of hydrogen fuel is stored at supercool temperatures at -252 K. When the rocket is ready to be turned on, the hydrogen is pumped from its tank through a series of pipes into the nuclear reactor vessel where the hydrogen is heated into plasma and expelled through the rocket nozzle at high velocities. The amount of thrust a rocket can produce depends on both the temperature and the molecular weight of the expelled molecule; in both regards, a nuclear rocket is superior to a chemical rocket because of its higher exhaust temperature and lower molecular weight of fuel. Nuclear rockets, depending on design, can achieve exhaust temperatures ranging from 2750 K to as high as 21,000 K. For reference, most chemical rockets only go as high as 5,555 K. Because chemical rockets involve reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, the exhaust gas is mainly water vapor, while the exhaust gas of a nuclear rocket is pure hydrogen. This means that even the coolest form of a nuclear rocket can produce twice the power of a chemical rocket. NASA has experimented with nuclear propulsion in the past. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program was a nuclear experimentation program run jointly by NASA and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. The program's goal was to establish a technological baseline for nuclear propulsion; several engines were test-fired in configurations that could be adapted to production-ready spaceflight. However, the program was canceled in 1972 when public support waivered and plans to send humans to Mars were canceled by Congress. Any plans to use a nuclear rocket focused on utilizing it as a second stage once the craft had entered deep space; this would avoid contaminating Earth's atmosphere with the radioactive byproduct. While we don't know exactly what NASA will produce with its $100 million allocation, a flight demonstration mission has been planned for 2024.

Data was collected during several hundred supersonic test runs in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley of a scale model of the Block 1 Cargo vehicle that is the currently mandated booster for the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. The first of six major testing campaigns began last year and are being conducted at NASA wind tunnels across the United States in support of the SLS Program's design analysis of the new configuration. The aerodynamic data is used to refine analysis and modeling of the vehicle's atmospheric trajectories, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, and structural loading. Testing is planned to cover the early phase of flight all the way out to Solid Rocket Booster separation, going back to the liftoff period to measure the effect of ground winds on the rocket, and also before liftoff while sitting on the Mobile Launcher. Supersonic Mach range test campaign for new SLS vehicle config. A 0.8-percent scale model of the SLS Block 1 Cargo configuration was set up in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley for this round of aerodynamics testing. \"We did about seven hundred runs, that was covering the Mach range in different pitches and rolls,\" Courtney Winski, a research aerospace engineer at NASA Langley, said in an interview. \"We just completed that test, that was Mach 1.5 to 4.5.\" During test runs, the wind tunnel was run at a set velocity and then data was taken as the model was moved through different orientations. \"We are varying angle of attack and roll, so we're doing pitch and roll combinations or alpha- roll combinations along with Mach number combinations, doing the same sets of pitch and roll at different Mach numbers,\" Winski explained. \"We did continuous runs and so we would set the model at a roll angle or at a pitch angle and then continuously take data while we either pitched at a set roll angle or rolled at a set pitch angle. And so we took about seven hundred of those runs over the Mach range. The entire testing took about a month, but that wasn't all run time, it was about three weeks of actual 'wind on' running in the Unitary.\" This model is configured with the shorter, 14-meter Delta 4 payload fairing that would encapsulate Europa Clipper. The \"Jupiter Direct\" trajectory is performance-challenging for the Block 1 vehicle and the shorter fairing saves weight over the longer, 19-meter PLF. \"A single run where we would pitch about twenty-four degrees just to kind of completely cover every option would take a little over a minute, where it was sitting at a single Mach number,\" she noted. The same data set would be collected in another run at another Mach number until the whole range was covered. \"The way that we would qualify it as is that the flight is quasi static in terms of Mach number,\" Jeremy Pinier, NASA's SLS Aerodynamics Team Lead at Langley, said in the interview. \"From liftoff to booster separation, that's around two minutes, so it goes from Mach zero to Mach four and a half in two minutes but that's actually pretty long and so we consider the state of the flow as quasi static.\" \"So we can go in the wind tunnel and sit at a Mach number and take data, take all the data we need at that Mach number and then go to the next Mach number, take all the data we need there and then create those databases where the GNC guys will be able to take our database and slice through this database even though in the wind tunnel we were statically sitting at a Mach number.\" \"The main data that we're collecting was force and moment data on the model,\" Winski noted. \"On this model we did not have pressure ports, but we did have the pressure sensitive paint .\" The luminescent paint provides visual data of the distribution of pressure over the model during wind tunnel testing. \"There are special lights on the tunnel,\" Winski noted. \"How much it actually causes the model to luminesce, because it's reacting with how much oxygen is in the air, is related to the pressure that it is seeing, how much light is luminescing off of it.\" \"We would have to sit at a condition for like thirty seconds or so and they would take images with the model just sitting still with conditions not changing.\" \"For this test what we actually did is we ran the model without paint for all of the force and moment testing and then once we completed the force and moment testing the model was painted for PSP,\" she added. \"If we were to retest this model later on for force and moment we would actually remove the PSP paint before testing.\" \"The paint is very sensitive, we can only use it for one test,\" Pinier said. \"It's sensitive to light, it's sensitive to oils on your hands, so if you touch the model it can damage the paint. So we paint it once for each test and then we can remove it and paint it again.\" \"What you saw in the picture with Courtney is the traditional pressure sensitive paint, steady pressure sensitive paint,\" he noted. \"It's a pretty mature technology, it's used in many institutions, in many labs and wind tunnels.\" A new, unsteady pressure sensitive paint is still in development but may be applied to future testing. \"We've already run a few exploratory tests using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint and it's shown very promising results,\" Pinier noted. \"We're thinking at some point we'll be able to characterize the buffet environment using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint. I say at some point because it needs validation, this technology needs to be validated first.\" Pad rollout to Boost phase aerodynamics Current testing is focused on the Block 1 Cargo configuration. \"We're just focusing this one right now because we've already done a lot of testing on all the other configurations,\" Pinier said. \"This Block 1 Cargo configuration was completely new to us when it came out and we had to start a whole testing campaign for that one specifically.\" The testing is intended to create an aerodynamic database for the vehicle configuration, from rolling out to the launch pad through liftoff, through the Boost phase of flight that goes through SRB separation and beyond. \"At liftoff you've got the ground winds that are pushing on the vehicle and the tower and those two are connected,\" Pinier explained. \"We're really interested in the ground wind loads on the tower and the vehicle, just static loads from winds from all directions, north, south, east, west.\" \"They're also interested in when they are rolling out the vehicle on the Mobile Launcher from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad there's also ground wind environments there.\" \"At T-0 you're really at ninety degrees angle of attack with the wind perpendicular to the vehicle,\" he added. \"As the vehicle accelerates that angle of attack reduces very quickly down to single digits in degrees. And so during ascent, subsonic all the way to supersonic Mach numbers we test at low angles of attack, meaning below eight degrees angle of attack. And really the vehicle is going to fly below four degrees angle of attack.\" \"As you're accelerating you go through Mach 1, you know lots of things happen around Mach 1,\" he continued. \"The fluid dynamics around Mach 1, speed of sound, are very non-linear. The unsteady pressure environment on the vehicle is the highest and that's what creates buffet. Basically you can think of it as the air kind of shaking the vehicle structure around Mach 1.\" \"The buffet is all of the low-frequency type of shaking of the vehicle that happens around transonic Mach numbers and the aeroacoustics is all of the higher-frequency shaking that happens in this airflow as it's going over the vehicle.\" \"So you go through Mach 1, you get past peak buffet loads and then you get to maximum dynamic pressure, which is when basically the force of the air on the vehicle, the static force is the highest,\" he continued. \"You get max dynamic pressure between Mach 1 and 2. The loads guys are mostly interested in the static loads on the vehicle during that phase in flight.\" \"And then you accelerate and everything in the environments start to tail off. Aeroacoustics is still present but it's also tailing off.\" \"Some of the things we look at as we get to higher and higher altitudes and close to booster separation is something called plume induced flow separation,\" he added. \"The plumes of the vehicle as you've probably seen when the rocket launches and gets to high altitude become very underexpanded, meaning they become very large and they can induce local separation of the flow on the back of the vehicle so we try to look at that at the highest Mach numbers.\" \"And then you get to booster separation around Mach 4, Mach 5, and that's where we have to characterize that environment to make sure that the boosters don't come back and contact the Core Stage.\" Testing to build aero database for design analysis of new vehicle configuration Testing all of those regions in the early phase of flight involves wind tunnels at NASA centers across the country. \"We tested at the Marshall fourteen-inch trisonic tunnel to get some data quickly,\" Pinier said. \"We can test quickly in that tunnel and get the data for initial design cycles; however, very quickly for this one we needed mature data so where we've got is we're probably in the middle of a testing campaign that comprises six large wind tunnel tests. This picture that you saw was from the test at the Langley Unitary Wind Tunnel to cover the high supersonic Mach range.\" \"We have also run a wind tunnel test at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to cover the subsonic to about Mach 2.5 range for ascent, that was a 1.3 percent scale model,\" he added. \"We are current getting set up to run a liftoff test at the Langley fourteen by twenty-two wind tunnel to cover the liftoff phase of flight and a 1.75 percent scale model along with a 1.75 percent scale Mobile Launcher. We're trying to characterize the liftoff environment with winds from all directions and basically the entire rollout to liftoff phase of flight.\" \"We're going to have a wind tunnel test this summer at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to characterize the aeroacoustics environment - transonic and low supersonic aeroacoustic environments,\" he continued. \"So we're going to have a transonic buffet environment test at the TDT or Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Langley, that's going to occur next calendar year and that's to characterize the unsteady buffet environment as the vehicle goes through the transonic Mach numbers.\" \"The sixth one is going to be a booster separation wind tunnel test at the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel and that's going to be a static 0.9 percent scale model. Those tests are pretty standard, those are critical phases of flight where we need to get that data right and so we rely heavily on wind tunnels for those critical databases.\" \"For pretty much every configuration of the Space Launch System family we've run those tests,\" Pinier added. \"We're just doing it all over for this particular configuration.\" Data feeds into two areas of design analysis work The database being generated for this vehicle configuration from the wind tunnel testing is used by different design groups. \"There's really two customers for us - for the aerodynamics team,\" Pinier explained. \"One of them is the trajectory and guidance navigation and control teams. They are interested in databases to cover the entire Mach range.\" \"We take force and moment data for the entire Mach range and we put it in databases, give that to them,\" he added. \"They design trajectories, they run Monte Carlo simulations...in dispersed flight conditions throughout the entire Boost phase. So that's one of the customers - integrated forces and moments go to GN&C and trajectory.\" \"The second customer is the loads team,\" he continued. \"They're interested in the aerodynamic loading on the vehicle and in this case they are really interested in the peak loading phases of flight.\" On the right, a Schlieren image of a 0.8 percent scale model of the vehicle in Langley's supersonic wind tunnel at a supersonic Mach number. The force-moment and pressure data collected in the wind tunnel tests validates and is fed back into the analytical models. \"So for example, buffet. We don't have to characterize buffet throughout the entire Boost phase because we know buffet peaks around Mach 1 so we focus on transonic conditions for buffet environment.\" \"Aeroacoustics, we know those go a little higher than that so we characterize aeroacoustic environments all the way up to Mach two and a half and the aeroacoustics environment is also an environment that goes to the loads team.\" \"So those are the two biggest products, the aeroacoustics and the buffet, that go to the loads team that are kind of critical,\" Pinier said. \"A third one would be just the static loading, the distribution of the loading during ascent.\" \"It's not a driver for design, but we produce that. That comes mostly out of CFD, basically the distribution of the pressures over the entire vehicle as it goes through the Boost phase, but now that we have pressure sensitive paint when we're doing force-moment measurements we try to do this pressure sensitive paint measurement in order to validate the CFD.\" \"Those are models that the loads team have and they apply and they add those models gusts and wind shear and they add those models on top of what we give them in terms of environments,\" Pinier said. \"There's no way to measure that in a ground test environment.\" Block 1 Cargo is a new config under analysis The Block 1 Cargo configuration was studied earlier in the program, but more detailed design analysis began last year when the SLS option of flying the Europa Clipper spacecraft was moved back to the Block 1 vehicle as a part of Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. SLS is still the mandated launch vehicle for Europa Clipper, but also remains a source of disagreement between the Trump Administration and Congress. Congress mostly recently retained the SLS mandate in the language in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations passed in mid-February. Although the FY 2019 appropriations were signed by the President, the Administration remains opposed to using SLS for Europa; as in past years, their Fiscal Year 2020 Budget submission that followed in mid-March continues to advocate use of U.S. commercial launch services. Two other launch options on heavy-lift commercial vehicles would perform one or more gravity assist flybys past Earth and/or Venus; the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with any of these options. Congress and the Administration did reach agreement on one mandate also written into law, regarding the launch date. Previously, Congress enacted a 2022 launch mandate and the Administration proposed launch in 2025; the FY 2019 appropriations were passed with a 2023 launch target and the Administration's FY 2020 budget request supports this. While the \"Jupiter Direct\" launch mandate remains in place, the SLS Program continues design work on the general configuration and the specific mission, referred to as Science Mission-1. \"This cargo configuration as you probably know is for the Europa Clipper mission and there are two potential fairings, a short one and a long one and currently the primary one we're testing is the short one,\" Pinier said. The Block 1 vehicles use a derivative of United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy upper stage and the Delta's payload fairing system would also be used to encapsulate the spacecraft in the SLS launch option. The short fairing is approximately 14 meters long, the long fairing is approximately 19 meters long. \"It makes a lot of sense once you're in the wind tunnel to go ahead and test several configurations, so we have done some testing on the long configuration but currently the shorter one is the priority,\" Pinier added.

Europa Clipper is currently scheduled to launch in 2023 to orbit the moon for more than three years, studying its icy shell and suspected internal ocean, among other features. Europa Lander would follow in its wake and touch down on the ice in order to better investigate the possibility of life. But according to a nine-month investigation conducted by the NASA Office of Inspector General, both missions are facing a host of serious issues as their teams attempt to balance the needs of NASA and Congress. \"Our audit found that despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, a management analyst at the Office of Inspector General, said in a video released with the report. The report highlighted that since 2013, Congress has provided more than $2 billion for the pair of Europa missions. The Clipper mission alone is expected to cost at least $2.8 billion, according to the report. Every year of that period, the missions' funding has exceeded NASA's budget request. But with all that money has come a lot of strings. First, Congress has ordered NASA to launch both missions on the agency's SLS rocket, which is still in development. Congress also set specific launch targets - currently 2023 for Europa Clipper and 2025 for Europa Lander. Those two directives may be contradictory. Experts were already worried about the rocket's development; these concerns aren't just a problem for Europa, they also could affect projects like NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. But for Europa specifically, the first flight version of the SLS definitely won't be able to do the job for Europa Lander, and it's not clear yet whether it can successfully launch Europa Clipper, the investigation found. Clipper may need, and Lander will definitely need, a more advanced version of the rocket aiming to fly in 2024 but also predicted to slip. NASA also has not yet ordered a vital part of the SLS that the investigation found requires 52 months to produce - which it should have done in September to be ready in time for a summer 2023 launch. Because of these SLS problems, NASA's budget request released earlier this year also raises the possibility of launching on a commercial vehicle. The Clipper team has attempted to work around this problem by still considering the possibility that they'll be switched to ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, both of which are already flying. But the continuing uncertainty \"creates added risks and uncertainties for an already challenging project,\" the investigation found. Another challenge the investigation found is that the Clipper mission is struggling to manage its staffing. The mission is run out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But as of December, about 10% of Clipper's JPL staff roles were vacant, the investigation found, in part because the center is running four other key NASA projects, including Mars 2020, and keeps having to shuffle staff members between the neediest missions. The investigation also found that Clipper suffered from an instrument- selection process that tried to be too wary of conflicts of interest. Clipper team members with perceived conflicts of interest - but also vital knowledge about the mission - were either cut out of the instrument-selection process or given insufficient time to review insufficient information, according to the investigation., which was designed to measure the magnetic field around the moon, replacing it with a simpler version. The investigation did not explicitly link that decision to the instrument-selection issues it identified.) The report found similar issues plaguing the Europa Lander mission as well, although that project is in a more preliminary stage and NASA has not yet formally committed to launching it. The investigation also raised concerns that by scheduling the Lander to launch so soon after Clipper, it won't be able to fully integrate its predecessor's discoveries into its mission plan. The investigation team concluded with 10 recommendations it believes can help NASA get the Europa projects back on track and avoid similar issues in the future. Those recommendations include evaluating JPL's overall staffing, rescheduling mission milestones more realistically and making sure mission- related estimates reflect the risks associated with the SLS.

The audit also noted that the Europa program's biggest backer, John Culberson, no longer chairs the House appropriations subcommittee. The Republican Congressman from Texas was defeated in his reelection bid last year. The audit found that the Space Launch System (SLS) would probably not be available in time for the orbiter's planned launch in 2023. Congress has mandated the program use SLS for both missions. Using SLS would also be more expensive than using commercially available rockets such as Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy. The audit projected cost savings of at least $276 million from using the other launchers. The cost of up to $450 million for the Falcon Heavy appears to high. SpaceX has advertised Falcon Heavy launches at between $90 million and $150 million. \"These are conservative estimates for a commercial launch during this time frame; specific launch costs for the Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy are procurement sensitive,\" the audit stated. Cost, however, is not the only factor. The report notes that SLS would be capable of doing a direct trajectory to Europa, cutting four years off the transit time. This would allow the orbiter to collect far more data at the moon before NASA launches a lander there. Launching on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV would require gravity assist maneuvers that would take more time and require a beefed up spacecraft. \"Launching on a commercial launch vehicle will also subject Clipper to a more severe thermal environment requiring additional thermal and ultraviolet protection, which are already designed into the spacecraft,\" the audit found. \"The risks associated with a gravity assist flight trajectory need to be resolved prior to the Agency establishing the project's cost and schedule baseline.\" The report stated that NASA is studying whether the Falcon Heavy could send the orbiter on a Venus-Earth gravity assist that would reduce transit time and thermal exposure near Venus. Complicating the choice of a booster is that if the Europa Clipper orbiter misses its planned 2023 launch date, it could not be launched the next year due to a lack of a planetary alignment. NASA must also weight booster reliability. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launcher has flown two successful flights with no failures., with four more flights on the manifest through 2022. The audit noted the launcher would have to go through certification before it could launch the costly Europa mission. \"While the U.S. Air Force purchased Falcon Heavy launches in 2018, the vehicle would need to pass additional flight testing (known as Category-3 certification) for high priority, very high complexity,or high-cost payloads-descriptions that apply to the Europa Clipper mission,\" the audit stated. \"As part of this NASA certification process, the Falcon Heavy would need to have accomplished three successful flights by the Clipper's launch readiness date,\" the audit added. Reliability is also a concern with SLS, which is scheduled to launch for the first time in late 2020 or early 2021. \"Although the SLS will have had minimal flight history if the Europa Clipper is launched in the 2023 time frame, senior NASA managers believe the extensive quality assurance testing required to human-rate the vehicle will provide the needed confidence levels to meet the intent of commercial launch vehicle certification requirements,\" the audit said. Delta IV boosters have launched 37 times, including 10 Delta IV variants. All were successful except the first Delta IV Heavy flight, which suffered a partial failure. However, United Launch Alliance's plan to switch to the new Vulcan Centaur booster while phasing out the Delta IV line could result in higher costs. \"To support a Clipper launch with the Delta IV Heavy, NASA would have to provide more money upfront to keep production lines open and is at risk of having to shoulder some of the cost of maintaining the site required to launch that particular rocket, potentially increasing launch costs significantly if Clipper is the last Delta IV Heavy launch,\" the audit found. To get the project back on track, the audit made 10 recommendations related to staffing, budget, schedule and related issues. NASA concurred with nine of the recommendations, but did concur with the second one. 2. Reassess the Clipper Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level with launch vehicle risks for the Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, and SLS prior to Key Decision Point-C and establishing the Agency Baseline Commitment. \"Management did not concur with Recommendation 2, stating that Congress directed NASA to use the SLS launch vehicle and that directive justified its decision not to model the other launch vehicles in the project's JCL,\" the audit stated. \"We disagree and find this response inconsistent with the Agency's Cost Estimating Handbook which states that a JCL analysis should integrate cost, schedule, risk, and uncertainty. The Handbook also states that launch vehicle costs and associated risks shall be included in JCL calculations to ensure they are integrated into the entire project scope to aid management decision making,\" the report added.

The Planetary Science Division reached extraordinary new budgetary heights at $2.8 billion, again directing significant resources to the Europa Clipper mission and $195 million for a yet-to-be-approved lander. Despite receiving a legislative tongue-lashing on overruns on the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA received approval to increase the mission's cost cap by $800 million in addition to continued funds. WFIRST, the follow-on mission to JWST, was rescued from cancellation and received a strong $312 million funding commitment for 2019. NASA's Education Division-originally zeroed out in the President's request-instead got a boost to $110 million and a name change to STEM Engagement. The President's lunar initiative was widely supported by the Congress, with nearly all of its funding requests approved, though with a caveat that only 50% could be obligated before NASA provided a milestone-based schedule for a comprehensive lunar exploration program. The Gateway project received $450 million, slightly less than requested. Commercial payload services and the science-focused lunar discovery program both received full approval. NASA's low-Earth orbit commercialization proposal did not fare as well, receiving only $40 million compared to its $150 million request, directed toward a docking node on the ISS dedicated to \"commercial activities\". Accounting for inflation, this is the best budget for NASA since the late 2000s, and represents the fifth year in a row that Congress provided funding beyond that which was requested by the executive branch. Many Planetary Society priorities are included in this budget, particularly for Planetary Science. Missing was additional funding for Mars activities, though Mars Sample Return receives approximately $50M for project studies. Though the Democratic party took control of the House of Representatives in January, this legislation is very similar to the draft NASA funding bills released last year under full Republican control. This is likely due to the short timeframe in which the congressional committees had to work with, the fact that this legislation was supposed to have passed before the Democrats took control anyway, and the higher level of bipartisan consensus around NASA. Absent the guiding hand of ex-House CJS committee chair John Culberson, things could look a lot different next time around. Now that NASA has its funding for 2019, our eyes turn toward 2020. The White House is likely to release its formal President's Budget Request in March, at which point the whole process begins anew. Given the political animosity between the House of Representatives and the White House, the growing deficit, and the lack of a broad spending agreement in the Congress, we may look back and consider 2019 as a local maxima of budgetary support for the space program.", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/0215-fy2019-nasa-gets-its-best-budget-in-decades"}, {"title": "NASA to replace Europa Clipper instrument", "date": "2019-03-06", "content": "NASA has removed an instrument previously selected for the Europa Clipper mission, citing cost growth, but will seek ways to replace it with a less complex design. In a March 5 statement, NASA said that it would no longer pursue development of the Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry instrument, a magnetometer designed to measure the magnetic field around the icy moon of Jupiter. ICEMAG was one of nine instruments originally selected by NASA in 2015 for development for the Europa Clipper mission. NASA said that the increasing cost of ICEMAG, still in its preliminary design phase, led to its removal from the mission. \"I believe this decision was necessary as a result of continued, significant cost growth and remaining high cost risk for this investigation,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a memo. In that memo, he said that ICEMAG exceeded a \"cost trigger\" last summer that had been put in place for it and other instruments to keep costs under control. That cost trigger escalated reviews of the instrument all the way to NASA Headquarters, including a briefing there Feb. 14. The key problem with the instrument was accommodating its \"scalar vector helium sensors,\" used to measure the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. Zurbuchen said in the memo that, at the time of the February review, ICEMAG's estimated cost has grown to $45.6 million, $16 million above its original cost trigger and $8.3 million above a revised cost trigger established just a month earlier. That cost was also three times above the original estimate in the ICEMAG proposal. \"The level of cost growth on ICEMAG is not acceptable, and NASA considers the investigation to possess significant potential for additional cost growth,\" Zurbuchen wrote in the memo. \"As a result, I decided to terminate the ICEMAG investigation.\" NASA will instead pursue options for \"a simpler, less complex\" magnetometer on Europa Clipper, although the announcement contained few details about how that will be accomplished. Scientists who were part of the ICEMAG team will be invited to remain on the overall mission science team. \"A magnetometer investigation brings significant value to Europa science and exploration,\" Zurbchen said in the statement about ICEMAG's removal. \"We have enough time before launch to find such a replacement and will move quickly to implement this.\" Scientists consider the inclusion of a magnetometer particularly valuable for probing the interior of Europa, thought to contain a global ocean of liquid water. Data from the magnetometer on the Galileo spacecraft, which performed many flybys of Europa, detected variations in Jupiter's magnetic field in the vicinity of the moon that scientists said were likely caused by the presence of an electrically conductive fluid, like water, beneath the surface. Scientists had hoped ICEMAG would provide more detailed magnetic field measurements that could constrain the depth, thickness and salinity of the ocean. That would help scientists assess the potential habitability of Europa, a key goal of the overall Europa Clipper mission. \"The nature of the subsurface ocean and how it interacts with the surface is critical to evaluating Europa's potential habitability,\" Carol Raymond of JPL, the principal investigator for ICEMAG, said in a 2015 statement about the instrument's selection. \"Knowledge of the ocean properties helps us understand Europa's evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface.\" Zurbuchen said that NASA was still committed to the overall Europa Clipper mission, but instituted the cost trigger process to manage the mission's overall costs and avoid increases that could upset the overall balance of the agency's planetary science programs. \"We consider it a critical part of the mission portfolio of NASA Science, and am looking forward to see this development mature towards flight,\" he wrote in the memo. The Europa Clipper mission benefitted for years from the patronage of Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who became chairman of the subcommittee that funds NASA four years ago. Culberson was an unusually staunch advocate for both Europa Clipper and a follow-on lander, providing funding for the mission far above any NASA request for them. In the final fiscal year 2019 funding bill, passed in February but whose NASA provisions were finalized late last year, Europa Clipper received $545 million, more than double NASA's request of $264.7 million. Culberson, though, lost re-election last November. While NASA says it remains committed to flying Europa Clipper, the mission is unlikely to see the increased funding provided to accelerate its development. The 2019 spending bill set a 2023 deadline for launching the mission, a year later than previous bills, but NASA's statement about the removal of ICEMAG said only that it plans to launch Europa Clipper \"in the 2020s.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-replace-europa-clipper-instrument/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter Gets $600M in NASA's 2020 Budget Request", "date": "2019-03-12", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission could receive $600 million for the fiscal year that begins in October, according to budget request documents released Monday by President Donald Trump's administration. Those documents also suggest that NASA will look to launch the spacecraft on a commercial rocket, rather than on a government rocket, which the administration states would save more than $700 million. The Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will explore Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons and one of scientists' top contenders for a spot to find life beyond Earth. Researchers believe the moon hides a global liquid ocean beneath its icy shell; if the rocky surface below that ocean is geologically active, it could tick all the boxes that life seems to require. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether those requirements are present. The funding news comes in the wake of a NASA decision to remove one of the previously approved instruments from the spacecraft, a magnetometer called Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry. NASA cited cost concerns as its motivation and noted that it would look for a new, simpler magnetometer to fly on the probe. Such an instrument would be crucial for confirming that Europa features a global liquid ocean, characterizing that water and measuring the thickness of the ice shell above it. The spacecraft design is currently undergoing its final review and is not yet being built. The budget request may address one of the team's lingering uncertainties in planning the mission: what rocket NASA would use to launch the probe. The mission requires the heft of either a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which has flown once, or NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, which has never flown. Rocket choice will affect both the project's budget and its mission schedule: Riding by SLS, the probe would arrive within about three years; by Falcon Heavy, it would get there within five or six years. The Europa Clipper funding is part of a $2.6 billion budget request for planetary science. These documents represent only what NASA and the Trump administration would like to prioritize and accomplish in the coming year; actual budgets must be determined by Congress.

The magnetometer, known as ICEMAG, was intended to collect data that could help to determine whether Europa's ice-covered ocean is capable of hosting life, in part by measuring the water's salt content. But on 5 March, NASA said that it had cancelled plans to build ICEMAG, citing increased costs. \"This is a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever,\" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who is on the Europa Clipper science team. \"Why throw it off?\" NASA plans to replace ICEMAG with a simpler, and cheaper, magnetometer that would gather less-detailed observations of Europa's ocean. The decision stoked outrage this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas - especially when it emerged that NASA's planetary-science division, which is developing the Europa Clipper, is also facing large increases in the cost of its next Mars mission. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's planetary-science division, said the agency was trying to reduce risk by eliminating ICEMAG from the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch in 2023. NASA says that ICEMAG's estimated price tag grew from nearly US$30 million in February 2017 to more than $45 million two years later. Others dispute those numbers, saying they include costs that should not have been charged to ICEMAG - and note that the team working on the magnetometer had offered alternative designs that would have been simpler and cheaper to build. But NASA decided to work with another, as-yet-unnamed group of scientists to build the simpler instrument. The decision to cut ICEMAG \"is the hammer coming down a lot faster than anyone expected,\" says Schmidt. Several scientists at the planetary-science conference questioned why the Europa mission was losing out even as the budget of another flagship NASA mission, the $2.4-billion rover planned to launch to Mars in 2020, has ballooned, mostly because of delays in instrument development. \"The Europa mission as a whole is doing great,\" said Kurt Retherford, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, to Glaze. Yet \"you didn't say anything about the cost problems on Mars2020\". Glaze said that Mars2020 had overrun its budget by less than 15%, but woudl not give an exact figure. The added cost probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, compared with increases in the tens of millions for the Europa magnetometer. But there are crucial differences between the missions: the Mars2020 project is much further along in development, at a stage at which instruments have already been built and are being installed on the spacecraft. By contrast, NASA is still designing the Europa Clipper mission. And as Glaze noted, an August report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine singled out the Europa Clipper mission as needing to be carefully tracked to stay within budget. \"The intent here is to show that NASA is taking the National Academies' direction seriously,\" Glaze said. But some feel the Europa mission is being made too much of an example. \"To those not involved in the process, this news came as a complete surprise,\" said a 13 March statement from a group of scientists that consults with NASA on missions to the outer Solar System. NASA also recently cut nearly all of the $10 million allocated to analyse the last bits of data collected by another mission, the Cassini spacecraft that plunged to its death in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017. Finishing the analysis of data from Cassini's final year would have supported a number of graduate students and early-career scientists, the group said. Some of the final Cassini data products, it wrote, \"may simply not be developed\".

In fact, it's not a satellite dish at all. It's a high-gain antenna, and a future version of it will send and receive signals to and from Earth from a looping orbit around Jupiter. The antenna will take that long journey aboard NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa to see whether the icy orb could harbor conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe there's a massive salty ocean beneath Europa's icy surface. The antenna will beam back high-resolution images and scientific data from Europa Clipper's cameras and science instruments. The full-scale prototype antenna, which at 10 feet tall is the same height as a standard basketball hoop, is in the Experimental Test Range at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley are testing the prototype in the ETR in order to assess its performance and demonstrate the high pointing accuracies required for the Europa Clipper mission. The ETR is an indoor electromagnetic test facility that allows researchers to characterize transmitters, receivers, antennas and other electromagnetic components and subsystems in a scientifically controlled environment. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"said Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" Tests on this prototype antenna are scheduled to wrap up soon; however, researchers plan to return to the ETR in 2020 to conduct additional tests on Europa Clipper's high-gain antenna flight article.

The HGA will be used to keep the Clipper in contact with mission control as it conducts a series of flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scheduled to launch sometime between 2022 and 2025, the Europa Clipper mission, as its name suggests, is tasked with making the first up-close, detailed study of the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it's believed to possess an ocean sealed beneath its icy crust that is twice the volume of all of Earth's seas and is arguably the most likely place in the solar system to find life outside of our planet. The problem is that studying Europa is actually a much more complex job than visiting, for example, Mars, so the Europa Clipper is still undergoing a lot of basic design work as NASA determines exactly what its mission objectives and parameters will be. However, one thing is clear, the Clipper will not go into orbit around Europa. Not only would that be much too expensive in terms of propellant, but the area is far too radioactive for the probe's electronics. Instead, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and carry out a series of 45 close flybys of the moon, during which it will study the characteristics and chemistry of the ice crust and the Europan world ocean, as well as the general geology of the moon. One of the most important bits of equipment on the Clipper is the HGA, which will act as the primary communications link with Earth as the unmanned probe takes up to seven years to reach Jupiter and conducts its over three-year science mission after arrival. Resembling a domestic satellite dish, the HGA is 10 ft tall and is being tested by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley. The goal is to make sure that the HGA is built to standard and has the required accuracy to keep pointed at Earth across 460 million mi. The ETR was chosen to ascertain this because it has the ability to make the close tests required. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"says Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" NASA says that the current tests will end soon, but will resume next year as the design matures.

Notably hidden among the budget items, however, was a $100 million allocation to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Nuclear rocket propulsion has long been theorized and researched, but no fully-produced version exists yet today. A nuclear thermal rocket, as the name suggests, is a rocket motor powered by a nuclear reactor. Aboard the spacecraft, a tank of hydrogen fuel is stored at supercool temperatures at -252 K. When the rocket is ready to be turned on, the hydrogen is pumped from its tank through a series of pipes into the nuclear reactor vessel where the hydrogen is heated into plasma and expelled through the rocket nozzle at high velocities. The amount of thrust a rocket can produce depends on both the temperature and the molecular weight of the expelled molecule; in both regards, a nuclear rocket is superior to a chemical rocket because of its higher exhaust temperature and lower molecular weight of fuel. Nuclear rockets, depending on design, can achieve exhaust temperatures ranging from 2750 K to as high as 21,000 K. For reference, most chemical rockets only go as high as 5,555 K. Because chemical rockets involve reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, the exhaust gas is mainly water vapor, while the exhaust gas of a nuclear rocket is pure hydrogen. This means that even the coolest form of a nuclear rocket can produce twice the power of a chemical rocket. NASA has experimented with nuclear propulsion in the past. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program was a nuclear experimentation program run jointly by NASA and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. The program's goal was to establish a technological baseline for nuclear propulsion; several engines were test-fired in configurations that could be adapted to production-ready spaceflight. However, the program was canceled in 1972 when public support waivered and plans to send humans to Mars were canceled by Congress. Any plans to use a nuclear rocket focused on utilizing it as a second stage once the craft had entered deep space; this would avoid contaminating Earth's atmosphere with the radioactive byproduct. While we don't know exactly what NASA will produce with its $100 million allocation, a flight demonstration mission has been planned for 2024.

Data was collected during several hundred supersonic test runs in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley of a scale model of the Block 1 Cargo vehicle that is the currently mandated booster for the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. The first of six major testing campaigns began last year and are being conducted at NASA wind tunnels across the United States in support of the SLS Program's design analysis of the new configuration. The aerodynamic data is used to refine analysis and modeling of the vehicle's atmospheric trajectories, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, and structural loading. Testing is planned to cover the early phase of flight all the way out to Solid Rocket Booster separation, going back to the liftoff period to measure the effect of ground winds on the rocket, and also before liftoff while sitting on the Mobile Launcher. Supersonic Mach range test campaign for new SLS vehicle config. A 0.8-percent scale model of the SLS Block 1 Cargo configuration was set up in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley for this round of aerodynamics testing. \"We did about seven hundred runs, that was covering the Mach range in different pitches and rolls,\" Courtney Winski, a research aerospace engineer at NASA Langley, said in an interview. \"We just completed that test, that was Mach 1.5 to 4.5.\" During test runs, the wind tunnel was run at a set velocity and then data was taken as the model was moved through different orientations. \"We are varying angle of attack and roll, so we're doing pitch and roll combinations or alpha- roll combinations along with Mach number combinations, doing the same sets of pitch and roll at different Mach numbers,\" Winski explained. \"We did continuous runs and so we would set the model at a roll angle or at a pitch angle and then continuously take data while we either pitched at a set roll angle or rolled at a set pitch angle. And so we took about seven hundred of those runs over the Mach range. The entire testing took about a month, but that wasn't all run time, it was about three weeks of actual 'wind on' running in the Unitary.\" This model is configured with the shorter, 14-meter Delta 4 payload fairing that would encapsulate Europa Clipper. The \"Jupiter Direct\" trajectory is performance-challenging for the Block 1 vehicle and the shorter fairing saves weight over the longer, 19-meter PLF. \"A single run where we would pitch about twenty-four degrees just to kind of completely cover every option would take a little over a minute, where it was sitting at a single Mach number,\" she noted. The same data set would be collected in another run at another Mach number until the whole range was covered. \"The way that we would qualify it as is that the flight is quasi static in terms of Mach number,\" Jeremy Pinier, NASA's SLS Aerodynamics Team Lead at Langley, said in the interview. \"From liftoff to booster separation, that's around two minutes, so it goes from Mach zero to Mach four and a half in two minutes but that's actually pretty long and so we consider the state of the flow as quasi static.\" \"So we can go in the wind tunnel and sit at a Mach number and take data, take all the data we need at that Mach number and then go to the next Mach number, take all the data we need there and then create those databases where the GNC guys will be able to take our database and slice through this database even though in the wind tunnel we were statically sitting at a Mach number.\" \"The main data that we're collecting was force and moment data on the model,\" Winski noted. \"On this model we did not have pressure ports, but we did have the pressure sensitive paint .\" The luminescent paint provides visual data of the distribution of pressure over the model during wind tunnel testing. \"There are special lights on the tunnel,\" Winski noted. \"How much it actually causes the model to luminesce, because it's reacting with how much oxygen is in the air, is related to the pressure that it is seeing, how much light is luminescing off of it.\" \"We would have to sit at a condition for like thirty seconds or so and they would take images with the model just sitting still with conditions not changing.\" \"For this test what we actually did is we ran the model without paint for all of the force and moment testing and then once we completed the force and moment testing the model was painted for PSP,\" she added. \"If we were to retest this model later on for force and moment we would actually remove the PSP paint before testing.\" \"The paint is very sensitive, we can only use it for one test,\" Pinier said. \"It's sensitive to light, it's sensitive to oils on your hands, so if you touch the model it can damage the paint. So we paint it once for each test and then we can remove it and paint it again.\" \"What you saw in the picture with Courtney is the traditional pressure sensitive paint, steady pressure sensitive paint,\" he noted. \"It's a pretty mature technology, it's used in many institutions, in many labs and wind tunnels.\" A new, unsteady pressure sensitive paint is still in development but may be applied to future testing. \"We've already run a few exploratory tests using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint and it's shown very promising results,\" Pinier noted. \"We're thinking at some point we'll be able to characterize the buffet environment using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint. I say at some point because it needs validation, this technology needs to be validated first.\" Pad rollout to Boost phase aerodynamics Current testing is focused on the Block 1 Cargo configuration. \"We're just focusing this one right now because we've already done a lot of testing on all the other configurations,\" Pinier said. \"This Block 1 Cargo configuration was completely new to us when it came out and we had to start a whole testing campaign for that one specifically.\" The testing is intended to create an aerodynamic database for the vehicle configuration, from rolling out to the launch pad through liftoff, through the Boost phase of flight that goes through SRB separation and beyond. \"At liftoff you've got the ground winds that are pushing on the vehicle and the tower and those two are connected,\" Pinier explained. \"We're really interested in the ground wind loads on the tower and the vehicle, just static loads from winds from all directions, north, south, east, west.\" \"They're also interested in when they are rolling out the vehicle on the Mobile Launcher from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad there's also ground wind environments there.\" \"At T-0 you're really at ninety degrees angle of attack with the wind perpendicular to the vehicle,\" he added. \"As the vehicle accelerates that angle of attack reduces very quickly down to single digits in degrees. And so during ascent, subsonic all the way to supersonic Mach numbers we test at low angles of attack, meaning below eight degrees angle of attack. And really the vehicle is going to fly below four degrees angle of attack.\" \"As you're accelerating you go through Mach 1, you know lots of things happen around Mach 1,\" he continued. \"The fluid dynamics around Mach 1, speed of sound, are very non-linear. The unsteady pressure environment on the vehicle is the highest and that's what creates buffet. Basically you can think of it as the air kind of shaking the vehicle structure around Mach 1.\" \"The buffet is all of the low-frequency type of shaking of the vehicle that happens around transonic Mach numbers and the aeroacoustics is all of the higher-frequency shaking that happens in this airflow as it's going over the vehicle.\" \"So you go through Mach 1, you get past peak buffet loads and then you get to maximum dynamic pressure, which is when basically the force of the air on the vehicle, the static force is the highest,\" he continued. \"You get max dynamic pressure between Mach 1 and 2. The loads guys are mostly interested in the static loads on the vehicle during that phase in flight.\" \"And then you accelerate and everything in the environments start to tail off. Aeroacoustics is still present but it's also tailing off.\" \"Some of the things we look at as we get to higher and higher altitudes and close to booster separation is something called plume induced flow separation,\" he added. \"The plumes of the vehicle as you've probably seen when the rocket launches and gets to high altitude become very underexpanded, meaning they become very large and they can induce local separation of the flow on the back of the vehicle so we try to look at that at the highest Mach numbers.\" \"And then you get to booster separation around Mach 4, Mach 5, and that's where we have to characterize that environment to make sure that the boosters don't come back and contact the Core Stage.\" Testing to build aero database for design analysis of new vehicle configuration Testing all of those regions in the early phase of flight involves wind tunnels at NASA centers across the country. \"We tested at the Marshall fourteen-inch trisonic tunnel to get some data quickly,\" Pinier said. \"We can test quickly in that tunnel and get the data for initial design cycles; however, very quickly for this one we needed mature data so where we've got is we're probably in the middle of a testing campaign that comprises six large wind tunnel tests. This picture that you saw was from the test at the Langley Unitary Wind Tunnel to cover the high supersonic Mach range.\" \"We have also run a wind tunnel test at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to cover the subsonic to about Mach 2.5 range for ascent, that was a 1.3 percent scale model,\" he added. \"We are current getting set up to run a liftoff test at the Langley fourteen by twenty-two wind tunnel to cover the liftoff phase of flight and a 1.75 percent scale model along with a 1.75 percent scale Mobile Launcher. We're trying to characterize the liftoff environment with winds from all directions and basically the entire rollout to liftoff phase of flight.\" \"We're going to have a wind tunnel test this summer at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to characterize the aeroacoustics environment - transonic and low supersonic aeroacoustic environments,\" he continued. \"So we're going to have a transonic buffet environment test at the TDT or Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Langley, that's going to occur next calendar year and that's to characterize the unsteady buffet environment as the vehicle goes through the transonic Mach numbers.\" \"The sixth one is going to be a booster separation wind tunnel test at the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel and that's going to be a static 0.9 percent scale model. Those tests are pretty standard, those are critical phases of flight where we need to get that data right and so we rely heavily on wind tunnels for those critical databases.\" \"For pretty much every configuration of the Space Launch System family we've run those tests,\" Pinier added. \"We're just doing it all over for this particular configuration.\" Data feeds into two areas of design analysis work The database being generated for this vehicle configuration from the wind tunnel testing is used by different design groups. \"There's really two customers for us - for the aerodynamics team,\" Pinier explained. \"One of them is the trajectory and guidance navigation and control teams. They are interested in databases to cover the entire Mach range.\" \"We take force and moment data for the entire Mach range and we put it in databases, give that to them,\" he added. \"They design trajectories, they run Monte Carlo simulations...in dispersed flight conditions throughout the entire Boost phase. So that's one of the customers - integrated forces and moments go to GN&C and trajectory.\" \"The second customer is the loads team,\" he continued. \"They're interested in the aerodynamic loading on the vehicle and in this case they are really interested in the peak loading phases of flight.\" On the right, a Schlieren image of a 0.8 percent scale model of the vehicle in Langley's supersonic wind tunnel at a supersonic Mach number. The force-moment and pressure data collected in the wind tunnel tests validates and is fed back into the analytical models. \"So for example, buffet. We don't have to characterize buffet throughout the entire Boost phase because we know buffet peaks around Mach 1 so we focus on transonic conditions for buffet environment.\" \"Aeroacoustics, we know those go a little higher than that so we characterize aeroacoustic environments all the way up to Mach two and a half and the aeroacoustics environment is also an environment that goes to the loads team.\" \"So those are the two biggest products, the aeroacoustics and the buffet, that go to the loads team that are kind of critical,\" Pinier said. \"A third one would be just the static loading, the distribution of the loading during ascent.\" \"It's not a driver for design, but we produce that. That comes mostly out of CFD, basically the distribution of the pressures over the entire vehicle as it goes through the Boost phase, but now that we have pressure sensitive paint when we're doing force-moment measurements we try to do this pressure sensitive paint measurement in order to validate the CFD.\" \"Those are models that the loads team have and they apply and they add those models gusts and wind shear and they add those models on top of what we give them in terms of environments,\" Pinier said. \"There's no way to measure that in a ground test environment.\" Block 1 Cargo is a new config under analysis The Block 1 Cargo configuration was studied earlier in the program, but more detailed design analysis began last year when the SLS option of flying the Europa Clipper spacecraft was moved back to the Block 1 vehicle as a part of Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. SLS is still the mandated launch vehicle for Europa Clipper, but also remains a source of disagreement between the Trump Administration and Congress. Congress mostly recently retained the SLS mandate in the language in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations passed in mid-February. Although the FY 2019 appropriations were signed by the President, the Administration remains opposed to using SLS for Europa; as in past years, their Fiscal Year 2020 Budget submission that followed in mid-March continues to advocate use of U.S. commercial launch services. Two other launch options on heavy-lift commercial vehicles would perform one or more gravity assist flybys past Earth and/or Venus; the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with any of these options. Congress and the Administration did reach agreement on one mandate also written into law, regarding the launch date. Previously, Congress enacted a 2022 launch mandate and the Administration proposed launch in 2025; the FY 2019 appropriations were passed with a 2023 launch target and the Administration's FY 2020 budget request supports this. While the \"Jupiter Direct\" launch mandate remains in place, the SLS Program continues design work on the general configuration and the specific mission, referred to as Science Mission-1. \"This cargo configuration as you probably know is for the Europa Clipper mission and there are two potential fairings, a short one and a long one and currently the primary one we're testing is the short one,\" Pinier said. The Block 1 vehicles use a derivative of United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy upper stage and the Delta's payload fairing system would also be used to encapsulate the spacecraft in the SLS launch option. The short fairing is approximately 14 meters long, the long fairing is approximately 19 meters long. \"It makes a lot of sense once you're in the wind tunnel to go ahead and test several configurations, so we have done some testing on the long configuration but currently the shorter one is the priority,\" Pinier added.

Europa Clipper is currently scheduled to launch in 2023 to orbit the moon for more than three years, studying its icy shell and suspected internal ocean, among other features. Europa Lander would follow in its wake and touch down on the ice in order to better investigate the possibility of life. But according to a nine-month investigation conducted by the NASA Office of Inspector General, both missions are facing a host of serious issues as their teams attempt to balance the needs of NASA and Congress. \"Our audit found that despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, a management analyst at the Office of Inspector General, said in a video released with the report. The report highlighted that since 2013, Congress has provided more than $2 billion for the pair of Europa missions. The Clipper mission alone is expected to cost at least $2.8 billion, according to the report. Every year of that period, the missions' funding has exceeded NASA's budget request. But with all that money has come a lot of strings. First, Congress has ordered NASA to launch both missions on the agency's SLS rocket, which is still in development. Congress also set specific launch targets - currently 2023 for Europa Clipper and 2025 for Europa Lander. Those two directives may be contradictory. Experts were already worried about the rocket's development; these concerns aren't just a problem for Europa, they also could affect projects like NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. But for Europa specifically, the first flight version of the SLS definitely won't be able to do the job for Europa Lander, and it's not clear yet whether it can successfully launch Europa Clipper, the investigation found. Clipper may need, and Lander will definitely need, a more advanced version of the rocket aiming to fly in 2024 but also predicted to slip. NASA also has not yet ordered a vital part of the SLS that the investigation found requires 52 months to produce - which it should have done in September to be ready in time for a summer 2023 launch. Because of these SLS problems, NASA's budget request released earlier this year also raises the possibility of launching on a commercial vehicle. The Clipper team has attempted to work around this problem by still considering the possibility that they'll be switched to ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, both of which are already flying. But the continuing uncertainty \"creates added risks and uncertainties for an already challenging project,\" the investigation found. Another challenge the investigation found is that the Clipper mission is struggling to manage its staffing. The mission is run out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But as of December, about 10% of Clipper's JPL staff roles were vacant, the investigation found, in part because the center is running four other key NASA projects, including Mars 2020, and keeps having to shuffle staff members between the neediest missions. The investigation also found that Clipper suffered from an instrument- selection process that tried to be too wary of conflicts of interest. Clipper team members with perceived conflicts of interest - but also vital knowledge about the mission - were either cut out of the instrument-selection process or given insufficient time to review insufficient information, according to the investigation., which was designed to measure the magnetic field around the moon, replacing it with a simpler version. The investigation did not explicitly link that decision to the instrument-selection issues it identified.) The report found similar issues plaguing the Europa Lander mission as well, although that project is in a more preliminary stage and NASA has not yet formally committed to launching it. The investigation also raised concerns that by scheduling the Lander to launch so soon after Clipper, it won't be able to fully integrate its predecessor's discoveries into its mission plan. The investigation team concluded with 10 recommendations it believes can help NASA get the Europa projects back on track and avoid similar issues in the future. Those recommendations include evaluating JPL's overall staffing, rescheduling mission milestones more realistically and making sure mission- related estimates reflect the risks associated with the SLS.

The audit also noted that the Europa program's biggest backer, John Culberson, no longer chairs the House appropriations subcommittee. The Republican Congressman from Texas was defeated in his reelection bid last year. The audit found that the Space Launch System (SLS) would probably not be available in time for the orbiter's planned launch in 2023. Congress has mandated the program use SLS for both missions. Using SLS would also be more expensive than using commercially available rockets such as Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy. The audit projected cost savings of at least $276 million from using the other launchers. The cost of up to $450 million for the Falcon Heavy appears to high. SpaceX has advertised Falcon Heavy launches at between $90 million and $150 million. \"These are conservative estimates for a commercial launch during this time frame; specific launch costs for the Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy are procurement sensitive,\" the audit stated. Cost, however, is not the only factor. The report notes that SLS would be capable of doing a direct trajectory to Europa, cutting four years off the transit time. This would allow the orbiter to collect far more data at the moon before NASA launches a lander there. Launching on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV would require gravity assist maneuvers that would take more time and require a beefed up spacecraft. \"Launching on a commercial launch vehicle will also subject Clipper to a more severe thermal environment requiring additional thermal and ultraviolet protection, which are already designed into the spacecraft,\" the audit found. \"The risks associated with a gravity assist flight trajectory need to be resolved prior to the Agency establishing the project's cost and schedule baseline.\" The report stated that NASA is studying whether the Falcon Heavy could send the orbiter on a Venus-Earth gravity assist that would reduce transit time and thermal exposure near Venus. Complicating the choice of a booster is that if the Europa Clipper orbiter misses its planned 2023 launch date, it could not be launched the next year due to a lack of a planetary alignment. NASA must also weight booster reliability. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launcher has flown two successful flights with no failures., with four more flights on the manifest through 2022. The audit noted the launcher would have to go through certification before it could launch the costly Europa mission. \"While the U.S. Air Force purchased Falcon Heavy launches in 2018, the vehicle would need to pass additional flight testing (known as Category-3 certification) for high priority, very high complexity,or high-cost payloads-descriptions that apply to the Europa Clipper mission,\" the audit stated. \"As part of this NASA certification process, the Falcon Heavy would need to have accomplished three successful flights by the Clipper's launch readiness date,\" the audit added. Reliability is also a concern with SLS, which is scheduled to launch for the first time in late 2020 or early 2021. \"Although the SLS will have had minimal flight history if the Europa Clipper is launched in the 2023 time frame, senior NASA managers believe the extensive quality assurance testing required to human-rate the vehicle will provide the needed confidence levels to meet the intent of commercial launch vehicle certification requirements,\" the audit said. Delta IV boosters have launched 37 times, including 10 Delta IV variants. All were successful except the first Delta IV Heavy flight, which suffered a partial failure. However, United Launch Alliance's plan to switch to the new Vulcan Centaur booster while phasing out the Delta IV line could result in higher costs. \"To support a Clipper launch with the Delta IV Heavy, NASA would have to provide more money upfront to keep production lines open and is at risk of having to shoulder some of the cost of maintaining the site required to launch that particular rocket, potentially increasing launch costs significantly if Clipper is the last Delta IV Heavy launch,\" the audit found. To get the project back on track, the audit made 10 recommendations related to staffing, budget, schedule and related issues. NASA concurred with nine of the recommendations, but did concur with the second one. 2. Reassess the Clipper Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level with launch vehicle risks for the Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, and SLS prior to Key Decision Point-C and establishing the Agency Baseline Commitment. \"Management did not concur with Recommendation 2, stating that Congress directed NASA to use the SLS launch vehicle and that directive justified its decision not to model the other launch vehicles in the project's JCL,\" the audit stated. \"We disagree and find this response inconsistent with the Agency's Cost Estimating Handbook which states that a JCL analysis should integrate cost, schedule, risk, and uncertainty. The Handbook also states that launch vehicle costs and associated risks shall be included in JCL calculations to ensure they are integrated into the entire project scope to aid management decision making,\" the report added.

The team building the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of nine science instruments on board NASA's Europa Clipper mission to make multiple flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa, has passed its critical design review (CDR) and has begun construction of the flight instrument and other systems. PIMS, built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, will measure the plasmas, or electrically charged gasses, in Europa's ionosphere (the moon's upper atmosphere) and Jupiter's magnetosphere (created by the planet's magnetic field). These plasma measurements will contribute to other data used to determine the thickness of the ice shell that covers Europa, and the depth and makeup of the liquid-water ocean below that shell. PIMS will do this by taking advantage of the rapidly flowing plasma that connects Europa to Jupiter. This plasma, which moves at more than 220,000 miles per hour and rotates with Jupiter, constantly ebbs and flows over Europa, much like water in a stream over a rock. The plasma interacts with neutral and ionized gasses surrounding Europa and with ices on the surface of the moon, producing radiation damage, ionization and other effects that will modify the ice composition. \"We put PIMS through extremely thorough testing, and we're excited to begin construction of our flight instrument,\" said APL's Joseph Westlake, the instrument's principal investigator. \"In addition to vibration and shock testing, we simulated every environment that PIMS will experience from Earth to Europa, and it passed with flying colors.\" The instrument - which is shielded to protect it from the high radiation around Jupiter - has two identical sensors mounted on opposite sides of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The two sensors provide a large entrance to study the plasma. The plasma sensors are Faraday cups, which capture and measure the current from charged particles in the plasma. When combined with magnetic field data, information from PIMS will help reveal details about Europa's structure unable to be determined from Earth-based observations. PIMS is being built by Johns Hopkins APL; the University of Michigan is contributing critical electronic components. The PIMS science team includes researchers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Oregon and the University of Michigan. The Europa Clipper mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The multiple-flyby concept was developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins APL, which is building the PIMS and Europa Imaging System (EIS) instruments and providing the spacecraft's communication and propulsion systems.

But that hasn't killed the dream of sending something, anything, to that corner of the solar system. NASA had planned to launch the Europa Clipper mission in 2022 to circle Jupiter and pass Europa dozens of times. The idea was to swoop low and check for elements of life by analyzing particles of ice, water, and rock that may be spewing out from the moon's surface like the spray of a geyser. But the ambitious $2 billion mission has stumbled. Earlier this year, the launch date slipped from 2022 to 2023, and there's still no rocket to get it there. NASA's Space Launch System rocket is behind schedule and over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office, while a commercial rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy would take twice as long to reach Europa from Earth as the SLS, which can make the trip in about three years. NASA is hoping to start building the Europa Clipper spacecraft later this year while both rocket systems continue testing. But a NASA Inspector General report released in May found that space agency officials underestimated both the time and money needed to get the Europa Clipper mission off the ground. Meanwhile, a follow-up mission to be launched two years after-called Europa Lander, which would put some kind of device on the crusty surface-has become less certain. The report concluded that, given the current pace of work, that mission could not even consider launching until 2030. Still, all is not lost for fans of Europa and the possibility of finding something amazing there (even if it's not an astronaut-munching creature as depicted in the 2013 sci-fi thriller \"Europa Report\"). Even with the recent budgetary and logistical problems, planetary scientists are pretty excited about building and testing devices to help them uncover life once a mission does reach the planet's orbit or even its surface. \"We are looking at what we will do when we get there,\" says Cynthia Phillips, a member of the Europa mission science team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We have two sets of arrival dates. We are looking at what trajectories we can use and what kinds of observations we will make once we get there.\" Phillips says Europa is a special place. It's only about the size of our own moon, but its icy surface hides an ocean 60 miles deep that contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \"It is one of the best places to look for life in the solar system beyond Earth,\" she says. Because gravity is weaker on Europa than here, the pressure at the bottom of this super-deep ocean is about the same as the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Earth's deepest spot at about 36,000 feet. Europa might even be better than other icy moons, because its seas have a rocky bottom instead of being sandwiched between layers of ice, as on neighboring moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's Enceladus and Titan. That environment could be an ideal place to find hydrothermal vents that spew minerals into the ocean and, perhaps, creatures that evolved to harvest them. Marine scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who explore Earth's hydrothermal vents have been working with NASA to devise autonomous underwater vehicles that could work on both Earth and Europa. The agency just announced a $7.6 million, five-year collaboration with WHOI to have space and ocean researchers brainstorm the science and technology needed for future Europa missions. Even though a landing on Europa is more than a decade away, some engineers are already testing drills to burrow through the ice sheet to the life-giving ocean below. A Brooklyn-based space company called Honeybee Robotics is planning a plutonium-powered probe with a rotating drill head that would take three years to work its way through the ice. The team now has prototypes of the device, called SLUSH (Search for Life Using a Submersible Heated Drill), drilling through icy cryochambers in the firm's Pasadena lab. \"These technologies are just over the horizon,\" said Honeybee's Tighe Costa at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held last week in Seattle. Then there's the plutonium-powered TunnelBot, which can drill and sample subsurface life. That's being developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center. There's also ARCHIMEDES (A Really Cool High-Impact Method for Exploring Down into the Europan Subsurface), designed by Austin-based Stone Aerospace, which will use lasers to melt the ice. These devices have a host of engineering obstacles to surmount in the coming years. They have to carry their own power supply, take samples without damaging any potential life form with a radiation leak, and transmit data back to Europa's surface, and then back to scientists on Earth. So while NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and China race to put humans back on the lifeless moon or faraway Mars, a more exciting (albeit slow-motion) race is underway to reach a tiny moon that may be hiding a big secret.

In a March 5 statement, NASA said that it would no longer pursue development of the Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry instrument, a magnetometer designed to measure the magnetic field around the icy moon of Jupiter. ICEMAG was one of nine instruments originally selected by NASA in 2015 for development for the Europa Clipper mission. NASA said that the increasing cost of ICEMAG, still in its preliminary design phase, led to its removal from the mission. \"I believe this decision was necessary as a result of continued, significant cost growth and remaining high cost risk for this investigation,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a memo. In that memo, he said that ICEMAG exceeded a \"cost trigger\" last summer that had been put in place for it and other instruments to keep costs under control. That cost trigger escalated reviews of the instrument all the way to NASA Headquarters, including a briefing there Feb. 14. The key problem with the instrument was accommodating its \"scalar vector helium sensors,\" used to measure the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. Zurbuchen said in the memo that, at the time of the February review, ICEMAG's estimated cost has grown to $45.6 million, $16 million above its original cost trigger and $8.3 million above a revised cost trigger established just a month earlier. That cost was also three times above the original estimate in the ICEMAG proposal. \"The level of cost growth on ICEMAG is not acceptable, and NASA considers the investigation to possess significant potential for additional cost growth,\" Zurbuchen wrote in the memo. \"As a result, I decided to terminate the ICEMAG investigation.\" NASA will instead pursue options for \"a simpler, less complex\" magnetometer on Europa Clipper, although the announcement contained few details about how that will be accomplished. Scientists who were part of the ICEMAG team will be invited to remain on the overall mission science team. \"A magnetometer investigation brings significant value to Europa science and exploration,\" Zurbchen said in the statement about ICEMAG's removal. \"We have enough time before launch to find such a replacement and will move quickly to implement this.\" Scientists consider the inclusion of a magnetometer particularly valuable for probing the interior of Europa, thought to contain a global ocean of liquid water. Data from the magnetometer on the Galileo spacecraft, which performed many flybys of Europa, detected variations in Jupiter's magnetic field in the vicinity of the moon that scientists said were likely caused by the presence of an electrically conductive fluid, like water, beneath the surface. Scientists had hoped ICEMAG would provide more detailed magnetic field measurements that could constrain the depth, thickness and salinity of the ocean. That would help scientists assess the potential habitability of Europa, a key goal of the overall Europa Clipper mission. \"The nature of the subsurface ocean and how it interacts with the surface is critical to evaluating Europa's potential habitability,\" Carol Raymond of JPL, the principal investigator for ICEMAG, said in a 2015 statement about the instrument's selection. \"Knowledge of the ocean properties helps us understand Europa's evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface.\" Zurbuchen said that NASA was still committed to the overall Europa Clipper mission, but instituted the cost trigger process to manage the mission's overall costs and avoid increases that could upset the overall balance of the agency's planetary science programs. \"We consider it a critical part of the mission portfolio of NASA Science, and am looking forward to see this development mature towards flight,\" he wrote in the memo. The Europa Clipper mission benefitted for years from the patronage of Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who became chairman of the subcommittee that funds NASA four years ago. Culberson was an unusually staunch advocate for both Europa Clipper and a follow-on lander, providing funding for the mission far above any NASA request for them. In the final fiscal year 2019 funding bill, passed in February but whose NASA provisions were finalized late last year, Europa Clipper received $545 million, more than double NASA's request of $264.7 million. Culberson, though, lost re-election last November. While NASA says it remains committed to flying Europa Clipper, the mission is unlikely to see the increased funding provided to accelerate its development. The 2019 spending bill set a 2023 deadline for launching the mission, a year later than previous bills, but NASA's statement about the removal of ICEMAG said only that it plans to launch Europa Clipper \"in the 2020s.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-replace-europa-clipper-instrument/"}, {"title": "Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter Gets $600M in NASA's 2020 Budget Request", "date": "2019-03-12", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission could receive $600 million for the fiscal year that begins in October, according to budget request documents released Monday by President Donald Trump's administration. Those documents also suggest that NASA will look to launch the spacecraft on a commercial rocket, rather than on a government rocket, which the administration states would save more than $700 million. The Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will explore Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons and one of scientists' top contenders for a spot to find life beyond Earth. Researchers believe the moon hides a global liquid ocean beneath its icy shell; if the rocky surface below that ocean is geologically active, it could tick all the boxes that life seems to require. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether those requirements are present. The funding news comes in the wake of a NASA decision to remove one of the previously approved instruments from the spacecraft, a magnetometer called Interior Characterization of Europa Using Magnetometry. NASA cited cost concerns as its motivation and noted that it would look for a new, simpler magnetometer to fly on the probe. Such an instrument would be crucial for confirming that Europa features a global liquid ocean, characterizing that water and measuring the thickness of the ice shell above it. The spacecraft design is currently undergoing its final review and is not yet being built. The budget request may address one of the team's lingering uncertainties in planning the mission: what rocket NASA would use to launch the probe. The mission requires the heft of either a SpaceX Falcon Heavy, which has flown once, or NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, which has never flown. Rocket choice will affect both the project's budget and its mission schedule: Riding by SLS, the probe would arrive within about three years; by Falcon Heavy, it would get there within five or six years. The Europa Clipper funding is part of a $2.6 billion budget request for planetary science.

The magnetometer, known as ICEMAG, was intended to collect data that could help to determine whether Europa's ice-covered ocean is capable of hosting life, in part by measuring the water's salt content. But on 5 March, NASA said that it had cancelled plans to build ICEMAG, citing increased costs. \"This is a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever,\" says Britney Schmidt, a planetary scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who is on the Europa Clipper science team. \"Why throw it off?\" NASA plans to replace ICEMAG with a simpler, and cheaper, magnetometer that would gather less-detailed observations of Europa's ocean. The decision stoked outrage this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas - especially when it emerged that NASA's planetary-science division, which is developing the Europa Clipper, is also facing large increases in the cost of its next Mars mission. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA's planetary-science division, said the agency was trying to reduce risk by eliminating ICEMAG from the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch in 2023. NASA says that ICEMAG's estimated price tag grew from nearly US$30 million in February 2017 to more than $45 million two years later. Others dispute those numbers, saying they include costs that should not have been charged to ICEMAG - and note that the team working on the magnetometer had offered alternative designs that would have been simpler and cheaper to build. But NASA decided to work with another, as-yet-unnamed group of scientists to build the simpler instrument. The decision to cut ICEMAG \"is the hammer coming down a lot faster than anyone expected,\" says Schmidt. Several scientists at the planetary-science conference questioned why the Europa mission was losing out even as the budget of another flagship NASA mission, the $2.4-billion rover planned to launch to Mars in 2020, has ballooned, mostly because of delays in instrument development. \"The Europa mission as a whole is doing great,\" said Kurt Retherford, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, to Glaze. Yet \"you didn't say anything about the cost problems on Mars2020\". Glaze said that Mars2020 had overrun its budget by less than 15%, but woudl not give an exact figure. The added cost probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, compared with increases in the tens of millions for the Europa magnetometer. But there are crucial differences between the missions: the Mars2020 project is much further along in development, at a stage at which instruments have already been built and are being installed on the spacecraft. By contrast, NASA is still designing the Europa Clipper mission. And as Glaze noted, an August report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine singled out the Europa Clipper mission as needing to be carefully tracked to stay within budget. \"The intent here is to show that NASA is taking the National Academies' direction seriously,\" Glaze said. But some feel the Europa mission is being made too much of an example. \"To those not involved in the process, this news came as a complete surprise,\" said a 13 March statement from a group of scientists that consults with NASA on missions to the outer Solar System. NASA also recently cut nearly all of the $10 million allocated to analyse the last bits of data collected by another mission, the Cassini spacecraft that plunged to its death in Saturn's atmosphere in 2017. Finishing the analysis of data from Cassini's final year would have supported a number of graduate students and early-career scientists, the group said. Some of the final Cassini data products, it wrote, \"may simply not be developed\".

In fact, it's not a satellite dish at all. It's a high-gain antenna, and a future version of it will send and receive signals to and from Earth from a looping orbit around Jupiter. The antenna will take that long journey aboard NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa to see whether the icy orb could harbor conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe there's a massive salty ocean beneath Europa's icy surface. The antenna will beam back high-resolution images and scientific data from Europa Clipper's cameras and science instruments. The full-scale prototype antenna, which at 10 feet tall is the same height as a standard basketball hoop, is in the Experimental Test Range at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley are testing the prototype in the ETR in order to assess its performance and demonstrate the high pointing accuracies required for the Europa Clipper mission. The ETR is an indoor electromagnetic test facility that allows researchers to characterize transmitters, receivers, antennas and other electromagnetic components and subsystems in a scientifically controlled environment. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"said Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" Tests on this prototype antenna are scheduled to wrap up soon; however, researchers plan to return to the ETR in 2020 to conduct additional tests on Europa Clipper's high-gain antenna flight article.

The HGA will be used to keep the Clipper in contact with mission control as it conducts a series of flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scheduled to launch sometime between 2022 and 2025, the Europa Clipper mission, as its name suggests, is tasked with making the first up-close, detailed study of the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it's believed to possess an ocean sealed beneath its icy crust that is twice the volume of all of Earth's seas and is arguably the most likely place in the solar system to find life outside of our planet. The problem is that studying Europa is actually a much more complex job than visiting, for example, Mars, so the Europa Clipper is still undergoing a lot of basic design work as NASA determines exactly what its mission objectives and parameters will be. However, one thing is clear, the Clipper will not go into orbit around Europa. Not only would that be much too expensive in terms of propellant, but the area is far too radioactive for the probe's electronics. Instead, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and carry out a series of 45 close flybys of the moon, during which it will study the characteristics and chemistry of the ice crust and the Europan world ocean, as well as the general geology of the moon. One of the most important bits of equipment on the Clipper is the HGA, which will act as the primary communications link with Earth as the unmanned probe takes up to seven years to reach Jupiter and conducts its over three-year science mission after arrival. Resembling a domestic satellite dish, the HGA is 10 ft tall and is being tested by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley. The goal is to make sure that the HGA is built to standard and has the required accuracy to keep pointed at Earth across 460 million mi. The ETR was chosen to ascertain this because it has the ability to make the close tests required. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"says Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" NASA says that the current tests will end soon, but will resume next year as the design matures.

Notably hidden among the budget items, however, was a $100 million allocation to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Nuclear rocket propulsion has long been theorized and researched, but no fully-produced version exists yet today. A nuclear thermal rocket, as the name suggests, is a rocket motor powered by a nuclear reactor. Aboard the spacecraft, a tank of hydrogen fuel is stored at supercool temperatures at -252 K. When the rocket is ready to be turned on, the hydrogen is pumped from its tank through a series of pipes into the nuclear reactor vessel where the hydrogen is heated into plasma and expelled through the rocket nozzle at high velocities. The amount of thrust a rocket can produce depends on both the temperature and the molecular weight of the expelled molecule; in both regards, a nuclear rocket is superior to a chemical rocket because of its higher exhaust temperature and lower molecular weight of fuel. Nuclear rockets, depending on design, can achieve exhaust temperatures ranging from 2750 K to as high as 21,000 K. For reference, most chemical rockets only go as high as 5,555 K. Because chemical rockets involve reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, the exhaust gas is mainly water vapor, while the exhaust gas of a nuclear rocket is pure hydrogen. This means that even the coolest form of a nuclear rocket can produce twice the power of a chemical rocket. NASA has experimented with nuclear propulsion in the past. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program was a nuclear experimentation program run jointly by NASA and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. The program's goal was to establish a technological baseline for nuclear propulsion; several engines were test-fired in configurations that could be adapted to production-ready spaceflight. However, the program was canceled in 1972 when public support waivered and plans to send humans to Mars were canceled by Congress. Any plans to use a nuclear rocket focused on utilizing it as a second stage once the craft had entered deep space; this would avoid contaminating Earth's atmosphere with the radioactive byproduct. While we don't know exactly what NASA will produce with its $100 million allocation, a flight demonstration mission has been planned for 2024.

Data was collected during several hundred supersonic test runs in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley of a scale model of the Block 1 Cargo vehicle that is the currently mandated booster for the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. The first of six major testing campaigns began last year and are being conducted at NASA wind tunnels across the United States in support of the SLS Program's design analysis of the new configuration. The aerodynamic data is used to refine analysis and modeling of the vehicle's atmospheric trajectories, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, and structural loading. Testing is planned to cover the early phase of flight all the way out to Solid Rocket Booster separation, going back to the liftoff period to measure the effect of ground winds on the rocket, and also before liftoff while sitting on the Mobile Launcher. Supersonic Mach range test campaign for new SLS vehicle config. A 0.8-percent scale model of the SLS Block 1 Cargo configuration was set up in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley for this round of aerodynamics testing. \"We did about seven hundred runs, that was covering the Mach range in different pitches and rolls,\" Courtney Winski, a research aerospace engineer at NASA Langley, said in an interview. \"We just completed that test, that was Mach 1.5 to 4.5.\" During test runs, the wind tunnel was run at a set velocity and then data was taken as the model was moved through different orientations. \"We are varying angle of attack and roll, so we're doing pitch and roll combinations or alpha- roll combinations along with Mach number combinations, doing the same sets of pitch and roll at different Mach numbers,\" Winski explained. \"We did continuous runs and so we would set the model at a roll angle or at a pitch angle and then continuously take data while we either pitched at a set roll angle or rolled at a set pitch angle. And so we took about seven hundred of those runs over the Mach range. The entire testing took about a month, but that wasn't all run time, it was about three weeks of actual 'wind on' running in the Unitary.\" This model is configured with the shorter, 14-meter Delta 4 payload fairing that would encapsulate Europa Clipper. The \"Jupiter Direct\" trajectory is performance-challenging for the Block 1 vehicle and the shorter fairing saves weight over the longer, 19-meter PLF. \"A single run where we would pitch about twenty-four degrees just to kind of completely cover every option would take a little over a minute, where it was sitting at a single Mach number,\" she noted. The same data set would be collected in another run at another Mach number until the whole range was covered. \"The way that we would qualify it as is that the flight is quasi static in terms of Mach number,\" Jeremy Pinier, NASA's SLS Aerodynamics Team Lead at Langley, said in the interview. \"From liftoff to booster separation, that's around two minutes, so it goes from Mach zero to Mach four and a half in two minutes but that's actually pretty long and so we consider the state of the flow as quasi static.\" \"So we can go in the wind tunnel and sit at a Mach number and take data, take all the data we need at that Mach number and then go to the next Mach number, take all the data we need there and then create those databases where the GNC guys will be able to take our database and slice through this database even though in the wind tunnel we were statically sitting at a Mach number.\" \"The main data that we're collecting was force and moment data on the model,\" Winski noted. \"On this model we did not have pressure ports, but we did have the pressure sensitive paint .\" The luminescent paint provides visual data of the distribution of pressure over the model during wind tunnel testing. \"There are special lights on the tunnel,\" Winski noted. \"How much it actually causes the model to luminesce, because it's reacting with how much oxygen is in the air, is related to the pressure that it is seeing, how much light is luminescing off of it.\" \"We would have to sit at a condition for like thirty seconds or so and they would take images with the model just sitting still with conditions not changing.\" \"For this test what we actually did is we ran the model without paint for all of the force and moment testing and then once we completed the force and moment testing the model was painted for PSP,\" she added. \"If we were to retest this model later on for force and moment we would actually remove the PSP paint before testing.\" \"The paint is very sensitive, we can only use it for one test,\" Pinier said. \"It's sensitive to light, it's sensitive to oils on your hands, so if you touch the model it can damage the paint. So we paint it once for each test and then we can remove it and paint it again.\" \"What you saw in the picture with Courtney is the traditional pressure sensitive paint, steady pressure sensitive paint,\" he noted. \"It's a pretty mature technology, it's used in many institutions, in many labs and wind tunnels.\" A new, unsteady pressure sensitive paint is still in development but may be applied to future testing. \"We've already run a few exploratory tests using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint and it's shown very promising results,\" Pinier noted. \"We're thinking at some point we'll be able to characterize the buffet environment using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint. I say at some point because it needs validation, this technology needs to be validated first.\" Pad rollout to Boost phase aerodynamics Current testing is focused on the Block 1 Cargo configuration. \"We're just focusing this one right now because we've already done a lot of testing on all the other configurations,\" Pinier said. \"This Block 1 Cargo configuration was completely new to us when it came out and we had to start a whole testing campaign for that one specifically.\" The testing is intended to create an aerodynamic database for the vehicle configuration, from rolling out to the launch pad through liftoff, through the Boost phase of flight that goes through SRB separation and beyond. \"At liftoff you've got the ground winds that are pushing on the vehicle and the tower and those two are connected,\" Pinier explained. \"We're really interested in the ground wind loads on the tower and the vehicle, just static loads from winds from all directions, north, south, east, west.\" \"They're also interested in when they are rolling out the vehicle on the Mobile Launcher from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad there's also ground wind environments there.\" \"At T-0 you're really at ninety degrees angle of attack with the wind perpendicular to the vehicle,\" he added. \"As the vehicle accelerates that angle of attack reduces very quickly down to single digits in degrees. And so during ascent, subsonic all the way to supersonic Mach numbers we test at low angles of attack, meaning below eight degrees angle of attack. And really the vehicle is going to fly below four degrees angle of attack.\" \"As you're accelerating you go through Mach 1, you know lots of things happen around Mach 1,\" he continued. \"The fluid dynamics around Mach 1, speed of sound, are very non-linear. The unsteady pressure environment on the vehicle is the highest and that's what creates buffet. Basically you can think of it as the air kind of shaking the vehicle structure around Mach 1.\" \"The buffet is all of the low-frequency type of shaking of the vehicle that happens around transonic Mach numbers and the aeroacoustics is all of the higher-frequency shaking that happens in this airflow as it's going over the vehicle.\" \"So you go through Mach 1, you get past peak buffet loads and then you get to maximum dynamic pressure, which is when basically the force of the air on the vehicle, the static force is the highest,\" he continued. \"You get max dynamic pressure between Mach 1 and 2. The loads guys are mostly interested in the static loads on the vehicle during that phase in flight.\" \"And then you accelerate and everything in the environments start to tail off. Aeroacoustics is still present but it's also tailing off.\" \"Some of the things we look at as we get to higher and higher altitudes and close to booster separation is something called plume induced flow separation,\" he added. \"The plumes of the vehicle as you've probably seen when the rocket launches and gets to high altitude become very underexpanded, meaning they become very large and they can induce local separation of the flow on the back of the vehicle so we try to look at that at the highest Mach numbers.\" \"And then you get to booster separation around Mach 4, Mach 5, and that's where we have to characterize that environment to make sure that the boosters don't come back and contact the Core Stage.\" Testing to build aero database for design analysis of new vehicle configuration Testing all of those regions in the early phase of flight involves wind tunnels at NASA centers across the country. \"We tested at the Marshall fourteen-inch trisonic tunnel to get some data quickly,\" Pinier said. \"We can test quickly in that tunnel and get the data for initial design cycles; however, very quickly for this one we needed mature data so where we've got is we're probably in the middle of a testing campaign that comprises six large wind tunnel tests. This picture that you saw was from the test at the Langley Unitary Wind Tunnel to cover the high supersonic Mach range.\" \"We have also run a wind tunnel test at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to cover the subsonic to about Mach 2.5 range for ascent, that was a 1.3 percent scale model,\" he added. \"We are current getting set up to run a liftoff test at the Langley fourteen by twenty-two wind tunnel to cover the liftoff phase of flight and a 1.75 percent scale model along with a 1.75 percent scale Mobile Launcher. We're trying to characterize the liftoff environment with winds from all directions and basically the entire rollout to liftoff phase of flight.\" \"We're going to have a wind tunnel test this summer at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to characterize the aeroacoustics environment - transonic and low supersonic aeroacoustic environments,\" he continued. \"So we're going to have a transonic buffet environment test at the TDT or Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Langley, that's going to occur next calendar year and that's to characterize the unsteady buffet environment as the vehicle goes through the transonic Mach numbers.\" \"The sixth one is going to be a booster separation wind tunnel test at the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel and that's going to be a static 0.9 percent scale model. Those tests are pretty standard, those are critical phases of flight where we need to get that data right and so we rely heavily on wind tunnels for those critical databases.\" \"For pretty much every configuration of the Space Launch System family we've run those tests,\" Pinier added. \"We're just doing it all over for this particular configuration.\" Data feeds into two areas of design analysis work The database being generated for this vehicle configuration from the wind tunnel testing is used by different design groups. \"There's really two customers for us - for the aerodynamics team,\" Pinier explained. \"One of them is the trajectory and guidance navigation and control teams. They are interested in databases to cover the entire Mach range.\" \"We take force and moment data for the entire Mach range and we put it in databases, give that to them,\" he added. \"They design trajectories, they run Monte Carlo simulations...in dispersed flight conditions throughout the entire Boost phase. So that's one of the customers - integrated forces and moments go to GN&C and trajectory.\" \"The second customer is the loads team,\" he continued. \"They're interested in the aerodynamic loading on the vehicle and in this case they are really interested in the peak loading phases of flight.\" On the right, a Schlieren image of a 0.8 percent scale model of the vehicle in Langley's supersonic wind tunnel at a supersonic Mach number. The force-moment and pressure data collected in the wind tunnel tests validates and is fed back into the analytical models. \"So for example, buffet. We don't have to characterize buffet throughout the entire Boost phase because we know buffet peaks around Mach 1 so we focus on transonic conditions for buffet environment.\" \"Aeroacoustics, we know those go a little higher than that so we characterize aeroacoustic environments all the way up to Mach two and a half and the aeroacoustics environment is also an environment that goes to the loads team.\" \"So those are the two biggest products, the aeroacoustics and the buffet, that go to the loads team that are kind of critical,\" Pinier said. \"A third one would be just the static loading, the distribution of the loading during ascent.\" \"It's not a driver for design, but we produce that. That comes mostly out of CFD, basically the distribution of the pressures over the entire vehicle as it goes through the Boost phase, but now that we have pressure sensitive paint when we're doing force-moment measurements we try to do this pressure sensitive paint measurement in order to validate the CFD.\" \"Those are models that the loads team have and they apply and they add those models gusts and wind shear and they add those models on top of what we give them in terms of environments,\" Pinier said. \"There's no way to measure that in a ground test environment.\" Block 1 Cargo is a new config under analysis The Block 1 Cargo configuration was studied earlier in the program, but more detailed design analysis began last year when the SLS option of flying the Europa Clipper spacecraft was moved back to the Block 1 vehicle as a part of Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. SLS is still the mandated launch vehicle for Europa Clipper, but also remains a source of disagreement between the Trump Administration and Congress. Congress mostly recently retained the SLS mandate in the language in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations passed in mid-February. Although the FY 2019 appropriations were signed by the President, the Administration remains opposed to using SLS for Europa; as in past years, their Fiscal Year 2020 Budget submission that followed in mid-March continues to advocate use of U.S. commercial launch services. Two other launch options on heavy-lift commercial vehicles would perform one or more gravity assist flybys past Earth and/or Venus; the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with any of these options. Congress and the Administration did reach agreement on one mandate also written into law, regarding the launch date. Previously, Congress enacted a 2022 launch mandate and the Administration proposed launch in 2025; the FY 2019 appropriations were passed with a 2023 launch target and the Administration's FY 2020 budget request supports this. While the \"Jupiter Direct\" launch mandate remains in place, the SLS Program continues design work on the general configuration and the specific mission, referred to as Science Mission-1. \"This cargo configuration as you probably know is for the Europa Clipper mission and there are two potential fairings, a short one and a long one and currently the primary one we're testing is the short one,\" Pinier said. The Block 1 vehicles use a derivative of United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy upper stage and the Delta's payload fairing system would also be used to encapsulate the spacecraft in the SLS launch option. The short fairing is approximately 14 meters long, the long fairing is approximately 19 meters long. \"It makes a lot of sense once you're in the wind tunnel to go ahead and test several configurations, so we have done some testing on the long configuration but currently the shorter one is the priority,\" Pinier added.

Europa Clipper is currently scheduled to launch in 2023 to orbit the moon for more than three years, studying its icy shell and suspected internal ocean, among other features. Europa Lander would follow in its wake and touch down on the ice in order to better investigate the possibility of life. But according to a nine-month investigation conducted by the NASA Office of Inspector General, both missions are facing a host of serious issues as their teams attempt to balance the needs of NASA and Congress. \"Our audit found that despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, a management analyst at the Office of Inspector General, said in a video released with the report. The report highlighted that since 2013, Congress has provided more than $2 billion for the pair of Europa missions. The Clipper mission alone is expected to cost at least $2.8 billion, according to the report. Every year of that period, the missions' funding has exceeded NASA's budget request. But with all that money has come a lot of strings. First, Congress has ordered NASA to launch both missions on the agency's SLS rocket, which is still in development. Congress also set specific launch targets - currently 2023 for Europa Clipper and 2025 for Europa Lander. Those two directives may be contradictory. Experts were already worried about the rocket's development; these concerns aren't just a problem for Europa, they also could affect projects like NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. But for Europa specifically, the first flight version of the SLS definitely won't be able to do the job for Europa Lander, and it's not clear yet whether it can successfully launch Europa Clipper, the investigation found. Clipper may need, and Lander will definitely need, a more advanced version of the rocket aiming to fly in 2024 but also predicted to slip. NASA also has not yet ordered a vital part of the SLS that the investigation found requires 52 months to produce - which it should have done in September to be ready in time for a summer 2023 launch. Because of these SLS problems, NASA's budget request released earlier this year also raises the possibility of launching on a commercial vehicle. The Clipper team has attempted to work around this problem by still considering the possibility that they'll be switched to ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, both of which are already flying. But the continuing uncertainty \"creates added risks and uncertainties for an already challenging project,\" the investigation found. Another challenge the investigation found is that the Clipper mission is struggling to manage its staffing. The mission is run out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But as of December, about 10% of Clipper's JPL staff roles were vacant, the investigation found, in part because the center is running four other key NASA projects, including Mars 2020, and keeps having to shuffle staff members between the neediest missions. The investigation also found that Clipper suffered from an instrument- selection process that tried to be too wary of conflicts of interest. Clipper team members with perceived conflicts of interest - but also vital knowledge about the mission - were either cut out of the instrument-selection process or given insufficient time to review insufficient information, according to the investigation., which was designed to measure the magnetic field around the moon, replacing it with a simpler version. The investigation did not explicitly link that decision to the instrument-selection issues it identified.) The report found similar issues plaguing the Europa Lander mission as well, although that project is in a more preliminary stage and NASA has not yet formally committed to launching it. The investigation also raised concerns that by scheduling the Lander to launch so soon after Clipper, it won't be able to fully integrate its predecessor's discoveries into its mission plan. The investigation team concluded with 10 recommendations it believes can help NASA get the Europa projects back on track and avoid similar issues in the future. Those recommendations include evaluating JPL's overall staffing, rescheduling mission milestones more realistically and making sure mission- related estimates reflect the risks associated with the SLS.

The audit also noted that the Europa program's biggest backer, John Culberson, no longer chairs the House appropriations subcommittee. The Republican Congressman from Texas was defeated in his reelection bid last year. The audit found that the Space Launch System (SLS) would probably not be available in time for the orbiter's planned launch in 2023. Congress has mandated the program use SLS for both missions. Using SLS would also be more expensive than using commercially available rockets such as Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy. The audit projected cost savings of at least $276 million from using the other launchers. The cost of up to $450 million for the Falcon Heavy appears to high. SpaceX has advertised Falcon Heavy launches at between $90 million and $150 million. \"These are conservative estimates for a commercial launch during this time frame; specific launch costs for the Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy are procurement sensitive,\" the audit stated. Cost, however, is not the only factor. The report notes that SLS would be capable of doing a direct trajectory to Europa, cutting four years off the transit time. This would allow the orbiter to collect far more data at the moon before NASA launches a lander there. Launching on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV would require gravity assist maneuvers that would take more time and require a beefed up spacecraft. \"Launching on a commercial launch vehicle will also subject Clipper to a more severe thermal environment requiring additional thermal and ultraviolet protection, which are already designed into the spacecraft,\" the audit found. \"The risks associated with a gravity assist flight trajectory need to be resolved prior to the Agency establishing the project's cost and schedule baseline.\" The report stated that NASA is studying whether the Falcon Heavy could send the orbiter on a Venus-Earth gravity assist that would reduce transit time and thermal exposure near Venus. Complicating the choice of a booster is that if the Europa Clipper orbiter misses its planned 2023 launch date, it could not be launched the next year due to a lack of a planetary alignment. NASA must also weight booster reliability. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launcher has flown two successful flights with no failures., with four more flights on the manifest through 2022. The audit noted the launcher would have to go through certification before it could launch the costly Europa mission. \"While the U.S. Air Force purchased Falcon Heavy launches in 2018, the vehicle would need to pass additional flight testing (known as Category-3 certification) for high priority, very high complexity,or high-cost payloads-descriptions that apply to the Europa Clipper mission,\" the audit stated. \"As part of this NASA certification process, the Falcon Heavy would need to have accomplished three successful flights by the Clipper's launch readiness date,\" the audit added. Reliability is also a concern with SLS, which is scheduled to launch for the first time in late 2020 or early 2021. \"Although the SLS will have had minimal flight history if the Europa Clipper is launched in the 2023 time frame, senior NASA managers believe the extensive quality assurance testing required to human-rate the vehicle will provide the needed confidence levels to meet the intent of commercial launch vehicle certification requirements,\" the audit said. Delta IV boosters have launched 37 times, including 10 Delta IV variants. All were successful except the first Delta IV Heavy flight, which suffered a partial failure. However, United Launch Alliance's plan to switch to the new Vulcan Centaur booster while phasing out the Delta IV line could result in higher costs. \"To support a Clipper launch with the Delta IV Heavy, NASA would have to provide more money upfront to keep production lines open and is at risk of having to shoulder some of the cost of maintaining the site required to launch that particular rocket, potentially increasing launch costs significantly if Clipper is the last Delta IV Heavy launch,\" the audit found. To get the project back on track, the audit made 10 recommendations related to staffing, budget, schedule and related issues. NASA concurred with nine of the recommendations, but did concur with the second one. 2. Reassess the Clipper Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level with launch vehicle risks for the Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, and SLS prior to Key Decision Point-C and establishing the Agency Baseline Commitment. \"Management did not concur with Recommendation 2, stating that Congress directed NASA to use the SLS launch vehicle and that directive justified its decision not to model the other launch vehicles in the project's JCL,\" the audit stated. \"We disagree and find this response inconsistent with the Agency's Cost Estimating Handbook which states that a JCL analysis should integrate cost, schedule, risk, and uncertainty. The Handbook also states that launch vehicle costs and associated risks shall be included in JCL calculations to ensure they are integrated into the entire project scope to aid management decision making,\" the report added.

The team building the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of nine science instruments on board NASA's Europa Clipper mission to make multiple flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa, has passed its critical design review (CDR) and has begun construction of the flight instrument and other systems. PIMS, built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, will measure the plasmas, or electrically charged gasses, in Europa's ionosphere (the moon's upper atmosphere) and Jupiter's magnetosphere (created by the planet's magnetic field). These plasma measurements will contribute to other data used to determine the thickness of the ice shell that covers Europa, and the depth and makeup of the liquid-water ocean below that shell. PIMS will do this by taking advantage of the rapidly flowing plasma that connects Europa to Jupiter. This plasma, which moves at more than 220,000 miles per hour and rotates with Jupiter, constantly ebbs and flows over Europa, much like water in a stream over a rock. The plasma interacts with neutral and ionized gasses surrounding Europa and with ices on the surface of the moon, producing radiation damage, ionization and other effects that will modify the ice composition. \"We put PIMS through extremely thorough testing, and we're excited to begin construction of our flight instrument,\" said APL's Joseph Westlake, the instrument's principal investigator. \"In addition to vibration and shock testing, we simulated every environment that PIMS will experience from Earth to Europa, and it passed with flying colors.\" The instrument - which is shielded to protect it from the high radiation around Jupiter - has two identical sensors mounted on opposite sides of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The two sensors provide a large entrance to study the plasma. The plasma sensors are Faraday cups, which capture and measure the current from charged particles in the plasma. When combined with magnetic field data, information from PIMS will help reveal details about Europa's structure unable to be determined from Earth-based observations. PIMS is being built by Johns Hopkins APL; the University of Michigan is contributing critical electronic components. The PIMS science team includes researchers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Oregon and the University of Michigan. The Europa Clipper mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The multiple-flyby concept was developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins APL, which is building the PIMS and Europa Imaging System (EIS) instruments and providing the spacecraft's communication and propulsion systems.

But that hasn't killed the dream of sending something, anything, to that corner of the solar system. NASA had planned to launch the Europa Clipper mission in 2022 to circle Jupiter and pass Europa dozens of times. The idea was to swoop low and check for elements of life by analyzing particles of ice, water, and rock that may be spewing out from the moon's surface like the spray of a geyser. But the ambitious $2 billion mission has stumbled. Earlier this year, the launch date slipped from 2022 to 2023, and there's still no rocket to get it there. NASA's Space Launch System rocket is behind schedule and over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office, while a commercial rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy would take twice as long to reach Europa from Earth as the SLS, which can make the trip in about three years. NASA is hoping to start building the Europa Clipper spacecraft later this year while both rocket systems continue testing. But a NASA Inspector General report released in May found that space agency officials underestimated both the time and money needed to get the Europa Clipper mission off the ground. Meanwhile, a follow-up mission to be launched two years after-called Europa Lander, which would put some kind of device on the crusty surface-has become less certain. The report concluded that, given the current pace of work, that mission could not even consider launching until 2030. Still, all is not lost for fans of Europa and the possibility of finding something amazing there (even if it's not an astronaut-munching creature as depicted in the 2013 sci-fi thriller \"Europa Report\"). Even with the recent budgetary and logistical problems, planetary scientists are pretty excited about building and testing devices to help them uncover life once a mission does reach the planet's orbit or even its surface. \"We are looking at what we will do when we get there,\" says Cynthia Phillips, a member of the Europa mission science team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We have two sets of arrival dates. We are looking at what trajectories we can use and what kinds of observations we will make once we get there.\" Phillips says Europa is a special place. It's only about the size of our own moon, but its icy surface hides an ocean 60 miles deep that contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \"It is one of the best places to look for life in the solar system beyond Earth,\" she says. Because gravity is weaker on Europa than here, the pressure at the bottom of this super-deep ocean is about the same as the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Earth's deepest spot at about 36,000 feet. Europa might even be better than other icy moons, because its seas have a rocky bottom instead of being sandwiched between layers of ice, as on neighboring moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's Enceladus and Titan. That environment could be an ideal place to find hydrothermal vents that spew minerals into the ocean and, perhaps, creatures that evolved to harvest them. Marine scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who explore Earth's hydrothermal vents have been working with NASA to devise autonomous underwater vehicles that could work on both Earth and Europa. The agency just announced a $7.6 million, five-year collaboration with WHOI to have space and ocean researchers brainstorm the science and technology needed for future Europa missions. Even though a landing on Europa is more than a decade away, some engineers are already testing drills to burrow through the ice sheet to the life-giving ocean below. A Brooklyn-based space company called Honeybee Robotics is planning a plutonium-powered probe with a rotating drill head that would take three years to work its way through the ice. The team now has prototypes of the device, called SLUSH (Search for Life Using a Submersible Heated Drill), drilling through icy cryochambers in the firm's Pasadena lab. \"These technologies are just over the horizon,\" said Honeybee's Tighe Costa at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held last week in Seattle. Then there's the plutonium-powered TunnelBot, which can drill and sample subsurface life. That's being developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center. There's also ARCHIMEDES (A Really Cool High-Impact Method for Exploring Down into the Europan Subsurface), designed by Austin-based Stone Aerospace, which will use lasers to melt the ice. These devices have a host of engineering obstacles to surmount in the coming years. They have to carry their own power supply, take samples without damaging any potential life form with a radiation leak, and transmit data back to Europa's surface, and then back to scientists on Earth. So while NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and China race to put humans back on the lifeless moon or faraway Mars, a more exciting (albeit slow-motion) race is underway to reach a tiny moon that may be hiding a big secret.

The Europa Clipper mission will target the ice-encrusted moon of Jupiter, which is considered a prime target in the search for life beyond Earth. Below its icy shell, Europa is thought to hold a 170km-deep body of water. This could have the right conditions for biology. Due to launch in 2025, the Europa Clipper mission has now passed a stage called Key Decision Point C, a crucial marker on the road to the launch pad. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. Europa Clipper will carry out an in-depth investigation of the watery world, including whether it can support life in its subsurface ocean. Gravitational interactions with Jupiter generate tidal forces and heat, which keeps Europa's ocean liquid. The heating may even drive volcanic vents on the seafloor; on Earth, such vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But it has taken decades to bring a dedicated mission this far, in part because of cost considerations and the challenges posed by the space environment around Jupiter. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into belts of intense radiation that surround the giant planet. This radiation fries spacecraft electronics, which limits the durations of prospective missions to months or even weeks. So rather than orbiting Europa, Clipper will make repeated close flybys of the moon, to reduce its exposure to the energetic particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. The spacecraft will carry nine science instruments, including cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of the moon's surface, a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of its magnetic field (providing clues to the ocean's depth and salinity) and an ice-penetrating radar to determine the thickness of the icy crust above the ocean. The ice shell could be tens of kilometres thick. Luckily, scientists think there are several ways for ocean water to get up to Europa's surface. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope has made tentative observations of plumes of water-ice erupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Saturn's ice moon Enceladus, which also has a subsurface ocean. The first concepts for missions to explore Europa were drawn up in the 1990s, around the time that data from the Galileo spacecraft helped build evidence for a subsurface ocean. Since then, however, one proposal after another has been thwarted, including an ambitious US-European mission along the lines of the Cassini-Huygens mission. But Clipper has had a key champion on Capitol Hill, in the form of Republican legislator John Culberson who, as chairman of the US House of Representatives appropriations committee that funds Nasa, channelled money to the mission. But last year, Culberson, who had become known for his advocacy on Europa exploration, was unseated in Texas' 7th congressional district by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. During the campaign, a pro-Democrat political action committee ran an ad saying: \"For Houston, Lizzie Fletcher will invest in humans, not aliens.\" A follow-up mission to go and land on Europa has also been proposed. But the most recent federal budget request included no funding for the lander.

Because of the severe radiation challenges of the Jovian system, Europa Clipper is one of the most ambitious flagship missions ever attempted by NASA, with seismic implications for the agency's search for life beyond Earth. Europa-with its deep, ancient ocean locked beneath an icy crust-is seen by some astrobiologists as the solar system's most promising site for harboring alien biology. In search of further signs of habitability, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter and encounter the moon multiple times. With each flyby, it will collect data on Europa's ice shell and subsurface ocean, remotely sounding the unseen fathoms below. According to Curt Niebur, the mission's program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Europa Clipper could answer the question of whether the right conditions exist on the icy moon to support life as we know it. If those ingredients-which include organic molecules, as well as potential energy sources such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor-are found on Europa, Niebur says, \"we're going to want to explore further and see if life actually has arisen under the ice.\" A second mission, now in development, would land on Europa to excavate and collect samples in search of native organisms. Beyond the science, the mission has an unusual political element: Europa Clipper is the first and only space mission to be married to a specific spacecraft in any appropriations bill, says former Republican representative John Culberson of Texas, a longtime Europa advocate who previously chaired the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. The current appropriations bill mandates Europa Clipper use the SLS and requires a \"launch no later than 2023\" on the rocket. It was a move that Culberson, an attorney and political consultant, used to ensure Europa Clipper would one day reach the launchpad. He says tying the mission to the SLS, which is being built in Alabama, garnered the support of Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, without which the mission might not have been mandated by law. (Attempts to reach Senator Shelby for this article were unsuccessful. A staffer reported that he was unavailable for comment.) While Europa Clipper's development has proceeded apace, however, the SLS rocket has remained mired in setbacks and was arrogated by the Artemis lunar program instigated by the Trump administration. Before it could carry the Europa craft to space, the SLS would fly two Artemis moon missions-the first of which has reportedly been pushed back from 2020 to 2021, according to Senate testimony by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this year. For Europa Clipper to launch on time, the second Artemis launch, now scheduled for 2023, would have to occur without error, with a third SLS rocket ready to go-a tall order, considering the program's lengthy development, three-year delay and zero rockets completed thus far. A report issued this past May by NASA's Office of Inspector General supports that the SLS \"is unlikely to be available\" for Europa Clipper in 2023. And it adds that NASA \"continues to maintain spacecraft capabilities to accommodate both the SLS and two commercial launch vehicles.\" Moreover, even NASA's own 2019 budget encourages \"a Europa Clipper launch readiness date in 2025\" and further proposes \"to launch the Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle\" to save money. Each SLS launch is estimated to run more than $1 billion. In its Europa Clipper Key Decision Point-C memorandum, the formal commitment signed at NASA Headquarters earlier this month, the spacecraft is scheduled for a launch that ranges from 2023 to 2025, confirms Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate. But if the mission were to launch in 2025-or on something other than the SLS-it would be in violation of current law, which means the law must change or a working SLS must suddenly appear in order for Europa Clipper to take off in accordance with federal statute. \"We've been working very hard to follow the appropriation law,\" says Joan Salute, program executive of Europa Clipper. But she admits the mission \"may or may not\" be possible with the SLS in 2023. And if it's not, she says, \"we can't follow that appropriations law.\" Both Salute and Zurbuchen say forthcoming appropriations bills may need to be updated. \"Congress will follow the development of the SLS, and that language should be updated as we know more about the SLS's availability to us, or not, in 2023,\" Salute says. And NASA will talk to Congress in order to \"make sure the right solution happens for the American taxpayer,\" Zurbuchen adds. Zurbuchen points out that the appropriations bill's language had been changed previously to accommodate Europa Clipper. Indeed, the 2017 appropriations bill called for a 2022 orbit and 2024 landing. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its research-and-development center, says, \"When Congress returns in September, we will continue to work to pass an appropriations package across the House and Senate that preserves our strong support for Europa Clipper's goals and timeline. We will also continue to monitor the mission's progress as part of that process, including the potential launch vehicle.\" Another vehicle that could take Europa Clipper to Jupiter's moon is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy-though it would do so with an asterisk attached. Falcon Heavy has already achieved three successful launches, but using the SpaceX rocket-which is less powerful than the SLS-would add at least three years of travel time to the planned two-year mission. And while using SpaceX's rocket would save hundreds of millions of dollars on launch costs, it could add to Europa Clipper's operations budget because of its longer cruise time to Jupiter. \"It's vital that the Europa Clipper be launched on the SLS,\" Culberson says. The SLS has an undeniable advantage over Falcon Heavy: it enables a direct flight from Earth to Jupiter. Falcon Heavy will require gravity assists from other planets, and unless it uses an add-on \"kicker stage\"-an additional upper stage for extra loft-one of those gravity assists will require an encounter with Venus. According to Salute, a Venus flyby introduces \"a riskier environment, radiation and temperature. And so we would like to avoid flying closer to Venus with this direct trajectory that SLS affords us. Right now, SLS is the only launch vehicle that can give us that trajectory, and that's why it's so advantageous to us.\" The idea that Europa Clipper might not run on the SLS is almost unthinkable to Culberson, who says he remains optimistic the mission will fly on the SLS in 2023. \"Heaven forbid SLS is not ready in time,\" he says. \"But in the event that it's not, the most important thing for the mission is to ensure [it arrives] safely. The rocket, whatever it is, has to be reliable and has to be powerful enough to get the Clipper to Europa in a timely fashion.\" ", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-has-committed-to-a-rocket-for-the-europa-mission-and-it-wont-be-ready-on-time/"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moon for signs of life", "date": "2019-08-20", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission is entering its final design stage before construction and testing of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments it will carry to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Europa has been a high priority for scientists because, as an ice-covered moon with a subsurface salty liquid ocean, it has been identified as one of the ideal spots for hosting life in our solar system. In 2017, NASA announced new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The icy ocean worlds contain intriguing chemistry and water plume activity. The Europa Clipper mission is also the first to explore an alien ocean. \"If there are plumes on Europa, as we now strongly suspect, with the Europa Clipper we will be ready for them,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. The Europa Clipper, named for the streamlined sailing ships of the 1800s, could launch as early as 2023, but a targeted launch has been set for 2025. It is expected to reach Europa after a journey lasting several years. Europa Clipper will carry cameras and spectrometers to capture images and determine the composition of the moon. Ice-penetrating radar will measure the thickness of the ice shell covering the ocean and help search for the subsurface lakes believed to be there, much like those in Antarctica on Earth. A magnetometer can determine the strength and direction of the moon's magnetic field to understand how deep the ocean goes and its salinity. To investigate the possible plumes, a thermal instrument will search for eruptions or water particles in the atmosphere. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" Zurbuchen said. Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission observed long lines and dark spots instead of a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet. During its closest flyby of Europa in 1997, less than 93 miles above the surface, Galileo collected signatures of changes in Europa's magnetic field that the scientists didn't understand, said Margaret Kivelson, professor emerita of space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Last year, Kivelson and her colleagues took a closer look at that data. They realized that during the flyby, Galileo flew through a plume. This fortuitous happenstance is the best evidence of plumes to date, the study said. The necessary ingredients for life as we know it include liquid water, energy sources and chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. But we've also learned that life finds a way to exist in the harshest of Earth's environments, like vents in the deepest parts of the ocean floor. There, microbes don't receive energy from sunlight but use methanogenesis, a process that reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, to form methane. Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus show some of these key ingredients for life in their oceans, which is why researchers believe they are the best chance for finding life beyond Earth in our own solar system. While Galileo didn't know it was flying through a plume and was incapable of collecting material from it, Europa Clipper will be able to gather samples from plumes if it can fly through them. This would allow scientists a first look at the material inside Europa's ocean that's spewing through the icy crust and could reveal whether Europa's ocean is habitable. Europa Clipper's instruments will be capable of \"sniffing\" the atmosphere of Europa, with more than 40 planned flybys. The flybys will be less than 228 miles above the surface of the moon, within the observed range of the plumes, which can reach 124 to 228 miles above the surface. \"If plumes exist and we can directly sample what's coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist. \"That's what the mission is after. That's the big picture.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/world/europa-clipper-mission-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Clears Big Hurdle on Path to Launch", "date": "2019-08-21", "content": "A highly anticipated NASA mission to Jupiter's possibly life-supporting moon Europa remains on track for a mid-2020s launch.

This water is in contact with the moon's rocky core, scientists believe, making possible a range of interesting chemical reactions. Astrobiologists therefore consider Europa one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Europa Clipper won't search for signs of life, but the probe will attempt to gauge the moon's habitability.

Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, one of the planet's largest moons. Europa has an icy surface, below which most scientists believe is a deep ocean of liquid water. Combined with the interior heat source that keeps the ocean from freezing, and the presence of organic compounds, Europa has the basic requirements to support life. While the programmatic milestone Europa Clipper achieved, known in NASA parlance as Key Decision Point C, is the point where NASA sets the schedule and budget for the mission, exactly when Europa Clipper will launch is not yet clear. In the statement announcing the mission's confirmation, NASA noted that current plans have the spacecraft ready for launch as soon as 2023. However, the mission has a formal launch readiness date of 2025. That uncertainty is linked to how the mission will be launched. The mission's preferred launch option is the Space Launch System, which will allow the spacecraft to travel directly to Jupiter without the need of gravity assists, arriving within three years of launch. Language in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 and prior years also directed NASA to use the SLS. However, in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NASA proposed using a commercial launch vehicle, such as a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy, to launch Europa Clipper, saying that doing so would save several hundred million dollars even though the transit time to Jupiter would be about seven years. A report by NASA's Office of Inspector General in May downplayed the cost savings by using an alternative launch vehicle, but noted it is not possible to launch Europa Clipper on an SLS in 2023 since there won't be an available SLS for that mission then. The announcement didn't include a cost estimate for the mission, but agency spokesperson Alana Johnson said Aug. 21 that the agency baseline commitment for the mission is $4.25 billion, covering all costs for the entire mission. The NASA Office of Inspector General report cited an assessment last October by the mission's standing review board that estimated the mission's cost at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Despite the uncertainty about launch vehicle and schedule, other aspects of the mission are going well. \"Things are looking reasonably good,\" Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for Europa Clipper at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at an Aug. 21 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier in the year, NASA decided to replace a planned magnetometer instrument on the spacecraft that had suffered extensive cost overruns with a less complex \"facility\" magnetometer. That had raised concerns about whether the new magnetometer would have the precision needed to achieve science goals such as measuring the depth of Europa's subsurface ocean. Pappalardo and others at the OPAG meeting said that changes to the instrument's operation, notable periodic rolls of the spacecraft to calibrate it, should recover sufficient precision to achieve those science goals.

Jupiter's Galilean moon Europa consists of a huge ocean of liquid water beneath its icy shell. The water is in contact with the rocky core of the moon, which according to space scientists, make a range of interesting chemical reactions possible. Hence astrobiologists consider 1,940-miles-wide (3,120 kilometres) Europa moon to be one of the best bets to host alien life in the solar system, according to a report by Space.com. This apart, NASA had recently shared new pictures of Jupiter, which were taken by the Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 when the planet was 400 million miles from Earth on June 27, 2019. Earlier this month, Jupiter was possibly hit by an asteroid and the impact was captured by astronomer Ethan Chappel, who captured the event using his Celestron 8 telescope before it faded away.

The United States Congress has mandated that the Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2023, ride atop NASA's huge Space Launch System megarocket. \"However, because of developmental delays and, more significantly, NASA's plans to use the first three SLS rockets produced for its Artemis lunar program, an SLS will not be available until 2025 at the earliest,\" NASA Inspector General Paul Martin wrote in a letter to select lawmakers Tuesday. \"Consequently, if completed on its projected schedule, the approximately $3 billion dollar Europa spacecraft will need to be stored for at least 2 years at a cost of $3 to $5 million per month until an SLS becomes available,\" Martin added. \"Given all of the foregoing factors, we urge Congress to consider removing the requirement that NASA launch the Europa Clipper on an SLS and allow the Agency to decide whether to use an SLS or a commercial vehicle based on cost, schedule, vehicle availability and impact on science requirements,\" he concluded in the letter, stressing that the OIG believes this issue \"requires immediate action by Congress.\" Commercial vehicles will be available for Clipper; Martin mentioned SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket and United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, both of which are already flying. Europa Clipper is designed to characterize the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath the moon's icy shell, assess Europa's ability to host life as we know it, scout out touchdown sites for a potential life- hunting lander mission and perform a number of other tasks. The probe will do this work during dozens of flybys of Europa, which it will make after reaching Jupiter orbit. The SLS would allow Clipper to get to the gas giant much faster. The big NASA rocket will be powerful enough to launch the spacecraft directly to Jupiter, making the trip in a mere 2.4 years. The commercial alternatives would require a roundabout trajectory that takes advantage of planetary \"gravity assists,\" resulting in a transit time of nearly 6 years, Martin wrote. Still, NASA should be allowed to consider those alternatives, he stressed. The first three SLS rockets are already booked to aid NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land two astronauts near the lunar south pole by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by 2028. Congress also directed NASA to launch the Europa lander aboard an SLS. Unlike Clipper, however, this mission is just a concept at the moment; it's not officially on the space agency's docket. Tuesday's letter was a follow-up to a report into the Europa Clipper and Europa lander missions that the OIG released in May. That report determined that both projects face a variety of serious challenges on the way to the launchpad. \"Our audit found that, despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, an OIG management analyst, said in a video released with the May report.

In fact, it's not a satellite dish at all. It's a high-gain antenna, and a future version of it will send and receive signals to and from Earth from a looping orbit around Jupiter. The antenna will take that long journey aboard NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter's moon Europa to see whether the icy orb could harbor conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe there's a massive salty ocean beneath Europa's icy surface. The antenna will beam back high-resolution images and scientific data from Europa Clipper's cameras and science instruments. The full-scale prototype antenna, which at 10 feet tall is the same height as a standard basketball hoop, is in the Experimental Test Range at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley are testing the prototype in the ETR in order to assess its performance and demonstrate the high pointing accuracies required for the Europa Clipper mission. The ETR is an indoor electromagnetic test facility that allows researchers to characterize transmitters, receivers, antennas and other electromagnetic components and subsystems in a scientifically controlled environment. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"said Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" Tests on this prototype antenna are scheduled to wrap up soon; however, researchers plan to return to the ETR in 2020 to conduct additional tests on Europa Clipper's high-gain antenna flight article. Europa Clipper plans to launch in the 2020s, with travel time to Jupiter taking three to seven years.

The HGA will be used to keep the Clipper in contact with mission control as it conducts a series of flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa. Scheduled to launch sometime between 2022 and 2025, the Europa Clipper mission, as its name suggests, is tasked with making the first up-close, detailed study of the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons. Scientists are particularly interested in Europa because it's believed to possess an ocean sealed beneath its icy crust that is twice the volume of all of Earth's seas and is arguably the most likely place in the solar system to find life outside of our planet. The problem is that studying Europa is actually a much more complex job than visiting, for example, Mars, so the Europa Clipper is still undergoing a lot of basic design work as NASA determines exactly what its mission objectives and parameters will be. However, one thing is clear, the Clipper will not go into orbit around Europa. Not only would that be much too expensive in terms of propellant, but the area is far too radioactive for the probe's electronics. Instead, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and carry out a series of 45 close flybys of the moon, during which it will study the characteristics and chemistry of the ice crust and the Europan world ocean, as well as the general geology of the moon. One of the most important bits of equipment on the Clipper is the HGA, which will act as the primary communications link with Earth as the unmanned probe takes up to seven years to reach Jupiter and conducts its over three-year science mission after arrival. Resembling a domestic satellite dish, the HGA is 10 ft tall and is being tested by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and Langley. The goal is to make sure that the HGA is built to standard and has the required accuracy to keep pointed at Earth across 460 million mi. The ETR was chosen to ascertain this because it has the ability to make the close tests required. \"Several years ago we scoured the country to find a facility that was capable of making the difficult measurements that would be required on the HGA and found that the ETR clearly was it,\"says Thomas Magner, assistant project manager for Europa Clipper at the Applied Physics Laboratory. \"The measurements that will be performed in the ETR will demonstrate that the Europa Clipper mission can get a large volume of scientific data back to Earth and ultimately determine the habitability of Europa.\" NASA says that the current tests will end soon, but will resume next year as the design matures.

Notably hidden among the budget items, however, was a $100 million allocation to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. Nuclear rocket propulsion has long been theorized and researched, but no fully-produced version exists yet today. A nuclear thermal rocket, as the name suggests, is a rocket motor powered by a nuclear reactor. Aboard the spacecraft, a tank of hydrogen fuel is stored at supercool temperatures at -252 K. When the rocket is ready to be turned on, the hydrogen is pumped from its tank through a series of pipes into the nuclear reactor vessel where the hydrogen is heated into plasma and expelled through the rocket nozzle at high velocities. The amount of thrust a rocket can produce depends on both the temperature and the molecular weight of the expelled molecule; in both regards, a nuclear rocket is superior to a chemical rocket because of its higher exhaust temperature and lower molecular weight of fuel. Nuclear rockets, depending on design, can achieve exhaust temperatures ranging from 2750 K to as high as 21,000 K. For reference, most chemical rockets only go as high as 5,555 K. Because chemical rockets involve reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, the exhaust gas is mainly water vapor, while the exhaust gas of a nuclear rocket is pure hydrogen. This means that even the coolest form of a nuclear rocket can produce twice the power of a chemical rocket. NASA has experimented with nuclear propulsion in the past. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program was a nuclear experimentation program run jointly by NASA and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. The program's goal was to establish a technological baseline for nuclear propulsion; several engines were test-fired in configurations that could be adapted to production-ready spaceflight. However, the program was canceled in 1972 when public support waivered and plans to send humans to Mars were canceled by Congress. Any plans to use a nuclear rocket focused on utilizing it as a second stage once the craft had entered deep space; this would avoid contaminating Earth's atmosphere with the radioactive byproduct. While we don't know exactly what NASA will produce with its $100 million allocation, a flight demonstration mission has been planned for 2024.

Data was collected during several hundred supersonic test runs in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley of a scale model of the Block 1 Cargo vehicle that is the currently mandated booster for the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. The first of six major testing campaigns began last year and are being conducted at NASA wind tunnels across the United States in support of the SLS Program's design analysis of the new configuration. The aerodynamic data is used to refine analysis and modeling of the vehicle's atmospheric trajectories, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, and structural loading. Testing is planned to cover the early phase of flight all the way out to Solid Rocket Booster separation, going back to the liftoff period to measure the effect of ground winds on the rocket, and also before liftoff while sitting on the Mobile Launcher. Supersonic Mach range test campaign for new SLS vehicle config. A 0.8-percent scale model of the SLS Block 1 Cargo configuration was set up in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley for this round of aerodynamics testing. \"We did about seven hundred runs, that was covering the Mach range in different pitches and rolls,\" Courtney Winski, a research aerospace engineer at NASA Langley, said in an interview. \"We just completed that test, that was Mach 1.5 to 4.5.\" During test runs, the wind tunnel was run at a set velocity and then data was taken as the model was moved through different orientations. \"We are varying angle of attack and roll, so we're doing pitch and roll combinations or alpha- roll combinations along with Mach number combinations, doing the same sets of pitch and roll at different Mach numbers,\" Winski explained. \"We did continuous runs and so we would set the model at a roll angle or at a pitch angle and then continuously take data while we either pitched at a set roll angle or rolled at a set pitch angle. And so we took about seven hundred of those runs over the Mach range. The entire testing took about a month, but that wasn't all run time, it was about three weeks of actual 'wind on' running in the Unitary.\" This model is configured with the shorter, 14-meter Delta 4 payload fairing that would encapsulate Europa Clipper. The \"Jupiter Direct\" trajectory is performance-challenging for the Block 1 vehicle and the shorter fairing saves weight over the longer, 19-meter PLF. \"A single run where we would pitch about twenty-four degrees just to kind of completely cover every option would take a little over a minute, where it was sitting at a single Mach number,\" she noted. The same data set would be collected in another run at another Mach number until the whole range was covered. \"The way that we would qualify it as is that the flight is quasi static in terms of Mach number,\" Jeremy Pinier, NASA's SLS Aerodynamics Team Lead at Langley, said in the interview. \"From liftoff to booster separation, that's around two minutes, so it goes from Mach zero to Mach four and a half in two minutes but that's actually pretty long and so we consider the state of the flow as quasi static.\" \"So we can go in the wind tunnel and sit at a Mach number and take data, take all the data we need at that Mach number and then go to the next Mach number, take all the data we need there and then create those databases where the GNC guys will be able to take our database and slice through this database even though in the wind tunnel we were statically sitting at a Mach number.\" \"The main data that we're collecting was force and moment data on the model,\" Winski noted. \"On this model we did not have pressure ports, but we did have the pressure sensitive paint .\" The luminescent paint provides visual data of the distribution of pressure over the model during wind tunnel testing. \"There are special lights on the tunnel,\" Winski noted. \"How much it actually causes the model to luminesce, because it's reacting with how much oxygen is in the air, is related to the pressure that it is seeing, how much light is luminescing off of it.\" \"We would have to sit at a condition for like thirty seconds or so and they would take images with the model just sitting still with conditions not changing.\" \"For this test what we actually did is we ran the model without paint for all of the force and moment testing and then once we completed the force and moment testing the model was painted for PSP,\" she added. \"If we were to retest this model later on for force and moment we would actually remove the PSP paint before testing.\" \"The paint is very sensitive, we can only use it for one test,\" Pinier said. \"It's sensitive to light, it's sensitive to oils on your hands, so if you touch the model it can damage the paint. So we paint it once for each test and then we can remove it and paint it again.\" \"What you saw in the picture with Courtney is the traditional pressure sensitive paint, steady pressure sensitive paint,\" he noted. \"It's a pretty mature technology, it's used in many institutions, in many labs and wind tunnels.\" A new, unsteady pressure sensitive paint is still in development but may be applied to future testing. \"We've already run a few exploratory tests using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint and it's shown very promising results,\" Pinier noted. \"We're thinking at some point we'll be able to characterize the buffet environment using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint. I say at some point because it needs validation, this technology needs to be validated first.\" Pad rollout to Boost phase aerodynamics Current testing is focused on the Block 1 Cargo configuration. \"We're just focusing this one right now because we've already done a lot of testing on all the other configurations,\" Pinier said. \"This Block 1 Cargo configuration was completely new to us when it came out and we had to start a whole testing campaign for that one specifically.\" The testing is intended to create an aerodynamic database for the vehicle configuration, from rolling out to the launch pad through liftoff, through the Boost phase of flight that goes through SRB separation and beyond. \"At liftoff you've got the ground winds that are pushing on the vehicle and the tower and those two are connected,\" Pinier explained. \"We're really interested in the ground wind loads on the tower and the vehicle, just static loads from winds from all directions, north, south, east, west.\" \"They're also interested in when they are rolling out the vehicle on the Mobile Launcher from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad there's also ground wind environments there.\" \"At T-0 you're really at ninety degrees angle of attack with the wind perpendicular to the vehicle,\" he added. \"As the vehicle accelerates that angle of attack reduces very quickly down to single digits in degrees. And so during ascent, subsonic all the way to supersonic Mach numbers we test at low angles of attack, meaning below eight degrees angle of attack. And really the vehicle is going to fly below four degrees angle of attack.\" \"As you're accelerating you go through Mach 1, you know lots of things happen around Mach 1,\" he continued. \"The fluid dynamics around Mach 1, speed of sound, are very non-linear. The unsteady pressure environment on the vehicle is the highest and that's what creates buffet. Basically you can think of it as the air kind of shaking the vehicle structure around Mach 1.\" \"The buffet is all of the low-frequency type of shaking of the vehicle that happens around transonic Mach numbers and the aeroacoustics is all of the higher-frequency shaking that happens in this airflow as it's going over the vehicle.\" \"So you go through Mach 1, you get past peak buffet loads and then you get to maximum dynamic pressure, which is when basically the force of the air on the vehicle, the static force is the highest,\" he continued. \"You get max dynamic pressure between Mach 1 and 2. The loads guys are mostly interested in the static loads on the vehicle during that phase in flight.\" \"And then you accelerate and everything in the environments start to tail off. Aeroacoustics is still present but it's also tailing off.\" \"Some of the things we look at as we get to higher and higher altitudes and close to booster separation is something called plume induced flow separation,\" he added. \"The plumes of the vehicle as you've probably seen when the rocket launches and gets to high altitude become very underexpanded, meaning they become very large and they can induce local separation of the flow on the back of the vehicle so we try to look at that at the highest Mach numbers.\" \"And then you get to booster separation around Mach 4, Mach 5, and that's where we have to characterize that environment to make sure that the boosters don't come back and contact the Core Stage.\" Testing to build aero database for design analysis of new vehicle configuration Testing all of those regions in the early phase of flight involves wind tunnels at NASA centers across the country. \"We tested at the Marshall fourteen-inch trisonic tunnel to get some data quickly,\" Pinier said. \"We can test quickly in that tunnel and get the data for initial design cycles; however, very quickly for this one we needed mature data so where we've got is we're probably in the middle of a testing campaign that comprises six large wind tunnel tests. This picture that you saw was from the test at the Langley Unitary Wind Tunnel to cover the high supersonic Mach range.\" \"We have also run a wind tunnel test at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to cover the subsonic to about Mach 2.5 range for ascent, that was a 1.3 percent scale model,\" he added. \"We are current getting set up to run a liftoff test at the Langley fourteen by twenty-two wind tunnel to cover the liftoff phase of flight and a 1.75 percent scale model along with a 1.75 percent scale Mobile Launcher. We're trying to characterize the liftoff environment with winds from all directions and basically the entire rollout to liftoff phase of flight.\" \"We're going to have a wind tunnel test this summer at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to characterize the aeroacoustics environment - transonic and low supersonic aeroacoustic environments,\" he continued. \"So we're going to have a transonic buffet environment test at the TDT or Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Langley, that's going to occur next calendar year and that's to characterize the unsteady buffet environment as the vehicle goes through the transonic Mach numbers.\" \"The sixth one is going to be a booster separation wind tunnel test at the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel and that's going to be a static 0.9 percent scale model. Those tests are pretty standard, those are critical phases of flight where we need to get that data right and so we rely heavily on wind tunnels for those critical databases.\" \"For pretty much every configuration of the Space Launch System family we've run those tests,\" Pinier added. \"We're just doing it all over for this particular configuration.\" Data feeds into two areas of design analysis work The database being generated for this vehicle configuration from the wind tunnel testing is used by different design groups. \"There's really two customers for us - for the aerodynamics team,\" Pinier explained. \"One of them is the trajectory and guidance navigation and control teams. They are interested in databases to cover the entire Mach range.\" \"We take force and moment data for the entire Mach range and we put it in databases, give that to them,\" he added. \"They design trajectories, they run Monte Carlo simulations...in dispersed flight conditions throughout the entire Boost phase. So that's one of the customers - integrated forces and moments go to GN&C and trajectory.\" \"The second customer is the loads team,\" he continued. \"They're interested in the aerodynamic loading on the vehicle and in this case they are really interested in the peak loading phases of flight.\" On the right, a Schlieren image of a 0.8 percent scale model of the vehicle in Langley's supersonic wind tunnel at a supersonic Mach number. The force-moment and pressure data collected in the wind tunnel tests validates and is fed back into the analytical models. \"So for example, buffet. We don't have to characterize buffet throughout the entire Boost phase because we know buffet peaks around Mach 1 so we focus on transonic conditions for buffet environment.\" \"Aeroacoustics, we know those go a little higher than that so we characterize aeroacoustic environments all the way up to Mach two and a half and the aeroacoustics environment is also an environment that goes to the loads team.\" \"So those are the two biggest products, the aeroacoustics and the buffet, that go to the loads team that are kind of critical,\" Pinier said. \"A third one would be just the static loading, the distribution of the loading during ascent.\" \"It's not a driver for design, but we produce that. That comes mostly out of CFD, basically the distribution of the pressures over the entire vehicle as it goes through the Boost phase, but now that we have pressure sensitive paint when we're doing force-moment measurements we try to do this pressure sensitive paint measurement in order to validate the CFD.\" \"Those are models that the loads team have and they apply and they add those models gusts and wind shear and they add those models on top of what we give them in terms of environments,\" Pinier said. \"There's no way to measure that in a ground test environment.\" Block 1 Cargo is a new config under analysis The Block 1 Cargo configuration was studied earlier in the program, but more detailed design analysis began last year when the SLS option of flying the Europa Clipper spacecraft was moved back to the Block 1 vehicle as a part of Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. SLS is still the mandated launch vehicle for Europa Clipper, but also remains a source of disagreement between the Trump Administration and Congress. Congress mostly recently retained the SLS mandate in the language in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations passed in mid-February. Although the FY 2019 appropriations were signed by the President, the Administration remains opposed to using SLS for Europa; as in past years, their Fiscal Year 2020 Budget submission that followed in mid-March continues to advocate use of U.S. commercial launch services. Two other launch options on heavy-lift commercial vehicles would perform one or more gravity assist flybys past Earth and/or Venus; the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with any of these options. Congress and the Administration did reach agreement on one mandate also written into law, regarding the launch date. Previously, Congress enacted a 2022 launch mandate and the Administration proposed launch in 2025; the FY 2019 appropriations were passed with a 2023 launch target and the Administration's FY 2020 budget request supports this. While the \"Jupiter Direct\" launch mandate remains in place, the SLS Program continues design work on the general configuration and the specific mission, referred to as Science Mission-1. \"This cargo configuration as you probably know is for the Europa Clipper mission and there are two potential fairings, a short one and a long one and currently the primary one we're testing is the short one,\" Pinier said. The Block 1 vehicles use a derivative of United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy upper stage and the Delta's payload fairing system would also be used to encapsulate the spacecraft in the SLS launch option. The short fairing is approximately 14 meters long, the long fairing is approximately 19 meters long. \"It makes a lot of sense once you're in the wind tunnel to go ahead and test several configurations, so we have done some testing on the long configuration but currently the shorter one is the priority,\" Pinier added.

Europa Clipper is currently scheduled to launch in 2023 to orbit the moon for more than three years, studying its icy shell and suspected internal ocean, among other features. Europa Lander would follow in its wake and touch down on the ice in order to better investigate the possibility of life. But according to a nine-month investigation conducted by the NASA Office of Inspector General, both missions are facing a host of serious issues as their teams attempt to balance the needs of NASA and Congress. \"Our audit found that despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, a management analyst at the Office of Inspector General, said in a video released with the report. The report highlighted that since 2013, Congress has provided more than $2 billion for the pair of Europa missions. The Clipper mission alone is expected to cost at least $2.8 billion, according to the report. Every year of that period, the missions' funding has exceeded NASA's budget request. But with all that money has come a lot of strings. First, Congress has ordered NASA to launch both missions on the agency's SLS rocket, which is still in development. Congress also set specific launch targets - currently 2023 for Europa Clipper and 2025 for Europa Lander. Those two directives may be contradictory. Experts were already worried about the rocket's development; these concerns aren't just a problem for Europa, they also could affect projects like NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. But for Europa specifically, the first flight version of the SLS definitely won't be able to do the job for Europa Lander, and it's not clear yet whether it can successfully launch Europa Clipper, the investigation found. Clipper may need, and Lander will definitely need, a more advanced version of the rocket aiming to fly in 2024 but also predicted to slip. NASA also has not yet ordered a vital part of the SLS that the investigation found requires 52 months to produce - which it should have done in September to be ready in time for a summer 2023 launch. Because of these SLS problems, NASA's budget request released earlier this year also raises the possibility of launching on a commercial vehicle. The Clipper team has attempted to work around this problem by still considering the possibility that they'll be switched to ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, both of which are already flying. But the continuing uncertainty \"creates added risks and uncertainties for an already challenging project,\" the investigation found. Another challenge the investigation found is that the Clipper mission is struggling to manage its staffing. The mission is run out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But as of December, about 10% of Clipper's JPL staff roles were vacant, the investigation found, in part because the center is running four other key NASA projects, including Mars 2020, and keeps having to shuffle staff members between the neediest missions. The investigation also found that Clipper suffered from an instrument- selection process that tried to be too wary of conflicts of interest. Clipper team members with perceived conflicts of interest - but also vital knowledge about the mission - were either cut out of the instrument-selection process or given insufficient time to review insufficient information, according to the investigation., which was designed to measure the magnetic field around the moon, replacing it with a simpler version. The investigation did not explicitly link that decision to the instrument-selection issues it identified.) The report found similar issues plaguing the Europa Lander mission as well, although that project is in a more preliminary stage and NASA has not yet formally committed to launching it. The investigation also raised concerns that by scheduling the Lander to launch so soon after Clipper, it won't be able to fully integrate its predecessor's discoveries into its mission plan. The investigation team concluded with 10 recommendations it believes can help NASA get the Europa projects back on track and avoid similar issues in the future. Those recommendations include evaluating JPL's overall staffing, rescheduling mission milestones more realistically and making sure mission- related estimates reflect the risks associated with the SLS.

The audit also noted that the Europa program's biggest backer, John Culberson, no longer chairs the House appropriations subcommittee. The Republican Congressman from Texas was defeated in his reelection bid last year. The audit found that the Space Launch System (SLS) would probably not be available in time for the orbiter's planned launch in 2023. Congress has mandated the program use SLS for both missions. Using SLS would also be more expensive than using commercially available rockets such as Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy. The audit projected cost savings of at least $276 million from using the other launchers. The cost of up to $450 million for the Falcon Heavy appears to high. SpaceX has advertised Falcon Heavy launches at between $90 million and $150 million. \"These are conservative estimates for a commercial launch during this time frame; specific launch costs for the Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy are procurement sensitive,\" the audit stated. Cost, however, is not the only factor. The report notes that SLS would be capable of doing a direct trajectory to Europa, cutting four years off the transit time. This would allow the orbiter to collect far more data at the moon before NASA launches a lander there. Launching on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV would require gravity assist maneuvers that would take more time and require a beefed up spacecraft. \"Launching on a commercial launch vehicle will also subject Clipper to a more severe thermal environment requiring additional thermal and ultraviolet protection, which are already designed into the spacecraft,\" the audit found. \"The risks associated with a gravity assist flight trajectory need to be resolved prior to the Agency establishing the project's cost and schedule baseline.\" The report stated that NASA is studying whether the Falcon Heavy could send the orbiter on a Venus-Earth gravity assist that would reduce transit time and thermal exposure near Venus. Complicating the choice of a booster is that if the Europa Clipper orbiter misses its planned 2023 launch date, it could not be launched the next year due to a lack of a planetary alignment. NASA must also weight booster reliability. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launcher has flown two successful flights with no failures., with four more flights on the manifest through 2022. The audit noted the launcher would have to go through certification before it could launch the costly Europa mission. \"While the U.S. Air Force purchased Falcon Heavy launches in 2018, the vehicle would need to pass additional flight testing (known as Category-3 certification) for high priority, very high complexity,or high-cost payloads-descriptions that apply to the Europa Clipper mission,\" the audit stated. \"As part of this NASA certification process, the Falcon Heavy would need to have accomplished three successful flights by the Clipper's launch readiness date,\" the audit added. Reliability is also a concern with SLS, which is scheduled to launch for the first time in late 2020 or early 2021. \"Although the SLS will have had minimal flight history if the Europa Clipper is launched in the 2023 time frame, senior NASA managers believe the extensive quality assurance testing required to human-rate the vehicle will provide the needed confidence levels to meet the intent of commercial launch vehicle certification requirements,\" the audit said. Delta IV boosters have launched 37 times, including 10 Delta IV variants. All were successful except the first Delta IV Heavy flight, which suffered a partial failure. However, United Launch Alliance's plan to switch to the new Vulcan Centaur booster while phasing out the Delta IV line could result in higher costs. \"To support a Clipper launch with the Delta IV Heavy, NASA would have to provide more money upfront to keep production lines open and is at risk of having to shoulder some of the cost of maintaining the site required to launch that particular rocket, potentially increasing launch costs significantly if Clipper is the last Delta IV Heavy launch,\" the audit found. To get the project back on track, the audit made 10 recommendations related to staffing, budget, schedule and related issues. NASA concurred with nine of the recommendations, but did concur with the second one. 2. Reassess the Clipper Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level with launch vehicle risks for the Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy, and SLS prior to Key Decision Point-C and establishing the Agency Baseline Commitment. \"Management did not concur with Recommendation 2, stating that Congress directed NASA to use the SLS launch vehicle and that directive justified its decision not to model the other launch vehicles in the project's JCL,\" the audit stated. \"We disagree and find this response inconsistent with the Agency's Cost Estimating Handbook which states that a JCL analysis should integrate cost, schedule, risk, and uncertainty. The Handbook also states that launch vehicle costs and associated risks shall be included in JCL calculations to ensure they are integrated into the entire project scope to aid management decision making,\" the report added.

The team building the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of nine science instruments on board NASA's Europa Clipper mission to make multiple flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa, has passed its critical design review (CDR) and has begun construction of the flight instrument and other systems. PIMS, built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, will measure the plasmas, or electrically charged gasses, in Europa's ionosphere (the moon's upper atmosphere) and Jupiter's magnetosphere (created by the planet's magnetic field). These plasma measurements will contribute to other data used to determine the thickness of the ice shell that covers Europa, and the depth and makeup of the liquid-water ocean below that shell. PIMS will do this by taking advantage of the rapidly flowing plasma that connects Europa to Jupiter. This plasma, which moves at more than 220,000 miles per hour and rotates with Jupiter, constantly ebbs and flows over Europa, much like water in a stream over a rock. The plasma interacts with neutral and ionized gasses surrounding Europa and with ices on the surface of the moon, producing radiation damage, ionization and other effects that will modify the ice composition. \"We put PIMS through extremely thorough testing, and we're excited to begin construction of our flight instrument,\" said APL's Joseph Westlake, the instrument's principal investigator. \"In addition to vibration and shock testing, we simulated every environment that PIMS will experience from Earth to Europa, and it passed with flying colors.\" The instrument - which is shielded to protect it from the high radiation around Jupiter - has two identical sensors mounted on opposite sides of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The two sensors provide a large entrance to study the plasma. The plasma sensors are Faraday cups, which capture and measure the current from charged particles in the plasma. When combined with magnetic field data, information from PIMS will help reveal details about Europa's structure unable to be determined from Earth-based observations. PIMS is being built by Johns Hopkins APL; the University of Michigan is contributing critical electronic components. The PIMS science team includes researchers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Oregon and the University of Michigan. The Europa Clipper mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The multiple-flyby concept was developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins APL, which is building the PIMS and Europa Imaging System (EIS) instruments and providing the spacecraft's communication and propulsion systems.

But that hasn't killed the dream of sending something, anything, to that corner of the solar system. NASA had planned to launch the Europa Clipper mission in 2022 to circle Jupiter and pass Europa dozens of times. The idea was to swoop low and check for elements of life by analyzing particles of ice, water, and rock that may be spewing out from the moon's surface like the spray of a geyser. But the ambitious $2 billion mission has stumbled. Earlier this year, the launch date slipped from 2022 to 2023, and there's still no rocket to get it there. NASA's Space Launch System rocket is behind schedule and over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office, while a commercial rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy would take twice as long to reach Europa from Earth as the SLS, which can make the trip in about three years. NASA is hoping to start building the Europa Clipper spacecraft later this year while both rocket systems continue testing. But a NASA Inspector General report released in May found that space agency officials underestimated both the time and money needed to get the Europa Clipper mission off the ground. Meanwhile, a follow-up mission to be launched two years after-called Europa Lander, which would put some kind of device on the crusty surface-has become less certain. The report concluded that, given the current pace of work, that mission could not even consider launching until 2030. Still, all is not lost for fans of Europa and the possibility of finding something amazing there (even if it's not an astronaut-munching creature as depicted in the 2013 sci-fi thriller \"Europa Report\"). Even with the recent budgetary and logistical problems, planetary scientists are pretty excited about building and testing devices to help them uncover life once a mission does reach the planet's orbit or even its surface. \"We are looking at what we will do when we get there,\" says Cynthia Phillips, a member of the Europa mission science team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We have two sets of arrival dates. We are looking at what trajectories we can use and what kinds of observations we will make once we get there.\" Phillips says Europa is a special place. It's only about the size of our own moon, but its icy surface hides an ocean 60 miles deep that contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \"It is one of the best places to look for life in the solar system beyond Earth,\" she says. Because gravity is weaker on Europa than here, the pressure at the bottom of this super-deep ocean is about the same as the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Earth's deepest spot at about 36,000 feet. Europa might even be better than other icy moons, because its seas have a rocky bottom instead of being sandwiched between layers of ice, as on neighboring moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's Enceladus and Titan. That environment could be an ideal place to find hydrothermal vents that spew minerals into the ocean and, perhaps, creatures that evolved to harvest them. Marine scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who explore Earth's hydrothermal vents have been working with NASA to devise autonomous underwater vehicles that could work on both Earth and Europa. The agency just announced a $7.6 million, five-year collaboration with WHOI to have space and ocean researchers brainstorm the science and technology needed for future Europa missions. Even though a landing on Europa is more than a decade away, some engineers are already testing drills to burrow through the ice sheet to the life-giving ocean below. A Brooklyn-based space company called Honeybee Robotics is planning a plutonium-powered probe with a rotating drill head that would take three years to work its way through the ice. The team now has prototypes of the device, called SLUSH (Search for Life Using a Submersible Heated Drill), drilling through icy cryochambers in the firm's Pasadena lab. \"These technologies are just over the horizon,\" said Honeybee's Tighe Costa at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held last week in Seattle. Then there's the plutonium-powered TunnelBot, which can drill and sample subsurface life. That's being developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center. There's also ARCHIMEDES (A Really Cool High-Impact Method for Exploring Down into the Europan Subsurface), designed by Austin-based Stone Aerospace, which will use lasers to melt the ice. These devices have a host of engineering obstacles to surmount in the coming years. They have to carry their own power supply, take samples without damaging any potential life form with a radiation leak, and transmit data back to Europa's surface, and then back to scientists on Earth. So while NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and China race to put humans back on the lifeless moon or faraway Mars, a more exciting (albeit slow-motion) race is underway to reach a tiny moon that may be hiding a big secret.

The Europa Clipper mission will target the ice-encrusted moon of Jupiter, which is considered a prime target in the search for life beyond Earth. Below its icy shell, Europa is thought to hold a 170km-deep body of water. This could have the right conditions for biology. Due to launch in 2025, the Europa Clipper mission has now passed a stage called Key Decision Point C, a crucial marker on the road to the launch pad. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. Europa Clipper will carry out an in-depth investigation of the watery world, including whether it can support life in its subsurface ocean. Gravitational interactions with Jupiter generate tidal forces and heat, which keeps Europa's ocean liquid. The heating may even drive volcanic vents on the seafloor; on Earth, such vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But it has taken decades to bring a dedicated mission this far, in part because of cost considerations and the challenges posed by the space environment around Jupiter. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into belts of intense radiation that surround the giant planet. This radiation fries spacecraft electronics, which limits the durations of prospective missions to months or even weeks. So rather than orbiting Europa, Clipper will make repeated close flybys of the moon, to reduce its exposure to the energetic particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. The spacecraft will carry nine science instruments, including cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of the moon's surface, a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of its magnetic field (providing clues to the ocean's depth and salinity) and an ice-penetrating radar to determine the thickness of the icy crust above the ocean. The ice shell could be tens of kilometres thick. Luckily, scientists think there are several ways for ocean water to get up to Europa's surface. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope has made tentative observations of plumes of water-ice erupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Saturn's ice moon Enceladus, which also has a subsurface ocean. The first concepts for missions to explore Europa were drawn up in the 1990s, around the time that data from the Galileo spacecraft helped build evidence for a subsurface ocean. Since then, however, one proposal after another has been thwarted, including an ambitious US-European mission along the lines of the Cassini-Huygens mission. But Clipper has had a key champion on Capitol Hill, in the form of Republican legislator John Culberson who, as chairman of the US House of Representatives appropriations committee that funds Nasa, channelled money to the mission. But last year, Culberson, who had become known for his advocacy on Europa exploration, was unseated in Texas' 7th congressional district by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. During the campaign, a pro-Democrat political action committee ran an ad saying: \"For Houston, Lizzie Fletcher will invest in humans, not aliens.\" A follow-up mission to go and land on Europa has also been proposed. But the most recent federal budget request included no funding for the lander.

Because of the severe radiation challenges of the Jovian system, Europa Clipper is one of the most ambitious flagship missions ever attempted by NASA, with seismic implications for the agency's search for life beyond Earth. Europa-with its deep, ancient ocean locked beneath an icy crust-is seen by some astrobiologists as the solar system's most promising site for harboring alien biology. In search of further signs of habitability, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter and encounter the moon multiple times. With each flyby, it will collect data on Europa's ice shell and subsurface ocean, remotely sounding the unseen fathoms below. According to Curt Niebur, the mission's program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Europa Clipper could answer the question of whether the right conditions exist on the icy moon to support life as we know it. If those ingredients-which include organic molecules, as well as potential energy sources such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor-are found on Europa, Niebur says, \"we're going to want to explore further and see if life actually has arisen under the ice.\" A second mission, now in development, would land on Europa to excavate and collect samples in search of native organisms. Beyond the science, the mission has an unusual political element: Europa Clipper is the first and only space mission to be married to a specific spacecraft in any appropriations bill, says former Republican representative John Culberson of Texas, a longtime Europa advocate who previously chaired the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. The current appropriations bill mandates Europa Clipper use the SLS and requires a \"launch no later than 2023\" on the rocket. It was a move that Culberson, an attorney and political consultant, used to ensure Europa Clipper would one day reach the launchpad. He says tying the mission to the SLS, which is being built in Alabama, garnered the support of Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, without which the mission might not have been mandated by law. (Attempts to reach Senator Shelby for this article were unsuccessful. A staffer reported that he was unavailable for comment.) While Europa Clipper's development has proceeded apace, however, the SLS rocket has remained mired in setbacks and was arrogated by the Artemis lunar program instigated by the Trump administration. Before it could carry the Europa craft to space, the SLS would fly two Artemis moon missions-the first of which has reportedly been pushed back from 2020 to 2021, according to Senate testimony by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this year. For Europa Clipper to launch on time, the second Artemis launch, now scheduled for 2023, would have to occur without error, with a third SLS rocket ready to go-a tall order, considering the program's lengthy development, three-year delay and zero rockets completed thus far. A report issued this past May by NASA's Office of Inspector General supports that the SLS \"is unlikely to be available\" for Europa Clipper in 2023. And it adds that NASA \"continues to maintain spacecraft capabilities to accommodate both the SLS and two commercial launch vehicles.\" Moreover, even NASA's own 2019 budget encourages \"a Europa Clipper launch readiness date in 2025\" and further proposes \"to launch the Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle\" to save money. Each SLS launch is estimated to run more than $1 billion. In its Europa Clipper Key Decision Point-C memorandum, the formal commitment signed at NASA Headquarters earlier this month, the spacecraft is scheduled for a launch that ranges from 2023 to 2025, confirms Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate. But if the mission were to launch in 2025-or on something other than the SLS-it would be in violation of current law, which means the law must change or a working SLS must suddenly appear in order for Europa Clipper to take off in accordance with federal statute. \"We've been working very hard to follow the appropriation law,\" says Joan Salute, program executive of Europa Clipper. But she admits the mission \"may or may not\" be possible with the SLS in 2023. And if it's not, she says, \"we can't follow that appropriations law.\" Both Salute and Zurbuchen say forthcoming appropriations bills may need to be updated. \"Congress will follow the development of the SLS, and that language should be updated as we know more about the SLS's availability to us, or not, in 2023,\" Salute says. And NASA will talk to Congress in order to \"make sure the right solution happens for the American taxpayer,\" Zurbuchen adds. Zurbuchen points out that the appropriations bill's language had been changed previously to accommodate Europa Clipper. Indeed, the 2017 appropriations bill called for a 2022 orbit and 2024 landing. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its research-and-development center, says, \"When Congress returns in September, we will continue to work to pass an appropriations package across the House and Senate that preserves our strong support for Europa Clipper's goals and timeline. We will also continue to monitor the mission's progress as part of that process, including the potential launch vehicle.\" Another vehicle that could take Europa Clipper to Jupiter's moon is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy-though it would do so with an asterisk attached. Falcon Heavy has already achieved three successful launches, but using the SpaceX rocket-which is less powerful than the SLS-would add at least three years of travel time to the planned two-year mission. And while using SpaceX's rocket would save hundreds of millions of dollars on launch costs, it could add to Europa Clipper's operations budget because of its longer cruise time to Jupiter. \"It's vital that the Europa Clipper be launched on the SLS,\" Culberson says. The SLS has an undeniable advantage over Falcon Heavy: it enables a direct flight from Earth to Jupiter. Falcon Heavy will require gravity assists from other planets, and unless it uses an add-on \"kicker stage\"-an additional upper stage for extra loft-one of those gravity assists will require an encounter with Venus. According to Salute, a Venus flyby introduces \"a riskier environment, radiation and temperature. And so we would like to avoid flying closer to Venus with this direct trajectory that SLS affords us. Right now, SLS is the only launch vehicle that can give us that trajectory, and that's why it's so advantageous to us.\" The idea that Europa Clipper might not run on the SLS is almost unthinkable to Culberson, who says he remains optimistic the mission will fly on the SLS in 2023. \"Heaven forbid SLS is not ready in time,\" he says. \"But in the event that it's not, the most important thing for the mission is to ensure [it arrives] safely. The rocket, whatever it is, has to be reliable and has to be powerful enough to get the Clipper to Europa in a timely fashion.\" ", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-has-committed-to-a-rocket-for-the-europa-mission-and-it-wont-be-ready-on-time/"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moon for signs of life", "date": "2019-08-20", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission is entering its final design stage before construction and testing of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments it will carry to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Europa has been a high priority for scientists because, as an ice-covered moon with a subsurface salty liquid ocean, it has been identified as one of the ideal spots for hosting life in our solar system. In 2017, NASA announced new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The icy ocean worlds contain intriguing chemistry and water plume activity. The Europa Clipper mission is also the first to explore an alien ocean. \"If there are plumes on Europa, as we now strongly suspect, with the Europa Clipper we will be ready for them,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. The Europa Clipper, named for the streamlined sailing ships of the 1800s, could launch as early as 2023, but a targeted launch has been set for 2025. It is expected to reach Europa after a journey lasting several years. Europa Clipper will carry cameras and spectrometers to capture images and determine the composition of the moon. Ice-penetrating radar will measure the thickness of the ice shell covering the ocean and help search for the subsurface lakes believed to be there, much like those in Antarctica on Earth. A magnetometer can determine the strength and direction of the moon's magnetic field to understand how deep the ocean goes and its salinity. To investigate the possible plumes, a thermal instrument will search for eruptions or water particles in the atmosphere. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" Zurbuchen said. Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission observed long lines and dark spots instead of a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet. During its closest flyby of Europa in 1997, less than 93 miles above the surface, Galileo collected signatures of changes in Europa's magnetic field that the scientists didn't understand, said Margaret Kivelson, professor emerita of space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Last year, Kivelson and her colleagues took a closer look at that data. They realized that during the flyby, Galileo flew through a plume. This fortuitous happenstance is the best evidence of plumes to date, the study said. The necessary ingredients for life as we know it include liquid water, energy sources and chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. But we've also learned that life finds a way to exist in the harshest of Earth's environments, like vents in the deepest parts of the ocean floor. There, microbes don't receive energy from sunlight but use methanogenesis, a process that reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, to form methane. Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus show some of these key ingredients for life in their oceans, which is why researchers believe they are the best chance for finding life beyond Earth in our own solar system. While Galileo didn't know it was flying through a plume and was incapable of collecting material from it, Europa Clipper will be able to gather samples from plumes if it can fly through them. This would allow scientists a first look at the material inside Europa's ocean that's spewing through the icy crust and could reveal whether Europa's ocean is habitable. Europa Clipper's instruments will be capable of \"sniffing\" the atmosphere of Europa, with more than 40 planned flybys. The flybys will be less than 228 miles above the surface of the moon, within the observed range of the plumes, which can reach 124 to 228 miles above the surface. \"If plumes exist and we can directly sample what's coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist. \"That's what the mission is after. That's the big picture.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/world/europa-clipper-mission-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Clears Big Hurdle on Path to Launch", "date": "2019-08-21", "content": "A highly anticipated NASA mission to Jupiter's possibly life-supporting moon Europa remains on track for a mid-2020s launch.

This water is in contact with the moon's rocky core, scientists believe, making possible a range of interesting chemical reactions. Astrobiologists therefore consider Europa one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Europa Clipper won't search for signs of life, but the probe will attempt to gauge the moon's habitability.

That will cover final design of the spacecraft, followed by assembly and testing. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a statement announcing the milestone. Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, one of the planet's largest moons. Europa has an icy surface, below which most scientists believe is a deep ocean of liquid water. Combined with the interior heat source that keeps the ocean from freezing, and the presence of organic compounds, Europa has the basic requirements to support life. While the programmatic milestone Europa Clipper achieved, known in NASA parlance as Key Decision Point C, is the point where NASA sets the schedule and budget for the mission, exactly when Europa Clipper will launch is not yet clear. In the statement announcing the mission's confirmation, NASA noted that current plans have the spacecraft ready for launch as soon as 2023. However, the mission has a formal launch readiness date of 2025. That uncertainty is linked to how the mission will be launched. The mission's preferred launch option is the Space Launch System, which will allow the spacecraft to travel directly to Jupiter without the need of gravity assists, arriving within three years of launch. Language in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 and prior years also directed NASA to use the SLS. However, in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NASA proposed using a commercial launch vehicle, such as a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy, to launch Europa Clipper, saying that doing so would save several hundred million dollars even though the transit time to Jupiter would be about seven years. A report by NASA's Office of Inspector General in May downplayed the cost savings by using an alternative launch vehicle, but noted it is not possible to launch Europa Clipper on an SLS in 2023 since there won't be an available SLS for that mission then. The announcement didn't include a cost estimate for the mission, but agency spokesperson Alana Johnson said Aug. 21 that the agency baseline commitment for the mission is $4.25 billion, covering all costs for the entire mission. The NASA Office of Inspector General report cited an assessment last October by the mission's standing review board that estimated the mission's cost at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Despite the uncertainty about launch vehicle and schedule, other aspects of the mission are going well. \"Things are looking reasonably good,\" Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for Europa Clipper at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at an Aug. 21 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier in the year, NASA decided to replace a planned magnetometer instrument on the spacecraft that had suffered extensive cost overruns with a less complex \"facility\" magnetometer. That had raised concerns about whether the new magnetometer would have the precision needed to achieve science goals such as measuring the depth of Europa's subsurface ocean. Pappalardo and others at the OPAG meeting said that changes to the instrument's operation, notable periodic rolls of the spacecraft to calibrate it, should recover sufficient precision to achieve those science goals.

The space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California leads the development of the Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for the Science Mission Directorate. The mission is managed by the Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington recently said in a statement. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" he said. Jupiter's Galilean moon Europa consists of a huge ocean of liquid water beneath its icy shell. The water is in contact with the rocky core of the moon, which according to space scientists, make a range of interesting chemical reactions possible. Hence astrobiologists consider 1,940-miles-wide (3,120 kilometres) Europa moon to be one of the best bets to host alien life in the solar system, according to a report by Space.com. This apart, NASA had recently shared new pictures of Jupiter, which were taken by the Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 when the planet was 400 million miles from Earth on June 27, 2019. Earlier this month, Jupiter was possibly hit by an asteroid and the impact was captured by astronomer Ethan Chappel, who captured the event using his Celestron 8 telescope before it faded away.

The United States Congress has mandated that the Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2023, ride atop NASA's huge Space Launch System megarocket. \"However, because of developmental delays and, more significantly, NASA's plans to use the first three SLS rockets produced for its Artemis lunar program, an SLS will not be available until 2025 at the earliest,\" NASA Inspector General Paul Martin wrote in a letter to select lawmakers Tuesday. \"Consequently, if completed on its projected schedule, the approximately $3 billion dollar Europa spacecraft will need to be stored for at least 2 years at a cost of $3 to $5 million per month until an SLS becomes available,\" Martin added. \"Given all of the foregoing factors, we urge Congress to consider removing the requirement that NASA launch the Europa Clipper on an SLS and allow the Agency to decide whether to use an SLS or a commercial vehicle based on cost, schedule, vehicle availability and impact on science requirements,\" he concluded in the letter, stressing that the OIG believes this issue \"requires immediate action by Congress.\" Commercial vehicles will be available for Clipper; Martin mentioned SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket and United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, both of which are already flying. Europa Clipper is designed to characterize the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath the moon's icy shell, assess Europa's ability to host life as we know it, scout out touchdown sites for a potential life- hunting lander mission and perform a number of other tasks. The probe will do this work during dozens of flybys of Europa, which it will make after reaching Jupiter orbit. The SLS would allow Clipper to get to the gas giant much faster. The big NASA rocket will be powerful enough to launch the spacecraft directly to Jupiter, making the trip in a mere 2.4 years. The commercial alternatives would require a roundabout trajectory that takes advantage of planetary \"gravity assists,\" resulting in a transit time of nearly 6 years, Martin wrote. Still, NASA should be allowed to consider those alternatives, he stressed. The first three SLS rockets are already booked to aid NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land two astronauts near the lunar south pole by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by 2028. Congress also directed NASA to launch the Europa lander aboard an SLS. Unlike Clipper, however, this mission is just a concept at the moment; it's not officially on the space agency's docket. Tuesday's letter was a follow-up to a report into the Europa Clipper and Europa lander missions that the OIG released in May. That report determined that both projects face a variety of serious challenges on the way to the launchpad. \"Our audit found that, despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, an OIG management analyst, said in a video released with the May report.

The Europa Clipper mission, in development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has just been approved for its final design and construction phase. It's on track for a 2025 launch. \"Clipper\" is the culmination of decades of dreaming and years of conceptual and preliminary design. It is only the second mission NASA has dedicated to exploring a moon in the solar system-our own moon was the first. The target, Jupiter's icy Europa, is very different from Earth's moon. Believed to possess a heated rocky core and mantle surrounded by an ice-topped ocean of liquid water up to 100 miles deep, Europa is arguably the best place in our solar system to look for life beyond Earth. Why Are We Interested in this Icy Jovian Moon? Astrobiologists' mouths water at the prospect of an ocean of liquid water -- particularly a salty one -- in contact with a rocky ocean floor. They theorize that heat from within Europa's rocky interior, generated by tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity, powers eruptions of hot, mineral-laden water on Europa's ocean floor. Such \"hydrothermal vents\" could supply all the ingredients necessary to sustain some form of life. Hydrothermal vents dot Earth's own oceans in volcanically active areas. Since their discovery, researchers have found communities of life forms that thrive around hydrothermal vents, subsisting entirely on thermal and chemical energy emerging from Earth's interior. How life arrived at these deep ocean oases is still open to scientific debate. One theory poses the idea that life on Earth could have gotten its start at hydrothermal vents and migrated later to the surface. The Challenge of Exploring a Concealed Ocean Half a Billion Miles Away. You might wonder, if there's a saltwater ocean on Europa, and the strong possibility of a life-friendly environment, why don't we already have robot submarines in the water sending us images of beautiful bioluminescent jellyfish, or something? Easier said than done. Even landing a robot on Europa's unexplored surface would be a great engineering challenge. Designing a mission capable of boring through miles of ice and descending through a hundred miles of water to reach the ocean floor, and still able to communicate with us back on Earth, is presently an adventure of science fiction. Although earlier mission concepts flirted with dropping robots onto Europa's surface, the Clipper mission won't do that. It won't even orbit Europa. That moon resides within bands of intense radiation that surround Jupiter, an environment where even a radiation-hardened spacecraft might survive only a few weeks. Such a short visit wouldn't allow much time to explore, let alone transmit the huge volumes of collected scientific data back to Earth before a fatal failure brought an end to the mission. Instead, Clipper will follow a looping trajectory around Jupiter that will send it careening past Europa on 45 close flybys. Some will pass as close as 16 miles near the surface. Between flybys the spacecraft will retreat to the far end of its elongated orbit, away from Jupiter and into safer climates beyond the deadly radiation zone. The longer mission time and extended orbits will ultimately let Clipper collect and send home up to three times as much data as a Europa-orbiting spacecraft could. Europa Clipper Will See Under Europa's Skin. Europa Clipper will carry nine scientific instruments designed to offer a detailed look at the moon, particularly the vast ocean lurking beneath its icy crust. Apart from the usual cameras and spectrometers that will take high-resolution pictures and analyze the composition of Europa's surface, Clipper will carry instruments to investigate what lies below that surface. An ice-penetrating radar will probe the frozen crust to determine its thickness and map its structure. Scientists will look for any subsurface lakes in chambers closer to the surface, which may be sources of water plumes detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. A magnetometer will measure the disturbance of Jupiter's magnetic field by Europa's salty ocean, divining its salinity and depth. Two different instruments will analyze particles \"sniffed\" during very close flybys. The composition of particles and gases in Europa's tenuous atmosphere and possibly plumes of water and chemicals erupting from its surface could help explain what Europa's ocean is made of, if those plumes originate from the ocean's waters. How Long Have We Known About Europa's Ocean? We caught our first scent of Europa's ocean in 1979 when the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew through the Jupiter system. The spacecraft captured images of Europa's fractured surface. Its patterns of cracks and fissures were best explained by a thin icy crust floating on a body of liquid. Starting in 1995 the Galileo spacecraft made 11 close flybys of Europa, capturing images of much higher detail and measuring Europa's effects on Jupiter's magnetic field. The images further confirmed the presence of the hidden ocean, and Europa's magnetic disturbances suggested that ocean is salty. In the past few years, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have tentatively detected what may be plumes of water vapor emanating from Europa's southern polar region, further whetting scientists' appetites to explore the exo-ocean. We'll have to wait a few more years before getting our next taste of Europa's ocean waters, but at least we know that Europa Clipper is on the way.

Data was collected during several hundred supersonic test runs in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley of a scale model of the Block 1 Cargo vehicle that is the currently mandated booster for the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. The first of six major testing campaigns began last year and are being conducted at NASA wind tunnels across the United States in support of the SLS Program's design analysis of the new configuration. The aerodynamic data is used to refine analysis and modeling of the vehicle's atmospheric trajectories, Guidance, Navigation, and Control, and structural loading. Testing is planned to cover the early phase of flight all the way out to Solid Rocket Booster separation, going back to the liftoff period to measure the effect of ground winds on the rocket, and also before liftoff while sitting on the Mobile Launcher. Supersonic Mach range test campaign for new SLS vehicle config. A 0.8-percent scale model of the SLS Block 1 Cargo configuration was set up in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Langley for this round of aerodynamics testing. \"We did about seven hundred runs, that was covering the Mach range in different pitches and rolls,\" Courtney Winski, a research aerospace engineer at NASA Langley, said in an interview. \"We just completed that test, that was Mach 1.5 to 4.5.\" During test runs, the wind tunnel was run at a set velocity and then data was taken as the model was moved through different orientations. \"We are varying angle of attack and roll, so we're doing pitch and roll combinations or alpha- roll combinations along with Mach number combinations, doing the same sets of pitch and roll at different Mach numbers,\" Winski explained. \"We did continuous runs and so we would set the model at a roll angle or at a pitch angle and then continuously take data while we either pitched at a set roll angle or rolled at a set pitch angle. And so we took about seven hundred of those runs over the Mach range. The entire testing took about a month, but that wasn't all run time, it was about three weeks of actual 'wind on' running in the Unitary.\" This model is configured with the shorter, 14-meter Delta 4 payload fairing that would encapsulate Europa Clipper. The \"Jupiter Direct\" trajectory is performance-challenging for the Block 1 vehicle and the shorter fairing saves weight over the longer, 19-meter PLF. \"A single run where we would pitch about twenty-four degrees just to kind of completely cover every option would take a little over a minute, where it was sitting at a single Mach number,\" she noted. The same data set would be collected in another run at another Mach number until the whole range was covered. \"The way that we would qualify it as is that the flight is quasi static in terms of Mach number,\" Jeremy Pinier, NASA's SLS Aerodynamics Team Lead at Langley, said in the interview. \"From liftoff to booster separation, that's around two minutes, so it goes from Mach zero to Mach four and a half in two minutes but that's actually pretty long and so we consider the state of the flow as quasi static.\" \"So we can go in the wind tunnel and sit at a Mach number and take data, take all the data we need at that Mach number and then go to the next Mach number, take all the data we need there and then create those databases where the GNC guys will be able to take our database and slice through this database even though in the wind tunnel we were statically sitting at a Mach number.\" \"The main data that we're collecting was force and moment data on the model,\" Winski noted. \"On this model we did not have pressure ports, but we did have the pressure sensitive paint .\" The luminescent paint provides visual data of the distribution of pressure over the model during wind tunnel testing. \"There are special lights on the tunnel,\" Winski noted. \"How much it actually causes the model to luminesce, because it's reacting with how much oxygen is in the air, is related to the pressure that it is seeing, how much light is luminescing off of it.\" \"We would have to sit at a condition for like thirty seconds or so and they would take images with the model just sitting still with conditions not changing.\" \"For this test what we actually did is we ran the model without paint for all of the force and moment testing and then once we completed the force and moment testing the model was painted for PSP,\" she added. \"If we were to retest this model later on for force and moment we would actually remove the PSP paint before testing.\" \"The paint is very sensitive, we can only use it for one test,\" Pinier said. \"It's sensitive to light, it's sensitive to oils on your hands, so if you touch the model it can damage the paint. So we paint it once for each test and then we can remove it and paint it again.\" \"What you saw in the picture with Courtney is the traditional pressure sensitive paint, steady pressure sensitive paint,\" he noted. \"It's a pretty mature technology, it's used in many institutions, in many labs and wind tunnels.\" A new, unsteady pressure sensitive paint is still in development but may be applied to future testing. \"We've already run a few exploratory tests using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint and it's shown very promising results,\" Pinier noted. \"We're thinking at some point we'll be able to characterize the buffet environment using the unsteady pressure sensitive paint. I say at some point because it needs validation, this technology needs to be validated first.\" Pad rollout to Boost phase aerodynamics Current testing is focused on the Block 1 Cargo configuration. \"We're just focusing this one right now because we've already done a lot of testing on all the other configurations,\" Pinier said. \"This Block 1 Cargo configuration was completely new to us when it came out and we had to start a whole testing campaign for that one specifically.\" The testing is intended to create an aerodynamic database for the vehicle configuration, from rolling out to the launch pad through liftoff, through the Boost phase of flight that goes through SRB separation and beyond. \"At liftoff you've got the ground winds that are pushing on the vehicle and the tower and those two are connected,\" Pinier explained. \"We're really interested in the ground wind loads on the tower and the vehicle, just static loads from winds from all directions, north, south, east, west.\" \"They're also interested in when they are rolling out the vehicle on the Mobile Launcher from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad there's also ground wind environments there.\" \"At T-0 you're really at ninety degrees angle of attack with the wind perpendicular to the vehicle,\" he added. \"As the vehicle accelerates that angle of attack reduces very quickly down to single digits in degrees. And so during ascent, subsonic all the way to supersonic Mach numbers we test at low angles of attack, meaning below eight degrees angle of attack. And really the vehicle is going to fly below four degrees angle of attack.\" \"As you're accelerating you go through Mach 1, you know lots of things happen around Mach 1,\" he continued. \"The fluid dynamics around Mach 1, speed of sound, are very non-linear. The unsteady pressure environment on the vehicle is the highest and that's what creates buffet. Basically you can think of it as the air kind of shaking the vehicle structure around Mach 1.\" \"The buffet is all of the low-frequency type of shaking of the vehicle that happens around transonic Mach numbers and the aeroacoustics is all of the higher-frequency shaking that happens in this airflow as it's going over the vehicle.\" \"So you go through Mach 1, you get past peak buffet loads and then you get to maximum dynamic pressure, which is when basically the force of the air on the vehicle, the static force is the highest,\" he continued. \"You get max dynamic pressure between Mach 1 and 2. The loads guys are mostly interested in the static loads on the vehicle during that phase in flight.\" \"And then you accelerate and everything in the environments start to tail off. Aeroacoustics is still present but it's also tailing off.\" \"Some of the things we look at as we get to higher and higher altitudes and close to booster separation is something called plume induced flow separation,\" he added. \"The plumes of the vehicle as you've probably seen when the rocket launches and gets to high altitude become very underexpanded, meaning they become very large and they can induce local separation of the flow on the back of the vehicle so we try to look at that at the highest Mach numbers.\" \"And then you get to booster separation around Mach 4, Mach 5, and that's where we have to characterize that environment to make sure that the boosters don't come back and contact the Core Stage.\" Testing to build aero database for design analysis of new vehicle configuration Testing all of those regions in the early phase of flight involves wind tunnels at NASA centers across the country. \"We tested at the Marshall fourteen-inch trisonic tunnel to get some data quickly,\" Pinier said. \"We can test quickly in that tunnel and get the data for initial design cycles; however, very quickly for this one we needed mature data so where we've got is we're probably in the middle of a testing campaign that comprises six large wind tunnel tests. This picture that you saw was from the test at the Langley Unitary Wind Tunnel to cover the high supersonic Mach range.\" \"We have also run a wind tunnel test at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to cover the subsonic to about Mach 2.5 range for ascent, that was a 1.3 percent scale model,\" he added. \"We are current getting set up to run a liftoff test at the Langley fourteen by twenty-two wind tunnel to cover the liftoff phase of flight and a 1.75 percent scale model along with a 1.75 percent scale Mobile Launcher. We're trying to characterize the liftoff environment with winds from all directions and basically the entire rollout to liftoff phase of flight.\" \"We're going to have a wind tunnel test this summer at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel to characterize the aeroacoustics environment - transonic and low supersonic aeroacoustic environments,\" he continued. \"So we're going to have a transonic buffet environment test at the TDT or Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Langley, that's going to occur next calendar year and that's to characterize the unsteady buffet environment as the vehicle goes through the transonic Mach numbers.\" \"The sixth one is going to be a booster separation wind tunnel test at the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel and that's going to be a static 0.9 percent scale model. Those tests are pretty standard, those are critical phases of flight where we need to get that data right and so we rely heavily on wind tunnels for those critical databases.\" \"For pretty much every configuration of the Space Launch System family we've run those tests,\" Pinier added. \"We're just doing it all over for this particular configuration.\" Data feeds into two areas of design analysis work The database being generated for this vehicle configuration from the wind tunnel testing is used by different design groups. \"There's really two customers for us - for the aerodynamics team,\" Pinier explained. \"One of them is the trajectory and guidance navigation and control teams. They are interested in databases to cover the entire Mach range.\" \"We take force and moment data for the entire Mach range and we put it in databases, give that to them,\" he added. \"They design trajectories, they run Monte Carlo simulations...in dispersed flight conditions throughout the entire Boost phase. So that's one of the customers - integrated forces and moments go to GN&C and trajectory.\" \"The second customer is the loads team,\" he continued. \"They're interested in the aerodynamic loading on the vehicle and in this case they are really interested in the peak loading phases of flight.\" On the right, a Schlieren image of a 0.8 percent scale model of the vehicle in Langley's supersonic wind tunnel at a supersonic Mach number. The force-moment and pressure data collected in the wind tunnel tests validates and is fed back into the analytical models. \"So for example, buffet. We don't have to characterize buffet throughout the entire Boost phase because we know buffet peaks around Mach 1 so we focus on transonic conditions for buffet environment.\" \"Aeroacoustics, we know those go a little higher than that so we characterize aeroacoustic environments all the way up to Mach two and a half and the aeroacoustics environment is also an environment that goes to the loads team.\" \"So those are the two biggest products, the aeroacoustics and the buffet, that go to the loads team that are kind of critical,\" Pinier said. \"A third one would be just the static loading, the distribution of the loading during ascent.\" \"It's not a driver for design, but we produce that. That comes mostly out of CFD, basically the distribution of the pressures over the entire vehicle as it goes through the Boost phase, but now that we have pressure sensitive paint when we're doing force-moment measurements we try to do this pressure sensitive paint measurement in order to validate the CFD.\" \"Those are models that the loads team have and they apply and they add those models gusts and wind shear and they add those models on top of what we give them in terms of environments,\" Pinier said. \"There's no way to measure that in a ground test environment.\" Block 1 Cargo is a new config under analysis The Block 1 Cargo configuration was studied earlier in the program, but more detailed design analysis began last year when the SLS option of flying the Europa Clipper spacecraft was moved back to the Block 1 vehicle as a part of Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. SLS is still the mandated launch vehicle for Europa Clipper, but also remains a source of disagreement between the Trump Administration and Congress. Congress mostly recently retained the SLS mandate in the language in Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations passed in mid-February. Although the FY 2019 appropriations were signed by the President, the Administration remains opposed to using SLS for Europa; as in past years, their Fiscal Year 2020 Budget submission that followed in mid-March continues to advocate use of U.S. commercial launch services. Two other launch options on heavy-lift commercial vehicles would perform one or more gravity assist flybys past Earth and/or Venus; the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with any of these options. Congress and the Administration did reach agreement on one mandate also written into law, regarding the launch date. Previously, Congress enacted a 2022 launch mandate and the Administration proposed launch in 2025; the FY 2019 appropriations were passed with a 2023 launch target and the Administration's FY 2020 budget request supports this. While the \"Jupiter Direct\" launch mandate remains in place, the SLS Program continues design work on the general configuration and the specific mission, referred to as Science Mission-1. \"This cargo configuration as you probably know is for the Europa Clipper mission and there are two potential fairings, a short one and a long one and currently the primary one we're testing is the short one,\" Pinier said. The Block 1 vehicles use a derivative of United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy upper stage and the Delta's payload fairing system would also be used to encapsulate the spacecraft in the SLS launch option. The short fairing is approximately 14 meters long, the long fairing is approximately 19 meters long. \"It makes a lot of sense once you're in the wind tunnel to go ahead and test several configurations, so we have done some testing on the long configuration but currently the shorter one is the priority,\" Pinier added.

Europa Clipper is currently scheduled to launch in 2023 to orbit the moon for more than three years, studying its icy shell and suspected internal ocean, among other features. Europa Lander would follow in its wake and touch down on the ice in order to better investigate the possibility of life. But according to a nine-month investigation conducted by the NASA Office of Inspector General, both missions are facing a host of serious issues as their teams attempt to balance the needs of NASA and Congress. \"Our audit found that despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, a management analyst at the Office of Inspector General, said in a video released with the report. The report highlighted that since 2013, Congress has provided more than $2 billion for the pair of Europa missions. The Clipper mission alone is expected to cost at least $2.8 billion, according to the report. Every year of that period, the missions' funding has exceeded NASA's budget request. But with all that money has come a lot of strings. First, Congress has ordered NASA to launch both missions on the agency's SLS rocket, which is still in development. Congress also set specific launch targets - currently 2023 for Europa Clipper and 2025 for Europa Lander. Those two directives may be contradictory. Experts were already worried about the rocket's development; these concerns aren't just a problem for Europa, they also could affect projects like NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. But for Europa specifically, the first flight version of the SLS definitely won't be able to do the job for Europa Lander, and it's not clear yet whether it can successfully launch Europa Clipper, the investigation found. Clipper may need, and Lander will definitely need, a more advanced version of the rocket aiming to fly in 2024 but also predicted to slip. NASA also has not yet ordered a vital part of the SLS that the investigation found requires 52 months to produce - which it should have done in September to be ready in time for a summer 2023 launch. Because of these SLS problems, NASA's budget request released earlier this year also raises the possibility of launching on a commercial vehicle. The Clipper team has attempted to work around this problem by still considering the possibility that they'll be switched to ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, both of which are already flying. But the continuing uncertainty \"creates added risks and uncertainties for an already challenging project,\" the investigation found. Another challenge the investigation found is that the Clipper mission is struggling to manage its staffing. The mission is run out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. But as of December, about 10% of Clipper's JPL staff roles were vacant, the investigation found, in part because the center is running four other key NASA projects, including Mars 2020, and keeps having to shuffle staff members between the neediest missions. The investigation also found that Clipper suffered from an instrument- selection process that tried to be too wary of conflicts of interest. Clipper team members with perceived conflicts of interest - but also vital knowledge about the mission - were either cut out of the instrument-selection process or given insufficient time to review insufficient information, according to the investigation., which was designed to measure the magnetic field around the moon, replacing it with a simpler version. The investigation did not explicitly link that decision to the instrument-selection issues it identified.) The report found similar issues plaguing the Europa Lander mission as well, although that project is in a more preliminary stage and NASA has not yet formally committed to launching it. The investigation also raised concerns that by scheduling the Lander to launch so soon after Clipper, it won't be able to fully integrate its predecessor's discoveries into its mission plan. The investigation team concluded with 10 recommendations it believes can help NASA get the Europa projects back on track and avoid similar issues in the future. Those recommendations include evaluating JPL's overall staffing, rescheduling mission milestones more realistically and making sure mission- related estimates reflect the risks associated with the SLS.

The audit also noted that the Europa program's biggest backer, John Culberson, no longer chairs the House appropriations subcommittee. The Republican Congressman from Texas was defeated in his reelection bid last year. The audit found that the Space Launch System (SLS) would probably not be available in time for the orbiter's planned launch in 2023. Congress has mandated the program use SLS for both missions. Using SLS would also be more expensive than using commercially available rockets such as Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy. The audit projected cost savings of at least $276 million from using the other launchers. The cost of up to $450 million for the Falcon Heavy appears to high. SpaceX has advertised Falcon Heavy launches at between $90 million and $150 million. \"These are conservative estimates for a commercial launch during this time frame; specific launch costs for the Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy are procurement sensitive,\" the audit stated. Cost, however, is not the only factor. The report notes that SLS would be capable of doing a direct trajectory to Europa, cutting four years off the transit time. This would allow the orbiter to collect far more data at the moon before NASA launches a lander there. Launching on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV would require gravity assist maneuvers that would take more time and require a beefed up spacecraft. \"Launching on a commercial launch vehicle will also subject Clipper to a more severe thermal environment requiring additional thermal and ultraviolet protection, which are already designed into the spacecraft,\" the audit found. \"The risks associated with a gravity assist flight trajectory need to be resolved prior to the Agency establishing the project's cost and schedule baseline.\" The report stated that NASA is studying whether the Falcon Heavy could send the orbiter on a Venus-Earth gravity assist that would reduce transit time and thermal exposure near Venus. Complicating the choice of a booster is that if the Europa Clipper orbiter misses its planned 2023 launch date, it could not be launched the next year due to a lack of a planetary alignment. NASA must also weight booster reliability. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launcher has flown two successful flights with no failures., with four more flights on the manifest through 2022. The audit noted the launcher would have to go through certification before it could launch the costly Europa mission. \"While the U.S. Air Force purchased Falcon Heavy launches in 2018, the vehicle would need to pass additional flight testing (known as Category-3 certification) for high priority, very high complexity,or high-cost payloads-descriptions that apply to the Europa Clipper mission,\" the audit stated. \"As part of this NASA certification process, the Falcon Heavy would need to have accomplished three successful flights by the Clipper's launch readiness date,\" the audit added. Reliability is also a concern with SLS, which is scheduled to launch for the first time in late 2020 or early 2021. \"Although the SLS will have had minimal flight history if the Europa Clipper is launched in the 2023 time frame, senior NASA managers believe the extensive quality assurance testing required to human-rate the vehicle will provide the needed confidence levels to meet the intent of commercial launch vehicle certification requirements,\" the audit said. Delta IV boosters have launched 37 times, including 10 Delta IV variants. All were successful except the first Delta IV Heavy flight, which suffered a partial failure. However, United Launch Alliance's plan to switch to the new Vulcan Centaur booster while phasing out the Delta IV line could result in higher costs. \"To support a Clipper launch with the Delta IV Heavy, NASA would have to provide more money upfront to keep production lines open and is at risk of having to shoulder some of the cost of maintaining the site required to launch that particular rocket, potentially increasing launch costs significantly if Clipper is the last Delta IV Heavy launch,\" the audit found.

The team building the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of nine science instruments on board NASA's Europa Clipper mission to make multiple flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa, has passed its critical design review (CDR) and has begun construction of the flight instrument and other systems. PIMS, built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, will measure the plasmas, or electrically charged gasses, in Europa's ionosphere (the moon's upper atmosphere) and Jupiter's magnetosphere (created by the planet's magnetic field). These plasma measurements will contribute to other data used to determine the thickness of the ice shell that covers Europa, and the depth and makeup of the liquid-water ocean below that shell. PIMS will do this by taking advantage of the rapidly flowing plasma that connects Europa to Jupiter. This plasma, which moves at more than 220,000 miles per hour and rotates with Jupiter, constantly ebbs and flows over Europa, much like water in a stream over a rock. The plasma interacts with neutral and ionized gasses surrounding Europa and with ices on the surface of the moon, producing radiation damage, ionization and other effects that will modify the ice composition. \"We put PIMS through extremely thorough testing, and we're excited to begin construction of our flight instrument,\" said APL's Joseph Westlake, the instrument's principal investigator. \"In addition to vibration and shock testing, we simulated every environment that PIMS will experience from Earth to Europa, and it passed with flying colors.\" The instrument - which is shielded to protect it from the high radiation around Jupiter - has two identical sensors mounted on opposite sides of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The two sensors provide a large entrance to study the plasma. The plasma sensors are Faraday cups, which capture and measure the current from charged particles in the plasma. When combined with magnetic field data, information from PIMS will help reveal details about Europa's structure unable to be determined from Earth-based observations. PIMS is being built by Johns Hopkins APL; the University of Michigan is contributing critical electronic components. The PIMS science team includes researchers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Oregon and the University of Michigan. The Europa Clipper mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The multiple-flyby concept was developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins APL, which is building the PIMS and Europa Imaging System (EIS) instruments and providing the spacecraft's communication and propulsion systems.

But that hasn't killed the dream of sending something, anything, to that corner of the solar system. NASA had planned to launch the Europa Clipper mission in 2022 to circle Jupiter and pass Europa dozens of times. The idea was to swoop low and check for elements of life by analyzing particles of ice, water, and rock that may be spewing out from the moon's surface like the spray of a geyser. But the ambitious $2 billion mission has stumbled. Earlier this year, the launch date slipped from 2022 to 2023, and there's still no rocket to get it there. NASA's Space Launch System rocket is behind schedule and over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office, while a commercial rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy would take twice as long to reach Europa from Earth as the SLS, which can make the trip in about three years. NASA is hoping to start building the Europa Clipper spacecraft later this year while both rocket systems continue testing. But a NASA Inspector General report released in May found that space agency officials underestimated both the time and money needed to get the Europa Clipper mission off the ground. Meanwhile, a follow-up mission to be launched two years after-called Europa Lander, which would put some kind of device on the crusty surface-has become less certain. The report concluded that, given the current pace of work, that mission could not even consider launching until 2030. Still, all is not lost for fans of Europa and the possibility of finding something amazing there (even if it's not an astronaut-munching creature as depicted in the 2013 sci-fi thriller \"Europa Report\"). Even with the recent budgetary and logistical problems, planetary scientists are pretty excited about building and testing devices to help them uncover life once a mission does reach the planet's orbit or even its surface. \"We are looking at what we will do when we get there,\" says Cynthia Phillips, a member of the Europa mission science team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We have two sets of arrival dates. We are looking at what trajectories we can use and what kinds of observations we will make once we get there.\" Phillips says Europa is a special place. It's only about the size of our own moon, but its icy surface hides an ocean 60 miles deep that contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \"It is one of the best places to look for life in the solar system beyond Earth,\" she says. Because gravity is weaker on Europa than here, the pressure at the bottom of this super-deep ocean is about the same as the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Earth's deepest spot at about 36,000 feet. Europa might even be better than other icy moons, because its seas have a rocky bottom instead of being sandwiched between layers of ice, as on neighboring moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's Enceladus and Titan. That environment could be an ideal place to find hydrothermal vents that spew minerals into the ocean and, perhaps, creatures that evolved to harvest them. Marine scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who explore Earth's hydrothermal vents have been working with NASA to devise autonomous underwater vehicles that could work on both Earth and Europa. The agency just announced a $7.6 million, five-year collaboration with WHOI to have space and ocean researchers brainstorm the science and technology needed for future Europa missions. Even though a landing on Europa is more than a decade away, some engineers are already testing drills to burrow through the ice sheet to the life-giving ocean below. A Brooklyn-based space company called Honeybee Robotics is planning a plutonium-powered probe with a rotating drill head that would take three years to work its way through the ice. The team now has prototypes of the device, called SLUSH (Search for Life Using a Submersible Heated Drill), drilling through icy cryochambers in the firm's Pasadena lab. \"These technologies are just over the horizon,\" said Honeybee's Tighe Costa at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held last week in Seattle. Then there's the plutonium-powered TunnelBot, which can drill and sample subsurface life. That's being developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center. There's also ARCHIMEDES (A Really Cool High-Impact Method for Exploring Down into the Europan Subsurface), designed by Austin-based Stone Aerospace, which will use lasers to melt the ice. These devices have a host of engineering obstacles to surmount in the coming years. They have to carry their own power supply, take samples without damaging any potential life form with a radiation leak, and transmit data back to Europa's surface, and then back to scientists on Earth. So while NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and China race to put humans back on the lifeless moon or faraway Mars, a more exciting (albeit slow-motion) race is underway to reach a tiny moon that may be hiding a big secret.

The Europa Clipper mission will target the ice-encrusted moon of Jupiter, which is considered a prime target in the search for life beyond Earth. Below its icy shell, Europa is thought to hold a 170km-deep body of water. This could have the right conditions for biology. Due to launch in 2025, the Europa Clipper mission has now passed a stage called Key Decision Point C, a crucial marker on the road to the launch pad. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. Europa Clipper will carry out an in-depth investigation of the watery world, including whether it can support life in its subsurface ocean. Gravitational interactions with Jupiter generate tidal forces and heat, which keeps Europa's ocean liquid. The heating may even drive volcanic vents on the seafloor; on Earth, such vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But it has taken decades to bring a dedicated mission this far, in part because of cost considerations and the challenges posed by the space environment around Jupiter. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into belts of intense radiation that surround the giant planet. This radiation fries spacecraft electronics, which limits the durations of prospective missions to months or even weeks. So rather than orbiting Europa, Clipper will make repeated close flybys of the moon, to reduce its exposure to the energetic particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. The spacecraft will carry nine science instruments, including cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of the moon's surface, a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of its magnetic field (providing clues to the ocean's depth and salinity) and an ice-penetrating radar to determine the thickness of the icy crust above the ocean. The ice shell could be tens of kilometres thick. Luckily, scientists think there are several ways for ocean water to get up to Europa's surface. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope has made tentative observations of plumes of water-ice erupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Saturn's ice moon Enceladus, which also has a subsurface ocean. The first concepts for missions to explore Europa were drawn up in the 1990s, around the time that data from the Galileo spacecraft helped build evidence for a subsurface ocean. Since then, however, one proposal after another has been thwarted, including an ambitious US-European mission along the lines of the Cassini-Huygens mission. But Clipper has had a key champion on Capitol Hill, in the form of Republican legislator John Culberson who, as chairman of the US House of Representatives appropriations committee that funds Nasa, channelled money to the mission. But last year, Culberson, who had become known for his advocacy on Europa exploration, was unseated in Texas' 7th congressional district by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. During the campaign, a pro-Democrat political action committee ran an ad saying: \"For Houston, Lizzie Fletcher will invest in humans, not aliens.\" A follow-up mission to go and land on Europa has also been proposed. But the most recent federal budget request included no funding for the lander.

Because of the severe radiation challenges of the Jovian system, Europa Clipper is one of the most ambitious flagship missions ever attempted by NASA, with seismic implications for the agency's search for life beyond Earth. Europa-with its deep, ancient ocean locked beneath an icy crust-is seen by some astrobiologists as the solar system's most promising site for harboring alien biology. In search of further signs of habitability, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter and encounter the moon multiple times. With each flyby, it will collect data on Europa's ice shell and subsurface ocean, remotely sounding the unseen fathoms below. According to Curt Niebur, the mission's program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Europa Clipper could answer the question of whether the right conditions exist on the icy moon to support life as we know it. If those ingredients-which include organic molecules, as well as potential energy sources such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor-are found on Europa, Niebur says, \"we're going to want to explore further and see if life actually has arisen under the ice.\" A second mission, now in development, would land on Europa to excavate and collect samples in search of native organisms. Beyond the science, the mission has an unusual political element: Europa Clipper is the first and only space mission to be married to a specific spacecraft in any appropriations bill, says former Republican representative John Culberson of Texas, a longtime Europa advocate who previously chaired the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. The current appropriations bill mandates Europa Clipper use the SLS and requires a \"launch no later than 2023\" on the rocket. It was a move that Culberson, an attorney and political consultant, used to ensure Europa Clipper would one day reach the launchpad. He says tying the mission to the SLS, which is being built in Alabama, garnered the support of Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, without which the mission might not have been mandated by law. (Attempts to reach Senator Shelby for this article were unsuccessful. A staffer reported that he was unavailable for comment.) While Europa Clipper's development has proceeded apace, however, the SLS rocket has remained mired in setbacks and was arrogated by the Artemis lunar program instigated by the Trump administration. Before it could carry the Europa craft to space, the SLS would fly two Artemis moon missions-the first of which has reportedly been pushed back from 2020 to 2021, according to Senate testimony by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this year. For Europa Clipper to launch on time, the second Artemis launch, now scheduled for 2023, would have to occur without error, with a third SLS rocket ready to go-a tall order, considering the program's lengthy development, three-year delay and zero rockets completed thus far. A report issued this past May by NASA's Office of Inspector General supports that the SLS \"is unlikely to be available\" for Europa Clipper in 2023. And it adds that NASA \"continues to maintain spacecraft capabilities to accommodate both the SLS and two commercial launch vehicles.\" Moreover, even NASA's own 2019 budget encourages \"a Europa Clipper launch readiness date in 2025\" and further proposes \"to launch the Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle\" to save money. Each SLS launch is estimated to run more than $1 billion. In its Europa Clipper Key Decision Point-C memorandum, the formal commitment signed at NASA Headquarters earlier this month, the spacecraft is scheduled for a launch that ranges from 2023 to 2025, confirms Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate. But if the mission were to launch in 2025-or on something other than the SLS-it would be in violation of current law, which means the law must change or a working SLS must suddenly appear in order for Europa Clipper to take off in accordance with federal statute. \"We've been working very hard to follow the appropriation law,\" says Joan Salute, program executive of Europa Clipper. But she admits the mission \"may or may not\" be possible with the SLS in 2023. And if it's not, she says, \"we can't follow that appropriations law.\" Both Salute and Zurbuchen say forthcoming appropriations bills may need to be updated. \"Congress will follow the development of the SLS, and that language should be updated as we know more about the SLS's availability to us, or not, in 2023,\" Salute says. And NASA will talk to Congress in order to \"make sure the right solution happens for the American taxpayer,\" Zurbuchen adds. Zurbuchen points out that the appropriations bill's language had been changed previously to accommodate Europa Clipper. Indeed, the 2017 appropriations bill called for a 2022 orbit and 2024 landing. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its research-and-development center, says, \"When Congress returns in September, we will continue to work to pass an appropriations package across the House and Senate that preserves our strong support for Europa Clipper's goals and timeline. We will also continue to monitor the mission's progress as part of that process, including the potential launch vehicle.\" Another vehicle that could take Europa Clipper to Jupiter's moon is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy-though it would do so with an asterisk attached. Falcon Heavy has already achieved three successful launches, but using the SpaceX rocket-which is less powerful than the SLS-would add at least three years of travel time to the planned two-year mission. And while using SpaceX's rocket would save hundreds of millions of dollars on launch costs, it could add to Europa Clipper's operations budget because of its longer cruise time to Jupiter. \"It's vital that the Europa Clipper be launched on the SLS,\" Culberson says. The SLS has an undeniable advantage over Falcon Heavy: it enables a direct flight from Earth to Jupiter. Falcon Heavy will require gravity assists from other planets, and unless it uses an add-on \"kicker stage\"-an additional upper stage for extra loft-one of those gravity assists will require an encounter with Venus. According to Salute, a Venus flyby introduces \"a riskier environment, radiation and temperature. And so we would like to avoid flying closer to Venus with this direct trajectory that SLS affords us. Right now, SLS is the only launch vehicle that can give us that trajectory, and that's why it's so advantageous to us.\" The idea that Europa Clipper might not run on the SLS is almost unthinkable to Culberson, who says he remains optimistic the mission will fly on the SLS in 2023. \"Heaven forbid SLS is not ready in time,\" he says. \"But in the event that it's not, the most important thing for the mission is to ensure [it arrives] safely. The rocket, whatever it is, has to be reliable and has to be powerful enough to get the Clipper to Europa in a timely fashion.\" ", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-has-committed-to-a-rocket-for-the-europa-mission-and-it-wont-be-ready-on-time/"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moon for signs of life", "date": "2019-08-20", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission is entering its final design stage before construction and testing of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments it will carry to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Europa has been a high priority for scientists because, as an ice-covered moon with a subsurface salty liquid ocean, it has been identified as one of the ideal spots for hosting life in our solar system. In 2017, NASA announced new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The icy ocean worlds contain intriguing chemistry and water plume activity. The Europa Clipper mission is also the first to explore an alien ocean. \"If there are plumes on Europa, as we now strongly suspect, with the Europa Clipper we will be ready for them,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. The Europa Clipper, named for the streamlined sailing ships of the 1800s, could launch as early as 2023, but a targeted launch has been set for 2025. It is expected to reach Europa after a journey lasting several years. Europa Clipper will carry cameras and spectrometers to capture images and determine the composition of the moon. Ice-penetrating radar will measure the thickness of the ice shell covering the ocean and help search for the subsurface lakes believed to be there, much like those in Antarctica on Earth. A magnetometer can determine the strength and direction of the moon's magnetic field to understand how deep the ocean goes and its salinity. To investigate the possible plumes, a thermal instrument will search for eruptions or water particles in the atmosphere. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" Zurbuchen said. Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission observed long lines and dark spots instead of a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet. During its closest flyby of Europa in 1997, less than 93 miles above the surface, Galileo collected signatures of changes in Europa's magnetic field that the scientists didn't understand, said Margaret Kivelson, professor emerita of space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Last year, Kivelson and her colleagues took a closer look at that data. They realized that during the flyby, Galileo flew through a plume. This fortuitous happenstance is the best evidence of plumes to date, the study said. The necessary ingredients for life as we know it include liquid water, energy sources and chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. But we've also learned that life finds a way to exist in the harshest of Earth's environments, like vents in the deepest parts of the ocean floor. There, microbes don't receive energy from sunlight but use methanogenesis, a process that reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, to form methane. Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus show some of these key ingredients for life in their oceans, which is why researchers believe they are the best chance for finding life beyond Earth in our own solar system. While Galileo didn't know it was flying through a plume and was incapable of collecting material from it, Europa Clipper will be able to gather samples from plumes if it can fly through them. This would allow scientists a first look at the material inside Europa's ocean that's spewing through the icy crust and could reveal whether Europa's ocean is habitable. Europa Clipper's instruments will be capable of \"sniffing\" the atmosphere of Europa, with more than 40 planned flybys. The flybys will be less than 228 miles above the surface of the moon, within the observed range of the plumes, which can reach 124 to 228 miles above the surface. \"If plumes exist and we can directly sample what's coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist. \"That's what the mission is after. That's the big picture.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/world/europa-clipper-mission-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Clears Big Hurdle on Path to Launch", "date": "2019-08-21", "content": "A highly anticipated NASA mission to Jupiter's possibly life-supporting moon Europa remains on track for a mid-2020s launch.

Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, one of the planet's largest moons. Europa has an icy surface, below which most scientists believe is a deep ocean of liquid water. Combined with the interior heat source that keeps the ocean from freezing, and the presence of organic compounds, Europa has the basic requirements to support life. While the programmatic milestone Europa Clipper achieved, known in NASA parlance as Key Decision Point C, is the point where NASA sets the schedule and budget for the mission, exactly when Europa Clipper will launch is not yet clear. In the statement announcing the mission's confirmation, NASA noted that current plans have the spacecraft ready for launch as soon as 2023. However, the mission has a formal launch readiness date of 2025. That uncertainty is linked to how the mission will be launched. The mission's preferred launch option is the Space Launch System, which will allow the spacecraft to travel directly to Jupiter without the need of gravity assists, arriving within three years of launch. Language in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 and prior years also directed NASA to use the SLS. However, in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NASA proposed using a commercial launch vehicle, such as a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy, to launch Europa Clipper, saying that doing so would save several hundred million dollars even though the transit time to Jupiter would be about seven years. A report by NASA's Office of Inspector General in May downplayed the cost savings by using an alternative launch vehicle, but noted it is not possible to launch Europa Clipper on an SLS in 2023 since there won't be an available SLS for that mission then. The announcement didn't include a cost estimate for the mission, but agency spokesperson Alana Johnson said Aug. 21 that the agency baseline commitment for the mission is $4.25 billion, covering all costs for the entire mission. The NASA Office of Inspector General report cited an assessment last October by the mission's standing review board that estimated the mission's cost at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Despite the uncertainty about launch vehicle and schedule, other aspects of the mission are going well. \"Things are looking reasonably good,\" Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for Europa Clipper at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at an Aug. 21 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier in the year, NASA decided to replace a planned magnetometer instrument on the spacecraft that had suffered extensive cost overruns with a less complex \"facility\" magnetometer. That had raised concerns about whether the new magnetometer would have the precision needed to achieve science goals such as measuring the depth of Europa's subsurface ocean. Pappalardo and others at the OPAG meeting said that changes to the instrument's operation, notable periodic rolls of the spacecraft to calibrate it, should recover sufficient precision to achieve those science goals.

The United States Congress has mandated that the Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2023, ride atop NASA's huge Space Launch System megarocket. \"However, because of developmental delays and, more significantly, NASA's plans to use the first three SLS rockets produced for its Artemis lunar program, an SLS will not be available until 2025 at the earliest,\" NASA Inspector General Paul Martin wrote in a letter to select lawmakers Tuesday. \"Consequently, if completed on its projected schedule, the approximately $3 billion dollar Europa spacecraft will need to be stored for at least 2 years at a cost of $3 to $5 million per month until an SLS becomes available,\" Martin added. \"Given all of the foregoing factors, we urge Congress to consider removing the requirement that NASA launch the Europa Clipper on an SLS and allow the Agency to decide whether to use an SLS or a commercial vehicle based on cost, schedule, vehicle availability and impact on science requirements,\" he concluded in the letter, stressing that the OIG believes this issue \"requires immediate action by Congress.\" Commercial vehicles will be available for Clipper; Martin mentioned SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket and United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, both of which are already flying. Europa Clipper is designed to characterize the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath the moon's icy shell, assess Europa's ability to host life as we know it, scout out touchdown sites for a potential life- hunting lander mission and perform a number of other tasks. The probe will do this work during dozens of flybys of Europa, which it will make after reaching Jupiter orbit. The SLS would allow Clipper to get to the gas giant much faster. The big NASA rocket will be powerful enough to launch the spacecraft directly to Jupiter, making the trip in a mere 2.4 years. The commercial alternatives would require a roundabout trajectory that takes advantage of planetary \"gravity assists,\" resulting in a transit time of nearly 6 years, Martin wrote. Still, NASA should be allowed to consider those alternatives, he stressed. The first three SLS rockets are already booked to aid NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land two astronauts near the lunar south pole by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by 2028. Congress also directed NASA to launch the Europa lander aboard an SLS. Unlike Clipper, however, this mission is just a concept at the moment; it's not officially on the space agency's docket. Tuesday's letter was a follow-up to a report into the Europa Clipper and Europa lander missions that the OIG released in May. That report determined that both projects face a variety of serious challenges on the way to the launchpad. \"Our audit found that, despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, an OIG management analyst, said in a video released with the May report.

The Europa Clipper mission, in development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has just been approved for its final design and construction phase. It's on track for a 2025 launch. \"Clipper\" is the culmination of decades of dreaming and years of conceptual and preliminary design. It is only the second mission NASA has dedicated to exploring a moon in the solar system-our own moon was the first. The target, Jupiter's icy Europa, is very different from Earth's moon. Believed to possess a heated rocky core and mantle surrounded by an ice-topped ocean of liquid water up to 100 miles deep, Europa is arguably the best place in our solar system to look for life beyond Earth. Why Are We Interested in this Icy Jovian Moon? Astrobiologists' mouths water at the prospect of an ocean of liquid water -- particularly a salty one -- in contact with a rocky ocean floor. They theorize that heat from within Europa's rocky interior, generated by tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity, powers eruptions of hot, mineral-laden water on Europa's ocean floor. Such \"hydrothermal vents\" could supply all the ingredients necessary to sustain some form of life. Hydrothermal vents dot Earth's own oceans in volcanically active areas. Since their discovery, researchers have found communities of life forms that thrive around hydrothermal vents, subsisting entirely on thermal and chemical energy emerging from Earth's interior. How life arrived at these deep ocean oases is still open to scientific debate. One theory poses the idea that life on Earth could have gotten its start at hydrothermal vents and migrated later to the surface. The Challenge of Exploring a Concealed Ocean Half a Billion Miles Away. You might wonder, if there's a saltwater ocean on Europa, and the strong possibility of a life-friendly environment, why don't we already have robot submarines in the water sending us images of beautiful bioluminescent jellyfish, or something? Easier said than done. Even landing a robot on Europa's unexplored surface would be a great engineering challenge. Designing a mission capable of boring through miles of ice and descending through a hundred miles of water to reach the ocean floor, and still able to communicate with us back on Earth, is presently an adventure of science fiction. Although earlier mission concepts flirted with dropping robots onto Europa's surface, the Clipper mission won't do that. It won't even orbit Europa. That moon resides within bands of intense radiation that surround Jupiter, an environment where even a radiation-hardened spacecraft might survive only a few weeks. Such a short visit wouldn't allow much time to explore, let alone transmit the huge volumes of collected scientific data back to Earth before a fatal failure brought an end to the mission. Instead, Clipper will follow a looping trajectory around Jupiter that will send it careening past Europa on 45 close flybys. Some will pass as close as 16 miles near the surface. Between flybys the spacecraft will retreat to the far end of its elongated orbit, away from Jupiter and into safer climates beyond the deadly radiation zone. The longer mission time and extended orbits will ultimately let Clipper collect and send home up to three times as much data as a Europa-orbiting spacecraft could. Europa Clipper Will See Under Europa's Skin. Europa Clipper will carry nine scientific instruments designed to offer a detailed look at the moon, particularly the vast ocean lurking beneath its icy crust. Apart from the usual cameras and spectrometers that will take high-resolution pictures and analyze the composition of Europa's surface, Clipper will carry instruments to investigate what lies below that surface. An ice-penetrating radar will probe the frozen crust to determine its thickness and map its structure. Scientists will look for any subsurface lakes in chambers closer to the surface, which may be sources of water plumes detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. A magnetometer will measure the disturbance of Jupiter's magnetic field by Europa's salty ocean, divining its salinity and depth. Two different instruments will analyze particles \"sniffed\" during very close flybys. The composition of particles and gases in Europa's tenuous atmosphere and possibly plumes of water and chemicals erupting from its surface could help explain what Europa's ocean is made of, if those plumes originate from the ocean's waters. How Long Have We Known About Europa's Ocean? We caught our first scent of Europa's ocean in 1979 when the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew through the Jupiter system. The spacecraft captured images of Europa's fractured surface. Its patterns of cracks and fissures were best explained by a thin icy crust floating on a body of liquid. Starting in 1995 the Galileo spacecraft made 11 close flybys of Europa, capturing images of much higher detail and measuring Europa's effects on Jupiter's magnetic field. The images further confirmed the presence of the hidden ocean, and Europa's magnetic disturbances suggested that ocean is salty. In the past few years, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have tentatively detected what may be plumes of water vapor emanating from Europa's southern polar region, further whetting scientists' appetites to explore the exo-ocean. We'll have to wait a few more years before getting our next taste of Europa's ocean waters, but at least we know that Europa Clipper is on the way.

The farther from home a probe ventures, the longer its dispatches take to reach eager humans on Earth and the terser such reports must be. That's why computer scientists and planetary scientists are teaming up to develop an algorithm that could potentially identify the most intriguing data an icy moon explorer mission collects, sending those tidbits to receivers first. \"We're in this golden age of space exploration, and we have hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of data flooding back from across the solar system,\" Ashley Davies, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Space.com. \"It's not possible to return all the data that you ever collect.\" Hence the interest in an algorithm to negotiate what to report first. A team based at JPL is developing a potential system to do just that for individual instruments on NASA's Europa Clipper mission. That spacecraft is due to launch in the mid-2020s to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The moon is one of the most intriguing worlds in our solar system for scientists interested in understanding whether life exists beyond Earth. An ocean hidden below Europa's icy shell could potentially host microbial life similar to that found near deep-sea vents on Earth, and Clipper could collect information that would give scientists a more detailed understanding of the moon. Europa Clipper will carry nine different science instruments, and the algorithm team is already working with the teams behind three of them, with more partnerships under discussion. The instruments will look for features like warm patches in the icy shell and plumes of seawater bursting out into space. The idea behind the algorithm project is that it should be possible to train the spacecraft to spot the most promising data it gathers, then bump that to the front of the communications queue. It wouldn't change what Europa Clipper does next, but it could mean scientists wouldn't need to be quite as patient. There's just one problem: space-ready machines are ... not the typical hardware computer scientists use. The system on board Europa Clipper will be able to run at speeds of up to 200 megahertz. \"For comparison, that's about the equivalent of an early '90s desktop PC, if you took that and put that into orbit,\" Kiri Wagstaff, a computer scientist at JPL who is leading the project, told Space.com. \"We don't really encounter machines that limited today in our day-to-day life.\" The stunted processing capacity means any space-bound algorithm has to be lean, and extremely so. It's one of the two key challenges Wagstaff and her colleagues are facing in developing a system for Europa Clipper: The researchers have to come up with ways of flagging key data for the limited processor to execute in ways that are simple and quick. \"We get questions about, well, 'Are you using deep learning to help these spacecraft make these decisions?'\" Wagstaff said. \"And the answer is emphatically no, it's simply not possible.\" The team's other main challenge is that, after all, Europa Clipper itself doesn't exist yet and hasn't produced any data yet. Wagstaff and her colleagues are basing their current work on data gathered by other spacecraft and on simulations of what Clipper's data could look like, but it's not the same. Right now, the algorithm isn't a formal part of Europa Clipper, and there's no guarantee it will be used during the mission. First, it needs to pass a series of tests designed to make sure the algorithm is trim enough to work in flight. \"That's kind of a go, no-go point,\" Wagstaff said. \"If it can't fit into the available resources, you can't use it.\" Wagstaff and her colleagues are also checking whether the algorithm can withstand the harsh radiation environment around this frigid moon. The computer on the spacecraft will be sheathed to protect it from radiation, but some particles will still sneak through. Scientists need to know whether such hits can derail a calculation. But if the team can get the algorithm right, it could make Europa Clipper a more powerful mission, encouraging scientists to gather too much data to send home in the allotted time, with the assurance that they'll see the most intriguing of it. That's the first step in using such algorithms to actively shape outer solar system missions. The process has already begun at Mars on NASA's Curiosity rover, which can use its laser spectrometer to analyze rocks that meet current science priorities without waiting for instructions from Earth. \"It all happens without any human in the loop,\" Wagstaff said. \"The rover itself decides, 'This looks like an interesting rock, I will sample that,'\" in time that it would otherwise spend twiddling its thumbs. \"We're getting this bonus science basically for free.\" Examples like that make a tempting lure for planetary scientists with more distant targets. But even if an algorithm doesn't fly on Clipper, there's plenty for scientists to look forward to, Davies said. \"Whatever happens, the data that we're going to get back from Europa Clipper is going to be of immeasurably higher quality than what was achievable from previous missions,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of things that previous instruments simply couldn't have detected.\" They may just need a little more patience.

Pappalardo continued: \"We're not a life-search mission. But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra - probably, possibly - that we're sensing life. That's a longshot, but it's not impossible.\" The Europa Clipper, which could launch as soon as 2023 but has a baseline commitment of a \"launch readiness date by 2025,\" will have a mass spectrometer on the craft, used to determine the mass of ions in an atom. The Clipper is expected to record, collect and observe many of these types of samples during its 3.5-year operational life, Space.com added. It will do several flybys and not circle the moon due to the intense radiation that surrounds it. A 2018 study expressed concerns that Europa's surface may be extremely porous, which could harm any probe that touches down on its surface. Pappalardo added the researchers want to delve further into any discovery the Clipper makes of water plumes that emanate from Europa's surface. \"Early in the mission, we'll be searching for plumes and trying to understand, Are they real? Are they there? Where are they? Are they sporadic or continuously active?\" It's unclear what the oceans on Europa are made up of, but the Hubble Space Telescope detected the presence of sodium chloride on its surface, according to a study published in June. The conditions on Europa have been previously likened to exoplanet Barnard B, a \"super-Earth\" 30 trillion miles from Earth. It likely has a surface temperature of roughly 238 degrees below zero and may have oceans underneath its icy surface, according to a July 2018 statement from NASA. The mission for the solar-powered Clipper is expected to cost around $4 billion, according to NASA.

According to Robert Pappalardo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the project scientist for the Europa Clipper Mission, the main objective of the mission is to determine the moon's capability of hosting and supporting life. Through the mission, the project scientist and his colleagues are hoping that Clipper will encounter evidence of organic life during its voyage. \"We're a habitability mission,\" Pappalardo said during the 70th International Astronautical Congress held recently in Washington, D.C., according to Space.com. \"We're trying to understand, Is Europa a habitable environment?\" \"We're not a life-search mission,\" Pappalardo continued. \"But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra probably, possibly that we're sensing life.

The team building the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), one of nine science instruments on board NASA's Europa Clipper mission to make multiple flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa, has passed its critical design review (CDR) and has begun construction of the flight instrument and other systems. PIMS, built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, will measure the plasmas, or electrically charged gasses, in Europa's ionosphere (the moon's upper atmosphere) and Jupiter's magnetosphere (created by the planet's magnetic field). These plasma measurements will contribute to other data used to determine the thickness of the ice shell that covers Europa, and the depth and makeup of the liquid-water ocean below that shell. PIMS will do this by taking advantage of the rapidly flowing plasma that connects Europa to Jupiter. This plasma, which moves at more than 220,000 miles per hour and rotates with Jupiter, constantly ebbs and flows over Europa, much like water in a stream over a rock. The plasma interacts with neutral and ionized gasses surrounding Europa and with ices on the surface of the moon, producing radiation damage, ionization and other effects that will modify the ice composition. \"We put PIMS through extremely thorough testing, and we're excited to begin construction of our flight instrument,\" said APL's Joseph Westlake, the instrument's principal investigator. \"In addition to vibration and shock testing, we simulated every environment that PIMS will experience from Earth to Europa, and it passed with flying colors.\" The instrument - which is shielded to protect it from the high radiation around Jupiter - has two identical sensors mounted on opposite sides of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The two sensors provide a large entrance to study the plasma. The plasma sensors are Faraday cups, which capture and measure the current from charged particles in the plasma. When combined with magnetic field data, information from PIMS will help reveal details about Europa's structure unable to be determined from Earth-based observations. PIMS is being built by Johns Hopkins APL; the University of Michigan is contributing critical electronic components. The PIMS science team includes researchers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Oregon and the University of Michigan. The Europa Clipper mission is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

But that hasn't killed the dream of sending something, anything, to that corner of the solar system. NASA had planned to launch the Europa Clipper mission in 2022 to circle Jupiter and pass Europa dozens of times. The idea was to swoop low and check for elements of life by analyzing particles of ice, water, and rock that may be spewing out from the moon's surface like the spray of a geyser. But the ambitious $2 billion mission has stumbled. Earlier this year, the launch date slipped from 2022 to 2023, and there's still no rocket to get it there. NASA's Space Launch System rocket is behind schedule and over budget, according to the Government Accountability Office, while a commercial rocket like the SpaceX Falcon Heavy would take twice as long to reach Europa from Earth as the SLS, which can make the trip in about three years. NASA is hoping to start building the Europa Clipper spacecraft later this year while both rocket systems continue testing. But a NASA Inspector General report released in May found that space agency officials underestimated both the time and money needed to get the Europa Clipper mission off the ground. Meanwhile, a follow-up mission to be launched two years after-called Europa Lander, which would put some kind of device on the crusty surface-has become less certain. The report concluded that, given the current pace of work, that mission could not even consider launching until 2030. Still, all is not lost for fans of Europa and the possibility of finding something amazing there (even if it's not an astronaut-munching creature as depicted in the 2013 sci-fi thriller \"Europa Report\"). Even with the recent budgetary and logistical problems, planetary scientists are pretty excited about building and testing devices to help them uncover life once a mission does reach the planet's orbit or even its surface. \"We are looking at what we will do when we get there,\" says Cynthia Phillips, a member of the Europa mission science team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"We have two sets of arrival dates. We are looking at what trajectories we can use and what kinds of observations we will make once we get there.\" Phillips says Europa is a special place. It's only about the size of our own moon, but its icy surface hides an ocean 60 miles deep that contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \"It is one of the best places to look for life in the solar system beyond Earth,\" she says. Because gravity is weaker on Europa than here, the pressure at the bottom of this super-deep ocean is about the same as the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Earth's deepest spot at about 36,000 feet. Europa might even be better than other icy moons, because its seas have a rocky bottom instead of being sandwiched between layers of ice, as on neighboring moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's Enceladus and Titan. That environment could be an ideal place to find hydrothermal vents that spew minerals into the ocean and, perhaps, creatures that evolved to harvest them. Marine scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who explore Earth's hydrothermal vents have been working with NASA to devise autonomous underwater vehicles that could work on both Earth and Europa. The agency just announced a $7.6 million, five-year collaboration with WHOI to have space and ocean researchers brainstorm the science and technology needed for future Europa missions. Even though a landing on Europa is more than a decade away, some engineers are already testing drills to burrow through the ice sheet to the life-giving ocean below. A Brooklyn-based space company called Honeybee Robotics is planning a plutonium-powered probe with a rotating drill head that would take three years to work its way through the ice. The team now has prototypes of the device, called SLUSH (Search for Life Using a Submersible Heated Drill), drilling through icy cryochambers in the firm's Pasadena lab. \"These technologies are just over the horizon,\" said Honeybee's Tighe Costa at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held last week in Seattle. Then there's the plutonium-powered TunnelBot, which can drill and sample subsurface life. That's being developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center. There's also ARCHIMEDES (A Really Cool High-Impact Method for Exploring Down into the Europan Subsurface), designed by Austin-based Stone Aerospace, which will use lasers to melt the ice. These devices have a host of engineering obstacles to surmount in the coming years. They have to carry their own power supply, take samples without damaging any potential life form with a radiation leak, and transmit data back to Europa's surface, and then back to scientists on Earth. So while NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and China race to put humans back on the lifeless moon or faraway Mars, a more exciting (albeit slow-motion) race is underway to reach a tiny moon that may be hiding a big secret.

Below its icy shell, Europa is thought to hold a 170km-deep body of water. This could have the right conditions for biology. Due to launch in 2025, the Europa Clipper mission has now passed a stage called Key Decision Point C, a crucial marker on the road to the launch pad. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. Europa Clipper will carry out an in-depth investigation of the watery world, including whether it can support life in its subsurface ocean. Gravitational interactions with Jupiter generate tidal forces and heat, which keeps Europa's ocean liquid. The heating may even drive volcanic vents on the seafloor; on Earth, such vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But it has taken decades to bring a dedicated mission this far, in part because of cost considerations and the challenges posed by the space environment around Jupiter. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into belts of intense radiation that surround the giant planet. This radiation fries spacecraft electronics, which limits the durations of prospective missions to months or even weeks. So rather than orbiting Europa, Clipper will make repeated close flybys of the moon, to reduce its exposure to the energetic particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. The spacecraft will carry nine science instruments, including cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of the moon's surface, a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of its magnetic field (providing clues to the ocean's depth and salinity) and an ice-penetrating radar to determine the thickness of the icy crust above the ocean. The ice shell could be tens of kilometres thick. Luckily, scientists think there are several ways for ocean water to get up to Europa's surface. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope has made tentative observations of plumes of water-ice erupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Saturn's ice moon Enceladus, which also has a subsurface ocean. The first concepts for missions to explore Europa were drawn up in the 1990s, around the time that data from the Galileo spacecraft helped build evidence for a subsurface ocean. Since then, however, one proposal after another has been thwarted, including an ambitious US-European mission along the lines of the Cassini-Huygens mission. But Clipper has had a key champion on Capitol Hill, in the form of Republican legislator John Culberson who, as chairman of the US House of Representatives appropriations committee that funds Nasa, channelled money to the mission. But last year, Culberson, who had become known for his advocacy on Europa exploration, was unseated in Texas' 7th congressional district by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. During the campaign, a pro-Democrat political action committee ran an ad saying: \"For Houston, Lizzie Fletcher will invest in humans, not aliens.\" A follow-up mission to go and land on Europa has also been proposed. But the most recent federal budget request included no funding for the lander.

Because of the severe radiation challenges of the Jovian system, Europa Clipper is one of the most ambitious flagship missions ever attempted by NASA, with seismic implications for the agency's search for life beyond Earth. Europa-with its deep, ancient ocean locked beneath an icy crust-is seen by some astrobiologists as the solar system's most promising site for harboring alien biology. In search of further signs of habitability, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter and encounter the moon multiple times. With each flyby, it will collect data on Europa's ice shell and subsurface ocean, remotely sounding the unseen fathoms below. According to Curt Niebur, the mission's program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Europa Clipper could answer the question of whether the right conditions exist on the icy moon to support life as we know it. If those ingredients-which include organic molecules, as well as potential energy sources such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor-are found on Europa, Niebur says, \"we're going to want to explore further and see if life actually has arisen under the ice.\" A second mission, now in development, would land on Europa to excavate and collect samples in search of native organisms. Beyond the science, the mission has an unusual political element: Europa Clipper is the first and only space mission to be married to a specific spacecraft in any appropriations bill, says former Republican representative John Culberson of Texas, a longtime Europa advocate who previously chaired the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. The current appropriations bill mandates Europa Clipper use the SLS and requires a \"launch no later than 2023\" on the rocket. It was a move that Culberson, an attorney and political consultant, used to ensure Europa Clipper would one day reach the launchpad. He says tying the mission to the SLS, which is being built in Alabama, garnered the support of Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, without which the mission might not have been mandated by law. (Attempts to reach Senator Shelby for this article were unsuccessful. A staffer reported that he was unavailable for comment.) While Europa Clipper's development has proceeded apace, however, the SLS rocket has remained mired in setbacks and was arrogated by the Artemis lunar program instigated by the Trump administration. Before it could carry the Europa craft to space, the SLS would fly two Artemis moon missions-the first of which has reportedly been pushed back from 2020 to 2021, according to Senate testimony by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this year. For Europa Clipper to launch on time, the second Artemis launch, now scheduled for 2023, would have to occur without error, with a third SLS rocket ready to go-a tall order, considering the program's lengthy development, three-year delay and zero rockets completed thus far. A report issued this past May by NASA's Office of Inspector General supports that the SLS \"is unlikely to be available\" for Europa Clipper in 2023. And it adds that NASA \"continues to maintain spacecraft capabilities to accommodate both the SLS and two commercial launch vehicles.\" Moreover, even NASA's own 2019 budget encourages \"a Europa Clipper launch readiness date in 2025\" and further proposes \"to launch the Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle\" to save money. Each SLS launch is estimated to run more than $1 billion. In its Europa Clipper Key Decision Point-C memorandum, the formal commitment signed at NASA Headquarters earlier this month, the spacecraft is scheduled for a launch that ranges from 2023 to 2025, confirms Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate. But if the mission were to launch in 2025-or on something other than the SLS-it would be in violation of current law, which means the law must change or a working SLS must suddenly appear in order for Europa Clipper to take off in accordance with federal statute. \"We've been working very hard to follow the appropriation law,\" says Joan Salute, program executive of Europa Clipper. But she admits the mission \"may or may not\" be possible with the SLS in 2023. And if it's not, she says, \"we can't follow that appropriations law.\" Both Salute and Zurbuchen say forthcoming appropriations bills may need to be updated. \"Congress will follow the development of the SLS, and that language should be updated as we know more about the SLS's availability to us, or not, in 2023,\" Salute says. And NASA will talk to Congress in order to \"make sure the right solution happens for the American taxpayer,\" Zurbuchen adds. Zurbuchen points out that the appropriations bill's language had been changed previously to accommodate Europa Clipper. Indeed, the 2017 appropriations bill called for a 2022 orbit and 2024 landing. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its research-and-development center, says, \"When Congress returns in September, we will continue to work to pass an appropriations package across the House and Senate that preserves our strong support for Europa Clipper's goals and timeline. We will also continue to monitor the mission's progress as part of that process, including the potential launch vehicle.\" Another vehicle that could take Europa Clipper to Jupiter's moon is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy-though it would do so with an asterisk attached. Falcon Heavy has already achieved three successful launches, but using the SpaceX rocket-which is less powerful than the SLS-would add at least three years of travel time to the planned two-year mission. And while using SpaceX's rocket would save hundreds of millions of dollars on launch costs, it could add to Europa Clipper's operations budget because of its longer cruise time to Jupiter. \"It's vital that the Europa Clipper be launched on the SLS,\" Culberson says. The SLS has an undeniable advantage over Falcon Heavy: it enables a direct flight from Earth to Jupiter. Falcon Heavy will require gravity assists from other planets, and unless it uses an add-on \"kicker stage\"-an additional upper stage for extra loft-one of those gravity assists will require an encounter with Venus. According to Salute, a Venus flyby introduces \"a riskier environment, radiation and temperature. And so we would like to avoid flying closer to Venus with this direct trajectory that SLS affords us. Right now, SLS is the only launch vehicle that can give us that trajectory, and that's why it's so advantageous to us.\" The idea that Europa Clipper might not run on the SLS is almost unthinkable to Culberson, who says he remains optimistic the mission will fly on the SLS in 2023. \"Heaven forbid SLS is not ready in time,\" he says. \"But in the event that it's not, the most important thing for the mission is to ensure [it arrives] safely. The rocket, whatever it is, has to be reliable and has to be powerful enough to get the Clipper to Europa in a timely fashion.\" ", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-has-committed-to-a-rocket-for-the-europa-mission-and-it-wont-be-ready-on-time/"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moon for signs of life", "date": "2019-08-20", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission is entering its final design stage before construction and testing of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments it will carry to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Europa has been a high priority for scientists because, as an ice-covered moon with a subsurface salty liquid ocean, it has been identified as one of the ideal spots for hosting life in our solar system. In 2017, NASA announced new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The icy ocean worlds contain intriguing chemistry and water plume activity. The Europa Clipper mission is also the first to explore an alien ocean. \"If there are plumes on Europa, as we now strongly suspect, with the Europa Clipper we will be ready for them,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. The Europa Clipper, named for the streamlined sailing ships of the 1800s, could launch as early as 2023, but a targeted launch has been set for 2025. It is expected to reach Europa after a journey lasting several years. Europa Clipper will carry cameras and spectrometers to capture images and determine the composition of the moon. Ice-penetrating radar will measure the thickness of the ice shell covering the ocean and help search for the subsurface lakes believed to be there, much like those in Antarctica on Earth. A magnetometer can determine the strength and direction of the moon's magnetic field to understand how deep the ocean goes and its salinity. To investigate the possible plumes, a thermal instrument will search for eruptions or water particles in the atmosphere. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" Zurbuchen said. Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission observed long lines and dark spots instead of a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet. During its closest flyby of Europa in 1997, less than 93 miles above the surface, Galileo collected signatures of changes in Europa's magnetic field that the scientists didn't understand, said Margaret Kivelson, professor emerita of space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Last year, Kivelson and her colleagues took a closer look at that data. They realized that during the flyby, Galileo flew through a plume. This fortuitous happenstance is the best evidence of plumes to date, the study said. The necessary ingredients for life as we know it include liquid water, energy sources and chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. But we've also learned that life finds a way to exist in the harshest of Earth's environments, like vents in the deepest parts of the ocean floor. There, microbes don't receive energy from sunlight but use methanogenesis, a process that reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, to form methane. Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus show some of these key ingredients for life in their oceans, which is why researchers believe they are the best chance for finding life beyond Earth in our own solar system. While Galileo didn't know it was flying through a plume and was incapable of collecting material from it, Europa Clipper will be able to gather samples from plumes if it can fly through them. This would allow scientists a first look at the material inside Europa's ocean that's spewing through the icy crust and could reveal whether Europa's ocean is habitable. Europa Clipper's instruments will be capable of \"sniffing\" the atmosphere of Europa, with more than 40 planned flybys. The flybys will be less than 228 miles above the surface of the moon, within the observed range of the plumes, which can reach 124 to 228 miles above the surface. \"If plumes exist and we can directly sample what's coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist. \"That's what the mission is after. That's the big picture.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/world/europa-clipper-mission-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Clears Big Hurdle on Path to Launch", "date": "2019-08-21", "content": "A highly anticipated NASA mission to Jupiter's possibly life-supporting moon Europa remains on track for a mid-2020s launch.

This water is in contact with the moon's rocky core, scientists believe, making possible a range of interesting chemical reactions. Astrobiologists therefore consider Europa one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life. Europa Clipper won't search for signs of life, but the probe will attempt to gauge the moon's habitability. The Jupiter-orbiting spacecraft will characterize the moon's ocean during dozens of flybys and collect a variety of other data as well - including scouting out good touchdown locations for a potential life-hunting lander mission.

NASA announced Aug. 19 that it had formally confirmed the Europa Clipper mission to proceed into its next phase of development, known as Phase C. That will cover final design of the spacecraft, followed by assembly and testing. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said in a statement announcing the milestone. Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, one of the planet's largest moons. Europa has an icy surface, below which most scientists believe is a deep ocean of liquid water. Combined with the interior heat source that keeps the ocean from freezing, and the presence of organic compounds, Europa has the basic requirements to support life. While the programmatic milestone Europa Clipper achieved, known in NASA parlance as Key Decision Point C, is the point where NASA sets the schedule and budget for the mission, exactly when Europa Clipper will launch is not yet clear. In the statement announcing the mission's confirmation, NASA noted that current plans have the spacecraft ready for launch as soon as 2023. However, the mission has a formal launch readiness date of 2025. That uncertainty is linked to how the mission will be launched. The mission's preferred launch option is the Space Launch System, which will allow the spacecraft to travel directly to Jupiter without the need of gravity assists, arriving within three years of launch. Language in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 and prior years also directed NASA to use the SLS. However, in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NASA proposed using a commercial launch vehicle, such as a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy, to launch Europa Clipper, saying that doing so would save several hundred million dollars even though the transit time to Jupiter would be about seven years. A report by NASA's Office of Inspector General in May downplayed the cost savings by using an alternative launch vehicle, but noted it is not possible to launch Europa Clipper on an SLS in 2023 since there won't be an available SLS for that mission then. The announcement didn't include a cost estimate for the mission, but agency spokesperson Alana Johnson said Aug. 21 that the agency baseline commitment for the mission is $4.25 billion, covering all costs for the entire mission. The NASA Office of Inspector General report cited an assessment last October by the mission's standing review board that estimated the mission's cost at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Despite the uncertainty about launch vehicle and schedule, other aspects of the mission are going well. \"Things are looking reasonably good,\" Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for Europa Clipper at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at an Aug. 21 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier in the year, NASA decided to replace a planned magnetometer instrument on the spacecraft that had suffered extensive cost overruns with a less complex \"facility\" magnetometer. That had raised concerns about whether the new magnetometer would have the precision needed to achieve science goals such as measuring the depth of Europa's subsurface ocean. Pappalardo and others at the OPAG meeting said that changes to the instrument's operation, notable periodic rolls of the spacecraft to calibrate it, should recover sufficient precision to achieve those science goals.

The US space agency says that it targets to have the spacecraft ready for launch by 2023. NASA has confirmed the next phase of development of the Europa Clipper mission - an interplanetary mission to Jupiter's smallest moon Europa. The US space agency has cleared the mission to progress through its final design phase, followed by the construction and testing of the entire spacecraft. The latest development comes over 2 years after NASA originally announced its plans for the Galilean moon. To recall, NASA had announced the Europa Clipper mission back in March 2017. The mission will be conducting an in-depth exploration of Jupiter's moon Europa and investigate whether the icy moon can have suitable conditions for sustaining life and increase our insights in to astrobiology. NASA targets to have the Europa Clipper spacecraft ready for launch early by 2023. The space agency had earlier committed a launch date by 2025. The space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California leads the development of the Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for the Science Mission Directorate. The mission is managed by the Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington recently said in a statement. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" he said.

This apart, NASA had recently shared new pictures of Jupiter, which were taken by the Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 when the planet was 400 million miles from Earth on June 27, 2019. Earlier this month, Jupiter was possibly hit by an asteroid and the impact was captured by astronomer Ethan Chappel, who captured the event using his Celestron 8 telescope before it faded away.

The United States Congress has mandated that the Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2023, ride atop NASA's huge Space Launch System megarocket. \"However, because of developmental delays and, more significantly, NASA's plans to use the first three SLS rockets produced for its Artemis lunar program, an SLS will not be available until 2025 at the earliest,\" NASA Inspector General Paul Martin wrote in a letter to select lawmakers Tuesday. \"Consequently, if completed on its projected schedule, the approximately $3 billion dollar Europa spacecraft will need to be stored for at least 2 years at a cost of $3 to $5 million per month until an SLS becomes available,\" Martin added. \"Given all of the foregoing factors, we urge Congress to consider removing the requirement that NASA launch the Europa Clipper on an SLS and allow the Agency to decide whether to use an SLS or a commercial vehicle based on cost, schedule, vehicle availability and impact on science requirements,\" he concluded in the letter, stressing that the OIG believes this issue \"requires immediate action by Congress.\" Commercial vehicles will be available for Clipper; Martin mentioned SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket and United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, both of which are already flying. Europa Clipper is designed to characterize the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath the moon's icy shell, assess Europa's ability to host life as we know it, scout out touchdown sites for a potential life- hunting lander mission and perform a number of other tasks. The probe will do this work during dozens of flybys of Europa, which it will make after reaching Jupiter orbit. The SLS would allow Clipper to get to the gas giant much faster. The big NASA rocket will be powerful enough to launch the spacecraft directly to Jupiter, making the trip in a mere 2.4 years. The commercial alternatives would require a roundabout trajectory that takes advantage of planetary \"gravity assists,\" resulting in a transit time of nearly 6 years, Martin wrote. Still, NASA should be allowed to consider those alternatives, he stressed. The first three SLS rockets are already booked to aid NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land two astronauts near the lunar south pole by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by 2028. Congress also directed NASA to launch the Europa lander aboard an SLS. Unlike Clipper, however, this mission is just a concept at the moment; it's not officially on the space agency's docket. Tuesday's letter was a follow-up to a report into the Europa Clipper and Europa lander missions that the OIG released in May. That report determined that both projects face a variety of serious challenges on the way to the launchpad. \"Our audit found that, despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, an OIG management analyst, said in a video released with the May report.

The Europa Clipper mission, in development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has just been approved for its final design and construction phase. It's on track for a 2025 launch. \"Clipper\" is the culmination of decades of dreaming and years of conceptual and preliminary design. It is only the second mission NASA has dedicated to exploring a moon in the solar system-our own moon was the first. The target, Jupiter's icy Europa, is very different from Earth's moon. Believed to possess a heated rocky core and mantle surrounded by an ice-topped ocean of liquid water up to 100 miles deep, Europa is arguably the best place in our solar system to look for life beyond Earth. Why Are We Interested in this Icy Jovian Moon? Astrobiologists' mouths water at the prospect of an ocean of liquid water -- particularly a salty one -- in contact with a rocky ocean floor. They theorize that heat from within Europa's rocky interior, generated by tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity, powers eruptions of hot, mineral-laden water on Europa's ocean floor. Such \"hydrothermal vents\" could supply all the ingredients necessary to sustain some form of life. Hydrothermal vents dot Earth's own oceans in volcanically active areas. Since their discovery, researchers have found communities of life forms that thrive around hydrothermal vents, subsisting entirely on thermal and chemical energy emerging from Earth's interior. How life arrived at these deep ocean oases is still open to scientific debate. One theory poses the idea that life on Earth could have gotten its start at hydrothermal vents and migrated later to the surface. The Challenge of Exploring a Concealed Ocean Half a Billion Miles Away. You might wonder, if there's a saltwater ocean on Europa, and the strong possibility of a life-friendly environment, why don't we already have robot submarines in the water sending us images of beautiful bioluminescent jellyfish, or something? Easier said than done. Even landing a robot on Europa's unexplored surface would be a great engineering challenge. Designing a mission capable of boring through miles of ice and descending through a hundred miles of water to reach the ocean floor, and still able to communicate with us back on Earth, is presently an adventure of science fiction. Although earlier mission concepts flirted with dropping robots onto Europa's surface, the Clipper mission won't do that. It won't even orbit Europa. That moon resides within bands of intense radiation that surround Jupiter, an environment where even a radiation-hardened spacecraft might survive only a few weeks. Such a short visit wouldn't allow much time to explore, let alone transmit the huge volumes of collected scientific data back to Earth before a fatal failure brought an end to the mission. Instead, Clipper will follow a looping trajectory around Jupiter that will send it careening past Europa on 45 close flybys. Some will pass as close as 16 miles near the surface. Between flybys the spacecraft will retreat to the far end of its elongated orbit, away from Jupiter and into safer climates beyond the deadly radiation zone. The longer mission time and extended orbits will ultimately let Clipper collect and send home up to three times as much data as a Europa-orbiting spacecraft could. Europa Clipper Will See Under Europa's Skin. Europa Clipper will carry nine scientific instruments designed to offer a detailed look at the moon, particularly the vast ocean lurking beneath its icy crust. Apart from the usual cameras and spectrometers that will take high-resolution pictures and analyze the composition of Europa's surface, Clipper will carry instruments to investigate what lies below that surface. An ice-penetrating radar will probe the frozen crust to determine its thickness and map its structure. Scientists will look for any subsurface lakes in chambers closer to the surface, which may be sources of water plumes detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. A magnetometer will measure the disturbance of Jupiter's magnetic field by Europa's salty ocean, divining its salinity and depth. Two different instruments will analyze particles \"sniffed\" during very close flybys. The composition of particles and gases in Europa's tenuous atmosphere and possibly plumes of water and chemicals erupting from its surface could help explain what Europa's ocean is made of, if those plumes originate from the ocean's waters. How Long Have We Known About Europa's Ocean? We caught our first scent of Europa's ocean in 1979 when the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew through the Jupiter system. The spacecraft captured images of Europa's fractured surface. Its patterns of cracks and fissures were best explained by a thin icy crust floating on a body of liquid. Starting in 1995 the Galileo spacecraft made 11 close flybys of Europa, capturing images of much higher detail and measuring Europa's effects on Jupiter's magnetic field. The images further confirmed the presence of the hidden ocean, and Europa's magnetic disturbances suggested that ocean is salty. In the past few years, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have tentatively detected what may be plumes of water vapor emanating from Europa's southern polar region, further whetting scientists' appetites to explore the exo-ocean. We'll have to wait a few more years before getting our next taste of Europa's ocean waters, but at least we know that Europa Clipper is on the way.

The farther from home a probe ventures, the longer its dispatches take to reach eager humans on Earth and the terser such reports must be. That's why computer scientists and planetary scientists are teaming up to develop an algorithm that could potentially identify the most intriguing data an icy moon explorer mission collects, sending those tidbits to receivers first. \"We're in this golden age of space exploration, and we have hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of data flooding back from across the solar system,\" Ashley Davies, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Space.com. \"It's not possible to return all the data that you ever collect.\" Hence the interest in an algorithm to negotiate what to report first. A team based at JPL is developing a potential system to do just that for individual instruments on NASA's Europa Clipper mission. That spacecraft is due to launch in the mid-2020s to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The moon is one of the most intriguing worlds in our solar system for scientists interested in understanding whether life exists beyond Earth. An ocean hidden below Europa's icy shell could potentially host microbial life similar to that found near deep-sea vents on Earth, and Clipper could collect information that would give scientists a more detailed understanding of the moon. Europa Clipper will carry nine different science instruments, and the algorithm team is already working with the teams behind three of them, with more partnerships under discussion. The instruments will look for features like warm patches in the icy shell and plumes of seawater bursting out into space. The idea behind the algorithm project is that it should be possible to train the spacecraft to spot the most promising data it gathers, then bump that to the front of the communications queue. It wouldn't change what Europa Clipper does next, but it could mean scientists wouldn't need to be quite as patient. There's just one problem: space-ready machines are ... not the typical hardware computer scientists use. The system on board Europa Clipper will be able to run at speeds of up to 200 megahertz. \"For comparison, that's about the equivalent of an early '90s desktop PC, if you took that and put that into orbit,\" Kiri Wagstaff, a computer scientist at JPL who is leading the project, told Space.com. \"We don't really encounter machines that limited today in our day-to-day life.\" The stunted processing capacity means any space-bound algorithm has to be lean, and extremely so. It's one of the two key challenges Wagstaff and her colleagues are facing in developing a system for Europa Clipper: The researchers have to come up with ways of flagging key data for the limited processor to execute in ways that are simple and quick. \"We get questions about, well, 'Are you using deep learning to help these spacecraft make these decisions?'\" Wagstaff said. \"And the answer is emphatically no, it's simply not possible.\" The team's other main challenge is that, after all, Europa Clipper itself doesn't exist yet and hasn't produced any data yet. Wagstaff and her colleagues are basing their current work on data gathered by other spacecraft and on simulations of what Clipper's data could look like, but it's not the same. Right now, the algorithm isn't a formal part of Europa Clipper, and there's no guarantee it will be used during the mission. First, it needs to pass a series of tests designed to make sure the algorithm is trim enough to work in flight. \"That's kind of a go, no-go point,\" Wagstaff said. \"If it can't fit into the available resources, you can't use it.\" Wagstaff and her colleagues are also checking whether the algorithm can withstand the harsh radiation environment around this frigid moon. The computer on the spacecraft will be sheathed to protect it from radiation, but some particles will still sneak through. Scientists need to know whether such hits can derail a calculation. But if the team can get the algorithm right, it could make Europa Clipper a more powerful mission, encouraging scientists to gather too much data to send home in the allotted time, with the assurance that they'll see the most intriguing of it. That's the first step in using such algorithms to actively shape outer solar system missions. The process has already begun at Mars on NASA's Curiosity rover, which can use its laser spectrometer to analyze rocks that meet current science priorities without waiting for instructions from Earth. \"It all happens without any human in the loop,\" Wagstaff said. \"The rover itself decides, 'This looks like an interesting rock, I will sample that,'\" in time that it would otherwise spend twiddling its thumbs. \"We're getting this bonus science basically for free.\" Examples like that make a tempting lure for planetary scientists with more distant targets. But even if an algorithm doesn't fly on Clipper, there's plenty for scientists to look forward to, Davies said. \"Whatever happens, the data that we're going to get back from Europa Clipper is going to be of immeasurably higher quality than what was achievable from previous missions,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of things that previous instruments simply couldn't have detected.\" They may just need a little more patience.

Pappalardo continued: \"We're not a life-search mission. But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra - probably, possibly - that we're sensing life. That's a longshot, but it's not impossible.\" The Europa Clipper, which could launch as soon as 2023 but has a baseline commitment of a \"launch readiness date by 2025,\" will have a mass spectrometer on the craft, used to determine the mass of ions in an atom. The Clipper is expected to record, collect and observe many of these types of samples during its 3.5-year operational life, Space.com added. It will do several flybys and not circle the moon due to the intense radiation that surrounds it. A 2018 study expressed concerns that Europa's surface may be extremely porous, which could harm any probe that touches down on its surface. Pappalardo added the researchers want to delve further into any discovery the Clipper makes of water plumes that emanate from Europa's surface. \"Early in the mission, we'll be searching for plumes and trying to understand, Are they real? Are they there? Where are they? Are they sporadic or continuously active?\" It's unclear what the oceans on Europa are made up of, but the Hubble Space Telescope detected the presence of sodium chloride on its surface, according to a study published in June. The conditions on Europa have been previously likened to exoplanet Barnard B, a \"super-Earth\" 30 trillion miles from Earth. It likely has a surface temperature of roughly 238 degrees below zero and may have oceans underneath its icy surface, according to a July 2018 statement from NASA. The mission for the solar-powered Clipper is expected to cost around $4 billion, according to NASA.

The space agency's scientists are looking to accomplish this through a special experiment that the mission will carry out on Europa. NASA's upcoming mission to Jupiter's icy moon will be conducted using the Clipper spacecraft, which is expected to launch sometime in 2025. According to Robert Pappalardo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the project scientist for the Europa Clipper Mission, the main objective of the mission is to determine the moon's capability of hosting and supporting life. Through the mission, the project scientist and his colleagues are hoping that Clipper will encounter evidence of organic life during its voyage. \"We're a habitability mission,\" Pappalardo said during the 70th International Astronautical Congress held recently in Washington, D.C., according to Space.com. \"We're trying to understand, Is Europa a habitable environment?\" \"We're not a life-search mission,\" Pappalardo continued. \"But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra probably, possibly that we're sensing life. That's a longshot, but it's not impossible.\" As mentioned by the project scientist, the mass spectrometer is one of the nine scientific instruments that Clipper will carry for its Europa mission. This instrument is designed to measure the masses of ions in the samples that will be collected by the spacecraft. Pappalardo and his team are hoping that these samples would contain traces of extraterrestrial life. Unlike NASA's other planetary missions, Clipper will not land on Europa. Instead, the spacecraft will only carry out flybys on the icy moon by following Jupiter's orbit. From these flybys, the spacecraft will collect samples from the moon's atmosphere. According to Pappalardo, this experiment will determine if Europa emits water vapor plumes from its surface and into its atmosphere. \"Early in the mission, we'll be searching for plumes and trying to understand, are they real?\" he explained. \"Are they there? Where are they? Are they sporadic or continuously active? And maybe we'll fortuitously go through a plume, or maybe we'll be able to adjust the orbit slightly in order to go through a plume,\" he added.

The Europa Clipper mission will target the ice-encrusted moon of Jupiter, which is considered a prime target in the search for life beyond Earth. Below its icy shell, Europa is thought to hold a 170km-deep body of water. This could have the right conditions for biology. Due to launch in 2025, the Europa Clipper mission has now passed a stage called Key Decision Point C, a crucial marker on the road to the launch pad. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate. Europa Clipper will carry out an in-depth investigation of the watery world, including whether it can support life in its subsurface ocean. Gravitational interactions with Jupiter generate tidal forces and heat, which keeps Europa's ocean liquid. The heating may even drive volcanic vents on the seafloor; on Earth, such vent systems support a wide array of life forms. But it has taken decades to bring a dedicated mission this far, in part because of cost considerations and the challenges posed by the space environment around Jupiter. Europa's orbital path takes it deep into belts of intense radiation that surround the giant planet. This radiation fries spacecraft electronics, which limits the durations of prospective missions to months or even weeks. So rather than orbiting Europa, Clipper will make repeated close flybys of the moon, to reduce its exposure to the energetic particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. The spacecraft will carry nine science instruments, including cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images of the moon's surface, a magnetometer to measure the strength and direction of its magnetic field (providing clues to the ocean's depth and salinity) and an ice-penetrating radar to determine the thickness of the icy crust above the ocean. The ice shell could be tens of kilometres thick. Luckily, scientists think there are several ways for ocean water to get up to Europa's surface. In recent years, the Hubble Space Telescope has made tentative observations of plumes of water-ice erupting from beneath Europa, much as they do on Saturn's ice moon Enceladus, which also has a subsurface ocean. The first concepts for missions to explore Europa were drawn up in the 1990s, around the time that data from the Galileo spacecraft helped build evidence for a subsurface ocean. Since then, however, one proposal after another has been thwarted, including an ambitious US-European mission along the lines of the Cassini-Huygens mission. But Clipper has had a key champion on Capitol Hill, in the form of Republican legislator John Culberson who, as chairman of the US House of Representatives appropriations committee that funds Nasa, channelled money to the mission. But last year, Culberson, who had become known for his advocacy on Europa exploration, was unseated in Texas' 7th congressional district by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. During the campaign, a pro-Democrat political action committee ran an ad saying: \"For Houston, Lizzie Fletcher will invest in humans, not aliens.\" A follow-up mission to go and land on Europa has also been proposed. But the most recent federal budget request included no funding for the lander.

Because of the severe radiation challenges of the Jovian system, Europa Clipper is one of the most ambitious flagship missions ever attempted by NASA, with seismic implications for the agency's search for life beyond Earth. Europa-with its deep, ancient ocean locked beneath an icy crust-is seen by some astrobiologists as the solar system's most promising site for harboring alien biology. In search of further signs of habitability, the Europa Clipper spacecraft will enter orbit around Jupiter and encounter the moon multiple times. With each flyby, it will collect data on Europa's ice shell and subsurface ocean, remotely sounding the unseen fathoms below. According to Curt Niebur, the mission's program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Europa Clipper could answer the question of whether the right conditions exist on the icy moon to support life as we know it. If those ingredients-which include organic molecules, as well as potential energy sources such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor-are found on Europa, Niebur says, \"we're going to want to explore further and see if life actually has arisen under the ice.\" A second mission, now in development, would land on Europa to excavate and collect samples in search of native organisms. Beyond the science, the mission has an unusual political element: Europa Clipper is the first and only space mission to be married to a specific spacecraft in any appropriations bill, says former Republican representative John Culberson of Texas, a longtime Europa advocate who previously chaired the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations. The current appropriations bill mandates Europa Clipper use the SLS and requires a \"launch no later than 2023\" on the rocket. It was a move that Culberson, an attorney and political consultant, used to ensure Europa Clipper would one day reach the launchpad. He says tying the mission to the SLS, which is being built in Alabama, garnered the support of Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, without which the mission might not have been mandated by law. (Attempts to reach Senator Shelby for this article were unsuccessful. A staffer reported that he was unavailable for comment.) While Europa Clipper's development has proceeded apace, however, the SLS rocket has remained mired in setbacks and was arrogated by the Artemis lunar program instigated by the Trump administration. Before it could carry the Europa craft to space, the SLS would fly two Artemis moon missions-the first of which has reportedly been pushed back from 2020 to 2021, according to Senate testimony by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this year. For Europa Clipper to launch on time, the second Artemis launch, now scheduled for 2023, would have to occur without error, with a third SLS rocket ready to go-a tall order, considering the program's lengthy development, three-year delay and zero rockets completed thus far. A report issued this past May by NASA's Office of Inspector General supports that the SLS \"is unlikely to be available\" for Europa Clipper in 2023. And it adds that NASA \"continues to maintain spacecraft capabilities to accommodate both the SLS and two commercial launch vehicles.\" Moreover, even NASA's own 2019 budget encourages \"a Europa Clipper launch readiness date in 2025\" and further proposes \"to launch the Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle\" to save money. Each SLS launch is estimated to run more than $1 billion. In its Europa Clipper Key Decision Point-C memorandum, the formal commitment signed at NASA Headquarters earlier this month, the spacecraft is scheduled for a launch that ranges from 2023 to 2025, confirms Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate. But if the mission were to launch in 2025-or on something other than the SLS-it would be in violation of current law, which means the law must change or a working SLS must suddenly appear in order for Europa Clipper to take off in accordance with federal statute. \"We've been working very hard to follow the appropriation law,\" says Joan Salute, program executive of Europa Clipper. But she admits the mission \"may or may not\" be possible with the SLS in 2023. And if it's not, she says, \"we can't follow that appropriations law.\" Both Salute and Zurbuchen say forthcoming appropriations bills may need to be updated. \"Congress will follow the development of the SLS, and that language should be updated as we know more about the SLS's availability to us, or not, in 2023,\" Salute says. And NASA will talk to Congress in order to \"make sure the right solution happens for the American taxpayer,\" Zurbuchen adds. Zurbuchen points out that the appropriations bill's language had been changed previously to accommodate Europa Clipper. Indeed, the 2017 appropriations bill called for a 2022 orbit and 2024 landing. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California, whose district includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its research-and-development center, says, \"When Congress returns in September, we will continue to work to pass an appropriations package across the House and Senate that preserves our strong support for Europa Clipper's goals and timeline. We will also continue to monitor the mission's progress as part of that process, including the potential launch vehicle.\" Another vehicle that could take Europa Clipper to Jupiter's moon is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy-though it would do so with an asterisk attached. Falcon Heavy has already achieved three successful launches, but using the SpaceX rocket-which is less powerful than the SLS-would add at least three years of travel time to the planned two-year mission. And while using SpaceX's rocket would save hundreds of millions of dollars on launch costs, it could add to Europa Clipper's operations budget because of its longer cruise time to Jupiter. \"It's vital that the Europa Clipper be launched on the SLS,\" Culberson says. The SLS has an undeniable advantage over Falcon Heavy: it enables a direct flight from Earth to Jupiter. Falcon Heavy will require gravity assists from other planets, and unless it uses an add-on \"kicker stage\"-an additional upper stage for extra loft-one of those gravity assists will require an encounter with Venus. According to Salute, a Venus flyby introduces \"a riskier environment, radiation and temperature. And so we would like to avoid flying closer to Venus with this direct trajectory that SLS affords us. Right now, SLS is the only launch vehicle that can give us that trajectory, and that's why it's so advantageous to us.\" The idea that Europa Clipper might not run on the SLS is almost unthinkable to Culberson, who says he remains optimistic the mission will fly on the SLS in 2023. \"Heaven forbid SLS is not ready in time,\" he says. \"But in the event that it's not, the most important thing for the mission is to ensure [it arrives] safely. The rocket, whatever it is, has to be reliable and has to be powerful enough to get the Clipper to Europa in a timely fashion.\" ", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-has-committed-to-a-rocket-for-the-europa-mission-and-it-wont-be-ready-on-time/"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moon for signs of life", "date": "2019-08-20", "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper mission is entering its final design stage before construction and testing of the spacecraft and the scientific instruments it will carry to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. \"We are all excited about the decision that moves the Europa Clipper mission one key step closer to unlocking the mysteries of this ocean world,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Europa has been a high priority for scientists because, as an ice-covered moon with a subsurface salty liquid ocean, it has been identified as one of the ideal spots for hosting life in our solar system. In 2017, NASA announced new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. The icy ocean worlds contain intriguing chemistry and water plume activity. The Europa Clipper mission is also the first to explore an alien ocean. \"If there are plumes on Europa, as we now strongly suspect, with the Europa Clipper we will be ready for them,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. The Europa Clipper, named for the streamlined sailing ships of the 1800s, could launch as early as 2023, but a targeted launch has been set for 2025. It is expected to reach Europa after a journey lasting several years. Europa Clipper will carry cameras and spectrometers to capture images and determine the composition of the moon. Ice-penetrating radar will measure the thickness of the ice shell covering the ocean and help search for the subsurface lakes believed to be there, much like those in Antarctica on Earth. A magnetometer can determine the strength and direction of the moon's magnetic field to understand how deep the ocean goes and its salinity. To investigate the possible plumes, a thermal instrument will search for eruptions or water particles in the atmosphere. \"We are building upon the scientific insights received from the flagship Galileo and Cassini spacecraft and working to advance our understanding of our cosmic origin, and even life elsewhere,\" Zurbuchen said. Research suggesting the possibility of an ocean on Europa was published as early as 1977, after the Voyager mission observed long lines and dark spots instead of a cratered surface similar to other moons. Then the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa in 1996 and revealed for the first time that there was an ocean on another planet. During its closest flyby of Europa in 1997, less than 93 miles above the surface, Galileo collected signatures of changes in Europa's magnetic field that the scientists didn't understand, said Margaret Kivelson, professor emerita of space physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Last year, Kivelson and her colleagues took a closer look at that data. They realized that during the flyby, Galileo flew through a plume. This fortuitous happenstance is the best evidence of plumes to date, the study said. The necessary ingredients for life as we know it include liquid water, energy sources and chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. But we've also learned that life finds a way to exist in the harshest of Earth's environments, like vents in the deepest parts of the ocean floor. There, microbes don't receive energy from sunlight but use methanogenesis, a process that reduces carbon dioxide with hydrogen, to form methane. Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus show some of these key ingredients for life in their oceans, which is why researchers believe they are the best chance for finding life beyond Earth in our own solar system. While Galileo didn't know it was flying through a plume and was incapable of collecting material from it, Europa Clipper will be able to gather samples from plumes if it can fly through them. This would allow scientists a first look at the material inside Europa's ocean that's spewing through the icy crust and could reveal whether Europa's ocean is habitable. Europa Clipper's instruments will be capable of \"sniffing\" the atmosphere of Europa, with more than 40 planned flybys. The flybys will be less than 228 miles above the surface of the moon, within the observed range of the plumes, which can reach 124 to 228 miles above the surface. \"If plumes exist and we can directly sample what's coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist. \"That's what the mission is after. That's the big picture.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/world/europa-clipper-mission-scn/index.html"}, {"title": "NASA's Europa Clipper Mission to Jupiter's Icy Moon Clears Big Hurdle on Path to Launch", "date": "2019-08-21", "content": "A highly anticipated NASA mission to Jupiter's possibly life-supporting moon Europa remains on track for a mid-2020s launch.

Europa Clipper will enter orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, one of the planet's largest moons. Europa has an icy surface, below which most scientists believe is a deep ocean of liquid water. Combined with the interior heat source that keeps the ocean from freezing, and the presence of organic compounds, Europa has the basic requirements to support life. While the programmatic milestone Europa Clipper achieved, known in NASA parlance as Key Decision Point C, is the point where NASA sets the schedule and budget for the mission, exactly when Europa Clipper will launch is not yet clear. In the statement announcing the mission's confirmation, NASA noted that current plans have the spacecraft ready for launch as soon as 2023. However, the mission has a formal launch readiness date of 2025. That uncertainty is linked to how the mission will be launched. The mission's preferred launch option is the Space Launch System, which will allow the spacecraft to travel directly to Jupiter without the need of gravity assists, arriving within three years of launch. Language in appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 and prior years also directed NASA to use the SLS. However, in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NASA proposed using a commercial launch vehicle, such as a Delta 4 Heavy or Falcon Heavy, to launch Europa Clipper, saying that doing so would save several hundred million dollars even though the transit time to Jupiter would be about seven years. A report by NASA's Office of Inspector General in May downplayed the cost savings by using an alternative launch vehicle, but noted it is not possible to launch Europa Clipper on an SLS in 2023 since there won't be an available SLS for that mission then. The announcement didn't include a cost estimate for the mission, but agency spokesperson Alana Johnson said Aug. 21 that the agency baseline commitment for the mission is $4.25 billion, covering all costs for the entire mission. The NASA Office of Inspector General report cited an assessment last October by the mission's standing review board that estimated the mission's cost at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Despite the uncertainty about launch vehicle and schedule, other aspects of the mission are going well. \"Things are looking reasonably good,\" Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for Europa Clipper at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at an Aug. 21 meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in Boulder, Colorado. Earlier in the year, NASA decided to replace a planned magnetometer instrument on the spacecraft that had suffered extensive cost overruns with a less complex \"facility\" magnetometer. That had raised concerns about whether the new magnetometer would have the precision needed to achieve science goals such as measuring the depth of Europa's subsurface ocean. Pappalardo and others at the OPAG meeting said that changes to the instrument's operation, notable periodic rolls of the spacecraft to calibrate it, should recover sufficient precision to achieve those science goals.

Europa Clipper is designed to characterize the huge ocean of liquid water that sloshes beneath the moon's icy shell, assess Europa's ability to host life as we know it, scout out touchdown sites for a potential life- hunting lander mission and perform a number of other tasks. The probe will do this work during dozens of flybys of Europa, which it will make after reaching Jupiter orbit. The SLS would allow Clipper to get to the gas giant much faster. The big NASA rocket will be powerful enough to launch the spacecraft directly to Jupiter, making the trip in a mere 2.4 years. The commercial alternatives would require a roundabout trajectory that takes advantage of planetary \"gravity assists,\" resulting in a transit time of nearly 6 years, Martin wrote. Still, NASA should be allowed to consider those alternatives, he stressed. The first three SLS rockets are already booked to aid NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land two astronauts near the lunar south pole by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by 2028.

Tuesday's letter was a follow-up to a report into the Europa Clipper and Europa lander missions that the OIG released in May. That report determined that both projects face a variety of serious challenges on the way to the launchpad. \"Our audit found that, despite robust early-stage funding, NASA's aggressive development schedule, a stringent conflict of interest process during instrument selection, an insufficient evaluation of cost and schedule estimates, and technical workforce shortages have increased instrument integration challenges and development risks for the Clipper mission,\" John Schulz, an OIG management analyst, said in a video released with the May report.

The Europa Clipper mission, in development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has just been approved for its final design and construction phase. It's on track for a 2025 launch. \"Clipper\" is the culmination of decades of dreaming and years of conceptual and preliminary design. It is only the second mission NASA has dedicated to exploring a moon in the solar system-our own moon was the first. The target, Jupiter's icy Europa, is very different from Earth's moon. Believed to possess a heated rocky core and mantle surrounded by an ice-topped ocean of liquid water up to 100 miles deep, Europa is arguably the best place in our solar system to look for life beyond Earth. Why Are We Interested in this Icy Jovian Moon? Astrobiologists' mouths water at the prospect of an ocean of liquid water -- particularly a salty one -- in contact with a rocky ocean floor. They theorize that heat from within Europa's rocky interior, generated by tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity, powers eruptions of hot, mineral-laden water on Europa's ocean floor. Such \"hydrothermal vents\" could supply all the ingredients necessary to sustain some form of life. Hydrothermal vents dot Earth's own oceans in volcanically active areas. Since their discovery, researchers have found communities of life forms that thrive around hydrothermal vents, subsisting entirely on thermal and chemical energy emerging from Earth's interior. How life arrived at these deep ocean oases is still open to scientific debate. One theory poses the idea that life on Earth could have gotten its start at hydrothermal vents and migrated later to the surface. The Challenge of Exploring a Concealed Ocean Half a Billion Miles Away. You might wonder, if there's a saltwater ocean on Europa, and the strong possibility of a life-friendly environment, why don't we already have robot submarines in the water sending us images of beautiful bioluminescent jellyfish, or something? Easier said than done. Even landing a robot on Europa's unexplored surface would be a great engineering challenge. Designing a mission capable of boring through miles of ice and descending through a hundred miles of water to reach the ocean floor, and still able to communicate with us back on Earth, is presently an adventure of science fiction. Although earlier mission concepts flirted with dropping robots onto Europa's surface, the Clipper mission won't do that. It won't even orbit Europa. That moon resides within bands of intense radiation that surround Jupiter, an environment where even a radiation-hardened spacecraft might survive only a few weeks. Such a short visit wouldn't allow much time to explore, let alone transmit the huge volumes of collected scientific data back to Earth before a fatal failure brought an end to the mission. Instead, Clipper will follow a looping trajectory around Jupiter that will send it careening past Europa on 45 close flybys. Some will pass as close as 16 miles near the surface. Between flybys the spacecraft will retreat to the far end of its elongated orbit, away from Jupiter and into safer climates beyond the deadly radiation zone. The longer mission time and extended orbits will ultimately let Clipper collect and send home up to three times as much data as a Europa-orbiting spacecraft could. Europa Clipper Will See Under Europa's Skin. Europa Clipper will carry nine scientific instruments designed to offer a detailed look at the moon, particularly the vast ocean lurking beneath its icy crust. Apart from the usual cameras and spectrometers that will take high-resolution pictures and analyze the composition of Europa's surface, Clipper will carry instruments to investigate what lies below that surface. An ice-penetrating radar will probe the frozen crust to determine its thickness and map its structure. Scientists will look for any subsurface lakes in chambers closer to the surface, which may be sources of water plumes detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. A magnetometer will measure the disturbance of Jupiter's magnetic field by Europa's salty ocean, divining its salinity and depth. Two different instruments will analyze particles \"sniffed\" during very close flybys. The composition of particles and gases in Europa's tenuous atmosphere and possibly plumes of water and chemicals erupting from its surface could help explain what Europa's ocean is made of, if those plumes originate from the ocean's waters. How Long Have We Known About Europa's Ocean? We caught our first scent of Europa's ocean in 1979 when the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew through the Jupiter system. The spacecraft captured images of Europa's fractured surface. Its patterns of cracks and fissures were best explained by a thin icy crust floating on a body of liquid. Starting in 1995 the Galileo spacecraft made 11 close flybys of Europa, capturing images of much higher detail and measuring Europa's effects on Jupiter's magnetic field. The images further confirmed the presence of the hidden ocean, and Europa's magnetic disturbances suggested that ocean is salty. In the past few years, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have tentatively detected what may be plumes of water vapor emanating from Europa's southern polar region, further whetting scientists' appetites to explore the exo-ocean. We'll have to wait a few more years before getting our next taste of Europa's ocean waters, but at least we know that Europa Clipper is on the way.

A team based at JPL is developing a potential system to do just that for individual instruments on NASA's Europa Clipper mission. That spacecraft is due to launch in the mid-2020s to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The moon is one of the most intriguing worlds in our solar system for scientists interested in understanding whether life exists beyond Earth. An ocean hidden below Europa's icy shell could potentially host microbial life similar to that found near deep-sea vents on Earth, and Clipper could collect information that would give scientists a more detailed understanding of the moon. Europa Clipper will carry nine different science instruments, and the algorithm team is already working with the teams behind three of them, with more partnerships under discussion. The instruments will look for features like warm patches in the icy shell and plumes of seawater bursting out into space. The idea behind the algorithm project is that it should be possible to train the spacecraft to spot the most promising data it gathers, then bump that to the front of the communications queue. It wouldn't change what Europa Clipper does next, but it could mean scientists wouldn't need to be quite as patient. There's just one problem: space-ready machines are ... not the typical hardware computer scientists use. The system on board Europa Clipper will be able to run at speeds of up to 200 megahertz. \"For comparison, that's about the equivalent of an early '90s desktop PC, if you took that and put that into orbit,\" Kiri Wagstaff, a computer scientist at JPL who is leading the project, told Space.com. \"We don't really encounter machines that limited today in our day-to-day life.\" The stunted processing capacity means any space-bound algorithm has to be lean, and extremely so. It's one of the two key challenges Wagstaff and her colleagues are facing in developing a system for Europa Clipper: The researchers have to come up with ways of flagging key data for the limited processor to execute in ways that are simple and quick. \"We get questions about, well, 'Are you using deep learning to help these spacecraft make these decisions?'\" Wagstaff said. \"And the answer is emphatically no, it's simply not possible.\" The team's other main challenge is that, after all, Europa Clipper itself doesn't exist yet and hasn't produced any data yet. Wagstaff and her colleagues are basing their current work on data gathered by other spacecraft and on simulations of what Clipper's data could look like, but it's not the same. Right now, the algorithm isn't a formal part of Europa Clipper, and there's no guarantee it will be used during the mission. First, it needs to pass a series of tests designed to make sure the algorithm is trim enough to work in flight. \"That's kind of a go, no-go point,\" Wagstaff said. \"If it can't fit into the available resources, you can't use it.\" Wagstaff and her colleagues are also checking whether the algorithm can withstand the harsh radiation environment around this frigid moon. The computer on the spacecraft will be sheathed to protect it from radiation, but some particles will still sneak through. Scientists need to know whether such hits can derail a calculation. But if the team can get the algorithm right, it could make Europa Clipper a more powerful mission, encouraging scientists to gather too much data to send home in the allotted time, with the assurance that they'll see the most intriguing of it. That's the first step in using such algorithms to actively shape outer solar system missions. The process has already begun at Mars on NASA's Curiosity rover, which can use its laser spectrometer to analyze rocks that meet current science priorities without waiting for instructions from Earth. \"It all happens without any human in the loop,\" Wagstaff said. \"The rover itself decides, 'This looks like an interesting rock, I will sample that,'\" in time that it would otherwise spend twiddling its thumbs. \"We're getting this bonus science basically for free.\" Examples like that make a tempting lure for planetary scientists with more distant targets. But even if an algorithm doesn't fly on Clipper, there's plenty for scientists to look forward to, Davies said. \"Whatever happens, the data that we're going to get back from Europa Clipper is going to be of immeasurably higher quality than what was achievable from previous missions,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of things that previous instruments simply couldn't have detected.\" They may just need a little more patience.

The Europa Clipper mission, in development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has just been approved for its final design and construction phase. It's on track for a 2025 launch. \"Clipper\" is the culmination of decades of dreaming and years of conceptual and preliminary design. It is only the second mission NASA has dedicated to exploring a moon in the solar system-our own moon was the first. The target, Jupiter's icy Europa, is very different from Earth's moon. Believed to possess a heated rocky core and mantle surrounded by an ice-topped ocean of liquid water up to 100 miles deep, Europa is arguably the best place in our solar system to look for life beyond Earth. Why Are We Interested in this Icy Jovian Moon? Astrobiologists' mouths water at the prospect of an ocean of liquid water -- particularly a salty one -- in contact with a rocky ocean floor. They theorize that heat from within Europa's rocky interior, generated by tidal forces of Jupiter's gravity, powers eruptions of hot, mineral-laden water on Europa's ocean floor. Such \"hydrothermal vents\" could supply all the ingredients necessary to sustain some form of life. Hydrothermal vents dot Earth's own oceans in volcanically active areas. Since their discovery, researchers have found communities of life forms that thrive around hydrothermal vents, subsisting entirely on thermal and chemical energy emerging from Earth's interior. How life arrived at these deep ocean oases is still open to scientific debate. One theory poses the idea that life on Earth could have gotten its start at hydrothermal vents and migrated later to the surface. The Challenge of Exploring a Concealed Ocean Half a Billion Miles Away. You might wonder, if there's a saltwater ocean on Europa, and the strong possibility of a life-friendly environment, why don't we already have robot submarines in the water sending us images of beautiful bioluminescent jellyfish, or something? Easier said than done. Even landing a robot on Europa's unexplored surface would be a great engineering challenge. Designing a mission capable of boring through miles of ice and descending through a hundred miles of water to reach the ocean floor, and still able to communicate with us back on Earth, is presently an adventure of science fiction. Although earlier mission concepts flirted with dropping robots onto Europa's surface, the Clipper mission won't do that. It won't even orbit Europa. That moon resides within bands of intense radiation that surround Jupiter, an environment where even a radiation-hardened spacecraft might survive only a few weeks. Such a short visit wouldn't allow much time to explore, let alone transmit the huge volumes of collected scientific data back to Earth before a fatal failure brought an end to the mission. Instead, Clipper will follow a looping trajectory around Jupiter that will send it careening past Europa on 45 close flybys. Some will pass as close as 16 miles near the surface. Between flybys the spacecraft will retreat to the far end of its elongated orbit, away from Jupiter and into safer climates beyond the deadly radiation zone. The longer mission time and extended orbits will ultimately let Clipper collect and send home up to three times as much data as a Europa-orbiting spacecraft could.

The ongoing tussle between NASA and Congress for choosing the Europa Clipper's launch vehicle looks to be continuing this year as well. The Europa Clipper is the space agency's spacecraft that is intended to launch five years from now and study Jupiter's moon Europa. Europa is believed to have water beneath its icy surface, and the Clipper intends to determine the moon's habitability. This mission has seen NASA administrator's come at odds with Congress regarding its launch vehicle. Congress wants NASA to use Boeing's Space Launch System, dubbed 'SLS' for the Clipper mission. SLS will replace Space Shuttle and is NASA's chosen spacecraft for sending missions to the Moon under the Artemis program scheduled to land astronauts on the lunar south pole in 2024. The agency, on the other hand, wishes to use commercial launch vehicles for launching the Europa Clipper to Europa. Now, in its budget request for the fiscal year 2021, NASA has estimated that such a move will save it and the U.S. taxpayer approximately $1.5 billion. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Reusable Heavy-Lift Vehicle To Allow NASA $1.5 Billion Savings Over Boeing's Space Launch System When choosing the Europa Clipper's launch vehicle, NASA needs to keep in mind the time that it will take the vehicle to reach the moon, the path that it will follow to get there, the total thrust produced by the mission's launch vehicle and the cost of using a particular launch vehicle. The first block of Boeing's SLS that will carry the Artemis missions to the Moon is capable of producing 8.4 million lbs of thrust at liftoff, and with it, the expected time frame for the Europa Clipper mission to make it to Jupiter is estimated as approximately 3 years. Estimates made by NASA suggest that completion of the spacecraft will take two to three years, and end in November 2023. Using the SLS is expected to cost NASA in between $750 million - $1 billion for the launch only - and launch costs are only one part of the equation that determines the final bill for the Clipper's launch. Even though NASA believes that the spacecraft itself will be ready for launch by the end of 2023, this does not mean that it will have an SLS launch vehicle ready to take it to space. SLS is unlikely to be free until 2025 at the earliest, and given that the Clipper spacecraft will be completed by 2023, the agency will have to account for storage costs during the period. These, based on prior missions, are estimated to be between $10 million - $12 million per month for the geostationary satellites and $3 million - $5 million for polar satellites. First-generation Space Launch System. SpaceX Falcon Heavy is less than one-fifth of SLS' cost-per-launch but is also significantly underpowered in comparison to the super heavy-lift launch vehicle Additionally, and before we get to the launch costs of the two alternatives to the SLS for launching the Clipper in orbit around Jupiter, it's important to estimate the costs of storing the spacecraft. Storing it for two years will cost NASA in between $36 million - $60 million, assuming that an SLS is free and available for use at the end of 2025. Given that it packs the biggest power punch of all options for sending Clipper to Jupiter, the SLS is also the most expensive launch vehicle option available to the space agency. Using the SLS will cost NASA at least $900 million per launch according to Administrator Bridenstine, and this price can only go up given that the estimate was provided in 2019. In comparison, using the SpaceX Falcon Heavy's variant capable of putting at least 26 tons into geostationary orbit will cost $150 million per launch. This variant of the Falcon Heavy is capable of generating a maximum thrust of 5.13 million lbs at liftoff given that its center core engines are running. Aside from the Falcon Heavy, United Launch Alliance'sc Delta IV Heavy is also capable of carrying the 6 ton Clipper mission to Jupiter's orbit. The Delta IV Heavy generates 2.1 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and costs between $350 million - $400 million per launch. With deliberation for launch vehicle continuing, design parameters for Europa Clipper should remain in limbo Performing rudimentary calculations lets us determine the cost savings ourselves based on the information available. Using the Falcon Heavy is the cheapest option available to NASA for sending the Clipper to Jupiter, yet the launch vehicle is not the lowest at the thrust spectrum's end. Switching to SpaceX's product will save the agency at least $750 million in per-flight launch costs, $60 million in storage costs for total minimum savings of $810 million - a figure that's still short of the $1.5 billion range that the agency has stated in its latest budget request. However, the savings do carry opportunity costs. Given that Boeing's SLS is the most powerful launch vehicle of the three discussed in this piece, it also carries with it the potential to directly take the Clipper to its polar orbit around Jupiter. If the Clipper is launched using the SLS, then nine months after liftoff the Clipper mission only has to make one maneuver to insert itself in Jupiter's orbit. As opposed to this, if SpaceX Falcon Heavy is the Clipper launch vehicle, then the mission may have to make as much as three gravity assists before maneuvering and another after gravity assist from earth four years after launch. These stand to extend the mission time to six years. Another option that would avoid the need for these time-taking and dangerous gravity assists is strapping the SpaceX Falcon Heavy with Orbital ATK's 48BV kick stage. This would remove the need for dangerous Venus flybys and reduce the mission's time duration.

These include the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are Europa and Enceladus respectively. According to scientific reports, the icy crusts of these natural satellites could be hiding vast liquid oceans, which could have the right conditions to support alien life. Scientists believe that the interaction between the moons' rocky cores and the oceans might have triggered a chemical reaction that could spark the evolution of life, Space.com reported. Currently, NASA is working on a couple of projects that are focused on exploring Europa. One of these is the mission known as Europa Clipper, which would involve sending a robotic probe to study the surface of Jupiter's moon. Once there, the probe is also expected to collect readings from the moon's liquid oceans to detect traces of microbial life. Another project that NASA is working on is a nuclear-powered drill system that's designed to penetrate Europa's thick icy shell, which is estimated to be about nine to 16 miles deep. The system, known as the Scientific Exploration Subsurface Access Mechanism for Europa, will be brought to the moon through a lander in a future mission. It will then be used to reach the natural satellite's subsurface oceans to check for the presence of life. Although NASA could use the same technologies for the exploration of Saturn's Enceladus, the agency is currently developing new projects for future missions to the moon. This includes the Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor, which is an autonomous snake-like robot. It was designed to slip in between the cracks on Enceladus' surface to explore its liquid oceans. NASA confirmed that EELS will be part of a flagship mission to Enceladus. Aside from the robot, the mission would also involve deploying a lander, a probe and an orbiter to the natural satellite. \"A single Flagship-level mission that would search for life on Enceladus' surface, within its ice shell and in the subsurface ocean may be the most comprehensive opportunity for astrobiology in the coming decade,\" NASA scientists Jason Hofgartner stated.

The farther from home a probe ventures, the longer its dispatches take to reach eager humans on Earth and the terser such reports must be. That's why computer scientists and planetary scientists are teaming up to develop an algorithm that could potentially identify the most intriguing data an icy moon explorer mission collects, sending those tidbits to receivers first. \"We're in this golden age of space exploration, and we have hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of data flooding back from across the solar system,\" Ashley Davies, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told Space.com. \"It's not possible to return all the data that you ever collect.\" Hence the interest in an algorithm to negotiate what to report first. A team based at JPL is developing a potential system to do just that for individual instruments on NASA's Europa Clipper mission. That spacecraft is due to launch in the mid-2020s to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The moon is one of the most intriguing worlds in our solar system for scientists interested in understanding whether life exists beyond Earth. An ocean hidden below Europa's icy shell could potentially host microbial life similar to that found near deep-sea vents on Earth, and Clipper could collect information that would give scientists a more detailed understanding of the moon. Europa Clipper will carry nine different science instruments, and the algorithm team is already working with the teams behind three of them, with more partnerships under discussion. The instruments will look for features like warm patches in the icy shell and plumes of seawater bursting out into space. The idea behind the algorithm project is that it should be possible to train the spacecraft to spot the most promising data it gathers, then bump that to the front of the communications queue. It wouldn't change what Europa Clipper does next, but it could mean scientists wouldn't need to be quite as patient. There's just one problem: space-ready machines are ... not the typical hardware computer scientists use. The system on board Europa Clipper will be able to run at speeds of up to 200 megahertz. \"For comparison, that's about the equivalent of an early '90s desktop PC, if you took that and put that into orbit,\" Kiri Wagstaff, a computer scientist at JPL who is leading the project, told Space.com. \"We don't really encounter machines that limited today in our day-to-day life.\" The stunted processing capacity means any space-bound algorithm has to be lean, and extremely so. It's one of the two key challenges Wagstaff and her colleagues are facing in developing a system for Europa Clipper: The researchers have to come up with ways of flagging key data for the limited processor to execute in ways that are simple and quick. \"We get questions about, well, 'Are you using deep learning to help these spacecraft make these decisions?'\" Wagstaff said. \"And the answer is emphatically no, it's simply not possible.\" The team's other main challenge is that, after all, Europa Clipper itself doesn't exist yet and hasn't produced any data yet. Wagstaff and her colleagues are basing their current work on data gathered by other spacecraft and on simulations of what Clipper's data could look like, but it's not the same. Right now, the algorithm isn't a formal part of Europa Clipper, and there's no guarantee it will be used during the mission. First, it needs to pass a series of tests designed to make sure the algorithm is trim enough to work in flight. \"That's kind of a go, no-go point,\" Wagstaff said. \"If it can't fit into the available resources, you can't use it.\" Wagstaff and her colleagues are also checking whether the algorithm can withstand the harsh radiation environment around this frigid moon. The computer on the spacecraft will be sheathed to protect it from radiation, but some particles will still sneak through. Scientists need to know whether such hits can derail a calculation. But if the team can get the algorithm right, it could make Europa Clipper a more powerful mission, encouraging scientists to gather too much data to send home in the allotted time, with the assurance that they'll see the most intriguing of it. That's the first step in using such algorithms to actively shape outer solar system missions. The process has already begun at Mars on NASA's Curiosity rover, which can use its laser spectrometer to analyze rocks that meet current science priorities without waiting for instructions from Earth. \"It all happens without any human in the loop,\" Wagstaff said. \"The rover itself decides, 'This looks like an interesting rock, I will sample that,'\" in time that it would otherwise spend twiddling its thumbs. \"We're getting this bonus science basically for free.\" Examples like that make a tempting lure for planetary scientists with more distant targets. But even if an algorithm doesn't fly on Clipper, there's plenty for scientists to look forward to, Davies said. \"Whatever happens, the data that we're going to get back from Europa Clipper is going to be of immeasurably higher quality than what was achievable from previous missions,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of things that previous instruments simply couldn't have detected.\" They may just need a little more patience.

We're trying to understand, Is Europa a habitable environment?\" Europa Clipper project scientist Robert Pappalardo said last week, at the 70th International Astronautical Congress in Washington D.C., according to Space.com. Pappalardo continued: \"We're not a life-search mission. But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra - probably, possibly - that we're sensing life. That's a longshot, but it's not impossible.\" The Europa Clipper, which could launch as soon as 2023 but has a baseline commitment of a \"launch readiness date by 2025,\" will have a mass spectrometer on the craft, used to determine the mass of ions in an atom. The Clipper is expected to record, collect and observe many of these types of samples during its 3.5-year operational life, Space.com added. It will do several flybys and not circle the moon due to the intense radiation that surrounds it. A 2018 study expressed concerns that Europa's surface may be extremely porous, which could harm any probe that touches down on its surface. Pappalardo added the researchers want to delve further into any discovery the Clipper makes of water plumes that emanate from Europa's surface. \"Early in the mission, we'll be searching for plumes and trying to understand, Are they real? Are they there? Where are they? Are they sporadic or continuously active?\" It's unclear what the oceans on Europa are made up of, but the Hubble Space Telescope detected the presence of sodium chloride on its surface, according to a study published in June. The conditions on Europa have been previously likened to exoplanet Barnard B, a \"super-Earth\" 30 trillion miles from Earth. It likely has a surface temperature of roughly 238 degrees below zero and may have oceans underneath its icy surface, according to a July 2018 statement from NASA. The mission for the solar-powered Clipper is expected to cost around $4 billion, according to NASA.

The space agency's scientists are looking to accomplish this through a special experiment that the mission will carry out on Europa. NASA's upcoming mission to Jupiter's icy moon will be conducted using the Clipper spacecraft, which is expected to launch sometime in 2025. According to Robert Pappalardo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the project scientist for the Europa Clipper Mission, the main objective of the mission is to determine the moon's capability of hosting and supporting life. Through the mission, the project scientist and his colleagues are hoping that Clipper will encounter evidence of organic life during its voyage. \"We're a habitability mission,\" Pappalardo said during the 70th International Astronautical Congress held recently in Washington, D.C., according to Space.com. \"We're trying to understand, Is Europa a habitable environment?\" \"We're not a life-search mission,\" Pappalardo continued. \"But, if Europa's interior happened to be rich in organic microbes pouring out of it, we would be able to tell from the mass spectra probably, possibly that we're sensing life.

This instrument is designed to measure the masses of ions in the samples that will be collected by the spacecraft. Pappalardo and his team are hoping that these samples would contain traces of extraterrestrial life. Unlike NASA's other planetary missions, Clipper will not land on Europa. Instead, the spacecraft will only carry out flybys on the icy moon by following Jupiter's orbit. From these flybys, the spacecraft will collect samples from the moon's atmosphere. According to Pappalardo, this experiment will determine if Europa emits water vapor plumes from its surface and into its atmosphere. \"Early in the mission, we'll be searching for plumes and trying to understand, are they real?\" he explained. \"Are they there? Where are they? Are they sporadic or continuously active?

The first block of Boeing's SLS that will carry the Artemis missions to the Moon is capable of producing 8.4 million lbs of thrust at liftoff, and with it, the expected time frame for the Europa Clipper mission to make it to Jupiter is estimated as approximately 3 years. Estimates made by NASA suggest that completion of the spacecraft will take two to three years, and end in November 2023. Using the SLS is expected to cost NASA in between $750 million - $1 billion for the launch only - and launch costs are only one part of the equation that determines the final bill for the Clipper's launch. Even though NASA believes that the spacecraft itself will be ready for launch by the end of 2023, this does not mean that it will have an SLS launch vehicle ready to take it to space. SLS is unlikely to be free until 2025 at the earliest, and given that the Clipper spacecraft will be completed by 2023, the agency will have to account for storage costs during the period.

Storing it for two years will cost NASA in between $36 million - $60 million, assuming that an SLS is free and available for use at the end of 2025. Given that it packs the biggest power punch of all options for sending Clipper to Jupiter, the SLS is also the most expensive launch vehicle option available to the space agency.

This variant of the Falcon Heavy is capable of generating a maximum thrust of 5.13 million lbs at liftoff given that its center core engines are running. Aside from the Falcon Heavy, United Launch Alliance'sc Delta IV Heavy is also capable of carrying the 6 ton Clipper mission to Jupiter's orbit.

The Delta IV Heavy generates 2.1 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and costs between $350 million - $400 million per launch. With deliberation for launch vehicle continuing, design parameters for Europa Clipper should remain in limbo Performing rudimentary calculations lets us determine the cost savings ourselves based on the information available. Using the Falcon Heavy is the cheapest option available to NASA for sending the Clipper to Jupiter, yet the launch vehicle is not the lowest at the thrust spectrum's end. Switching to SpaceX's product will save the agency at least $750 million in per-flight launch costs, $60 million in storage costs for total minimum savings of $810 million - a figure that's still short of the $1.5 billion range that the agency has stated in its latest budget request. However, the savings do carry opportunity costs. Given that Boeing's SLS is the most powerful launch vehicle of the three discussed in this piece, it also carries with it the potential to directly take the Clipper to its polar orbit around Jupiter. If the Clipper is launched using the SLS, then nine months after liftoff the Clipper mission only has to make one maneuver to insert itself in Jupiter's orbit. As opposed to this, if SpaceX Falcon Heavy is the Clipper launch vehicle, then the mission may have to make as much as three gravity assists before maneuvering and another after gravity assist from earth four years after launch. These stand to extend the mission time to six years. Another option that would avoid the need for these time-taking and dangerous gravity assists is strapping the SpaceX Falcon Heavy with Orbital ATK's 48BV kick stage. This would remove the need for dangerous Venus flybys and reduce the mission's time duration. Looking at NASA's latest estimate of $1.5 billion cost savings, we have an inkling that the agency might also be factoring in savings through the Artemis program if resources dedicated to the SLS are not diverted for the Clipper mission. The sooner this decision is taken is the sooner Clipper designers will be able to breathe easily. When this will happen, only time can tell.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The ongoing tussle between NASA and Congress for choosing the Europa Clipper's launch vehicle looks to be continuing this year as well. The Europa Clipper is the space agency's spacecraft that is intended to launch five years from now and study Jupiter's moon Europa. Europa is believed to have water beneath its icy surface, and the Clipper intends to determine the moon's habitability. This mission has seen NASA administrator's come at odds with Congress regarding its launch vehicle. Congress wants NASA to use Boeing's Space Launch System, dubbed 'SLS' for the Clipper mission. SLS will replace Space Shuttle and is NASA's chosen spacecraft for sending missions to the Moon under the Artemis program scheduled to land astronauts on the lunar south pole in 2024. The agency, on the other hand, wishes to use commercial launch vehicles for launching the Europa Clipper to Europa. Now, in its budget request for the fiscal year 2021, NASA has estimated that such a move will save it and the U.S. taxpayer approximately $1.5 billion. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy Reusable Heavy-Lift Vehicle To Allow NASA $1.5 Billion Savings Over Boeing's Space Launch System When choosing the Europa Clipper's launch vehicle, NASA needs to keep in mind the time that it will take the vehicle to reach the moon, the path that it will follow to get there, the total thrust produced by the mission's launch vehicle and the cost of using a particular launch vehicle. The first block of Boeing's SLS that will carry the Artemis missions to the Moon is capable of producing 8.4 million lbs of thrust at liftoff, and with it, the expected time frame for the Europa Clipper mission to make it to Jupiter is estimated as approximately 3 years. Estimates made by NASA suggest that completion of the spacecraft will take two to three years, and end in November 2023. Using the SLS is expected to cost NASA in between $750 million - $1 billion for the launch only - and launch costs are only one part of the equation that determines the final bill for the Clipper's launch. Even though NASA believes that the spacecraft itself will be ready for launch by the end of 2023, this does not mean that it will have an SLS launch vehicle ready to take it to space. SLS is unlikely to be free until 2025 at the earliest, and given that the Clipper spacecraft will be completed by 2023, the agency will have to account for storage costs during the period. These, based on prior missions, are estimated to be between $10 million - $12 million per month for the geostationary satellites and $3 million - $5 million for polar satellites. First-generation Space Launch System. SpaceX Falcon Heavy is less than one-fifth of SLS' cost-per-launch but is also significantly underpowered in comparison to the super heavy-lift launch vehicle Additionally, and before we get to the launch costs of the two alternatives to the SLS for launching the Clipper in orbit around Jupiter, it's important to estimate the costs of storing the spacecraft. Storing it for two years will cost NASA in between $36 million - $60 million, assuming that an SLS is free and available for use at the end of 2025. Given that it packs the biggest power punch of all options for sending Clipper to Jupiter, the SLS is also the most expensive launch vehicle option available to the space agency. Using the SLS will cost NASA at least $900 million per launch according to Administrator Bridenstine, and this price can only go up given that the estimate was provided in 2019. In comparison, using the SpaceX Falcon Heavy's variant capable of putting at least 26 tons into geostationary orbit will cost $150 million per launch. This variant of the Falcon Heavy is capable of generating a maximum thrust of 5.13 million lbs at liftoff given that its center core engines are running. Aside from the Falcon Heavy, United Launch Alliance'sc Delta IV Heavy is also capable of carrying the 6 ton Clipper mission to Jupiter's orbit.

This is the same amount of funding that was enacted for NASA's budget this year. This is just the beginning of the budget process, of course. The White House released its budget request back in February, and now the House and Senate will establish their priorities. Months of negotiations will ensue, compounded by the COVID-19 crisis and the 2020 presidential election. After the fiscal year 2020 budget ends in October, a continuing resolution is likely. The 2021 budget seems unlikely to be resolved before December. Still, the new document does tell us where Democrats and Republicans in the House think NASA funding should go. And there are a few important clues within worth discussing. One of the big questions in recent years has been how NASA will get its multi-billion-dollar Europa Clipper mission to Jupiter's moon. In the past, Congress has said this must go on NASA's Space Launch System rocket, but this came with downsides. For one, the SLS rocket likely will cost NASA at least $1.5 billion more than a commercial rocket. Also, because it takes so long to build the large rocket, it's unlikely an SLS would be available for the Clipper before 2026. Because the spacecraft may be ready to launch as early as 2024, and storing it would lead to increased costs, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has studied alternative launch vehicles. Among the most promising is a Falcon Heavy booster with a kick stage. In the House legislation, Congress says NASA \"shall use the Space Launch System, if available, as the launch vehicles for the Jupiter Europa missions,\" and plan for an orbiter launch no later than 2025. Because few people at NASA expect an SLS vehicle to be available in 2025, this is a pretty big deal. Advertisement It remains to be seen how the US Senate will act-the biggest proponent of the SLS rocket, Alabama's Richard Shelby, chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. In order to have any chance to make a 2024 landing on the Moon, NASA also needs to receive substantial funding soon for a Human Landing System. This is the most technologically challenging aspect of the Artemis Program to return to the Moon. NASA is currently working with three teams, led by Blue Origin, Dynetics, and SpaceX, on lander designs. Back in February, the White House asked for $3.37 billion in fiscal year 2021 to accelerate development of the lander. Democrats in the House have been skeptical of the 2024 launch date-some see it as political due to the timing of the next presidential election-and so have been slow to fund the lander. In its budget, the House appropriates $1.56 billion for \"Exploration Research and Development.\" This includes funding for the lander, Lunar Gateway, and other activities related to the Moon's surface, of which more than $600 million can be used for the lander. \"I want to thank the House Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee for the bipartisan support they have shown for NASA's Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said. \"The $628.2 million in funding for the human landing system is an important first step in this year's appropriations process. We still have more to do, and I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure America has the resources to land the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024.\" While this is far from the White House request, it seems like a better starting point than zero. And the budget for the lander probably will receive additional funding from the Senate later in the fiscal process. Sources at NASA said the lander program will remain on track as long as new funding arrives by the end of this calendar year.

For the second time, NASA has performed \"continuation/termination reviews\" of three of the Europa Clipper spacecraft's scientific instruments after budget overruns on the order of no more than a few tens of millions of dollars. Thankfully, no instruments were canceled, unlike the \"ICEMAG\" magnetometer that was functionally killed last year. Still, a NASA program scientist casually noted that the space agency would tolerate launching without one of two cameras and would offer no more funding to a mass spectrometer instrument, raising the risk of instrument failure during the challenging mission. For any scientific spacecraft or rover, the instruments carried along are effectively the entire reason for their existence: if those instruments are faulty, the mission is effectively rendered pointless. Further, due to the sheer complexity and challenges posed by the act of getting to the destination and surviving after arrival, the actual instruments most scientific spacecraft carry represent a tiny fraction of the overall mission cost and mass. It's not easy to readily imagine a better way to signal inept program management than by singularly focusing on that tiny, lifeblood-esque portion of a spacecraft's budget. Undeterred, that is exactly what NASA appears to be doing with Europa Clipper - penny-wise, perhaps, but undoubtedly pound-foolish. It's not always true that only a small portion of an exploratory spacecraft's budget is spent on scientific instruments but it absolutely is when it comes to Europa Clipper. Originally hoped to cost as little as $2 billion in 2013, Europa Clipper's budget allocation has ballooned to $4.5 billion over the life of the program. Of that $4.5 billion, as little as $110M was dedicated to nine scientific instruments assigned to the spacecraft - a ratio of ~41:1. Even if instrument cost ballooned by 100% to ~$220 million, it would still be a measly 20:1. The space environment around Jupiter is admittedly one of the most challenging in the Solar System, warranting some imbalance, but either ratio is still exceptionally bad as far as most exploratory missions go. Designed to create detailed maps of Europa's theorized water oceans, ICEMAG, for example, jumped from a $30 million cost estimate to $45 million before NASA abruptly killed it. A Clipper planetary scientist called ICEMAG \"a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever\". MASPEX, meanwhile, is a mass spectrometer that will be used to analyze possible chemicals captured by flying through Europa's transient atmosphere. In other words, the instrument most likely to be hobbled next by NASA is also the only instrument on Europa Clipper capable of potentially detecting signs of life by directly sampling material ejected by Europa's plumes. Even just with ICEMAG removed, the value proposition of a $4.5 billion mission to an ocean moon of Jupiter becomes much hazier. With ICEMAG removed and MASPEX at risk of being thrown to the wolves, Europa Clipper's purpose becomes even weaker. Of course, seven valuable instruments remain - some of which partially overlap with MASPEX' goals - and MASPEX could still technically make it to the finish line in its original handicap-free state, but the tides are definitely not moving in an encouraging direction. The worst part is that excluding the extraordinarily expensive spacecraft that will host instruments worth ~3-5% its cost, Congress has been dead-set on forcing Europa Clipper to launch on NASA's chronically-delayed, over-budget Space Launch System rocket. SLS has yet to launch once despite more than a decade of development and almost $30 billion spent on the rocket alone, and it would take a miracle for an SLS rocket to be ready to launch Clipper before 2025 or 2026. Europa Clipper is working towards a launch no earlier than 2024, meaning that the spacecraft would have to be stored indefinitely at a cost of at least $125 million per year. Intrepid readers may note that the cost of simply waiting a single year for SLS to be ready for launch is higher than the cost of all of Europa Clipper's scientific instruments at their original $110 million budget. The actual cost to NASA for a single SLS launch is expected to $1.5 billion at the absolute minimum, while $2-2.5 billion is far more reasonable. With a little effort and some moderate cruise stage tweaks, Ars Technica has already reported that an expendable SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket augmented with an off-the-shelf kick stage could send Europa Clipper to Jupiter in 5-6 years, compared to ~3 with SLS. Ironically, that means that if Falcon Heavy was ready to launch Europa Clipper when the spacecraft is expected to be ready in 2024, it would actually arrive at the same time if it launched on SLS - once a minimum two-year launch vehicle delay is accounted for. A Falcon Heavy would also save NASA at least $1-2 billion, while it would directly save the Europa Clipper program the ~$250 million it would otherwise need to spend to store the spacecraft while waiting years for an SLS rocket. That $250 million alone - an inevitable add-on cost if SLS is chosen - could easily double the budget of every single Europa Clipper science instrument, adding plenty of breathing room, reinstating ICEMAG, and likely improving the science they output - data- gathering quite literally being the whole purpose of the mission. Of course, the odds that NASA actually steps out from under the political shadow of SLS and stops playing penny wise and pound foolish with the extraordinarily expensive science missions it shepherds is unlikely. But still, the possibility remains. Most recently, a very slight change in the wording of a proposed law could give the Europa Clipper program the legal wiggle room it needs to sidestep Congress' desire to force it to launch on SLS. Of course, the senators and representatives with parochial attachment to the rocket will continue to fight tooth and nail to legally force it upon NASA at every possible turn, but there is now at least a chance of a sane outcome.

Sources at NASA said the lander program will remain on track as long as new funding arrives by the end of this calendar year.

For the second time, NASA has performed \"continuation/termination reviews\" of three of the Europa Clipper spacecraft's scientific instruments after budget overruns on the order of no more than a few tens of millions of dollars. Thankfully, no instruments were canceled, unlike the \"ICEMAG\" magnetometer that was functionally killed last year. Still, a NASA program scientist casually noted that the space agency would tolerate launching without one of two cameras and would offer no more funding to a mass spectrometer instrument, raising the risk of instrument failure during the challenging mission. For any scientific spacecraft or rover, the instruments carried along are effectively the entire reason for their existence: if those instruments are faulty, the mission is effectively rendered pointless. Further, due to the sheer complexity and challenges posed by the act of getting to the destination and surviving after arrival, the actual instruments most scientific spacecraft carry represent a tiny fraction of the overall mission cost and mass. It's not easy to readily imagine a better way to signal inept program management than by singularly focusing on that tiny, lifeblood-esque portion of a spacecraft's budget. Undeterred, that is exactly what NASA appears to be doing with Europa Clipper - penny-wise, perhaps, but undoubtedly pound-foolish. It's not always true that only a small portion of an exploratory spacecraft's budget is spent on scientific instruments but it absolutely is when it comes to Europa Clipper. Originally hoped to cost as little as $2 billion in 2013, Europa Clipper's budget allocation has ballooned to $4.5 billion over the life of the program. Of that $4.5 billion, as little as $110M was dedicated to nine scientific instruments assigned to the spacecraft - a ratio of ~41:1. Even if instrument cost ballooned by 100% to ~$220 million, it would still be a measly 20:1. The space environment around Jupiter is admittedly one of the most challenging in the Solar System, warranting some imbalance, but either ratio is still exceptionally bad as far as most exploratory missions go. Designed to create detailed maps of Europa's theorized water oceans, ICEMAG, for example, jumped from a $30 million cost estimate to $45 million before NASA abruptly killed it. A Clipper planetary scientist called ICEMAG \"a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever\". MASPEX, meanwhile, is a mass spectrometer that will be used to analyze possible chemicals captured by flying through Europa's transient atmosphere. In other words, the instrument most likely to be hobbled next by NASA is also the only instrument on Europa Clipper capable of potentially detecting signs of life by directly sampling material ejected by Europa's plumes. Even just with ICEMAG removed, the value proposition of a $4.5 billion mission to an ocean moon of Jupiter becomes much hazier. With ICEMAG removed and MASPEX at risk of being thrown to the wolves, Europa Clipper's purpose becomes even weaker. Of course, seven valuable instruments remain - some of which partially overlap with MASPEX' goals - and MASPEX could still technically make it to the finish line in its original handicap-free state, but the tides are definitely not moving in an encouraging direction. The worst part is that excluding the extraordinarily expensive spacecraft that will host instruments worth ~3-5% its cost, Congress has been dead-set on forcing Europa Clipper to launch on NASA's chronically-delayed, over-budget Space Launch System rocket. SLS has yet to launch once despite more than a decade of development and almost $30 billion spent on the rocket alone, and it would take a miracle for an SLS rocket to be ready to launch Clipper before 2025 or 2026. Europa Clipper is working towards a launch no earlier than 2024, meaning that the spacecraft would have to be stored indefinitely at a cost of at least $125 million per year. Intrepid readers may note that the cost of simply waiting a single year for SLS to be ready for launch is higher than the cost of all of Europa Clipper's scientific instruments at their original $110 million budget. The actual cost to NASA for a single SLS launch is expected to $1.5 billion at the absolute minimum, while $2-2.5 billion is far more reasonable. With a little effort and some moderate cruise stage tweaks, Ars Technica has already reported that an expendable SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket augmented with an off-the-shelf kick stage could send Europa Clipper to Jupiter in 5-6 years, compared to ~3 with SLS. Ironically, that means that if Falcon Heavy was ready to launch Europa Clipper when the spacecraft is expected to be ready in 2024, it would actually arrive at the same time if it launched on SLS - once a minimum two-year launch vehicle delay is accounted for. A Falcon Heavy would also save NASA at least $1-2 billion, while it would directly save the Europa Clipper program the ~$250 million it would otherwise need to spend to store the spacecraft while waiting years for an SLS rocket. That $250 million alone - an inevitable add-on cost if SLS is chosen - could easily double the budget of every single Europa Clipper science instrument, adding plenty of breathing room, reinstating ICEMAG, and likely improving the science they output - data- gathering quite literally being the whole purpose of the mission. Of course, the odds that NASA actually steps out from under the political shadow of SLS and stops playing penny wise and pound foolish with the extraordinarily expensive science missions it shepherds is unlikely. But still, the possibility remains. Most recently, a very slight change in the wording of a proposed law could give the Europa Clipper program the legal wiggle room it needs to sidestep Congress' desire to force it to launch on SLS. Of course, the senators and representatives with parochial attachment to the rocket will continue to fight tooth and nail to legally force it upon NASA at every possible turn, but there is now at least a chance of a sane outcome.

While NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden deflected questions about the scope of this mission during a budget press conference yesterday, that hesitation seems to have lifted during a symposium held by the American Astronautical Society. NASA wants to explore Europa for less than a billion dollars, a budget that is smaller than nearly all other missions to the outer planets. Over the past few years, JPL and APL has been working on a reduced-cost Europa concept called the Europa Clipper, which would fly by Europa on the order of 50 times over a few years to map the surface and determine the properties of the assumed ocean and ice sheet. The Clipper had an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, less than half of the originally-conceived Europa Orbiter, which was around $4.7 billion. This would place the Clipper as a \"flagship\" mission, though on the low side for a flagship. Why is a billion dollars for a mission \"cheap\"? Mainly because Europa is a particularly difficult destination to explore. The moon orbits within Jupiter's extreme radiation field, which degrades and disrupts electrical equipment on spacecraft. To mitigate the radiation, spacecraft need to carry heavy shielding. This extra shielding adds weight; and weight adds cost. So does a long cruise out to Jupiter, which usually takes around six years, unless this mission launches on the SLS, which can reduce that to less than three. Plutonium, which the spacecraft would likely require for electrical power, also costs a decent amount of money to procure and launch due to the numerous safety reviews and permits. So we're already facing a decent amount of cost just to keep a spacecraft functioning in the Jovian environment. Only one mission has ever been sent to Jupiter with this price tag, Juno, which orbits Jupiter's poles and therefore avoids most of the nasty radiation. A Europa mission won't have that luxury. So where does this leave the science? I would be heartbroken to waste a to waste a once-in-a-generation opportunity to explore Europa by skimping on the science. There is so much to learn about this moon and its potential for habitability, that I feel it deserves a big investment if we want to see big returns. I'm looking to seeing the responses to this RFI.

At an Aug. 17 meeting of NASA's Planetary Science Advisory Committee, Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division, said the Europa Clipper mission had recently discovered compatibility issues involving the Space Launch System, the vehicle preferred by Congress to launch the spacecraft. \"There have been some issues that have been uncovered just recently,\" she said of the use of SLS for Europa Clipper. \"We are in a lot of conversations right now with human exploration and others within the agency about what kind of steps we can take going forward.\" She did not elaborate on the compatibility issues regarding SLS. Such issues, industry sources say, likely involve the environment the spacecraft would experience during launch, such as vibrations. That environment would be very different for Europa Clipper, a relatively small spacecraft encapsulated within a payload fairing, than for the Orion spacecraft that will be the payload for most SLS launches. \"We are currently working to identify and resolve potential hardware compatibility issues and will have more information once a full analysis has been conducted,\" NASA spokesperson Alana Johnson said in an Aug. 18 statement to SpaceNews. \"Preliminary analysis suggests that launching Clipper may require special hardware adjustments, depending on the launch vehicle.\" She said the mission was working with NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate \"to mature the launch vehicle analyses\" by the time of Clipper's critical design review, currently scheduled for December. How to launch Europa Clipper, a decision usually made by NASA for its science missions based on technical merits and cost, has been the subject of an unusually protracted and political debate. Other than the recent compatibility issues, SLS was long the preferred choice on a technical basis, since it allowed Clipper to fly a direct trajectory to Jupiter so that it arrived within three years of launch. Alternative vehicles, like United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, would instead require the use of gravity assist flybys to get to Jupiter, adding several years to the flight time. Congress has mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper, as well as a follow- on lander mission, including language to that effect in appropriations legislation for several years. NASA, though, has asked for relief from that requirement more recently on cost grounds. In the agency's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, NASA argued that the use of a commercial vehicle \"would save taxpayers over $1.5 billion compared to an SLS rocket.\" Another issue is the availability of the SLS. The first three SLS rockets are earmarked for the Artemis program, including the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission launching no earlier than late 2021, the Artemis 2 crewed test flight in early 2023, and the Artemis 3 lunar landing mission by the end of 2024. Thus, the earliest an SLS would be available for launching Europa Clipper would be 2025, even though the spacecraft itself will be ready to launch by 2024. Glaze noted that availability of an SLS before 2025 \"is not guaranteed\" given demand for the vehicle for the Artemis program. \"The launch vehicle remains very uncertain,\" she said. \"It is still a concern and an increasing concern.\" Europa Clipper has, for now, been keeping open both the option of launching on SLS as well as on a commercial alternative. Doing so, Glaze said, costs the mission about $30 million a year, but will increase if NASA doesn't finalize the launch vehicle by the time of December's critical design review. The House version of a fiscal year 2021 spending bill would give NASA some wiggle room. The bill continues to call for launching Europa Clipper on SLS, but only \"if available,\" a provision not included in appropriations bills in past years that required the use of SLS without exception. Despite the new language, one House appropriator continued to call for using SLS for Europa Clipper. \"NASA must increase the pace of SLS production to ensure an SLS is available for the Europa missions and other future science missions, in addition to meeting all the human exploration needs,\" said Rep. Robert Aderholt, ranking member of the commerce, justice and science appropriations subcommittee, during a July 8 markup of the bill.

NASA will be sending a future mission to study icy Europa, but in the meantime we can lose ourselves in some fresh versions of old images taken by the Galileo spacecraft in 1998. On Thursday, NASA released three newly reprocessed Galileo views highlighting the moon's \"chaos terrain,\" which looks like a cross between ice crystals and frenzied scratch marks. The space agency revisited the older imagery in preparation for sending the Europa Clipper mission for a visit. Clipper is expected to launch as early as 2023. These images aren't quite what we'd see if we visited Europa in person. NASA processed the images to enhance the color and make landscape features stand out. \"Areas that appear light blue or white are made of relatively pure water ice, and reddish areas have more non-ice materials, such as salts,\" the agency said. Scientists are curious about how Europa's relatively young surface formed. \" Areas of so-called chaos terrain contain blocks that have moved sideways, rotated or tilted before being refrozen into their new locations,\" said NASA. The Galileo mission ended in 2003 when the spacecraft dove into Jupiter's atmosphere. Europa Clipper will pick up where Galileo left off. It'll also look for signs that Europa could possibly be hosting some form of life. There may be more than chaos lurking in the moon's strange terrain.

This is the same amount of funding that was enacted for NASA's budget this year. This is just the beginning of the budget process, of course. The White House released its budget request back in February, and now the House and Senate will establish their priorities. Months of negotiations will ensue, compounded by the COVID-19 crisis and the 2020 presidential election. After the fiscal year 2020 budget ends in October, a continuing resolution is likely. The 2021 budget seems unlikely to be resolved before December. Still, the new document does tell us where Democrats and Republicans in the House think NASA funding should go. And there are a few important clues within worth discussing. One of the big questions in recent years has been how NASA will get its multi-billion-dollar Europa Clipper mission to Jupiter's moon. In the past, Congress has said this must go on NASA's Space Launch System rocket, but this came with downsides. For one, the SLS rocket likely will cost NASA at least $1.5 billion more than a commercial rocket. Also, because it takes so long to build the large rocket, it's unlikely an SLS would be available for the Clipper before 2026. Because the spacecraft may be ready to launch as early as 2024, and storing it would lead to increased costs, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has studied alternative launch vehicles. Among the most promising is a Falcon Heavy booster with a kick stage. In the House legislation, Congress says NASA \"shall use the Space Launch System, if available, as the launch vehicles for the Jupiter Europa missions,\" and plan for an orbiter launch no later than 2025. Because few people at NASA expect an SLS vehicle to be available in 2025, this is a pretty big deal. Advertisement It remains to be seen how the US Senate will act-the biggest proponent of the SLS rocket, Alabama's Richard Shelby, chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. In order to have any chance to make a 2024 landing on the Moon, NASA also needs to receive substantial funding soon for a Human Landing System. This is the most technologically challenging aspect of the Artemis Program to return to the Moon. NASA is currently working with three teams, led by Blue Origin, Dynetics, and SpaceX, on lander designs. Back in February, the White House asked for $3.37 billion in fiscal year 2021 to accelerate development of the lander. Democrats in the House have been skeptical of the 2024 launch date-some see it as political due to the timing of the next presidential election-and so have been slow to fund the lander. In its budget, the House appropriates $1.56 billion for \"Exploration Research and Development.\" This includes funding for the lander, Lunar Gateway, and other activities related to the Moon's surface, of which more than $600 million can be used for the lander. \"I want to thank the House Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee for the bipartisan support they have shown for NASA's Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said. \"The $628.2 million in funding for the human landing system is an important first step in this year's appropriations process. We still have more to do, and I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure America has the resources to land the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024.\" While this is far from the White House request, it seems like a better starting point than zero. And the budget for the lander probably will receive additional funding from the Senate later in the fiscal process.

How to launch Europa Clipper, a decision usually made by NASA for its science missions based on technical merits and cost, has been the subject of an unusually protracted and political debate. Other than the recent compatibility issues, SLS was long the preferred choice on a technical basis, since it allowed Clipper to fly a direct trajectory to Jupiter so that it arrived within three years of launch. Alternative vehicles, like United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, would instead require the use of gravity assist flybys to get to Jupiter, adding several years to the flight time. Congress has mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper, as well as a follow- on lander mission, including language to that effect in appropriations legislation for several years. NASA, though, has asked for relief from that requirement more recently on cost grounds. In the agency's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, NASA argued that the use of a commercial vehicle \"would save taxpayers over $1.5 billion compared to an SLS rocket.\" Another issue is the availability of the SLS. The first three SLS rockets are earmarked for the Artemis program, including the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission launching no earlier than late 2021, the Artemis 2 crewed test flight in early 2023, and the Artemis 3 lunar landing mission by the end of 2024. Thus, the earliest an SLS would be available for launching Europa Clipper would be 2025, even though the spacecraft itself will be ready to launch by 2024. Glaze noted that availability of an SLS before 2025 \"is not guaranteed\" given demand for the vehicle for the Artemis program. \"The launch vehicle remains very uncertain,\" she said. \"It is still a concern and an increasing concern.\" Europa Clipper has, for now, been keeping open both the option of launching on SLS as well as on a commercial alternative. Doing so, Glaze said, costs the mission about $30 million a year, but will increase if NASA doesn't finalize the launch vehicle by the time of December's critical design review. The House version of a fiscal year 2021 spending bill would give NASA some wiggle room. The bill continues to call for launching Europa Clipper on SLS, but only \"if available,\" a provision not included in appropriations bills in past years that required the use of SLS without exception. Despite the new language, one House appropriator continued to call for using SLS for Europa Clipper. \"NASA must increase the pace of SLS production to ensure an SLS is available for the Europa missions and other future science missions, in addition to meeting all the human exploration needs,\" said Rep.

For the second time, NASA has performed \"continuation/termination reviews\" of three of the Europa Clipper spacecraft's scientific instruments after budget overruns on the order of no more than a few tens of millions of dollars. Thankfully, no instruments were canceled, unlike the \"ICEMAG\" magnetometer that was functionally killed last year. Still, a NASA program scientist casually noted that the space agency would tolerate launching without one of two cameras and would offer no more funding to a mass spectrometer instrument, raising the risk of instrument failure during the challenging mission. For any scientific spacecraft or rover, the instruments carried along are effectively the entire reason for their existence: if those instruments are faulty, the mission is effectively rendered pointless. Further, due to the sheer complexity and challenges posed by the act of getting to the destination and surviving after arrival, the actual instruments most scientific spacecraft carry represent a tiny fraction of the overall mission cost and mass. It's not easy to readily imagine a better way to signal inept program management than by singularly focusing on that tiny, lifeblood-esque portion of a spacecraft's budget. Undeterred, that is exactly what NASA appears to be doing with Europa Clipper - penny-wise, perhaps, but undoubtedly pound-foolish. It's not always true that only a small portion of an exploratory spacecraft's budget is spent on scientific instruments but it absolutely is when it comes to Europa Clipper. Originally hoped to cost as little as $2 billion in 2013, Europa Clipper's budget allocation has ballooned to $4.5 billion over the life of the program. Of that $4.5 billion, as little as $110M was dedicated to nine scientific instruments assigned to the spacecraft - a ratio of ~41:1. Even if instrument cost ballooned by 100% to ~$220 million, it would still be a measly 20:1. The space environment around Jupiter is admittedly one of the most challenging in the Solar System, warranting some imbalance, but either ratio is still exceptionally bad as far as most exploratory missions go. Designed to create detailed maps of Europa's theorized water oceans, ICEMAG, for example, jumped from a $30 million cost estimate to $45 million before NASA abruptly killed it. A Clipper planetary scientist called ICEMAG \"a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever\". MASPEX, meanwhile, is a mass spectrometer that will be used to analyze possible chemicals captured by flying through Europa's transient atmosphere. In other words, the instrument most likely to be hobbled next by NASA is also the only instrument on Europa Clipper capable of potentially detecting signs of life by directly sampling material ejected by Europa's plumes. Even just with ICEMAG removed, the value proposition of a $4.5 billion mission to an ocean moon of Jupiter becomes much hazier. With ICEMAG removed and MASPEX at risk of being thrown to the wolves, Europa Clipper's purpose becomes even weaker. Of course, seven valuable instruments remain - some of which partially overlap with MASPEX' goals - and MASPEX could still technically make it to the finish line in its original handicap-free state, but the tides are definitely not moving in an encouraging direction. The worst part is that excluding the extraordinarily expensive spacecraft that will host instruments worth ~3-5% its cost, Congress has been dead-set on forcing Europa Clipper to launch on NASA's chronically-delayed, over-budget Space Launch System rocket. SLS has yet to launch once despite more than a decade of development and almost $30 billion spent on the rocket alone, and it would take a miracle for an SLS rocket to be ready to launch Clipper before 2025 or 2026. Europa Clipper is working towards a launch no earlier than 2024, meaning that the spacecraft would have to be stored indefinitely at a cost of at least $125 million per year. Intrepid readers may note that the cost of simply waiting a single year for SLS to be ready for launch is higher than the cost of all of Europa Clipper's scientific instruments at their original $110 million budget. The actual cost to NASA for a single SLS launch is expected to $1.5 billion at the absolute minimum, while $2-2.5 billion is far more reasonable. With a little effort and some moderate cruise stage tweaks, Ars Technica has already reported that an expendable SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket augmented with an off-the-shelf kick stage could send Europa Clipper to Jupiter in 5-6 years, compared to ~3 with SLS. Ironically, that means that if Falcon Heavy was ready to launch Europa Clipper when the spacecraft is expected to be ready in 2024, it would actually arrive at the same time if it launched on SLS - once a minimum two-year launch vehicle delay is accounted for. A Falcon Heavy would also save NASA at least $1-2 billion, while it would directly save the Europa Clipper program the ~$250 million it would otherwise need to spend to store the spacecraft while waiting years for an SLS rocket. That $250 million alone - an inevitable add-on cost if SLS is chosen - could easily double the budget of every single Europa Clipper science instrument, adding plenty of breathing room, reinstating ICEMAG, and likely improving the science they output - data- gathering quite literally being the whole purpose of the mission. Of course, the odds that NASA actually steps out from under the political shadow of SLS and stops playing penny wise and pound foolish with the extraordinarily expensive science missions it shepherds is unlikely. But still, the possibility remains. Most recently, a very slight change in the wording of a proposed law could give the Europa Clipper program the legal wiggle room it needs to sidestep Congress' desire to force it to launch on SLS. Of course, the senators and representatives with parochial attachment to the rocket will continue to fight tooth and nail to legally force it upon NASA at every possible turn, but there is now at least a chance of a sane outcome.

While NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden deflected questions about the scope of this mission during a budget press conference yesterday, that hesitation seems to have lifted during a symposium held by the American Astronautical Society. NASA wants to explore Europa for less than a billion dollars, a budget that is smaller than nearly all other missions to the outer planets. Over the past few years, JPL and APL has been working on a reduced-cost Europa concept called the Europa Clipper, which would fly by Europa on the order of 50 times over a few years to map the surface and determine the properties of the assumed ocean and ice sheet. The Clipper had an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, less than half of the originally-conceived Europa Orbiter, which was around $4.7 billion. This would place the Clipper as a \"flagship\" mission, though on the low side for a flagship. Why is a billion dollars for a mission \"cheap\"? Mainly because Europa is a particularly difficult destination to explore. The moon orbits within Jupiter's extreme radiation field, which degrades and disrupts electrical equipment on spacecraft. To mitigate the radiation, spacecraft need to carry heavy shielding. This extra shielding adds weight; and weight adds cost. So does a long cruise out to Jupiter, which usually takes around six years, unless this mission launches on the SLS, which can reduce that to less than three. Plutonium, which the spacecraft would likely require for electrical power, also costs a decent amount of money to procure and launch due to the numerous safety reviews and permits. So we're already facing a decent amount of cost just to keep a spacecraft functioning in the Jovian environment. Only one mission has ever been sent to Jupiter with this price tag, Juno, which orbits Jupiter's poles and therefore avoids most of the nasty radiation. A Europa mission won't have that luxury. So where does this leave the science? I would be heartbroken to waste a to waste a once-in-a-generation opportunity to explore Europa by skimping on the science. There is so much to learn about this moon and its potential for habitability, that I feel it deserves a big investment if we want to see big returns. I'm looking to seeing the responses to this RFI. Scientists and engineers are endlessly creative, and if we can find a way do the same science as outlined in the Decadal Survey and save some money, all the better. But we need to do Europa right.

For the second time, NASA has performed \"continuation/termination reviews\" of three of the Europa Clipper spacecraft's scientific instruments after budget overruns on the order of no more than a few tens of millions of dollars. Thankfully, no instruments were canceled, unlike the \"ICEMAG\" magnetometer that was functionally killed last year. Still, a NASA program scientist casually noted that the space agency would tolerate launching without one of two cameras and would offer no more funding to a mass spectrometer instrument, raising the risk of instrument failure during the challenging mission. For any scientific spacecraft or rover, the instruments carried along are effectively the entire reason for their existence: if those instruments are faulty, the mission is effectively rendered pointless. Further, due to the sheer complexity and challenges posed by the act of getting to the destination and surviving after arrival, the actual instruments most scientific spacecraft carry represent a tiny fraction of the overall mission cost and mass. It's not easy to readily imagine a better way to signal inept program management than by singularly focusing on that tiny, lifeblood-esque portion of a spacecraft's budget. Undeterred, that is exactly what NASA appears to be doing with Europa Clipper - penny-wise, perhaps, but undoubtedly pound-foolish. It's not always true that only a small portion of an exploratory spacecraft's budget is spent on scientific instruments but it absolutely is when it comes to Europa Clipper. Originally hoped to cost as little as $2 billion in 2013, Europa Clipper's budget allocation has ballooned to $4.5 billion over the life of the program. Of that $4.5 billion, as little as $110M was dedicated to nine scientific instruments assigned to the spacecraft - a ratio of ~41:1. Even if instrument cost ballooned by 100% to ~$220 million, it would still be a measly 20:1. The space environment around Jupiter is admittedly one of the most challenging in the Solar System, warranting some imbalance, but either ratio is still exceptionally bad as far as most exploratory missions go. Designed to create detailed maps of Europa's theorized water oceans, ICEMAG, for example, jumped from a $30 million cost estimate to $45 million before NASA abruptly killed it. A Clipper planetary scientist called ICEMAG \"a critical instrument that's been central to Europa science forever\". MASPEX, meanwhile, is a mass spectrometer that will be used to analyze possible chemicals captured by flying through Europa's transient atmosphere. In other words, the instrument most likely to be hobbled next by NASA is also the only instrument on Europa Clipper capable of potentially detecting signs of life by directly sampling material ejected by Europa's plumes. Even just with ICEMAG removed, the value proposition of a $4.5 billion mission to an ocean moon of Jupiter becomes much hazier. With ICEMAG removed and MASPEX at risk of being thrown to the wolves, Europa Clipper's purpose becomes even weaker. Of course, seven valuable instruments remain - some of which partially overlap with MASPEX' goals - and MASPEX could still technically make it to the finish line in its original handicap-free state, but the tides are definitely not moving in an encouraging direction. The worst part is that excluding the extraordinarily expensive spacecraft that will host instruments worth ~3-5% its cost, Congress has been dead-set on forcing Europa Clipper to launch on NASA's chronically-delayed, over-budget Space Launch System rocket. SLS has yet to launch once despite more than a decade of development and almost $30 billion spent on the rocket alone, and it would take a miracle for an SLS rocket to be ready to launch Clipper before 2025 or 2026. Europa Clipper is working towards a launch no earlier than 2024, meaning that the spacecraft would have to be stored indefinitely at a cost of at least $125 million per year. Intrepid readers may note that the cost of simply waiting a single year for SLS to be ready for launch is higher than the cost of all of Europa Clipper's scientific instruments at their original $110 million budget. The actual cost to NASA for a single SLS launch is expected to $1.5 billion at the absolute minimum, while $2-2.5 billion is far more reasonable. With a little effort and some moderate cruise stage tweaks, Ars Technica has already reported that an expendable SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket augmented with an off-the-shelf kick stage could send Europa Clipper to Jupiter in 5-6 years, compared to ~3 with SLS. Ironically, that means that if Falcon Heavy was ready to launch Europa Clipper when the spacecraft is expected to be ready in 2024, it would actually arrive at the same time if it launched on SLS - once a minimum two-year launch vehicle delay is accounted for. A Falcon Heavy would also save NASA at least $1-2 billion, while it would directly save the Europa Clipper program the ~$250 million it would otherwise need to spend to store the spacecraft while waiting years for an SLS rocket. That $250 million alone - an inevitable add-on cost if SLS is chosen - could easily double the budget of every single Europa Clipper science instrument, adding plenty of breathing room, reinstating ICEMAG, and likely improving the science they output - data- gathering quite literally being the whole purpose of the mission. Of course, the odds that NASA actually steps out from under the political shadow of SLS and stops playing penny wise and pound foolish with the extraordinarily expensive science missions it shepherds is unlikely. But still, the possibility remains. Most recently, a very slight change in the wording of a proposed law could give the Europa Clipper program the legal wiggle room it needs to sidestep Congress' desire to force it to launch on SLS. Of course, the senators and representatives with parochial attachment to the rocket will continue to fight tooth and nail to legally force it upon NASA at every possible turn, but there is now at least a chance of a sane outcome.

While NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden deflected questions about the scope of this mission during a budget press conference yesterday, that hesitation seems to have lifted during a symposium held by the American Astronautical Society. NASA wants to explore Europa for less than a billion dollars, a budget that is smaller than nearly all other missions to the outer planets. Over the past few years, JPL and APL has been working on a reduced-cost Europa concept called the Europa Clipper, which would fly by Europa on the order of 50 times over a few years to map the surface and determine the properties of the assumed ocean and ice sheet. The Clipper had an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, less than half of the originally-conceived Europa Orbiter, which was around $4.7 billion. This would place the Clipper as a \"flagship\" mission, though on the low side for a flagship. Why is a billion dollars for a mission \"cheap\"? Mainly because Europa is a particularly difficult destination to explore. The moon orbits within Jupiter's extreme radiation field, which degrades and disrupts electrical equipment on spacecraft. To mitigate the radiation, spacecraft need to carry heavy shielding. This extra shielding adds weight; and weight adds cost. So does a long cruise out to Jupiter, which usually takes around six years, unless this mission launches on the SLS, which can reduce that to less than three. Plutonium, which the spacecraft would likely require for electrical power, also costs a decent amount of money to procure and launch due to the numerous safety reviews and permits. So we're already facing a decent amount of cost just to keep a spacecraft functioning in the Jovian environment. Only one mission has ever been sent to Jupiter with this price tag, Juno, which orbits Jupiter's poles and therefore avoids most of the nasty radiation. A Europa mission won't have that luxury. So where does this leave the science? I would be heartbroken to waste a to waste a once-in-a-generation opportunity to explore Europa by skimping on the science. There is so much to learn about this moon and its potential for habitability, that I feel it deserves a big investment if we want to see big returns. I'm looking to seeing the responses to this RFI.

At an Aug. 17 meeting of NASA's Planetary Science Advisory Committee, Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division, said the Europa Clipper mission had recently discovered compatibility issues involving the Space Launch System, the vehicle preferred by Congress to launch the spacecraft. \"There have been some issues that have been uncovered just recently,\" she said of the use of SLS for Europa Clipper. \"We are in a lot of conversations right now with human exploration and others within the agency about what kind of steps we can take going forward.\" She did not elaborate on the compatibility issues regarding SLS. Such issues, industry sources say, likely involve the environment the spacecraft would experience during launch, such as vibrations. That environment would be very different for Europa Clipper, a relatively small spacecraft encapsulated within a payload fairing, than for the Orion spacecraft that will be the payload for most SLS launches. \"We are currently working to identify and resolve potential hardware compatibility issues and will have more information once a full analysis has been conducted,\" NASA spokesperson Alana Johnson said in an Aug. 18 statement to SpaceNews. \"Preliminary analysis suggests that launching Clipper may require special hardware adjustments, depending on the launch vehicle.\" She said the mission was working with NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate \"to mature the launch vehicle analyses\" by the time of Clipper's critical design review, currently scheduled for December. How to launch Europa Clipper, a decision usually made by NASA for its science missions based on technical merits and cost, has been the subject of an unusually protracted and political debate. Other than the recent compatibility issues, SLS was long the preferred choice on a technical basis, since it allowed Clipper to fly a direct trajectory to Jupiter so that it arrived within three years of launch. Alternative vehicles, like United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, would instead require the use of gravity assist flybys to get to Jupiter, adding several years to the flight time. Congress has mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper, as well as a follow- on lander mission, including language to that effect in appropriations legislation for several years. NASA, though, has asked for relief from that requirement more recently on cost grounds. In the agency's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, NASA argued that the use of a commercial vehicle \"would save taxpayers over $1.5 billion compared to an SLS rocket.\" Another issue is the availability of the SLS. The first three SLS rockets are earmarked for the Artemis program, including the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission launching no earlier than late 2021, the Artemis 2 crewed test flight in early 2023, and the Artemis 3 lunar landing mission by the end of 2024. Thus, the earliest an SLS would be available for launching Europa Clipper would be 2025, even though the spacecraft itself will be ready to launch by 2024. Glaze noted that availability of an SLS before 2025 \"is not guaranteed\" given demand for the vehicle for the Artemis program. \"The launch vehicle remains very uncertain,\" she said. \"It is still a concern and an increasing concern.\" Europa Clipper has, for now, been keeping open both the option of launching on SLS as well as on a commercial alternative. Doing so, Glaze said, costs the mission about $30 million a year, but will increase if NASA doesn't finalize the launch vehicle by the time of December's critical design review. The House version of a fiscal year 2021 spending bill would give NASA some wiggle room. The bill continues to call for launching Europa Clipper on SLS, but only \"if available,\" a provision not included in appropriations bills in past years that required the use of SLS without exception. Despite the new language, one House appropriator continued to call for using SLS for Europa Clipper. \"NASA must increase the pace of SLS production to ensure an SLS is available for the Europa missions and other future science missions, in addition to meeting all the human exploration needs,\" said Rep. Robert Aderholt, ranking member of the commerce, justice and science appropriations subcommittee, during a July 8 markup of the bill.

Clipper will assess the habitability of that buried ocean and perform a number of other tasks, including scouting out promising sites for a future life-hunting lander mission. Congress has long mandated that Clipper launch atop the Space Launch System, the giant rocket that NASA is developing to send astronauts toward the moon and other distant destinations. But SLS has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and the megarocket isn't slated to debut until late 2021. That initial mission will launch NASA's Orion capsule on an uncrewed flight around the moon for the space agency's Artemis program of lunar exploration. SLS and Orion are key elements of Artemis, which seeks to land two astronauts near the moon's south pole in 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by the end of the decade. Given the commitment to Artemis and the relatively slow pace of SLS development, the rocket's availability for an on-time Europa Clipper launch is in serious doubt, NASA's Office of Inspector General concluded last year. This concern has apparently bubbled up into the U.S. House of Representatives. The House's proposed 2021 NASA budget, which was released in July, directs the agency to launch Clipper by 2025 and the Europa lander by 2027. The proposal dictates that SLS be used for both missions \"if available.\" That wording leaves the door open for a commercial alternative - perhaps SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, the operational rocket that comes closest to SLS' power. The Europa Clipper team has been planning for both launch contingencies. But the mission cannot stay in this limbo for much longer, team members said. \"We really need a decision by the end of this calendar year in order to continue to mature the spacecraft development,\" Europa Clipper project manager Jan Chodas, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said on Wednesday during the fall meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group. The mission team is already working toward a big milestone at the end of the year: Clipper's critical design review, the final vetting hurdle to clear before full-scale manufacturing begins, will be held in December. The CDR \"was originally planned to be earlier, but, because of the launch- vehicle uncertainty, we've delayed it until the end of the year,\" Chodas said. The roughly $3 billion Europa Clipper mission has been dealing with other complications as well. Costs have ballooned on several science instruments, for example. And the coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact, the extent of which is still being assessed, Chodas said. The team is aiming to have Clipper launch-ready in early 2024. Liftoff will occur in summer or fall of that year, if all goes according to plan. Clipper will eventually settle into orbit around Jupiter. The probe will study Europa in depth during a series of roughly 50 flybys, which will take place over nearly four Earth years. Clipper will use nine science instruments to characterize Europa's ocean, measure the thickness of the moon's ice shell and hunt for plumes of water vapor wafting from the surface, among other tasks. The probe will also look for good touchdown sites for the Europa lander, which is still a concept mission, not an official NASA project.

In a Nov. 30 letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, discussed issues his office had with a series of fiscal year 2021 spending bills Shelby's committee released Nov. 10. Those bills were intended to serve as the starting point in negotiations with the House, which passed its version of those bills in the summer. Those Senate bills included a commerce, justice and science spending bill that provides NASA with $23.5 billion in 2021. The bill included language found in previous years' bills, but not the House version for 2021, that NASA \"shall use the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle for the Jupiter Europa Clipper mission.\" \"The Administration is disappointed that the bill would require NASA to use the Space Launch System rocket to launch the Europa Clipper mission,\" Vought wrote in his letter to Shelby. \"This would increase costs for the Clipper mission and deprive the lunar exploration effort of a rocket NASA needs for human exploration of the Moon.\" In the last few years, NASA has sought launching Europa Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle, like the Falcon Heavy, rather than the SLS. The agency argued that it needed initial SLS vehicles for its Artemis lunar exploration program, and that using a commercial alternative could save up to $1.5 billion. The House provided some relief to NASA in its spending bill in July. \"The Committee believes that the Clipper mission should use a vehicle to support a launch to reduce overall mission costs and complexity and expedite science results in concert with the decadal survey,\" House appropriators stated in a report accompanying their spending bill. Senate appropriators didn't explain why they retained the SLS language in their bill. They took an unorthodox approach to the fiscal year 2021 spending bills, holding no subcommittee or full committee markups of legislation, instead releasing drafts more than a month after the 2021 fiscal year started Oct. 1. From a technical standpoint, SLS has long been the preferred choice for Europa Clipper, since it allows the spacecraft to fly to Jupiter on a direct trajectory, arriving less than three years after launch. Alternative vehicles would instead rely on gravity assist flybys to get Europa Clipper, adding years to the travel time. However, agency officials said in August they were studying \"potential hardware compatibility issues\" between the Europa Clipper spacecraft and the SLS. NASA did not elaborate on those problems, but said that \"special hardware adjustments\" may be needed to address them. Potential changes to the Artemis program could address one problem about using SLS for launching Europa Clipper. While the incoming Biden administration has not talked about space policy, campaign statements such as the Democratic Party platform released this summer suggest it may at least slow the pace of returning humans to the moon, eliminating the 2024 goal established by the Trump administration. That could free up an SLS vehicle for a Europa Clipper launch in 2024, the mission's current launch readiness date. House and Senate appropriators are in negotiations on a final set of 2021 spending bills. The federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires Dec. 11. Whatever language in in that final bill could mark the end of a years-long debate on how to launch Europa Clipper. Project officials said this summer that they want to make a final decision on the launch vehicle by the time of the mission's critical design review, scheduled for December. Postponing that decision would increase the mission's costs as they continue to support analyses for both SLS and a commercial alternative. The OMB letter criticizes other aspects of the Senate legislation regarding NASA, including the $1 billion provided for the Human Landing System program, far short of the $3.2 billion requested to keep a 2024 landing on schedule. The letter also noted the \"under-funding\" of NASA's low Earth orbit commercialization efforts, which received only $15 million in the Senate bill versus the $150 million in the agency's request. That reduced funding, the letter warned, \"risks leaving the Nation without a presence in LEO when the International Space Station is eventually retired.\" However, OMB praised the Senate for providing $11.8 million for the Office of Space Commerce within the Department of Commerce. The administration sought $15 million for the office in its 2021 request, far above the $2.3 million it received in 2020, in order to implement Space Policy Directive 3 regarding space traffic management. The House did provide any additional money for the office, stating that it was waiting for a report by the National Academy of Public Administration on which agency should lead civil space traffic management work. That report, released in August, endorsed the Commerce Department as the lead agency for that activity. \"The Administration looks forward to continued engagement with the Congress as these efforts progress and it continues to urge the Congress to support the transfer of the Office of Space Commerce from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Office of the Secretary,\" the OMB letter stated.

Liftoff will occur in summer or fall of that year, if all goes according to plan. Clipper will eventually settle into orbit around Jupiter. The probe will study Europa in depth during a series of roughly 50 flybys, which will take place over nearly four Earth years. Clipper will use nine science instruments to characterize Europa's ocean, measure the thickness of the moon's ice shell and hunt for plumes of water vapor wafting from the surface, among other tasks. The probe will also look for good touchdown sites for the Europa lander, which is still a concept mission, not an official NASA project.

The launch vehicle would have to be able to launch the spacecraft, weighing at least 6,065 kilograms, on a trajectory that would incorporate gravity-assist flybys of Mars and Earth before arriving at Jupiter. The launch would take place during a three-week window in October 2024. At a July 2020 briefing to a National Academies committee, Europa Clipper project officials presented a proposal for once such trajectory. A launch in October 2024 would be followed by flybys of Mars in February 2025 and of Earth in December 2026, with the spacecraft entering orbit around Jupiter in April 2030. NASA's Launch Services Program, the briefing stated, had determined that trajectory using a \"commercial option\" for a launch vehicle was feasible. The SLS had been the preferred vehicle for the Europa Clipper mission because it could get the spacecraft to Jupiter much more quickly. The same briefing described a launch window in August 2024 that, using SLS, would get the spacecraft to Jupiter in no more than three years, without the need for flybys. NASA, in recent budget proposals, sought to launch Europa Clipper on a commercial vehicle rather than SLS. It argued that doing so would save the agency as much as $1.5 billion and free up SLS vehicles for use in the Artemis program of human lunar exploration. Congress, though, mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper in appropriations bills through fiscal year 2020. Another factor in the launch vehicle debate emerged in August, when NASA disclosed it was investigating \"potential hardware compatibility issues\" between SLS and Europa Clipper. The agency didn't elaborate on the specific issues, believed to be associated with vibrations and other environmental factors the spacecraft would experience during launch. Congress, in the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill passed last month, gave NASA some flexibility regarding the launch of Europa Clipper. The bill again directed the use of SLS for the mission, but only if \"the SLS is available and if torsional loading analysis has confirmed Clipper's appropriateness for SLS.\" The latter condition refers to the hardware compatibility issues previously reported by NASA. The most likely commercial option for launching Europa Clipper is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy. United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy, an earlier option, is no longer available since the remaining vehicles have all been assigned to national security launches. ULA plans to retire the vehicle by the middle of the decade as it transitions to the Vulcan Centaur. Both Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's New Glenn could be alternatives, but neither vehicle has made its first flight. The request for information states that the vehicle for Europa Clipper must meet NASA's Category 3 requirements for launch services, which requires a vehicle have at least three successful launches, including at least two consecutive successful launches. Falcon Heavy has flown three times so far, all successfully. The appropriations bill that gave NASA the option to consider alternatives to SLS did direct the agency to conduct a \"full and open competition\" for launch services if it chose not to use SLS, including allowing vehicles that are not currently on its NASA Launch Services 2 contract. Responses to the request for information are due to NASA by Feb. 8.

The Europa Clipper probe is scheduled to launch in 2024 to study the Jovian satellite, which harbors a huge sea of liquid water beneath its icy shell. Clipper will assess the habitability of that buried ocean and perform a number of other tasks, including scouting out promising sites for a future life-hunting lander mission. Congress has long mandated that Clipper launch atop the Space Launch System, the giant rocket that NASA is developing to send astronauts toward the moon and other distant destinations. But SLS has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and the megarocket isn't slated to debut until late 2021. That initial mission will launch NASA's Orion capsule on an uncrewed flight around the moon for the space agency's Artemis program of lunar exploration. SLS and Orion are key elements of Artemis, which seeks to land two astronauts near the moon's south pole in 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on and around Earth's nearest neighbor by the end of the decade. Given the commitment to Artemis and the relatively slow pace of SLS development, the rocket's availability for an on-time Europa Clipper launch is in serious doubt, NASA's Office of Inspector General concluded last year. This concern has apparently bubbled up into the U.S. House of Representatives. The House's proposed 2021 NASA budget, which was released in July, directs the agency to launch Clipper by 2025 and the Europa lander by 2027. The proposal dictates that SLS be used for both missions \"if available.\" That wording leaves the door open for a commercial alternative - perhaps SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, the operational rocket that comes closest to SLS' power. The Europa Clipper team has been planning for both launch contingencies. But the mission cannot stay in this limbo for much longer, team members said. \"We really need a decision by the end of this calendar year in order to continue to mature the spacecraft development,\" Europa Clipper project manager Jan Chodas, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said on Wednesday during the fall meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group. The mission team is already working toward a big milestone at the end of the year: Clipper's critical design review, the final vetting hurdle to clear before full-scale manufacturing begins, will be held in December. The CDR \"was originally planned to be earlier, but, because of the launch- vehicle uncertainty, we've delayed it until the end of the year,\" Chodas said.

The agency announced last week that it will issue, around the beginning of March, a formal request for proposals for launching the mission in October 2024. Congress had for years dictated that the mission launch on the Space Launch System, ensuring a speedy transit to Jupiter. NASA had objected, arguing it needed those SLS vehicles for the Artemis program and that a commercial launch option could save the agency as much as $1.5 billion. Congress relented in a spending bill passed in December after engineering analyses found potential issues with the vibrational environment the spacecraft will be exposed to during launch. That opens the door to using SpaceX's existing Falcon Heavy, or potentially Blue Origin's New Glenn and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur vehicles yet to make their first launch. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. That is just the latest twist in what has been a convoluted development of Europa Clipper, one where scientific and political advocacy faced off against budgets and institutional inertia. The Mission, a new book by David Brown, tells the story of the battle to get Europa Clipper started, one involving an alliance of scientists, engineers, politicians, and agency insiders. Concepts for missions to Europa date back to the 1990s, as data from the Galileo mission orbiting Jupiter showed that the icy moon has a subsurface ocean of liquid water that, along with a source of energy and organic compounds, gave it the necessary ingredients to support life. Some of those early concepts, though, foundered on technical issues, like the intense radiation environment around Europa, as well as budgets and competing priorities, notably Mars. However, a small group kept the door on a Europa mission from closing entirely, securing an endorsement in a planetary science decadal survey in 2001 and a trickle of funding for studies until it could develop a stronger base of support, particularly from then-Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who pushed for funding for the mission over the objections of the White House and NASA. Culberson is just one of the characters in The Mission. Others include planetary scientists Bob Pappalardo and Louise Prockter, who were early advocates for a mission to Europa; Curt Niebur, who worked from NASA Headquarters to keep a Europa mission alive; and Karla Clark, an engineer at JPL involved with many of the early Europa mission design studies. Their efforts, and their life stories, are weaved into the book along with many other supporting players. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. Brown dives in and out of the story of the mission itself, with frequent and often lengthy digressions to tell the backstories of the people involved, or to go on any number of tangents related to policy, technology, or even the formation of the solar system. It can be like an engaging conversation that flows and meanders, but sometimes leaves you wondering just how this all fits into the mission itself. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion. That tone is evident in the book's cover-spanning subtitle: \"Or, How a Disciple of Carl Sagan, an Ex-Motocross Racer, a Texas Tea Party Congressman, the World's Worst Typewriter Saleswoman, California Mountain People, and an Anonymous NASA Functionary Went to War with Mars, Survived an Insurgency at Saturn, Traded Blows with Washington, and Stole a Ride on an Alabama Moon Rocket to Send a Space Robot to Jupiter in Search of the Second Garden of Eden at the Bottom of an Alien Ocean Inside of an Ice World Called Europa.\" Whew. At times Brown can be very informal; it may take the reader time to realize that when he refers to the \"mountain people of Saint Gabe,\" he's referring to employees at JPL, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Yet other times he stretches to be erudite: in a passage about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, he describes the world as \"though Gaspard Marsy himself had carved the white marble moon with hammer and chisel.\" An endnote two pages long explains Marsy was a sculptor who created a statue of Enceladus in the garden of Versailles, and told the story of that Greek mythological figure. The book ends long before the present day, when Europa Clipper became a formal project in 2015, its future seemingly secured. That means we miss the ups and downs of the last several years, including the departure of Culberson as the mission's patron, problems with instruments that led to the replacement of a magnetometer and changes to others, and cost growth. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion: not so absurd after all. Despite these problems, Europa Clipper perseveres, and is on track for a launch in 2024 that will allow the spacecraft to arrive in 2030. The Mission helps explains why the mission is so compelling, but also so difficult to get started.

Nasa is sending a spacecraft to the icy world of Europa, which holds an ocean under its frozen outer shell. Scientists have long regarded the moon as one of the most promising targets in the search for life elsewhere in our Solar System. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will now launch to the jovian moon in October 2024, arriving in April 2030. The spacecraft was to have launched on Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But the space agency is reported to no longer be considering that launch vehicle. It will instead lift off on a commercial rocket. The details were disclosed by the mission's project scientist, Dr Robert Pappalardo, during a virtual meeting of Nasa's Outer Planets Assessment Group (Opag). \"We now have clarity on the launch vehicle path and launch date,\" Dr Pappalardo, who is based at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told the meeting. Interest in the moon as a potential habitat for extra-terrestrial life was given a boost in the 1990s, when Nasa's Galileo spacecraft provided evidence that Europa harboured an ocean of liquid water beneath its outer shell. Europa probably has a rocky core surrounded by around 80km (50 miles) of liquid water covered by a shell of water-ice that's roughly 20km (12 miles) thick. \"Europa's about the size of Earth's moon, yet we think it contains twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans,\" Dr Pappalardo said during a virtual talk organised by Arizona State University (ASU) last week. Discussing the moon's potential for life, he said: \"At the bottom of the Earth's oceans are places where water and rock interact, where water seeps down, contacts hot rock and emerges charged with chemical nutrients - reductants.\" When these reductants get together with other chemicals called oxidants, they react, he explained. Dr Pappalardo said these reactions could, \"potentially power life at the ocean floor of Europa - even where there is no light to allow for photosynthesis\". The spacecraft will be able to analyse chemicals in frozen water that has welled up to the surface from beneath the ice shell. It might also be able to sample the contents of water plumes that seem to be spurting out into space from locations on the jovian moon.

The launch vehicle would have to be able to launch the spacecraft, weighing at least 6,065 kilograms, on a trajectory that would incorporate gravity-assist flybys of Mars and Earth before arriving at Jupiter. The launch would take place during a three-week window in October 2024. At a July 2020 briefing to a National Academies committee, Europa Clipper project officials presented a proposal for once such trajectory. A launch in October 2024 would be followed by flybys of Mars in February 2025 and of Earth in December 2026, with the spacecraft entering orbit around Jupiter in April 2030. NASA's Launch Services Program, the briefing stated, had determined that trajectory using a \"commercial option\" for a launch vehicle was feasible. The SLS had been the preferred vehicle for the Europa Clipper mission because it could get the spacecraft to Jupiter much more quickly. The same briefing described a launch window in August 2024 that, using SLS, would get the spacecraft to Jupiter in no more than three years, without the need for flybys. NASA, in recent budget proposals, sought to launch Europa Clipper on a commercial vehicle rather than SLS. It argued that doing so would save the agency as much as $1.5 billion and free up SLS vehicles for use in the Artemis program of human lunar exploration. Congress, though, mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper in appropriations bills through fiscal year 2020. Another factor in the launch vehicle debate emerged in August, when NASA disclosed it was investigating \"potential hardware compatibility issues\" between SLS and Europa Clipper. The agency didn't elaborate on the specific issues, believed to be associated with vibrations and other environmental factors the spacecraft would experience during launch. Congress, in the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill passed last month, gave NASA some flexibility regarding the launch of Europa Clipper.

The most likely commercial option for launching Europa Clipper is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy. United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy, an earlier option, is no longer available since the remaining vehicles have all been assigned to national security launches. ULA plans to retire the vehicle by the middle of the decade as it transitions to the Vulcan Centaur. Both Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's New Glenn could be alternatives, but neither vehicle has made its first flight. The request for information states that the vehicle for Europa Clipper must meet NASA's Category 3 requirements for launch services, which requires a vehicle have at least three successful launches, including at least two consecutive successful launches. Falcon Heavy has flown three times so far, all successfully. The appropriations bill that gave NASA the option to consider alternatives to SLS did direct the agency to conduct a \"full and open competition\" for launch services if it chose not to use SLS, including allowing vehicles that are not currently on its NASA Launch Services 2 contract.

The Mission, a new book by David Brown, tells the story of the battle to get Europa Clipper started, one involving an alliance of scientists, engineers, politicians, and agency insiders. Concepts for missions to Europa date back to the 1990s, as data from the Galileo mission orbiting Jupiter showed that the icy moon has a subsurface ocean of liquid water that, along with a source of energy and organic compounds, gave it the necessary ingredients to support life. Some of those early concepts, though, foundered on technical issues, like the intense radiation environment around Europa, as well as budgets and competing priorities, notably Mars.

Nasa is sending a spacecraft to the icy world of Europa, which holds an ocean under its frozen outer shell. Scientists have long regarded the moon as one of the most promising targets in the search for life elsewhere in our Solar System. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will now launch to the jovian moon in October 2024, arriving in April 2030. The spacecraft was to have launched on Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But the space agency is reported to no longer be considering that launch vehicle. It will instead lift off on a commercial rocket. The details were disclosed by the mission's project scientist, Dr Robert Pappalardo, during a virtual meeting of Nasa's Outer Planets Assessment Group (Opag). \"We now have clarity on the launch vehicle path and launch date,\" Dr Pappalardo, who is based at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told the meeting. Interest in the moon as a potential habitat for extra-terrestrial life was given a boost in the 1990s, when Nasa's Galileo spacecraft provided evidence that Europa harboured an ocean of liquid water beneath its outer shell. Europa probably has a rocky core surrounded by around 80km (50 miles) of liquid water covered by a shell of water-ice that's roughly 20km (12 miles) thick. \"Europa's about the size of Earth's moon, yet we think it contains twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans,\" Dr Pappalardo said during a virtual talk organised by Arizona State University (ASU) last week. Discussing the moon's potential for life, he said: \"At the bottom of the Earth's oceans are places where water and rock interact, where water seeps down, contacts hot rock and emerges charged with chemical nutrients - reductants.\" When these reductants get together with other chemicals called oxidants, they react, he explained. Dr Pappalardo said these reactions could, \"potentially power life at the ocean floor of Europa - even where there is no light to allow for photosynthesis\".

In a Nov. 30 letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, discussed issues his office had with a series of fiscal year 2021 spending bills Shelby's committee released Nov. 10. Those bills were intended to serve as the starting point in negotiations with the House, which passed its version of those bills in the summer. Those Senate bills included a commerce, justice and science spending bill that provides NASA with $23.5 billion in 2021. The bill included language found in previous years' bills, but not the House version for 2021, that NASA \"shall use the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle for the Jupiter Europa Clipper mission.\" \"The Administration is disappointed that the bill would require NASA to use the Space Launch System rocket to launch the Europa Clipper mission,\" Vought wrote in his letter to Shelby. \"This would increase costs for the Clipper mission and deprive the lunar exploration effort of a rocket NASA needs for human exploration of the Moon.\" In the last few years, NASA has sought launching Europa Clipper on a commercial launch vehicle, like the Falcon Heavy, rather than the SLS. The agency argued that it needed initial SLS vehicles for its Artemis lunar exploration program, and that using a commercial alternative could save up to $1.5 billion. The House provided some relief to NASA in its spending bill in July. \"The Committee believes that the Clipper mission should use a vehicle to support a launch to reduce overall mission costs and complexity and expedite science results in concert with the decadal survey,\" House appropriators stated in a report accompanying their spending bill. Senate appropriators didn't explain why they retained the SLS language in their bill. They took an unorthodox approach to the fiscal year 2021 spending bills, holding no subcommittee or full committee markups of legislation, instead releasing drafts more than a month after the 2021 fiscal year started Oct. 1. From a technical standpoint, SLS has long been the preferred choice for Europa Clipper, since it allows the spacecraft to fly to Jupiter on a direct trajectory, arriving less than three years after launch. Alternative vehicles would instead rely on gravity assist flybys to get Europa Clipper, adding years to the travel time. However, agency officials said in August they were studying \"potential hardware compatibility issues\" between the Europa Clipper spacecraft and the SLS. NASA did not elaborate on those problems, but said that \"special hardware adjustments\" may be needed to address them. Potential changes to the Artemis program could address one problem about using SLS for launching Europa Clipper. While the incoming Biden administration has not talked about space policy, campaign statements such as the Democratic Party platform released this summer suggest it may at least slow the pace of returning humans to the moon, eliminating the 2024 goal established by the Trump administration. That could free up an SLS vehicle for a Europa Clipper launch in 2024, the mission's current launch readiness date. House and Senate appropriators are in negotiations on a final set of 2021 spending bills. The federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires Dec. 11.

During the review, experts examined the detailed design of the spacecraft to ensure that it is ready to complete construction. The mission is now able to complete hardware fabrication and testing, and move toward the assembly and testing of the spacecraft and its payload of sophisticated science instruments. With an internal global ocean twice the size of Earth's oceans combined, Jupiter's moon Europa carries the potential for conditions suitable for life. But the frigid temperatures and the nonstop pummeling of the surface from Jupiter's radiation make it a tricky target to explore: Mission engineers and scientists must design a spacecraft hardy enough to withstand the radiation yet sensitive enough to gather the science needed to investigate Europa's environment. The Europa Clipper orbiter will swoop around Jupiter on an elliptical path, dipping close to the moon on each flyby to conduct detailed reconnaissance. The science includes gathering measurements of the internal ocean, mapping the surface composition and its geology, and hunting for plumes of water vapor that may be venting from the icy crust. Development of the spacecraft is progressing well, based on the intense examination NASA recently completed. The Critical Design Review conducted a deep dive into the specifics of the plans for all of the science instruments - from cameras to antennas - and flight subsystems, including propulsion, power, avionics, and the flight computer. \"We showed that our project system design is strong,\" said Europa Clipper Project Manager Jan Chodas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Our plans for completing the development and integration of the individual pieces hold together, and the system as a whole will function as designed to gather the science measurements we need to explore the potential habitability of Europa.\" Beyond detailed plans, the mission has built prototypes and engineering models to test how well the instruments and engineering subsystems will work. Then there's the flight hardware itself. Much of it is already being built; individual engineering subsystems and instruments cleared their own design reviews over the last year and a half. The most striking of Europa Clipper's features, its signature elements, are taking shape. Nearly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, the disc-shaped high-gain antenna, which will receive commands from Earth and transmit science data back down, is in its final stage of assembly. And by far the most visible of Europa Clipper's hardware - the massive solar arrays that will unfurl in deep space like wings - are under construction as well. The spacecraft, with its arrays fully deployed, is wider than a basketball court is long, spanning 100 feet (30.5 meters). The arrays will cover over 960 square feet (90 square meters). They will be attached to the propulsion module being built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. The propulsion module core consists of two stacked cylinders that together stand almost 10 feet (3 meters) high and hold the propulsion tanks and 16 rocket engines that will propel Europa Clipper once it leaves Earth's atmosphere. The giant cylinders embody the cooperative effort needed to put a spacecraft like this together. They were built by APL and shipped to JPL for installation of the Heat Redistribution System tubing, part of a system that will keep the spacecraft thermally controlled. The cylinders were then sent to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for installation of the propulsion subsystem. There are 400 welded connections, each of them X-rayed for quality control, which are key to successfully installing the propulsion subsystem.

Also being built is ground support equipment that will be used to assemble and test Europa Clipper's large pieces of flight hardware. \"It's a very exciting time for the team, seeing the fruits of their work that will be orbiting Jupiter in a few years,\" said Europa Clipper Deputy Project Manager Jordan Evans of JPL. \"Even in the face of COVID-19, the team is firing on all cylinders. Using safe-at-work protocols, they're performing the necessary work on the hardware while the rest of the team is getting their job done at home.\" As this work moves forward, project leaders continue to plan the science of the mission. The spacecraft's science instruments will measure the depth of the ice crust, measure the depth of the internal ocean and how thick and salty it is, capture color images of surface geology in detail, and analyze potential plumes. Scientists are especially interested in what makes up the moon's surface. Evidence suggests that material exposed there has been mixed through the icy crust and perhaps comes from the ocean beneath. Europa Clipper will also investigate the moon's gravity field, which will tell scientists more about both how the moon flexes as Jupiter pulls on it and how that action could potentially warm the internal ocean. \"We're doing work that a decade from now will change how we think about the diversity of worlds in the outer solar system - and about where life might be able to exist right now, not in the distant past,\" said Europa Clipper Project Scientist Robert Pappalardo of JPL. But the more instruments a spacecraft carries, the more they interact and potentially affect each other's operation. To that end, noted Pappalardo, \"We're currently making sure the instruments can all operate at the same time without electromagnetic interference.\" The full suite of instruments will undergo extensive testing after they arrive at JPL in 2021. Early 2022 marks the start of assembly, test, and launch operations.

During the review, experts examined the detailed design of the spacecraft to ensure that it is ready to complete construction. The mission is now able to complete hardware fabrication and testing, and move toward the assembly and testing of the spacecraft and its payload of sophisticated science instruments. With an internal global ocean twice the size of Earth's oceans combined, Jupiter's moon Europa carries the potential for conditions suitable for life. But the frigid temperatures and the nonstop pummeling of the surface from Jupiter's radiation make it a tricky target to explore: Mission engineers and scientists must design a spacecraft hardy enough to withstand the radiation yet sensitive enough to gather the science needed to investigate Europa's environment. The Europa Clipper orbiter will swoop around Jupiter on an elliptical path, dipping close to the moon on each flyby to conduct detailed reconnaissance. The science includes gathering measurements of the internal ocean, mapping the surface composition and its geology, and hunting for plumes of water vapor that may be venting from the icy crust. Development of the spacecraft is progressing well, based on the intense examination NASA recently completed. The Critical Design Review conducted a deep dive into the specifics of the plans for all of the science instruments - from cameras to antennas - and flight subsystems, including propulsion, power, avionics, and the flight computer. \"We showed that our project system design is strong,\" said Europa Clipper Project Manager Jan Chodas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Our plans for completing the development and integration of the individual pieces hold together, and the system as a whole will function as designed to gather the science measurements we need to explore the potential habitability of Europa.\" Beyond detailed plans, the mission has built prototypes and engineering models to test how well the instruments and engineering subsystems will work. Then there's the flight hardware itself. Much of it is already being built; individual engineering subsystems and instruments cleared their own design reviews over the last year and a half. The most striking of Europa Clipper's features, its signature elements, are taking shape. Nearly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, the disc-shaped high-gain antenna, which will receive commands from Earth and transmit science data back down, is in its final stage of assembly. And by far the most visible of Europa Clipper's hardware - the massive solar arrays that will unfurl in deep space like wings - are under construction as well. The spacecraft, with its arrays fully deployed, is wider than a basketball court is long, spanning 100 feet (30.5 meters). The arrays will cover over 960 square feet (90 square meters). They will be attached to the propulsion module being built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. The propulsion module core consists of two stacked cylinders that together stand almost 10 feet (3 meters) high and hold the propulsion tanks and 16 rocket engines that will propel Europa Clipper once it leaves Earth's atmosphere. The giant cylinders embody the cooperative effort needed to put a spacecraft like this together. They were built by APL and shipped to JPL for installation of the Heat Redistribution System tubing, part of a system that will keep the spacecraft thermally controlled.

The Jan. 26 request for information seeks data from companies that believe they have vehicles that can launch the mission, which will go into orbit around Jupiter and make dozens of close approaches to Europa, an icy, potentially habitable moon. The launch vehicle would have to be able to launch the spacecraft, weighing at least 6,065 kilograms, on a trajectory that would incorporate gravity-assist flybys of Mars and Earth before arriving at Jupiter. The launch would take place during a three-week window in October 2024. At a July 2020 briefing to a National Academies committee, Europa Clipper project officials presented a proposal for once such trajectory. A launch in October 2024 would be followed by flybys of Mars in February 2025 and of Earth in December 2026, with the spacecraft entering orbit around Jupiter in April 2030. NASA's Launch Services Program, the briefing stated, had determined that trajectory using a \"commercial option\" for a launch vehicle was feasible. The SLS had been the preferred vehicle for the Europa Clipper mission because it could get the spacecraft to Jupiter much more quickly. The same briefing described a launch window in August 2024 that, using SLS, would get the spacecraft to Jupiter in no more than three years, without the need for flybys. NASA, in recent budget proposals, sought to launch Europa Clipper on a commercial vehicle rather than SLS. It argued that doing so would save the agency as much as $1.5 billion and free up SLS vehicles for use in the Artemis program of human lunar exploration. Congress, though, mandated the use of SLS for Europa Clipper in appropriations bills through fiscal year 2020. Another factor in the launch vehicle debate emerged in August, when NASA disclosed it was investigating \"potential hardware compatibility issues\" between SLS and Europa Clipper. The agency didn't elaborate on the specific issues, believed to be associated with vibrations and other environmental factors the spacecraft would experience during launch. Congress, in the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill passed last month, gave NASA some flexibility regarding the launch of Europa Clipper. The bill again directed the use of SLS for the mission, but only if \"the SLS is available and if torsional loading analysis has confirmed Clipper's appropriateness for SLS.\" The latter condition refers to the hardware compatibility issues previously reported by NASA. The most likely commercial option for launching Europa Clipper is SpaceX's Falcon Heavy. United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy, an earlier option, is no longer available since the remaining vehicles have all been assigned to national security launches. ULA plans to retire the vehicle by the middle of the decade as it transitions to the Vulcan Centaur. Both Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's New Glenn could be alternatives, but neither vehicle has made its first flight. The request for information states that the vehicle for Europa Clipper must meet NASA's Category 3 requirements for launch services, which requires a vehicle have at least three successful launches, including at least two consecutive successful launches. Falcon Heavy has flown three times so far, all successfully. The appropriations bill that gave NASA the option to consider alternatives to SLS did direct the agency to conduct a \"full and open competition\" for launch services if it chose not to use SLS, including allowing vehicles that are not currently on its NASA Launch Services 2 contract. Responses to the request for information are due to NASA by Feb. 8. NASA hasn't stated when it will decide on how to launch Europa Clipper, or issue a formal request for proposals for launch services, but agency officials said last summer they had hoped to decide how they would launch the mission by the end of 2020.

The agency announced last week that it will issue, around the beginning of March, a formal request for proposals for launching the mission in October 2024. Congress had for years dictated that the mission launch on the Space Launch System, ensuring a speedy transit to Jupiter. NASA had objected, arguing it needed those SLS vehicles for the Artemis program and that a commercial launch option could save the agency as much as $1.5 billion. Congress relented in a spending bill passed in December after engineering analyses found potential issues with the vibrational environment the spacecraft will be exposed to during launch. That opens the door to using SpaceX's existing Falcon Heavy, or potentially Blue Origin's New Glenn and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur vehicles yet to make their first launch. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. That is just the latest twist in what has been a convoluted development of Europa Clipper, one where scientific and political advocacy faced off against budgets and institutional inertia. The Mission, a new book by David Brown, tells the story of the battle to get Europa Clipper started, one involving an alliance of scientists, engineers, politicians, and agency insiders. Concepts for missions to Europa date back to the 1990s, as data from the Galileo mission orbiting Jupiter showed that the icy moon has a subsurface ocean of liquid water that, along with a source of energy and organic compounds, gave it the necessary ingredients to support life. Some of those early concepts, though, foundered on technical issues, like the intense radiation environment around Europa, as well as budgets and competing priorities, notably Mars. However, a small group kept the door on a Europa mission from closing entirely, securing an endorsement in a planetary science decadal survey in 2001 and a trickle of funding for studies until it could develop a stronger base of support, particularly from then-Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who pushed for funding for the mission over the objections of the White House and NASA. Culberson is just one of the characters in The Mission. Others include planetary scientists Bob Pappalardo and Louise Prockter, who were early advocates for a mission to Europa; Curt Niebur, who worked from NASA Headquarters to keep a Europa mission alive; and Karla Clark, an engineer at JPL involved with many of the early Europa mission design studies. Their efforts, and their life stories, are weaved into the book along with many other supporting players. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. Brown dives in and out of the story of the mission itself, with frequent and often lengthy digressions to tell the backstories of the people involved, or to go on any number of tangents related to policy, technology, or even the formation of the solar system. It can be like an engaging conversation that flows and meanders, but sometimes leaves you wondering just how this all fits into the mission itself. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion. That tone is evident in the book's cover-spanning subtitle: \"Or, How a Disciple of Carl Sagan, an Ex-Motocross Racer, a Texas Tea Party Congressman, the World's Worst Typewriter Saleswoman, California Mountain People, and an Anonymous NASA Functionary Went to War with Mars, Survived an Insurgency at Saturn, Traded Blows with Washington, and Stole a Ride on an Alabama Moon Rocket to Send a Space Robot to Jupiter in Search of the Second Garden of Eden at the Bottom of an Alien Ocean Inside of an Ice World Called Europa.\" Whew. At times Brown can be very informal; it may take the reader time to realize that when he refers to the \"mountain people of Saint Gabe,\" he's referring to employees at JPL, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Yet other times he stretches to be erudite: in a passage about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, he describes the world as \"though Gaspard Marsy himself had carved the white marble moon with hammer and chisel.\" An endnote two pages long explains Marsy was a sculptor who created a statue of Enceladus in the garden of Versailles, and told the story of that Greek mythological figure. The book ends long before the present day, when Europa Clipper became a formal project in 2015, its future seemingly secured. That means we miss the ups and downs of the last several years, including the departure of Culberson as the mission's patron, problems with instruments that led to the replacement of a magnetometer and changes to others, and cost growth. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion: not so absurd after all. Despite these problems, Europa Clipper perseveres, and is on track for a launch in 2024 that will allow the spacecraft to arrive in 2030. The Mission helps explains why the mission is so compelling, but also so difficult to get started.

Nasa is sending a spacecraft to the icy world of Europa, which holds an ocean under its frozen outer shell. Scientists have long regarded the moon as one of the most promising targets in the search for life elsewhere in our Solar System. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will now launch to the jovian moon in October 2024, arriving in April 2030. The spacecraft was to have launched on Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But the space agency is reported to no longer be considering that launch vehicle. It will instead lift off on a commercial rocket. The details were disclosed by the mission's project scientist, Dr Robert Pappalardo, during a virtual meeting of Nasa's Outer Planets Assessment Group (Opag). \"We now have clarity on the launch vehicle path and launch date,\" Dr Pappalardo, who is based at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told the meeting. Interest in the moon as a potential habitat for extra-terrestrial life was given a boost in the 1990s, when Nasa's Galileo spacecraft provided evidence that Europa harboured an ocean of liquid water beneath its outer shell. Europa probably has a rocky core surrounded by around 80km (50 miles) of liquid water covered by a shell of water-ice that's roughly 20km (12 miles) thick. \"Europa's about the size of Earth's moon, yet we think it contains twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans,\" Dr Pappalardo said during a virtual talk organised by Arizona State University (ASU) last week. Discussing the moon's potential for life, he said: \"At the bottom of the Earth's oceans are places where water and rock interact, where water seeps down, contacts hot rock and emerges charged with chemical nutrients - reductants.\" When these reductants get together with other chemicals called oxidants, they react, he explained. Dr Pappalardo said these reactions could, \"potentially power life at the ocean floor of Europa - even where there is no light to allow for photosynthesis\". The spacecraft will be able to analyse chemicals in frozen water that has welled up to the surface from beneath the ice shell. It might also be able to sample the contents of water plumes that seem to be spurting out into space from locations on the jovian moon.

That opens the door to using SpaceX's existing Falcon Heavy, or potentially Blue Origin's New Glenn and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur vehicles yet to make their first launch. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. That is just the latest twist in what has been a convoluted development of Europa Clipper, one where scientific and political advocacy faced off against budgets and institutional inertia. The Mission, a new book by David Brown, tells the story of the battle to get Europa Clipper started, one involving an alliance of scientists, engineers, politicians, and agency insiders. Concepts for missions to Europa date back to the 1990s, as data from the Galileo mission orbiting Jupiter showed that the icy moon has a subsurface ocean of liquid water that, along with a source of energy and organic compounds, gave it the necessary ingredients to support life. Some of those early concepts, though, foundered on technical issues, like the intense radiation environment around Europa, as well as budgets and competing priorities, notably Mars. However, a small group kept the door on a Europa mission from closing entirely, securing an endorsement in a planetary science decadal survey in 2001 and a trickle of funding for studies until it could develop a stronger base of support, particularly from then-Rep. John Culberson, a House appropriator who pushed for funding for the mission over the objections of the White House and NASA. Culberson is just one of the characters in The Mission. Others include planetary scientists Bob Pappalardo and Louise Prockter, who were early advocates for a mission to Europa; Curt Niebur, who worked from NASA Headquarters to keep a Europa mission alive; and Karla Clark, an engineer at JPL involved with many of the early Europa mission design studies. Their efforts, and their life stories, are weaved into the book along with many other supporting players. Going from the idea of sending a spacecraft to Europa to getting the Europa Clipper mission formally started was not a straightforward, linear progression, and neither is this book. Brown dives in and out of the story of the mission itself, with frequent and often lengthy digressions to tell the backstories of the people involved, or to go on any number of tangents related to policy, technology, or even the formation of the solar system. It can be like an engaging conversation that flows and meanders, but sometimes leaves you wondering just how this all fits into the mission itself. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion. That tone is evident in the book's cover-spanning subtitle: \"Or, How a Disciple of Carl Sagan, an Ex-Motocross Racer, a Texas Tea Party Congressman, the World's Worst Typewriter Saleswoman, California Mountain People, and an Anonymous NASA Functionary Went to War with Mars, Survived an Insurgency at Saturn, Traded Blows with Washington, and Stole a Ride on an Alabama Moon Rocket to Send a Space Robot to Jupiter in Search of the Second Garden of Eden at the Bottom of an Alien Ocean Inside of an Ice World Called Europa.\" Whew. At times Brown can be very informal; it may take the reader time to realize that when he refers to the \"mountain people of Saint Gabe,\" he's referring to employees at JPL, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Yet other times he stretches to be erudite: in a passage about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus, he describes the world as \"though Gaspard Marsy himself had carved the white marble moon with hammer and chisel.\" An endnote two pages long explains Marsy was a sculptor who created a statue of Enceladus in the garden of Versailles, and told the story of that Greek mythological figure. The book ends long before the present day, when Europa Clipper became a formal project in 2015, its future seemingly secured. That means we miss the ups and downs of the last several years, including the departure of Culberson as the mission's patron, problems with instruments that led to the replacement of a magnetometer and changes to others, and cost growth. In the book, backers of the Europa mission complain bitterly about the \"absurd\" cost estimate of $4.7 billion assigned to the Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey released in 2011. When Europa Clipper passed a review called Key Decision Point C in August 2019, the agency's formal cost estimate for the mission was $4.25 billion: not so absurd after all. Despite these problems, Europa Clipper perseveres, and is on track for a launch in 2024 that will allow the spacecraft to arrive in 2030. The Mission helps explains why the mission is so compelling, but also so difficult to get started.

Nasa is sending a spacecraft to the icy world of Europa, which holds an ocean under its frozen outer shell. Scientists have long regarded the moon as one of the most promising targets in the search for life elsewhere in our Solar System. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will now launch to the jovian moon in October 2024, arriving in April 2030. The spacecraft was to have launched on Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But the space agency is reported to no longer be considering that launch vehicle. It will instead lift off on a commercial rocket. The details were disclosed by the mission's project scientist, Dr Robert Pappalardo, during a virtual meeting of Nasa's Outer Planets Assessment Group (Opag). \"We now have clarity on the launch vehicle path and launch date,\" Dr Pappalardo, who is based at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told the meeting. Interest in the moon as a potential habitat for extra-terrestrial life was given a boost in the 1990s, when Nasa's Galileo spacecraft provided evidence that Europa harboured an ocean of liquid water beneath its outer shell. Europa probably has a rocky core surrounded by around 80km (50 miles) of liquid water covered by a shell of water-ice that's roughly 20km (12 miles) thick. \"Europa's about the size of Earth's moon, yet we think it contains twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans,\" Dr Pappalardo said during a virtual talk organised by Arizona State University (ASU) last week. Discussing the moon's potential for life, he said: \"At the bottom of the Earth's oceans are places where water and rock interact, where water seeps down, contacts hot rock and emerges charged with chemical nutrients - reductants.\" When these reductants get together with other chemicals called oxidants, they react, he explained. Dr Pappalardo said these reactions could, \"potentially power life at the ocean floor of Europa - even where there is no light to allow for photosynthesis\". The spacecraft will be able to analyse chemicals in frozen water that has welled up to the surface from beneath the ice shell. It might also be able to sample the contents of water plumes that seem to be spurting out into space from locations on the jovian moon.

During the review, experts examined the detailed design of the spacecraft to ensure that it is ready to complete construction. The mission is now able to complete hardware fabrication and testing, and move toward the assembly and testing of the spacecraft and its payload of sophisticated science instruments. With an internal global ocean twice the size of Earth's oceans combined, Jupiter's moon Europa carries the potential for conditions suitable for life. But the frigid temperatures and the nonstop pummeling of the surface from Jupiter's radiation make it a tricky target to explore: Mission engineers and scientists must design a spacecraft hardy enough to withstand the radiation yet sensitive enough to gather the science needed to investigate Europa's environment. The Europa Clipper orbiter will swoop around Jupiter on an elliptical path, dipping close to the moon on each flyby to conduct detailed reconnaissance. The science includes gathering measurements of the internal ocean, mapping the surface composition and its geology, and hunting for plumes of water vapor that may be venting from the icy crust. Development of the spacecraft is progressing well, based on the intense examination NASA recently completed. The Critical Design Review conducted a deep dive into the specifics of the plans for all of the science instruments - from cameras to antennas - and flight subsystems, including propulsion, power, avionics, and the flight computer. \"We showed that our project system design is strong,\" said Europa Clipper Project Manager Jan Chodas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"Our plans for completing the development and integration of the individual pieces hold together, and the system as a whole will function as designed to gather the science measurements we need to explore the potential habitability of Europa.\" Beyond detailed plans, the mission has built prototypes and engineering models to test how well the instruments and engineering subsystems will work. Then there's the flight hardware itself. Much of it is already being built; individual engineering subsystems and instruments cleared their own design reviews over the last year and a half. The most striking of Europa Clipper's features, its signature elements, are taking shape. Nearly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, the disc-shaped high-gain antenna, which will receive commands from Earth and transmit science data back down, is in its final stage of assembly. And by far the most visible of Europa Clipper's hardware - the massive solar arrays that will unfurl in deep space like wings - are under construction as well. The spacecraft, with its arrays fully deployed, is wider than a basketball court is long, spanning 100 feet (30.5 meters). The arrays will cover over 960 square feet (90 square meters). They will be attached to the propulsion module being built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. The propulsion module core consists of two stacked cylinders that together stand almost 10 feet (3 meters) high and hold the propulsion tanks and 16 rocket engines that will propel Europa Clipper once it leaves Earth's atmosphere. The giant cylinders embody the cooperative effort needed to put a spacecraft like this together. They were built by APL and shipped to JPL for installation of the Heat Redistribution System tubing, part of a system that will keep the spacecraft thermally controlled. The cylinders were then sent to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for installation of the propulsion subsystem. There are 400 welded connections, each of them X-rayed for quality control, which are key to successfully installing the propulsion subsystem. APL is also building the telecommunications module for radio communications with Earth and a radiation monitor to gauge the size of the electron blast that is hitting the spacecraft during its 40-plus flybys of Europa. At JPL, construction is underway on several elements of the flight system, including the protective vault that shields critical electronic hardware from Jupiter's intense radiation. JPL is also building and testing the avionics subsystem, which includes the flight computer, the power switching and distribution hardware, the flight software needed to perform the science mission, and the ground system tools necessary to fly the mission. Also being built is ground support equipment that will be used to assemble and test Europa Clipper's large pieces of flight hardware. \"It's a very exciting time for the team, seeing the fruits of their work that will be orbiting Jupiter in a few years,\" said Europa Clipper Deputy Project Manager Jordan Evans of JPL. \"Even in the face of COVID-19, the team is firing on all cylinders. Using safe-at-work protocols, they're performing the necessary work on the hardware while the rest of the team is getting their job done at home.\" As this work moves forward, project leaders continue to plan the science of the mission. The spacecraft's science instruments will measure the depth of the ice crust, measure the depth of the internal ocean and how thick and salty it is, capture color images of surface geology in detail, and analyze potential plumes. Scientists are especially interested in what makes up the moon's surface. Evidence suggests that material exposed there has been mixed through the icy crust and perhaps comes from the ocean beneath. Europa Clipper will also investigate the moon's gravity field, which will tell scientists more about both how the moon flexes as Jupiter pulls on it and how that action could potentially warm the internal ocean. \"We're doing work that a decade from now will change how we think about the diversity of worlds in the outer solar system - and about where life might be able to exist right now, not in the distant past,\" said Europa Clipper Project Scientist Robert Pappalardo of JPL. But the more instruments a spacecraft carries, the more they interact and potentially affect each other's operation. To that end, noted Pappalardo, \"We're currently making sure the instruments can all operate at the same time without electromagnetic interference.\" The full suite of instruments will undergo extensive testing after they arrive at JPL in 2021. Early 2022 marks the start of assembly, test, and launch operations. The countdown is on. \"Less than a year to go until all the hardware assemblies need to show up in one place,\" Chodas said. \"We bring all these pieces together to start building up the full flight system, then test the fully integrated spacecraft and get it ready to launch.\" The team is on track to have Europa Clipper ready for a launch in 2024.

Slated to launch in October 2024, the $4.25 billion mission will spend much of the remainder of this decade flying to the Jovian system before entering an elongated orbit around Jupiter. The spacecraft will then make as many as 44 flybys of Europa, the intriguing, ice-encrusted Jovian moon that scientists believe harbors a vast ocean beneath the surface. It is possible that aquatic life exists there. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million, NASA said in a news release. This is a significant moment for SpaceX, as the company will be entrusted with one of NASA's highest-priority exploration missions. The deal also saves NASA about $2 billion. The selection of a launch vehicle for this ambitious mission has been subjected to a long, drawn-out political process. Originally, at the urging of Congress, NASA planned to launch the spacecraft on its Space Launch System rocket. There were two reasons for this. Legislators wanted to find additional missions for the SLS rocket. And second, the powerful SLS rocket had the ability to get the Clipper to Jupiter within about four years. However, many in the scientific community preferred to launch on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy for a variety of reasons. For one, SpaceX offered launch services at a steep discount compared to the SLS rocket, which the White House estimated would cost more than $2 billion for the Clipper mission. Scientists were also concerned that the oft-delayed SLS rocket would simply not be ready for a 2024 launch date, and selecting it would delay the science mission. Advertisement However, politicians continued to insist that NASA launch Clipper on the SLS rocket. Three different events finally forced legislators to relent. First, in late 2018, NASA scientists concluded that the Falcon Heavy could complete the Clipper mission without needing a gravity assist from Venus, and therefore it would not have to go into the inner Solar System. The Falcon Heavy could do so with the addition of a Star 48 \"kick stage.\" \"Nobody is saying we're not going on the SLS,\" Barry Goldstein, of NASA, said at a meeting in November 2018. \"But if by chance we don't, we don't have the challenge of the inner Solar System. This was a major development. This was a big deal for us.\" Second, after finalizing plans for the Artemis Moon Program, NASA realized that the primary contractor for the SLS rocket's core stage, Boeing, simply was not up to the task of building an additional rocket for the Clipper mission in time. All of the SLS core stages, NASA officials realized, would be needed to support the effort to land humans on the Moon in the mid-2020s. Finally, what forced Shelby and the rest of Congress to give in was a \"shaking\" issue with the SLS rocket. This large vehicle is powered off the pad by two very large solid rocket boosters that produce significant vibrations. SLS program officials had been telling the agency's leadership that the torsional load-essentially a measurement of twisting and vibration-was a certain value. However, after NASA performed wind-tunnel testing, the actual torsional load value was nearly double the SLS program estimates. Accommodating for this launch stress, NASA officials told Ars, would have required an additional $1 billion in modifications to make the spacecraft more robust. That additional cost was ultimately what led NASA to be able to make Friday's announcement.

Using safe-at-work protocols, they're performing the necessary work on the hardware while the rest of the team is getting their job done at home.\" As this work moves forward, project leaders continue to plan the science of the mission. The spacecraft's science instruments will measure the depth of the ice crust, measure the depth of the internal ocean and how thick and salty it is, capture color images of surface geology in detail, and analyze potential plumes. Scientists are especially interested in what makes up the moon's surface. Evidence suggests that material exposed there has been mixed through the icy crust and perhaps comes from the ocean beneath. Europa Clipper will also investigate the moon's gravity field, which will tell scientists more about both how the moon flexes as Jupiter pulls on it and how that action could potentially warm the internal ocean. \"We're doing work that a decade from now will change how we think about the diversity of worlds in the outer solar system - and about where life might be able to exist right now, not in the distant past,\" said Europa Clipper Project Scientist Robert Pappalardo of JPL. But the more instruments a spacecraft carries, the more they interact and potentially affect each other's operation. To that end, noted Pappalardo, \"We're currently making sure the instruments can all operate at the same time without electromagnetic interference.\" The full suite of instruments will undergo extensive testing after they arrive at JPL in 2021. Early 2022 marks the start of assembly, test, and launch operations. The countdown is on. \"Less than a year to go until all the hardware assemblies need to show up in one place,\" Chodas said. \"We bring all these pieces together to start building up the full flight system, then test the fully integrated spacecraft and get it ready to launch.\" The team is on track to have Europa Clipper ready for a launch in 2024.

Slated to launch in October 2024, the $4.25 billion mission will spend much of the remainder of this decade flying to the Jovian system before entering an elongated orbit around Jupiter. The spacecraft will then make as many as 44 flybys of Europa, the intriguing, ice-encrusted Jovian moon that scientists believe harbors a vast ocean beneath the surface. It is possible that aquatic life exists there. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million, NASA said in a news release. This is a significant moment for SpaceX, as the company will be entrusted with one of NASA's highest-priority exploration missions. The deal also saves NASA about $2 billion. The selection of a launch vehicle for this ambitious mission has been subjected to a long, drawn-out political process. Originally, at the urging of Congress, NASA planned to launch the spacecraft on its Space Launch System rocket. There were two reasons for this. Legislators wanted to find additional missions for the SLS rocket. And second, the powerful SLS rocket had the ability to get the Clipper to Jupiter within about four years. However, many in the scientific community preferred to launch on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy for a variety of reasons. For one, SpaceX offered launch services at a steep discount compared to the SLS rocket, which the White House estimated would cost more than $2 billion for the Clipper mission. Scientists were also concerned that the oft-delayed SLS rocket would simply not be ready for a 2024 launch date, and selecting it would delay the science mission. Advertisement However, politicians continued to insist that NASA launch Clipper on the SLS rocket. Three different events finally forced legislators to relent. First, in late 2018, NASA scientists concluded that the Falcon Heavy could complete the Clipper mission without needing a gravity assist from Venus, and therefore it would not have to go into the inner Solar System. The Falcon Heavy could do so with the addition of a Star 48 \"kick stage.\" \"Nobody is saying we're not going on the SLS,\" Barry Goldstein, of NASA, said at a meeting in November 2018. \"But if by chance we don't, we don't have the challenge of the inner Solar System. This was a major development. This was a big deal for us.\" Second, after finalizing plans for the Artemis Moon Program, NASA realized that the primary contractor for the SLS rocket's core stage, Boeing, simply was not up to the task of building an additional rocket for the Clipper mission in time. All of the SLS core stages, NASA officials realized, would be needed to support the effort to land humans on the Moon in the mid-2020s. Finally, what forced Shelby and the rest of Congress to give in was a \"shaking\" issue with the SLS rocket. This large vehicle is powered off the pad by two very large solid rocket boosters that produce significant vibrations. SLS program officials had been telling the agency's leadership that the torsional load-essentially a measurement of twisting and vibration-was a certain value. However, after NASA performed wind-tunnel testing, the actual torsional load value was nearly double the SLS program estimates. Accommodating for this launch stress, NASA officials told Ars, would have required an additional $1 billion in modifications to make the spacecraft more robust. That additional cost was ultimately what led NASA to be able to make Friday's announcement.

The spacecraft's thick aluminum vault, which will protect Europa Clipper's electronics from Jupiter's intense radiation, is nearing completion at JPL. The building and testing of the science instruments at universities and partner institutions across the country continue as well. The mission is also gearing up for its System Integration Review in late 2021, when NASA will review plans for assembling and testing Europa Clipper, and its instruments are inspected in detail. \"It's really exciting to see the progression of flight hardware moving forward this year as the various elements are put together bit by bit and tested,\" said Europa Clipper Project Manager Jan Chodas of JPL. \"The project team is energized and more focused than ever on delivering a spacecraft with an exquisite instrument suite that promises to revolutionize our knowledge of Europa.\" Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which harbors an internal ocean with twice the amount of water in Earth's oceans combined, may currently have conditions suitable for supporting life. Europa Clipper will carry a broad suite of science instruments into orbit around Jupiter and conduct multiple close flybys of Europa to gather data on its atmosphere, surface, and interior. Engineers and technicians in a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory display the thick-walled aluminum vault they helped build for the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The vault will protect the spacecraft's electronics from Jupiter's intense radiation. In the background is a duplicate vault. Delivery of the towering propulsion module from Goddard to APL marked a milestone for that major piece of hardware. APL built the twin cylinders that make up the module and shipped them to JPL, where technicians added thermal tubing that will carry coolant to keep the spacecraft from getting too hot or too cold in deep space. From there, the cylinders went to Goddard, where propellant tanks were installed inside of them and 16 rocket engines were attached to the outside. Another large piece of hardware nearing completion is the spacecraft's radiator, which connects to the thermal tubing. The width and length of a twin-size bed, the radiator's 3-inch-thick panel has the crucial job of radiating heat out into space to keep the spacecraft within its operating temperature range. It is covered with louvers that open and close automatically as the spacecraft disperses more or less heat to regulate its temperature. Engineers in a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory build the nadir deck for NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft. The deck will stabilize the spacecraft's sensors and help the mission team ensure its instruments are oriented correctly. Meanwhile, work at APL begins to integrate the propulsion module and the telecommunications hardware. And construction of a high-gain antenna - a dish nearly 10 feet wide - is underway at vendor Applied Aerospace Structures Corporation in Stockton, California. It will be delivered to APL this year, where it will be integrated before the entire module comes back to JPL a final time. By the spring of 2022, the huge element will join other Europa Clipper hardware streaming into JPL's main high bay for assembly, test, and launch operations. One of the first elements in place for ATLO will be the spacecraft's vault, now entering its final stage of fabrication at JPL. Eventually, the vault will be bolted to the top of the propulsion module and affixed with miles of cabling so that the power box and computer inside can communicate with the other subsystems.

The main body of NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has been delivered to the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Over the next two years there, engineers and technicians will finish assembling the craft by hand before testing it to make sure it can withstand the journey to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The spacecraft body is the mission's workhorse. Standing 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide, it's an aluminum cylinder integrated with electronics, radios, thermal loop tubing, cabling, and the propulsion system. With its solar arrays and other deployable equipment stowed for launch, Europa Clipper will be as large as an SUV; when extended, the solar arrays make the craft the size of a basketball court. It is the largest NASA spacecraft ever developed for a planetary mission. \"It's an exciting time for the whole project team and a huge milestone,\" said Jordan Evans, the mission's project manager at JPL. \"This delivery brings us one step closer to launch and the Europa Clipper science investigation.\" Set to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper will conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, which scientists are confident harbors an internal ocean containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans combined. And the ocean may currently have conditions suitable for supporting life. The spacecraft's nine science instruments will gather data on Europa's atmosphere, surface, and interior - information that scientists will use to gauge the depth and salinity of the ocean, the thickness of the ice crust, and potential plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. Those instruments already have begun arriving at JPL, where the phase known as assembly, test, and launch operations has been underway since March. The ultraviolet spectrograph, called Europa-UVS, arrived in March. Next came the spacecraft's thermal emission imaging instrument, E-THEMIS, delivered by the scientists and engineers leading its development at Arizona State University. E-THEMIS is a sophisticated infrared camera designed to map Europa's temperatures and help scientists find clues about the moon's geological activity - including regions where liquid water may be near the surface. By the end of 2022, most of the flight hardware and the remainder of the science instruments are expected to be complete. The Whole Package The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, designed Europa Clipper's body in collaboration with JPL and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The flight system designed, built, and tested by APL - using a team of hundreds of engineers and technicians - was the physically largest system ever built by APL,\" said APL's Tom Magner, the mission's assistant project manager. The work on the main module continues now at JPL. \"What arrived at JPL represents essentially an assembly phase unto itself. Under APL's leadership, this delivery includes work by that institution and two NASA centers. Now the team will take the system to an even higher level of integration,\" said Evans. The main structure is actually two stacked aluminum cylinders dotted with threaded holes for bolting on the spacecraft's cargo: the radio frequency module, radiation monitors, propulsion electronics, power converters, and wiring. The radio frequency subsystem will power eight antennas, including an enormous high-gain antenna that measures 10 feet (3 meters) wide. The structure's web of electrical wires and connectors, called the harness, weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) by itself; if stretched out, it would run almost 2,100 feet (640 meters) - twice the perimeter of a football field. The heavy-duty electronics vault, built to withstand the intense radiation of the Jupiter system, will be integrated with the main spacecraft structure along with the science instruments. Inside the main body of the spacecraft are two tanks - one to hold fuel, one for oxidizer - and the tubing that will carry their contents to an array of 24 engines, where they will combine to create a controlled chemical reaction that produces thrust. \"Our engines are dual purpose,\" said JPL's Tim Larson, the deputy project manager. \"We use them for big maneuvers, including when we approach Jupiter and need a large burn to be captured in Jupiter's orbit. But they're also designed for smaller maneuvers to manage the attitude of the spacecraft and to fine tune the precision flybys of Europa and other solar system bodies along the way.\" Those big and small maneuvers will come into play a lot during the six-year, 1.8-billion-mile (2.9-billion-kilometer) journey to this ocean world, which Europa Clipper will begin investigating in earnest in 2031.

This assembly phase is a significant milestone for the engineers who've spent years on the project. \"We'll learn how the system we designed will actually perform,\" explains project manager Jan Chodas, who is overseeing the Europa Clipper assembly. \"It will be very exciting to see the hardware, the flight software, and the instruments get integrated and tested.\" Once the spacecraft is assembled it will be moved to JPL's thermal vacuum chamber, where engineers will subject Europa Clipper to the harsh conditions of deep space. Then, the agency will put the craft through \"intense vibration testing\" to make sure it can withstand launch. If all goes according to plan, Europa Clipper will be sitting on the launchpad in October 2024. If all goes as planned, it will reach Jupiter's orbit by 2030. Europa holds mysteries - and maybe even life Most of Jupiter's 79 moons are small and not all that attractive to astronomers. But the four biggest - Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto - are more like mini planets than desolate space rocks. In fact, they formed in parallel with Jupiter. All five objects emerged from the same cloud of gas and dust. Europa stands out because it appears to have a crust of ice. Much like Earth, the rocky object has a metallic core at its center and \"a skin of H2O,\" according to Bob Pappalardo, NASA's project scientist for the mission.

There it will join eight other instruments and become an integral part of the agency's Europa Clipper spacecraft. The instrument is the Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System led by Philip Christensen of Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. E-THEMIS is an infrared camera designed to map temperatures across Europa's surface. Its images, taken in three heat-sensitive bands, will help scientists find clues about Europa's geological activity, including regions where the moon's presumed ocean may lie near the surface. While Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, scientists think its ocean may hold twice the volume of Earth's oceans. In January 2022 the Arizona State University team took test images with the E-THEMIS camera from the rooftop of the Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 4 on the Arizona State University Tempe campus. E-THEMIS made temperature-sensing images at midday, in late afternoon, and after sunset. These images revealed how the temperature of the buildings and landscape responded to changes in sunlight as the day progressed. Besides identifying any warmer areas on Europa's surface, E-THEMIS images will also help scientists determine the physical state of the icy surface. As parts of Europa's landscape cool after local sunset, areas of solid ice will stay warmer longer, while those with a granular texture will lose heat more rapidly. By mapping the rates of cooling across the surface, scientists will better understand Europa's small-scale properties. This technique might even help to identify interesting sites for a possible future lander. Europa Clipper is a spacecraft sent to investigate Jupiter's ice-shrouded moon Europa. It is planned to launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in October 2024 and arrive at Jupiter in April 2030 after making flybys of Mars in 2025 and Earth in 2026. These planetary flybys use the masses of Mars and Earth to boost the spacecraft's velocity so it can reach the Jupiter system. After entering orbit at Jupiter, the spacecraft will make about 50 flybys of Europa to investigate whether the moon could harbor conditions suitable for life.

The main body of NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has been delivered to the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Over the next two years there, engineers and technicians will finish assembling the craft by hand before testing it to make sure it can withstand the journey to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The spacecraft body is the mission's workhorse. Standing 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide, it's an aluminum cylinder integrated with electronics, radios, thermal loop tubing, cabling, and the propulsion system. With its solar arrays and other deployable equipment stowed for launch, Europa Clipper will be as large as an SUV; when extended, the solar arrays make the craft the size of a basketball court. It is the largest NASA spacecraft ever developed for a planetary mission. \"It's an exciting time for the whole project team and a huge milestone,\" said Jordan Evans, the mission's project manager at JPL. \"This delivery brings us one step closer to launch and the Europa Clipper science investigation.\" Set to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper will conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, which scientists are confident harbors an internal ocean containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans combined. And the ocean may currently have conditions suitable for supporting life. The spacecraft's nine science instruments will gather data on Europa's atmosphere, surface, and interior - information that scientists will use to gauge the depth and salinity of the ocean, the thickness of the ice crust, and potential plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. Those instruments already have begun arriving at JPL, where the phase known as assembly, test, and launch operations has been underway since March. The ultraviolet spectrograph, called Europa-UVS, arrived in March. Next came the spacecraft's thermal emission imaging instrument, E-THEMIS, delivered by the scientists and engineers leading its development at Arizona State University. E-THEMIS is a sophisticated infrared camera designed to map Europa's temperatures and help scientists find clues about the moon's geological activity - including regions where liquid water may be near the surface. By the end of 2022, most of the flight hardware and the remainder of the science instruments are expected to be complete. The Whole Package The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, designed Europa Clipper's body in collaboration with JPL and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The flight system designed, built, and tested by APL - using a team of hundreds of engineers and technicians - was the physically largest system ever built by APL,\" said APL's Tom Magner, the mission's assistant project manager. The work on the main module continues now at JPL. \"What arrived at JPL represents essentially an assembly phase unto itself. Under APL's leadership, this delivery includes work by that institution and two NASA centers. Now the team will take the system to an even higher level of integration,\" said Evans. The main structure is actually two stacked aluminum cylinders dotted with threaded holes for bolting on the spacecraft's cargo: the radio frequency module, radiation monitors, propulsion electronics, power converters, and wiring. The radio frequency subsystem will power eight antennas, including an enormous high-gain antenna that measures 10 feet (3 meters) wide. The structure's web of electrical wires and connectors, called the harness, weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) by itself; if stretched out, it would run almost 2,100 feet (640 meters) - twice the perimeter of a football field. The heavy-duty electronics vault, built to withstand the intense radiation of the Jupiter system, will be integrated with the main spacecraft structure along with the science instruments. Inside the main body of the spacecraft are two tanks - one to hold fuel, one for oxidizer - and the tubing that will carry their contents to an array of 24 engines, where they will combine to create a controlled chemical reaction that produces thrust. \"Our engines are dual purpose,\" said JPL's Tim Larson, the deputy project manager. \"We use them for big maneuvers, including when we approach Jupiter and need a large burn to be captured in Jupiter's orbit. But they're also designed for smaller maneuvers to manage the attitude of the spacecraft and to fine tune the precision flybys of Europa and other solar system bodies along the way.\" Those big and small maneuvers will come into play a lot during the six-year, 1.8-billion-mile (2.9-billion-kilometer) journey to this ocean world, which Europa Clipper will begin investigating in earnest in 2031.

Standing 10 feet (3 meters) high and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, the craft's main body will for the next two years be the focus of attention in the facility's ultra-hygienic High Bay 1 as engineers and technicians assemble the spacecraft for its launch to Jupiter's moon Europa in October 2024.

The thermal-emission imaging instrument, called E-THEMIS, and the ultraviolet spectrograph, Europa-UVS, have already been installed on the spacecraft's nadir deck, which will support many of the instrument sensors by stabilizing them to ensure they are oriented correctly. Fabricated at JPL, this key piece of hardware will soon move into the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1, the same clean room where historic missions such as Galileo, Cassini, and all of NASA's Mars rovers were built. Also moving soon to High Bay 1 will be the aluminum electronics vault, which will be bolted to the main body of the spacecraft, protecting the electronics inside from Jupiter's intense radiation. The electronics enable Europa Clipper's computer to communicate with the spacecraft's antennae, science instruments, and the subsystems that will keep them alive. Bright copper cabling snaking around the orbiter's aluminum core contains thousands of wires and connectors handcrafted at APL. If placed end to end, the cabling would stretch almost 2,100 feet (640 meters) - enough to wrap around a U.S. football field twice. Inside the core are Europa Clipper's two propulsion tanks.

By the end of 2022, most of the flight hardware and the remainder of the science instruments are expected to be complete. Then, the next steps will be a wide variety of tests as the spacecraft moves toward its 2024 launch period. After traveling for nearly six years and over 1.8 billion miles, it will achieve orbit around Jupiter in 2030. Missions such as Europa Clipper contribute to the field of astrobiology, the interdisciplinary research field that studies the conditions of distant worlds that could harbor life as we know it. While Europa Clipper is not a life-detection mission, it will conduct a detailed exploration of Europa and investigate whether the icy moon, with its subsurface ocean, has the capability to support life. Understanding Europa's habitability will help scientists better understand how life developed on Earth and the potential for finding life beyond our planet.

The main body of NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has been delivered to the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Over the next two years there, engineers and technicians will finish assembling the craft by hand before testing it to make sure it can withstand the journey to Jupiter's icy moon Europa. The spacecraft body is the mission's workhorse. Standing 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide, it's an aluminum cylinder integrated with electronics, radios, thermal loop tubing, cabling, and the propulsion system. With its solar arrays and other deployable equipment stowed for launch, Europa Clipper will be as large as an SUV; when extended, the solar arrays make the craft the size of a basketball court. It is the largest NASA spacecraft ever developed for a planetary mission. \"It's an exciting time for the whole project team and a huge milestone,\" said Jordan Evans, the mission's project manager at JPL. \"This delivery brings us one step closer to launch and the Europa Clipper science investigation.\" Set to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper will conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, which scientists are confident harbors an internal ocean containing twice as much water as Earth's oceans combined. And the ocean may currently have conditions suitable for supporting life. The spacecraft's nine science instruments will gather data on Europa's atmosphere, surface, and interior - information that scientists will use to gauge the depth and salinity of the ocean, the thickness of the ice crust, and potential plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. Those instruments already have begun arriving at JPL, where the phase known as assembly, test, and launch operations has been underway since March. The ultraviolet spectrograph, called Europa-UVS, arrived in March. Next came the spacecraft's thermal emission imaging instrument, E-THEMIS, delivered by the scientists and engineers leading its development at Arizona State University. E-THEMIS is a sophisticated infrared camera designed to map Europa's temperatures and help scientists find clues about the moon's geological activity - including regions where liquid water may be near the surface. By the end of 2022, most of the flight hardware and the remainder of the science instruments are expected to be complete. The Whole Package The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, designed Europa Clipper's body in collaboration with JPL and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The flight system designed, built, and tested by APL - using a team of hundreds of engineers and technicians - was the physically largest system ever built by APL,\" said APL's Tom Magner, the mission's assistant project manager. The work on the main module continues now at JPL. \"What arrived at JPL represents essentially an assembly phase unto itself. Under APL's leadership, this delivery includes work by that institution and two NASA centers. Now the team will take the system to an even higher level of integration,\" said Evans. The main structure is actually two stacked aluminum cylinders dotted with threaded holes for bolting on the spacecraft's cargo: the radio frequency module, radiation monitors, propulsion electronics, power converters, and wiring. The radio frequency subsystem will power eight antennas, including an enormous high-gain antenna that measures 10 feet (3 meters) wide. The structure's web of electrical wires and connectors, called the harness, weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) by itself; if stretched out, it would run almost 2,100 feet (640 meters) - twice the perimeter of a football field. The heavy-duty electronics vault, built to withstand the intense radiation of the Jupiter system, will be integrated with the main spacecraft structure along with the science instruments. Inside the main body of the spacecraft are two tanks - one to hold fuel, one for oxidizer - and the tubing that will carry their contents to an array of 24 engines, where they will combine to create a controlled chemical reaction that produces thrust. \"Our engines are dual purpose,\" said JPL's Tim Larson, the deputy project manager. \"We use them for big maneuvers, including when we approach Jupiter and need a large burn to be captured in Jupiter's orbit. But they're also designed for smaller maneuvers to manage the attitude of the spacecraft and to fine tune the precision flybys of Europa and other solar system bodies along the way.\" Those big and small maneuvers will come into play a lot during the six-year, 1.8-billion-mile (2.9-billion-kilometer) journey to this ocean world, which Europa Clipper will begin investigating in earnest in 2031.

Standing 10 feet (3 meters) high and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, the craft's main body will for the next two years be the focus of attention in the facility's ultra-hygienic High Bay 1 as engineers and technicians assemble the spacecraft for its launch to Jupiter's moon Europa in October 2024.

Most recently, the plasma-detection instrument, called the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding, and the Europa Imaging System wide-angle camera arrived from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), in Laurel, Maryland. The thermal-emission imaging instrument, called E-THEMIS, and the ultraviolet spectrograph, Europa-UVS, have already been installed on the spacecraft's nadir deck, which will support many of the instrument sensors by stabilizing them to ensure they are oriented correctly. Fabricated at JPL, this key piece of hardware will soon move into the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1, the same clean room where historic missions such as Galileo, Cassini, and all of NASA's Mars rovers were built. Also moving soon to High Bay 1 will be the aluminum electronics vault, which will be bolted to the main body of the spacecraft, protecting the electronics inside from Jupiter's intense radiation. The electronics enable Europa Clipper's computer to communicate with the spacecraft's antennae, science instruments, and the subsystems that will keep them alive. Bright copper cabling snaking around the orbiter's aluminum core contains thousands of wires and connectors handcrafted at APL. If placed end to end, the cabling would stretch almost 2,100 feet (640 meters) - enough to wrap around a U.S. football field twice. Inside the core are Europa Clipper's two propulsion tanks.

By the end of 2022, most of the flight hardware and the remainder of the science instruments are expected to be complete. Then, the next steps will be a wide variety of tests as the spacecraft moves toward its 2024 launch period. After traveling for nearly six years and over 1.8 billion miles, it will achieve orbit around Jupiter in 2030. Missions such as Europa Clipper contribute to the field of astrobiology, the interdisciplinary research field that studies the conditions of distant worlds that could harbor life as we know it. While Europa Clipper is not a life-detection mission, it will conduct a detailed exploration of Europa and investigate whether the icy moon, with its subsurface ocean, has the capability to support life. Understanding Europa's habitability will help scientists better understand how life developed on Earth and the potential for finding life beyond our planet.

Engineers and technicians at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California recently installed four reaction wheels on Europa Clipper, which will rely on them during its journey at Jupiter's icy moon Europa. When NASA's spacecraft heads through deep space, slips into orbit around Jupiter, and collects science observations while flying dozens of times by Europa, the wheels rotate the orbiter so that its antennas can communicate with Earth and its science instruments, including cameras, can stay oriented. Two feet wide and made of steel, aluminum, and titanium, the wheels spin rapidly to create torque that causes the orbiter to rotate in the opposite direction. Isaac Newton's third law of motion also applies in deep space and explains the underlying phenomenon: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The reaction wheels cause the spacecraft to react to the spinning action of the wheels. Here's one way to visualize how reaction wheels work: Imagine you are sitting in a swivel chair and lift your feet off the floor so that you are free to rotate. If you jerk your torso one direction, the chair and your legs will rotate the opposite direction. The reaction wheels work the same way: As the reaction wheel's motor accelerates the metal wheel in one direction, the spacecraft experiences an acceleration in the opposite direction. Without those reaction wheels, Europa Clipper wouldn't be able to do its science investigations when it arrives at the Jupiter system in 2030 after its 2024 launch. Scientists believe Europa harbors a vast internal ocean that may have conditions suitable for supporting life. The spacecraft will gather data on the moon's atmosphere, surface, and interior - information that will help scientists learn more about the ocean, the ice crust, and potential plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. During its orbits around Jupiter, Europa Clipper will rely on reaction wheels to help it perform thousands of turns, or \"slews.\" Although the spacecraft could perform some of those maneuvers with thrusters, its thrusters need fuel - a finite resource aboard the orbiter. The reaction wheels will run on electricity provided by the spacecraft's vast solar arrays. The trade-off is that the reaction wheels work slowly. Europa Clipper's reaction wheels will take about 90 minutes to rotate the craft 180 degrees - a movement so gradual that, from a distance, it would be imperceptible to the human eye. The rotation of the spacecraft will be three times slower than the minute hand on a clock. Also, they can wear out over time. It happened on NASA's Dawn spacecraft, requiring engineers to figure out how to rotate using thrusters with the available fuel. To address this, engineers have installed four wheels on Europa Clipper even though only three are needed to maneuver. They alternate which three wheels are in operation to even the wear. That leaves them with a \"spare\" wheel if one of the others fails. Installing the wheels was one of the most recent steps of the phase known as assembly, test, and launch operations.
