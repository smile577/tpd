[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Details Emerging on Japan's Future Exascale System", "date": "2014-03-18", "content": "The Big Data and Extreme Computing meeting in Fukuoka, Japan concluded recently, pushing a great deal of information about international progress toward exascale initiatives into the global community. As the host country, Japan had ample opportunity to gather many of the researchers building out the next incarnation of the K Computer, which is expected to be the country's first exascale system-a $1.38 billion undertaking that's already underway with expected installation in 2019 and full-steam production in 2020. According to the roadmap put forth by Yoshio Kawaguchi from Japan's Office for Promotion of Computing Science/MEXT, basic development for the future system is swiftly moving on software, accelerator, processor and scientific project planning fronts. Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC are key vendors providing the system and support, along with technical staff at the University of Tokyo, the University of Tsukuba, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tohoku University and of course, at RIKEN, site of the K Computer and future hub of its successor. Called \"postK\" in reference to its ability to step up the power of the original former top system, K, the timeline for the exascale system is laid out as a projection-with additional research notes (summarized below) to highlight various tracks of the early development and system/stack design. Japan has its sights set on a number of potential problems that might be solved on postK, including the development of safer cars, the evolution of drugs with mitigated or reduced side effects, better prediction and responses to natural disasters, and specific projects, like the development of better batteries, the creation of electronic devices using novel materials, and the enhanced ability to kick galaxy simulation up several (thousand) notches. Of course, to do all of this at a reasonable cost is going to take some serious innovation. A few of the key researchers behind the components to building postK shared details, including Dr. Mitsushisa Sato from the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukba and team leader for the Programming Environment Research Team behind the K Computer at RIKEN. His work is centered around optimal accelerators for massive heterogeneous systems, which has led to the creation of what the team calls an \"extreme SIMD architecture\" designed for compute oriented applications. This involves tightly coupled accelerators and a few unique memory refinements, including the addition of high bandwidth memory (HBM in the chart below). This architecture would be designed to tackle molecular dynamics and N-body-type simulations as well as stencil apps and according to Sato, will aim for high performance in the area of around 10 teraflops per chip using a 10nm silicon technology that will arrive somewhere in the 2018-2020 timeframe. While that's not staggering when you really think about it, the real story seems to be (at this point anyway) that most of the crunch is being handled by the on-board accelerator with the added weight of the memory on the same package and associated networking. Sato and team are exploring possible programming models for this approach via a C extension for the in-the-weeds aspects, an OpenACC-based model for stencil applications to help ease porting existing codes, a DSL and application framework for building with as well as the option of OpenCL. There is no mention of CUDA here, which should likely tell you something about the nature of the accelerator. Again, as with all aspects of this article, we'll be following up as soon as we can secure more information. On the processor front, this is again seen as a natural evolution of the K system. According to Yutaka Ishikawa from the University of Tokyo, the team will carry over lessons learned with the general processor environment to target far greater efficiency and to meet a software stack that's designed for both the proposed and commodity-based systems. The ridiculously bright yellow chart on the left shows the various processor approaches they've been testing during their current cycles. In a presentation from the application and system feasibility study teams, they noted the many parallels in terms of challenges and potential problems the system could solve between K and the exascale system of 2020. The K Computer, which was put into production in 2011, currently has over 1,431 users and is running around 136 projects. Each of the sites in Japan's national infrastructure is dedicated to a specific strategic application area (although not exclusively running projects in the domain). At RIKEN the K system is devoted in particular to life sciences and drug design problems. Other sites are focused on materials science, climate and geosciences, manufacturing and astrophysics. The system has supported two notable Gordon Bell prizes since its inception, in addition to topping the Top 500 list in 2011. Keep in mind that the United States is a partner on the software side of the project. As Kawaguchi's slide highlights, the partnership will continue into the next phases of system development. The team notes that \"international collaboration for system software has been considered.\"", "url": "https://www.hpcwire.com/2014/03/18/details-emerge-japans-future-exascale-system/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Fujitsu to Build Post-K Supercomputer for RIKEN in Japan", "date": "2014-10-01", "content": "Today Riken announced that Fujitsu Ltd. has been selected to develop the basic design for Japan's next-generation supercomputer.

That lower profile changed this week at the ISC 2016 conference, where Fujitsu announced it would develop an ARM processor for its Post-K exascale supercomputer. But the effort promises to have much a wider impact on the HPC landscape than just a single system. The announcement was made at the ISC 2016 conference during one of the Vendor Showdown sessions by Toshiyuki Shimizu, who heads up Fujitsu's Next Generation Technical Computing Unit. As part of his presentation, he revealed that their exascale supercomputer scheduled for completion in 2020, will be powered by 64-bit ARM processors that will be designed to run HPC applications. RIKEN, Japan's largest and most prestigious scientific research institute, will be the recipient of the future system. The HPC processor design work will be done in collaboration with ARM Holdings, the firm that develops and licenses ARM intellectual property. This Post-K system represents the fourth generation of Fujitsu's \"K\" supercomputing line, which up until now was based on SPARC64 processors. The original K computer, installed five years ago, was an 8-petaflop supercomputer, which in 2011 was the number one system on the TOP500 list. It used the SPARC64 VIIIfx processor as the CPU, which was designed and developed specifically for supercomputing. The K computer was subsequently updated to over 11 petaflops, and is currently perched in the number five slot on the list. Two later versions of that processor, the SPARC64 IXfx and the SPARC XIfx, were developed for the FX10 and FX100 supercomputer lines, respectively. It's unclear how many total HPC systems Fujitsu built with these SPARC64 chips, but currently there are only seven on the TOP500 list, including the original K. Assuming these represent most or all the deployments, Fujitsu didn't get much payback from those development efforts. With that in mind, it's not all that surprising that the company decided to forego the SPARC64 in favor of a more mainstream architecture. Fujitsu never joined the OpenPower consortium, so a Power CPU was not in the cards. The Post-K developers could have opted for x86, using both Xeons and Xeon Phi processors (or Tesla GPUs, for that matter), but Fujitsu already provides those options in its PRIMERGY line. PRIMERGY is the company's HPC cluster offering, although these systems can get quite large, as in the 25-petaflop Oakforest-PACS supercomputer, which is scheduled to boot up later this year. The Post-K system for RIKEN was always intended to be a more custom endeavor, not just in the processor department, but also with regard to the system network, which in this case will be Fujitsu's Tofu interconnect that will be inherited from the FX10 and FX100. At some point, we assume the Post-K design will be productized (FX1000?), but it's probably a little too early to be thinking about exascale systems that sell by the dozens. In retrospect, selecting ARM for their exascale systems makes a good deal of sense. Fujitsu will be able to leverage the very large ecosystem that surrounds that architecture, while still being able to provide differentiation based on their implementation of the chip. The intent here is to build an ARM architecture geared to HPC workloads, with the level of floating point performance that that implies. That means the chip will offer much more powerful vector processing capabilities than are currently available in ARMv8, as well as other features associated with muscular architectures like the SPARC64. One could speculate that ARM was also chosen for its energy-efficiency cred. Designing a manycore CPU, which the Post-K processor will almost certainly be, with a simpler RISC core as its base, is inherently more efficient than trying to do that with a more complex architecture like SPARC64. But by the time you add all the HPC goodies into the mix, the result is probably not going to be all that different than say, a Xeon Phi. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of experience in the ARM community on how to optimize performance per watt. Significantly, Fujitsu is not alone in this effort. It will work with ARM Holdings to develop the HPC extensions to the ARMv8 specification, which presumably will be available to any licensee. There may be other vendors involved as well. While Fujitsu is spearheading this work, the company is characterizing its role as \"the lead partner of the ARM HPC extension effort.\" Cavium, which makes ARM ThunderX server processors, seems to be quite excited to see this roadmap move forward. While at ISC, company representatives told TOP500 News that the HPC ARM effort will not only provide a common specification for the technology, but also a lot of the critical system software, which will be developed as a result of the related exascale project for RIKEN. And this being HPC, a lot of that software will end up in open source repositories for everyone to use. Any new architecture that results from the ARMv8 upgrade won't affect Cavium's ThunderX2 chip, which is already in the pipeline, but maybe their 3rd-generation chip will be able to incorporate the new specification. Other ARM chip vendors with an eye on the HPC market - AppliedMicro and AMD come to mind - could also be interested in such projects. At this point, the timeline for the HPC ARM specification is unknown, as are the specifics of its features and capabilities. But not for long. On August 22nd, at the Hot Chips Conference in Cupertino, California, all of these questions should be answered.

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) called for a group of scientists and industry representatives to discuss what would be the best use of the machine. The committee recommended, in addition to nine priority issues including, environment, energy, and medicine, four exploratory challenges, including brain science and artificial intelligence. Recently, Prof. Kenji Doya of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and colleagues from four other Japanese institutes were awarded a grant from the MEXT to create a computer model of the whole brain and brain-like artificial intelligence using the post K supercomputer. The team consists of seven groups from five institutes, OIST, Kyoto University, Riken, the University of Electro-Communications, and the University of Tokyo. Prof. Doya will take the lead in the brain science side while Prof. Shin Ishii of Kyoto University will lead the artificial intelligence aspects. The grant allows the team to hire eight new researchers to work on the research and development. Together, over the next four years, the team will develop a brain simulation model that realizes flexible decisions and learning. They will also implement artificial intelligence that can perceive the world and make decisions in a similar way as the brain. In order to do this, they are looking at the three main components of the brain: the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. \"We believe that each of these parts of the brain perform specific types of computation and have different learning algorithms,\" Doya, head of OIST's Neural Computation Unit said. \"Therefore, I have created a team that has expertise in the main brain components. This way, we can bring knowledge from all of the components to see how the brain works together.\" Another necessary ingredient to success in building a simulated model is access to data from actual brains. \"We are collaborating with the Brain/MINDS project in Japan for a large amount of data from the marmoset brain,\" Doya said. \"They are systematically gathering anatomical and activity data from the whole brain down to the neuron level.\" Currently, neuroscience researchers have theories about how the brain works, but there is not a realistic simulation to test whether the brain can really work that way in a whole brain scale down to the details of single neurons. \"The basic aim of our project is to test whether the models of the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia constructed from the experimental data can actually perform the kind of computations we expect for them,\" Doya said. \"Our final goal is to see how those processing units of the brain fluidly work together for perception, movements and thoughts.\" From the artificial intelligence side, the major challenge is understanding the dynamic processing and learning capabilities of the brain. This is another aspect of the work the team will do during this project, which all leads to a more holistic understanding of the brain. \"This is a rare opportunity to understand by creating,\" Doya said. \"By constructing the brain with a computer, we can visualize how it is working and analyse the detail of brain function, which is normally quite difficult experimentally. In a simulation, we can modify parts of the brain and see what happens. This will allow us to understand the brain in a more interactive way.\" This knowledge could be helpful in a variety of applications, but is especially useful for diseases affecting the brain. \"For diseases, we could systematically check which factors are affecting the function of the brain model, which gives us candidates for what is causing brain diseases and allows us to explore how to fix these diseases,\" Doya said.", "url": "https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2016/7/4/can-next-generation-supercomputer-reveal-how-brain-works"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Fujitsu drops SPARC, turns to ARM for Post-K supercomputer", "date": "2016-06-21", "content": "Alternative chip architectures are taking some thunder away from Intel's x86 at this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Frankfurt.

One could speculate that ARM was also chosen for its energy-efficiency cred. Designing a manycore CPU, which the Post-K processor will almost certainly be, with a simpler RISC core as its base, is inherently more efficient than trying to do that with a more complex architecture like SPARC64. But by the time you add all the HPC goodies into the mix, the result is probably not going to be all that different than say, a Xeon Phi. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of experience in the ARM community on how to optimize performance per watt. Significantly, Fujitsu is not alone in this effort. It will work with ARM Holdings to develop the HPC extensions to the ARMv8 specification, which presumably will be available to any licensee. There may be other vendors involved as well. While Fujitsu is spearheading this work, the company is characterizing its role as \"the lead partner of the ARM HPC extension effort.\" Cavium, which makes ARM ThunderX server processors, seems to be quite excited to see this roadmap move forward. While at ISC, company representatives told TOP500 News that the HPC ARM effort will not only provide a common specification for the technology, but also a lot of the critical system software, which will be developed as a result of the related exascale project for RIKEN. And this being HPC, a lot of that software will end up in open source repositories for everyone to use. Any new architecture that results from the ARMv8 upgrade won't affect Cavium's ThunderX2 chip, which is already in the pipeline, but maybe their 3rd-generation chip will be able to incorporate the new specification. Other ARM chip vendors with an eye on the HPC market - AppliedMicro and AMD come to mind - could also be interested in such projects. At this point, the timeline for the HPC ARM specification is unknown, as are the specifics of its features and capabilities. But not for long. On August 22nd, at the Hot Chips Conference in Cupertino, California, all of these questions should be answered. Nigel Stephens, Lead ISA Architect and ARM Fellow, will present the new architecture in a talk titled, \"ARMv8 - A Next Generation Vector Architecture for HPC.\" In any case, the HPC processor story just got a whole lot more interesting. Having a vanilla 64-bit ARM platform for generic datacenter work and technical codes that are easy to parallelize is one thing; providing a performance-oriented design in an architecture that can be licensed by anyone is a potential game-changer.", "url": "https://www.top500.org/news/fujitsu-switches-horses-for-post-k-supercomputer-will-ride-arm-into-exascale/"}, {"title": "Can a Next-generation Supercomputer Reveal How the Brain Works?", "date": "2016-07-04", "content": "In the year 2020, Japan plans to launch the next generation of supercomputer called post K, which is about 100 times faster than the current flagship machine called K. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) called for a group of scientists and industry representatives to discuss what would be the best use of the machine. The committee recommended, in addition to nine priority issues including, environment, energy, and medicine, four exploratory challenges, including brain science and artificial intelligence. Recently, Prof. Kenji Doya of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and colleagues from four other Japanese institutes were awarded a grant from the MEXT to create a computer model of the whole brain and brain-like artificial intelligence using the post K supercomputer. The team consists of seven groups from five institutes, OIST, Kyoto University, Riken, the University of Electro-Communications, and the University of Tokyo. Prof. Doya will take the lead in the brain science side while Prof. Shin Ishii of Kyoto University will lead the artificial intelligence aspects. The grant allows the team to hire eight new researchers to work on the research and development. Together, over the next four years, the team will develop a brain simulation model that realizes flexible decisions and learning. They will also implement artificial intelligence that can perceive the world and make decisions in a similar way as the brain. In order to do this, they are looking at the three main components of the brain: the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. \"We believe that each of these parts of the brain perform specific types of computation and have different learning algorithms,\" Doya, head of OIST's Neural Computation Unit said. \"Therefore, I have created a team that has expertise in the main brain components. This way, we can bring knowledge from all of the components to see how the brain works together.\" Another necessary ingredient to success in building a simulated model is access to data from actual brains. \"We are collaborating with the Brain/MINDS project in Japan for a large amount of data from the marmoset brain,\" Doya said. \"They are systematically gathering anatomical and activity data from the whole brain down to the neuron level.\" Currently, neuroscience researchers have theories about how the brain works, but there is not a realistic simulation to test whether the brain can really work that way in a whole brain scale down to the details of single neurons. \"The basic aim of our project is to test whether the models of the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia constructed from the experimental data can actually perform the kind of computations we expect for them,\" Doya said. \"Our final goal is to see how those processing units of the brain fluidly work together for perception, movements and thoughts.\" From the artificial intelligence side, the major challenge is understanding the dynamic processing and learning capabilities of the brain. This is another aspect of the work the team will do during this project, which all leads to a more holistic understanding of the brain. \"This is a rare opportunity to understand by creating,\" Doya said. \"By constructing the brain with a computer, we can visualize how it is working and analyse the detail of brain function, which is normally quite difficult experimentally. In a simulation, we can modify parts of the brain and see what happens. This will allow us to understand the brain in a more interactive way.\" This knowledge could be helpful in a variety of applications, but is especially useful for diseases affecting the brain. \"For diseases, we could systematically check which factors are affecting the function of the brain model, which gives us candidates for what is causing brain diseases and allows us to explore how to fix these diseases,\" Doya said.", "url": "https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2016/7/4/can-next-generation-supercomputer-reveal-how-brain-works"}, {"title": "Japan's Post-K Computer Hits 1-2 Year Speed Bump", "date": "2016-09-08", "content": "At the HPC User Forum in Austin, Texas, Dr. Yutaka Ishikawa, project lead for RIKEN AICS, confirmed that Japan's next-generation supercomputer, the Post-K computer, has been delayed by one-to-two years, slipping from its original 2020 target to either 2021 or 2022.

With the adjusted schedule, Japan's exascale horizon has shifted closer to the US goal to stand up a productive exascale computer by no later than 2023. To be clear, Japan does not use the term exascale with respect to post-K, but has set a goal for the machine to deliver a 100x speedup (with algorithm and code optimizations) over the nation's current top number-cruncher, the K Computer (an 8.2-petaflops system).

Perhaps not surprisingly, further development of ARM is a driving force. Here are comments by project leaders from both partners: RIKEN. \"We are committed to building the ARM-based ecosystems and we want to send that message to those who are related to ARM so that those people will be excited in getting in contact with us,\" said Shig Okaya, director, Flagship 2020 Project, RIKEN.

Europe also has a major ARM project - Mont Blanc now in its third phase - that is exploring use of ARM in leadership class machines. Atos/Bull is the lead contractor. The agreement, announced last week in Japan and France, has been in the works for some time, said Okaya and Bourgoin, and is representative of the CEA-RIKEN long-term relationship. Although details are still forthcoming, the press release on the CEA website provides a worthwhile snapshot: \"The scope of the collaboration covers the development of open source software components, organized in an environment that can benefit both hardware developers and software and application developers on x86 as well as ARM architectures. The open source approach is particularly suited to combining the respective efforts of partners, bringing software environments closer to today's very different architectures and giving as much resonance to the results as possible - in particular through contributions to the OpenHPC collaborative project. \"Priority topics include environment and programming languages, execution materials, and work schedulers optimized for energy. Particular attention is paid to performance and efficiency indicators and metrics - with a focus on designing useful and cost-effective computers - as well as training and skills development. Finally, the first applications included in the collaboration concern quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, as well as the seismic behavior of nuclear installations.\" The new agreement, say both parties, \"should enable France and Japan to join forces in the global race on this strategic (HPC and exascale) subject.

Europe and Japan have both been supporters of open architectures and open source software. It also helps nation each further explore non-x86 (Intel) processors architecture. It's worth noting that ARM, founded in the U.K., was purchased last year by Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank (see HPCwire article, SoftBank will Purchase ARM Ltd for $32B). Steve Conway, IDC research vice president, HPC/HPDA, said, \"This CEA-RIKEN collaboration to advance open source software for leadership-class supercomputers, including exascale systems, makes great sense. Both organizations are among the global leaders for HPC innovations in hardware and software, and both have been strong supporters of the OpenHPC collaborative.

So the overall ecosystem [of both] will benefit,\" said Bourgoin. He singled out three critical areas for collaboration: programming environment, runtime environment, and energy-aware job scheduling. Okaya noted there are differences in the way each organization has tackled these problems but emphasized they are largely complementary. One example of tool sharing is the microkernel strategy being developed at RIKEN, which will be enriched by use of a virtualization tool (PCOCC) from CEA. At the application level, at least to start, two applications areas have been singled out: Quantum Chemistry/Molecular Dynamics. There's an early effort to port BigDFT, developed in large measure in Europe, to the K computer with follow-up work to develop libraries. Earth Sciences. Japan has leading edge seismic simulation/prediction capabilities and will work with CEA to port Japan's simulation code, GAMERA. Bourgoin noted the value of such simulations in nuclear installation evaluations and recalled that Japan and France have long collaborated on a variety of nuclear science issues. The partnership seems likely to bear fruit on several fronts. Bourgoin noted the agreement has a lengthy list of detailed deliverables and timetable for delivery. While the RIKEN effort is clearly focused on ARM, Bourgoin emphasized it is not clear which processor(s) will emerge for next generations HPC and exascale in the coming decade. Europe and CEA want to be ready for whatever mix of processor architecture landscapes arises. In addition to co-development, Bourgoin and Okaya said they would also work on HPC training issues. There is currently a lack of needed trained personnel, they agreed. How training would be addressed was not yet spelled out. It will be interesting to watch this collaboration and monitor what effect it has on accelerating ARM traction more generally. Recently, of course, Cray announced an ARM-based supercomputer project to be based in the U.K. Neither partner wanted to go on record regarding geopolitical influences on processor development generally or this collaboration specifically. Past European Commission statements have made it clear the EC would likely back a distinctly European (origin, IP, manufacture) processor alternative to the x86. Japan seems likely to share such homegrown and home-control concerns with regard to HPC technology, which is seen as an important competitive advantage for industry and science.", "url": "https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/01/19/cea-riken-partner-arm-exascale/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "France's CEA and Japan's RIKEN to Partner on ARM and Exascale", "date": "2017-01-19", "content": "France's CEA and Japan's RIKEN institute announced a multi-faceted five-year collaboration to advance HPC generally and prepare for exascale computing.

There's an early effort to port BigDFT, developed in large measure in Europe, to the K computer with follow-up work to develop libraries. Earth Sciences. Japan has leading edge seismic simulation/prediction capabilities and will work with CEA to port Japan's simulation code, GAMERA. Bourgoin noted the value of such simulations in nuclear installation evaluations and recalled that Japan and France have long collaborated on a variety of nuclear science issues. The partnership seems likely to bear fruit on several fronts. Bourgoin noted the agreement has a lengthy list of detailed deliverables and timetable for delivery. While the RIKEN effort is clearly focused on ARM, Bourgoin emphasized it is not clear which processor(s) will emerge for next generations HPC and exascale in the coming decade. Europe and CEA want to be ready for whatever mix of processor architecture landscapes arises. In addition to co-development, Bourgoin and Okaya said they would also work on HPC training issues. There is currently a lack of needed trained personnel, they agreed. How training would be addressed was not yet spelled out. It will be interesting to watch this collaboration and monitor what effect it has on accelerating ARM traction more generally. Recently, of course, Cray announced an ARM-based supercomputer project to be based in the U.K. Neither partner wanted to go on record regarding geopolitical influences on processor development generally or this collaboration specifically. Past European Commission statements have made it clear the EC would likely back a distinctly European (origin, IP, manufacture) processor alternative to the x86. Japan seems likely to share such homegrown and home-control concerns with regard to HPC technology, which is seen as an important competitive advantage for industry and science.", "url": "https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/01/19/cea-riken-partner-arm-exascale/"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Fujitsu Completes Post-K Supercomputer CPU Prototype, Begins Functionality Trials", "date": "2018-06-21", "content": "Fujitsu Limited and RIKEN today announced that the joint development of post-K, a supercomputer that the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has set forth as a successor to the K computer, is moving forward, with the goal of beginning full operations around 2021.

The system, known as Post-K, is scheduled to begin operation in 2021. The announcement took place at the Hot Chips conference that was held in Silicon Valley earlier this week. The A64FX is made up of 8,786 million transistors and will be manufactured with 7nm process technology. It will be the first CPU to implement Arm's Scalable Vector Extension, an instruction set designed specifically for high performance computing. As we reported in June, Fujitsu has already produced a prototype of the processor and had begun its initial testing. In conjunction with that announcement, the company revealed some of the basic details of the CPU, including its core count and the SIMD vector width. At the Hot Chips event, Fujitsu's Toshio Yoshida provided a much deeper dive into the microarchitecture and its performance profile. As the first SVE Arm chip, the A64FX has put up some decent floating point performance numbers: over 2.7 teraflops for 64-bit operations, over 5.4 teraflops for 32-bit operations, and over 10.8 teraflops for 16-bit operations. The latter two are especially important for deep learning applications, which traditionally use the lower precision FP32 and FP16 for training neural networks. The A64X also has implemented integer dot product operations for 16-bit and 8-bit formats, which can be used for inferencing those same networks. Fujitsu says the new CPU can achieve more than 21.6 teraops using INT8 and more than 10.8 teraops for INT16. Although floating point performance is certainly respectable, its only about 35 percent faster than the top-of-the-line Xeon Skylake CPUs and more than 20 percent slower than the now-defunct Xeon Phi CPUs. It's not hard to imagine that Intel will be producing floppier CPUs in the same 2021 timeframe for its Aurora exascale supercomputer, either with the Ice Lake Xeon CPUs or the unconfirmed Xeon AP processors. On the other hand, by providing only low-end performance estimates for the A64FX, Fujitsu may be hinting that it will boost those numbers by the time the final silicon rolls out in a couple of years. Flops aren't everything, but they do give us some idea of the number of processors that will be required for an exascale machine. Using the conservative 2.7 teraflops/chip estimate, it will take more than 370 thousand of these chips to get to a peak exaflop and probably more like 400 thousand to achieve an exaflop on Linpack or on a really floating-point-intensive application. Since Fujitsu is planning to put just a single A64FX in each Post-K node, that 400 thousand number also translates to the node count. Given that Post-K will have 384 nodes per rack, the system would need more than 1,000 such racks in the final exascale machine. Again, Fujitsu could improve the peak flops if it continues to refine the chip over the next two years. Regardless, the large number of nodes points to the need for a high- performance interconnect. For that, the A64FX will be equipped with an on-chip network controller that will route data over the system's Tofu fabric. For Post-K, this fabric will be a 6D mesh/torus with each processor providing 2 lanes, each with 10 ports at 28 Gbps. That works out to 560 Gbps per CPU or node. Another standout is memory bandwidth. In this regard, the A64FX will deliver up to 1024 GB/second per CPU using 32GB of on-package HBM2 memory. According to Fujitsu, they are able to achieve over 830 GB/second on the Stream Triad benchmark, a yield of over 80 percent of the processor's peak bandwidth. Fujitsu made no mention of connecting this chip to conventional DDR memory. Internally, the 48+4 cores are divided into four Core Memory Groups, or CMGs. A CME is 13 cores, which consists of 12 compute core and one assistant core. The latter handles OS functions like I/O and daemon processing. Each of the 13 cores is equipped with 64 KB of L1 cache, which can transfer data at more than 11 TB/second. Each CMG comes with 8MB of L2 cache, which operates at over 3.6 TB/second. The L2 cache is hooked into a memory controller and an interface to the network- on-chip. The NoC talks to the other CMGs, as well as the Tofu and PCIe controllers. On average, the A64FX is about 2.5 times faster than the SPARC64 XIfx, the company previous high performance CPU, across a range of HPC and AI workloads. The processor is particularly fast in areas like fluid dynamics and seismic wave propagation, where it recorded a 3.0x and 3.4x speedup, respectively. On the software front, Fujitsu and RIKEN, the customer for the Post-K machine, are co-developing software for both the A64FX processor and the system itself. Linaro, a developer of Arm-based system software and tools, as well as various open source and ISV developers, will also be contributing. By the time 2021 rolls around, expect to see a full stack of HPC software components, including Linux, C/C++ and Fortran compilers, debuggers, MPI, OpenMP, math libraries, resource managers, and Lustre, among others.", "url": "https://www.top500.org/news/fujitsu-reveals-details-of-processor-that-will-power-post-k-supercomputer/"}, {"title": "Fujitsu Presents Post-K CPU Specifications", "date": "2018-08-22", "content": "Fujitsu today announced publication of specifications for the A64FX\u2122 CPU to be featured in the post-K computer, a supercomputer being developed by Fujitsu and RIKEN as a successor to the K computer, which achieved the world's highest performance in 2011. The organizations are striving to achieve post-K application execution performance up to 100 times that of the K computer. A64FX is the world's first CPU to adopt the Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), an extension of Armv8-A instruction set architecture for supercomputers. Building on over 60 years' worth of Fujitsu-developed microarchitecture, this chip offers peak performance of over 2.7 TFLOPS, demonstrating superior HPC and AI performance. Fujitsu made the announcement at Hot Chips 30(1), an international symposium on high performance processors and related technologies held in Silicon Valley, California from August 19-21. Post-K is the successor to the K computer which in 2011 achieved the highest ranking in the world on the TOP500 list of supercomputers around the world. Fujitsu and RIKEN are developing post-K, aiming for starting operation around 2021. A64FX is the high-performance CPU that will be used in post-K. It offers a number of features, including broad utility supporting a wide range of applications, massive parallelization through the Tofu interconnect, low power consumption, and mainframe-class reliability. A64FX is the world's first CPU to adopt the SVE of Arm Limited's Armv8-A instruction set architecture, extended for supercomputers. Fujitsu collaborated with Arm, contributing to the development of the SVE as a lead partner, and adopted the results in the A64FX. Fujitsu developed the microarchitecture of the A64FX by building on the technology of its previous supercomputers, mainframes, and UNIX servers. With hardware technology that draws out the high memory bandwidth of high performance stacked memory, the system can efficiently utilize the CPU's high functional computational processing units, enabling delivery of high application execution performance. The CPUs will be directly connected by the proprietary Tofu interconnect developed for the K computer, improving parallel performance. The system can provide a peak double precision (64 bit) floating point operations performance of over 2.7 TFLOPS, with a computational throughput twice that amount for single precision (32 bit), and four times that amount for half precision (16 bit). In other words, by using single precision or half precision operations, applications can get results even faster. Fujitsu has also enhanced computational performance for 16 bit and 8 bit integer operations. Accordingly, this CPU is suited for a wide range of fields such as big data and AI, not just for the computer simulations at which traditional supercomputers excel.

The next-generation machine, dubbed the Post-K supercomputer, follows the two collaborators' development of the 8 petaflops K supercomputer that commenced operations for Riken in 2012, and which has since been upgraded to 11 petaflops in application processing speed. Now the aim is to \"create the world's highest performing supercomputer,\" with \"up to one hundred times the application execution performance of the K computer,\" Fujitsu declared in a press release on 21 June. The plan is to install the souped-up machine at the government-affiliated Riken around 2021. If the partners achieve those execution speeds, that would place the Post-K machine in exascale territory. To do this, they have replaced the SPARC64 VIIIfx CPU powering the K computer with the Arm8A-SVE 512-bit architecture that's been enhanced for supercomputer use, and which both Fujitsu and Riken had a hand in developing. The new design runs on CPUs with 48 cores plus 2 assistant cores for the computational nodes, and with 48 cores plus 4 assistant cores for the I/O and computational nodes. The system structure uses 1 CPU per node, and 384 nodes make up one rack. For strategic reasons, neither Fujitsu nor Riken will reveal how many nodes they are targeting with the Post-K. However, Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the Riken Center for Computational Sciences in Kobe, says, \"It will be the largest Arm system in the world and in fact, likely the largest supercomputer in the world.\" For system interconnection, Fujitsu is employing its Tofu 6D Mesh/Torus topology originally created for the K computer. Besides the adoption of a new CPU, several other key technologies are behind the Post-K's ramp up in execution speed, says Matsuoka. Memory bandwidth has been increased by \"more than an order of magnitude,\" and network bandwidth has also significantly increased. In addition, Fujitsu has enhanced the double-precision arithmetic performance of that found on the K computer. And to increase application versatility, it has also added support for half-precision floating-point arithmetic that reduces memory loads in applications like AI, where lower precision is acceptable, explains Koji Uchikawa, in Fujitsu's business strategy and development division. As well as adopting the Arm instruction-set architecture, Fujitsu worked with Arm Limited, the Cambridgeshire, England-based company that develops and licenses Arm technology, to implement new instructions for the scalable vector extension. shortcode ieee-pullquote quote=\"\"We, Fujitsu, and other collaborators will drive the Arm ecosystem in the high-end server space.\"\" float=\"left\" expand=1 Moreover, Fujitsu has developed its own microarchitecture for the chip. Whereas a processor's instruction-set architecture interfaces between the hardware and software to provide instructions to the processor, it does not define the chip's internal structure. Rather, that is the job of the microarchitecture, and because it directly impacts the processor's performance, Fujitsu believes this will be an important differentiating factor in its favor. Riken and Fujitsu see several other advantages in adopting the new architecture, not least the design's inherent power-saving features, such as power knobs that dial down the power in certain elements of the CPU when they are not needed. Consequently, Fujitsu is claiming a power consumption of just 30 to 40 megawatts compared to the K computer's 12.7 MW-despite the Post-K's target of delivering up to a hundredfold increase in application processing speed. Both Fujitsu and Riken say they also intend to leverage Arm's large software ecosystem. \"We, Fujitsu, and other collaborators will drive the Arm ecosystem in the high-end server space,\" says Riken's Matsuoka. This, he adds, will help contribute to any commercial success Fujitsu has \"in selling not only their systems but also the chip to external companies.\" At the same time, Fujitsu \"will provide a compatible performance balance with the K computer so that current applications can be migrated after recompiling,\" says Uchikawa. But the supercomputer race is nothing if not a game of hopscotch. For the first time in six years, the United States has just regained the top slot in global rankings of supercomputer performance with the newly installed Summit supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee. According to June's TOP500 assessment, Summit achieved a performance of 122.3 petaflops, bumping China's Sunway to second place with a performance of 93 petaflops. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Sierra came in third with 71.6 petaflops. So when the Post-K comes online around 2021, it will find no shortage of competitors vying for the leading position. Nevertheless, Riken's Matsuoka brushes aside such comparisons. \"Catalog flops is not our concern. For most applications, Post-K will likely exhibit the fastest time-to-solution and utmost scalability due to its brilliant memory and network bandwidths, as well as an outstanding power-efficient design.\" No doubt it won't be long before competitors beg to differ.

The system, known as Post-K, is scheduled to begin operation in 2021. The announcement took place at the Hot Chips conference that was held in Silicon Valley earlier this week. The A64FX is made up of 8,786 million transistors and will be manufactured with 7nm process technology. It will be the first CPU to implement Arm's Scalable Vector Extension, an instruction set designed specifically for high performance computing. As we reported in June, Fujitsu has already produced a prototype of the processor and had begun its initial testing. In conjunction with that announcement, the company revealed some of the basic details of the CPU, including its core count and the SIMD vector width. At the Hot Chips event, Fujitsu's Toshio Yoshida provided a much deeper dive into the microarchitecture and its performance profile. As the first SVE Arm chip, the A64FX has put up some decent floating point performance numbers: over 2.7 teraflops for 64-bit operations, over 5.4 teraflops for 32-bit operations, and over 10.8 teraflops for 16-bit operations. The latter two are especially important for deep learning applications, which traditionally use the lower precision FP32 and FP16 for training neural networks. The A64X also has implemented integer dot product operations for 16-bit and 8-bit formats, which can be used for inferencing those same networks. Fujitsu says the new CPU can achieve more than 21.6 teraops using INT8 and more than 10.8 teraops for INT16. Although floating point performance is certainly respectable, its only about 35 percent faster than the top-of-the-line Xeon Skylake CPUs and more than 20 percent slower than the now-defunct Xeon Phi CPUs. It's not hard to imagine that Intel will be producing floppier CPUs in the same 2021 timeframe for its Aurora exascale supercomputer, either with the Ice Lake Xeon CPUs or the unconfirmed Xeon AP processors. On the other hand, by providing only low-end performance estimates for the A64FX, Fujitsu may be hinting that it will boost those numbers by the time the final silicon rolls out in a couple of years. Flops aren't everything, but they do give us some idea of the number of processors that will be required for an exascale machine. Using the conservative 2.7 teraflops/chip estimate, it will take more than 370 thousand of these chips to get to a peak exaflop and probably more like 400 thousand to achieve an exaflop on Linpack or on a really floating-point-intensive application.

Now, Fujitsu is revealing some details on the third generation of its Torus Fusion, or Tofu, interconnect for lashing together those Arm server nodes into a powerful, exascale class machine that will come to market sometime in 2021. The Post-K system is being funded with $910 million through the Flagship 2020 project and was started back in 2014, two years after the \"Project Keisuko\" K supercomputer and the original Tofu interconnect went into production. After six years of being in the field, the K system, which cost $1.2 billion to develop and manufacture, is still one of the most efficient systems in terms of network and computational efficiency on a wide variety of workloads. The Post-K machine has to not only support traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads, but must also support a certain amount of machine learning and data analytics workloads while also scaling to offer more than 100X the performance of the original K machine on applications. Some of the changes to the third generation of the Tofu 6D mesh/torus network, which is now being called Tofu D, appear to be aimed at this wider variety of workloads and to offering much greater node scalability than was available with Tofu 1 or Tofu 2. Two years ago, Fujitsu and RIKEN made a lot of noise when they announced the Post-K machine would be based on an Arm architecture. We talked about the prototype of the Post-K system back in June in the wake of the ISC18 supercomputing conference in Germany, which was around the same time as when Fujitsu was showing off the prototype machine at a forum in Japan. Back then, we learned a bit about the 64-bit Arm processor, which has special vector instructions created in conjunction by Arm Holdings and Fujitsu and available for others to implement if they so choose, and we also discovered that the Post-K chip would have a single interconnect interface on the die that was labeled Tofu 3. This week, at the IEEE Cluster 2018 conference, researchers working at the Next Generation Technical Computing Unit and the AI Platform Business Unit at Fujitsu presented the architecture of the Tofu D interconnect and also published a companion paper on the setup. It is the first look that Fujitsu has given of Tofu D. It is reasonable to expect that an exascale machine would require very high bandwidth - something on the order of 200 Gb/sec or even 400 Gb/sec interconnects with lanes running at 50 GHz or even 100 GHz - but oddly enough the Tofu D interconnect will only feature a modest 8.8 percent increase in clock speed of the communications circuits, yielding a data rate per lane of 28 Gb/sec compared to 25.8 Gb/sec for the Tofu 2 interconnect but still 4.5X more oomph per lane than the original Tofu interconnect. The number of lanes coming out of the Tofu interconnect is intimately related to the number of channels coming out of main memory in the processor complex, which is one of the secrets of the outstanding performance that the K supercomputer and its successors in the PrimePower FX10 and FX100 commercial supercomputers made by Fujitsu deliver on real world applications. With the K supercomputer, the \"Venus\" Sparc64-VIIIfx processor had eight cores and eight memory channels running out to DDR3 DRAM memory. The Tofu 1 network router - that is what it really is, as opposed to a simple network interface card - was implemented as an external interconnect controller chip that had four network interfaces and a total of ten ports with 8 lanes each for a total of 80 signal lanes. (The diagram above does a bad job explaining this.) With a data rate per lane of 6.25 Gb/sec, the total link bandwidth across the Tofu1 network interface was 5 GB/sec and with four interfaces, that gave a total injection bandwidth of 20 GB/sec per node. The idea was to keep that DRAM main memory fed. With Tofu 2, which was available in the PrimeHPC FX100 systems, everything got cranked up a bunch of notches, but oddly enough, the number of signaling lanes on the Tofu interconnect went down. The PrimeHPC FX100 systems were based on the 32-core Sparc64-XIfx processor, as we have explained in detail here. The Tofu 2 router was brought onto the chip, which cut down on a lot of latencies, and at the same time the core complex on the chip was split into two Core Memory Groups, or CMGs, each sharing four Tofu network interfaces that split across them on the internal bus of the chip. Each of the core groups had four Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) stacked memory interfaces, so once again, you had a Tofu network interface for each memory bank, albeit they were shared across the CMGs. Here's the important architectural bit: The Sparc64-XIfx chip had HMC memory stacked eight chips high and had four Tofu network interfaces to attack those stacks. The signaling rate on Tofu 2 was jacked way up to 25 GHz, but the lanes were can back to 40 to match the reduction in memory ports on the chip. The net was that the Tofu 2 link bandwidth went up to 12.5 GB/sec, a factor of 2.5X increase over Tofu 1, which may not have precisely match the quadrupling in cores but it was as close as Fujitsu could get it within a tight thermal envelope. The Tofu 2 interconnect had ten ports, moving in both directions, and that yielded 125 GB/sec into and out of the chip and an injection bandwidth of 50 GB/sec per processor, a factor of 2.25X larger than Tofu 1 in the K system. With the A64FX and its Tofu D interconnect, there are going to be four core groups, each with 12 worker cores and one helper core. (We think that there are three more latent cores in each group that are not activated because Fujitsu expects about that dud rate using the 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, its foundry.) The CMGs are all linked to each other over a ring bus, for a total of 48 worker cores, and the Tofu network interfaces hook into that same bus as a group and on the same die. Each processor has its own High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) memory, which is stacked four chips high instead of eight with the HMC, and that means the number of off chip channels to memory were cut in half. Thus, Fujitsu could go to the other side of the chip with the Tofu interconnect and once again cut the number of lanes in half to 20. Here's the interesting bit. To better balance out the way these 20 lanes, which run at 28 GHz, operate, Fujitsu added two more network interfaces for a total of six. With fewer lanes per port and only a modest speed increase, the link bandwidth per port actually fell by 45.6 percent to 6.8 GB/sec, which is only 36 percent higher than the Tofu 1 interconnect used in the K machine. But because there are 50 percent more network interfaces with Tofu D compared to either Tofu 1 or Tofu 2, the injection bandwidth comes in at 40.8 percent - twice that of Tofu 1 and 81.6 percent that of Tofu 2. That is a good tradeoff and yields more balanced performance between the compute and memory complexes and the network; we think that the Post-K machine will have well north of 300,000 nodes, and it is therefore going to also have to take the power down in the network while extending its scalability, which is why Fujitsu did not go to 50 GHz or 100 GHz lane signaling as the Ethernet and InfiniBand crowd are. The D in Tofu D is has triple meaning: It will be a dual rail network, rather than single rail like Tofu 1 and Tofu 2; it is all about integrating more network resources in a smaller node to increase the density of the overall Post-K system; and there is dynamic packet slicing on the Tofu protocol to provide more fault resilience. The K supercomputer and its follow-ons in the PrimeHPC FX100 line as well as the Post-K machine seek to have high injection bandwidth - which expresses how fast a near node in the cluster can jam data into a node or pull it out - as opposed to focusing on bi-section bandwidth - which expresses how a data exchange across the whole network would perform.

The so-called \" post-K \" is a supercomputer that the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has chosen as a successor to the K computer, is moving forward, with the goal of beginning full operations around 2021. Fujitsu has now completed the prototype central processing unit chip that will serve as the core of post-K, commencing functionality field trials. With post-K, Fujitsu and Riken aim to create the world's highest-performing supercomputer, capable of tackling a broad range of applications to solve problems not only in the area of science and technology, but to play a role in a wide variety of issues in society. To realize this goal, Fujitsu has adopted the widely used Arm instruction set architecture in the CPU, while implementing expanded instructions newly formulated for supercomputers. In addition to further enhancing the high memory bandwidth and double- precision arithmetic performance implemented in the K computer, Fujitsu has also added support for half-precision arithmetic, which remains critical to fields like AI. Now, by verifying the initial operation of prototype CPU chips meeting these design standards, Fujitsu and RIKEN have smoothly cleared an important milestone in system development. Moving forward, Fujitsu and Riken say they will continue development with a view to completing post-K and commencing full operations. Akira Kabemoto, head of the service platform business at Fujitsu, says: \"We are extremely pleased to announce genuine progress in the development of the post-K computer. Fujitsu has been developing and delivering the world's top level supercomputers for over 40 years. \"The use of supercomputers has expanded beyond contributing to the development of science and technology through simulation to encompass areas like AI, emphasizing their importance as part of the infrastructure of society. With post-K, I believe we've combined all the various, cutting-edge technologies we have developed until now to create the world's leading supercomputer. \"We hope this will ultimately contribute to the achievement of an abundant, human-centric future filled with dreams.\" Satoshi Matsuoka, director, Riken Center for Computational Science, says: \"Because an architecture suited for high-performance computing was co-designed by Fujitsu and R-CCS, the post-K processors are expected to deliver performance far surpassing that of existing general-purpose server processors for many supercomputer applications, and considerably raising the system's usability by using a broad software ecosystem through the adoption of the Arm instruction set, while at the same time delivering top-class performance not just in simulations, but also in a wide range of fields related to Society 5.0, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, security and blockchain technology, big data, and IoT. \"In this way, I am certain that post-K will not only contribute world-leading performance to meet the concerns of the people of Japan, it will also be a sign of the revitalization of Japan's semiconductor technology. \"Having now verified the operation of the prototype CPU as planned, we have cleared a major step in the path to full operation of post-K around 2021, as well as toward subsequent developments. \"Going forward, R-CCS intends to even more vigorously pursue research and development, in collaboration with other related parties, in order to begin operations using post-K, the world's top supercomputer, as soon as possible. Please look forward to it.\" Drew Henry, senior vice president and general manager, infrastructure line of business, Arm, says: \"Arm has been deeply engaged with both Fujitsu and RIKEN, working to build an HPC ecosystem for the Armv8-A SVE architecture, opening a new chapter for Arm technology to scale the levels of vector processing. \"Our collaboration with Fujitsu and Riken represents our ongoing commitment to maximizing the success of the post-K design and marks a significant step toward deploying Arm-based technologies for HPC and potentially for a broader set of emerging applications.\"", "url": "https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2018/07/10/fujitsu-completes-post-k-supercomputer-prototype-and-begins-trials/18162/"}, {"title": "Fujitsu Reveals Details of Processor That Will Power Post-K Supercomputer", "date": "2018-08-22", "content": "Fujitsu has announced the specifications for A64FX, an Arm CPU that will power Japan's first exascale supercomputer. The system, known as Post-K, is scheduled to begin operation in 2021. The announcement took place at the Hot Chips conference that was held in Silicon Valley earlier this week. The A64FX is made up of 8,786 million transistors and will be manufactured with 7nm process technology. It will be the first CPU to implement Arm's Scalable Vector Extension, an instruction set designed specifically for high performance computing. As we reported in June, Fujitsu has already produced a prototype of the processor and had begun its initial testing. In conjunction with that announcement, the company revealed some of the basic details of the CPU, including its core count and the SIMD vector width. At the Hot Chips event, Fujitsu's Toshio Yoshida provided a much deeper dive into the microarchitecture and its performance profile. As the first SVE Arm chip, the A64FX has put up some decent floating point performance numbers: over 2.7 teraflops for 64-bit operations, over 5.4 teraflops for 32-bit operations, and over 10.8 teraflops for 16-bit operations. The latter two are especially important for deep learning applications, which traditionally use the lower precision FP32 and FP16 for training neural networks. The A64X also has implemented integer dot product operations for 16-bit and 8-bit formats, which can be used for inferencing those same networks. Fujitsu says the new CPU can achieve more than 21.6 teraops using INT8 and more than 10.8 teraops for INT16. Although floating point performance is certainly respectable, its only about 35 percent faster than the top-of-the-line Xeon Skylake CPUs and more than 20 percent slower than the now-defunct Xeon Phi CPUs. It's not hard to imagine that Intel will be producing floppier CPUs in the same 2021 timeframe for its Aurora exascale supercomputer, either with the Ice Lake Xeon CPUs or the unconfirmed Xeon AP processors. On the other hand, by providing only low-end performance estimates for the A64FX, Fujitsu may be hinting that it will boost those numbers by the time the final silicon rolls out in a couple of years. Flops aren't everything, but they do give us some idea of the number of processors that will be required for an exascale machine. Using the conservative 2.7 teraflops/chip estimate, it will take more than 370 thousand of these chips to get to a peak exaflop and probably more like 400 thousand to achieve an exaflop on Linpack or on a really floating-point-intensive application. Since Fujitsu is planning to put just a single A64FX in each Post-K node, that 400 thousand number also translates to the node count. Given that Post-K will have 384 nodes per rack, the system would need more than 1,000 such racks in the final exascale machine. Again, Fujitsu could improve the peak flops if it continues to refine the chip over the next two years. Regardless, the large number of nodes points to the need for a high- performance interconnect. For that, the A64FX will be equipped with an on-chip network controller that will route data over the system's Tofu fabric. For Post-K, this fabric will be a 6D mesh/torus with each processor providing 2 lanes, each with 10 ports at 28 Gbps. That works out to 560 Gbps per CPU or node. Another standout is memory bandwidth. In this regard, the A64FX will deliver up to 1024 GB/second per CPU using 32GB of on-package HBM2 memory. According to Fujitsu, they are able to achieve over 830 GB/second on the Stream Triad benchmark, a yield of over 80 percent of the processor's peak bandwidth. Fujitsu made no mention of connecting this chip to conventional DDR memory. Internally, the 48+4 cores are divided into four Core Memory Groups, or CMGs. A CME is 13 cores, which consists of 12 compute core and one assistant core. The latter handles OS functions like I/O and daemon processing. Each of the 13 cores is equipped with 64 KB of L1 cache, which can transfer data at more than 11 TB/second. Each CMG comes with 8MB of L2 cache, which operates at over 3.6 TB/second. The L2 cache is hooked into a memory controller and an interface to the network- on-chip. The NoC talks to the other CMGs, as well as the Tofu and PCIe controllers. On average, the A64FX is about 2.5 times faster than the SPARC64 XIfx, the company previous high performance CPU, across a range of HPC and AI workloads. The processor is particularly fast in areas like fluid dynamics and seismic wave propagation, where it recorded a 3.0x and 3.4x speedup, respectively. On the software front, Fujitsu and RIKEN, the customer for the Post-K machine, are co-developing software for both the A64FX processor and the system itself. Linaro, a developer of Arm-based system software and tools, as well as various open source and ISV developers, will also be contributing.

With hardware technology that draws out the high memory bandwidth of high performance stacked memory, the system can efficiently utilize the CPU's high functional computational processing units, enabling delivery of high application execution performance. The CPUs will be directly connected by the proprietary Tofu interconnect developed for the K computer, improving parallel performance. The system can provide a peak double precision (64 bit) floating point operations performance of over 2.7 TFLOPS, with a computational throughput twice that amount for single precision (32 bit), and four times that amount for half precision (16 bit). In other words, by using single precision or half precision operations, applications can get results even faster.

Now, Fujitsu is revealing some details on the third generation of its Torus Fusion, or Tofu, interconnect for lashing together those Arm server nodes into a powerful, exascale class machine that will come to market sometime in 2021. The Post-K system is being funded with $910 million through the Flagship 2020 project and was started back in 2014, two years after the \"Project Keisuko\" K supercomputer and the original Tofu interconnect went into production. After six years of being in the field, the K system, which cost $1.2 billion to develop and manufacture, is still one of the most efficient systems in terms of network and computational efficiency on a wide variety of workloads. The Post-K machine has to not only support traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads, but must also support a certain amount of machine learning and data analytics workloads while also scaling to offer more than 100X the performance of the original K machine on applications. Some of the changes to the third generation of the Tofu 6D mesh/torus network, which is now being called Tofu D, appear to be aimed at this wider variety of workloads and to offering much greater node scalability than was available with Tofu 1 or Tofu 2. Two years ago, Fujitsu and RIKEN made a lot of noise when they announced the Post-K machine would be based on an Arm architecture. We talked about the prototype of the Post-K system back in June in the wake of the ISC18 supercomputing conference in Germany, which was around the same time as when Fujitsu was showing off the prototype machine at a forum in Japan. Back then, we learned a bit about the 64-bit Arm processor, which has special vector instructions created in conjunction by Arm Holdings and Fujitsu and available for others to implement if they so choose, and we also discovered that the Post-K chip would have a single interconnect interface on the die that was labeled Tofu 3. This week, at the IEEE Cluster 2018 conference, researchers working at the Next Generation Technical Computing Unit and the AI Platform Business Unit at Fujitsu presented the architecture of the Tofu D interconnect and also published a companion paper on the setup. It is the first look that Fujitsu has given of Tofu D. It is reasonable to expect that an exascale machine would require very high bandwidth - something on the order of 200 Gb/sec or even 400 Gb/sec interconnects with lanes running at 50 GHz or even 100 GHz - but oddly enough the Tofu D interconnect will only feature a modest 8.8 percent increase in clock speed of the communications circuits, yielding a data rate per lane of 28 Gb/sec compared to 25.8 Gb/sec for the Tofu 2 interconnect but still 4.5X more oomph per lane than the original Tofu interconnect. The number of lanes coming out of the Tofu interconnect is intimately related to the number of channels coming out of main memory in the processor complex, which is one of the secrets of the outstanding performance that the K supercomputer and its successors in the PrimePower FX10 and FX100 commercial supercomputers made by Fujitsu deliver on real world applications. With the K supercomputer, the \"Venus\" Sparc64-VIIIfx processor had eight cores and eight memory channels running out to DDR3 DRAM memory. The Tofu 1 network router - that is what it really is, as opposed to a simple network interface card - was implemented as an external interconnect controller chip that had four network interfaces and a total of ten ports with 8 lanes each for a total of 80 signal lanes. (The diagram above does a bad job explaining this.) With a data rate per lane of 6.25 Gb/sec, the total link bandwidth across the Tofu1 network interface was 5 GB/sec and with four interfaces, that gave a total injection bandwidth of 20 GB/sec per node. The idea was to keep that DRAM main memory fed. With Tofu 2, which was available in the PrimeHPC FX100 systems, everything got cranked up a bunch of notches, but oddly enough, the number of signaling lanes on the Tofu interconnect went down. The PrimeHPC FX100 systems were based on the 32-core Sparc64-XIfx processor, as we have explained in detail here. The Tofu 2 router was brought onto the chip, which cut down on a lot of latencies, and at the same time the core complex on the chip was split into two Core Memory Groups, or CMGs, each sharing four Tofu network interfaces that split across them on the internal bus of the chip. Each of the core groups had four Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) stacked memory interfaces, so once again, you had a Tofu network interface for each memory bank, albeit they were shared across the CMGs. Here's the important architectural bit: The Sparc64-XIfx chip had HMC memory stacked eight chips high and had four Tofu network interfaces to attack those stacks. The signaling rate on Tofu 2 was jacked way up to 25 GHz, but the lanes were can back to 40 to match the reduction in memory ports on the chip. The net was that the Tofu 2 link bandwidth went up to 12.5 GB/sec, a factor of 2.5X increase over Tofu 1, which may not have precisely match the quadrupling in cores but it was as close as Fujitsu could get it within a tight thermal envelope. The Tofu 2 interconnect had ten ports, moving in both directions, and that yielded 125 GB/sec into and out of the chip and an injection bandwidth of 50 GB/sec per processor, a factor of 2.25X larger than Tofu 1 in the K system. With the A64FX and its Tofu D interconnect, there are going to be four core groups, each with 12 worker cores and one helper core. (We think that there are three more latent cores in each group that are not activated because Fujitsu expects about that dud rate using the 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, its foundry.) The CMGs are all linked to each other over a ring bus, for a total of 48 worker cores, and the Tofu network interfaces hook into that same bus as a group and on the same die. Each processor has its own High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) memory, which is stacked four chips high instead of eight with the HMC, and that means the number of off chip channels to memory were cut in half. Thus, Fujitsu could go to the other side of the chip with the Tofu interconnect and once again cut the number of lanes in half to 20. Here's the interesting bit. To better balance out the way these 20 lanes, which run at 28 GHz, operate, Fujitsu added two more network interfaces for a total of six. With fewer lanes per port and only a modest speed increase, the link bandwidth per port actually fell by 45.6 percent to 6.8 GB/sec, which is only 36 percent higher than the Tofu 1 interconnect used in the K machine. But because there are 50 percent more network interfaces with Tofu D compared to either Tofu 1 or Tofu 2, the injection bandwidth comes in at 40.8 percent - twice that of Tofu 1 and 81.6 percent that of Tofu 2. That is a good tradeoff and yields more balanced performance between the compute and memory complexes and the network; we think that the Post-K machine will have well north of 300,000 nodes, and it is therefore going to also have to take the power down in the network while extending its scalability, which is why Fujitsu did not go to 50 GHz or 100 GHz lane signaling as the Ethernet and InfiniBand crowd are. The D in Tofu D is has triple meaning: It will be a dual rail network, rather than single rail like Tofu 1 and Tofu 2; it is all about integrating more network resources in a smaller node to increase the density of the overall Post-K system; and there is dynamic packet slicing on the Tofu protocol to provide more fault resilience.

We talked about the prototype of the Post-K system back in June in the wake of the ISC18 supercomputing conference in Germany, which was around the same time as when Fujitsu was showing off the prototype machine at a forum in Japan. Back then, we learned a bit about the 64-bit Arm processor, which has special vector instructions created in conjunction by Arm Holdings and Fujitsu and available for others to implement if they so choose, and we also discovered that the Post-K chip would have a single interconnect interface on the die that was labeled Tofu 3. This week, at the IEEE Cluster 2018 conference, researchers working at the Next Generation Technical Computing Unit and the AI Platform Business Unit at Fujitsu presented the architecture of the Tofu D interconnect and also published a companion paper on the setup. It is the first look that Fujitsu has given of Tofu D. It is reasonable to expect that an exascale machine would require very high bandwidth - something on the order of 200 Gb/sec or even 400 Gb/sec interconnects with lanes running at 50 GHz or even 100 GHz - but oddly enough the Tofu D interconnect will only feature a modest 8.8 percent increase in clock speed of the communications circuits, yielding a data rate per lane of 28 Gb/sec compared to 25.8 Gb/sec for the Tofu 2 interconnect but still 4.5X more oomph per lane than the original Tofu interconnect. The number of lanes coming out of the Tofu interconnect is intimately related to the number of channels coming out of main memory in the processor complex, which is one of the secrets of the outstanding performance that the K supercomputer and its successors in the PrimePower FX10 and FX100 commercial supercomputers made by Fujitsu deliver on real world applications. With the K supercomputer, the \"Venus\" Sparc64-VIIIfx processor had eight cores and eight memory channels running out to DDR3 DRAM memory. The Tofu 1 network router - that is what it really is, as opposed to a simple network interface card - was implemented as an external interconnect controller chip that had four network interfaces and a total of ten ports with 8 lanes each for a total of 80 signal lanes. (The diagram above does a bad job explaining this.) With a data rate per lane of 6.25 Gb/sec, the total link bandwidth across the Tofu1 network interface was 5 GB/sec and with four interfaces, that gave a total injection bandwidth of 20 GB/sec per node. The idea was to keep that DRAM main memory fed. With Tofu 2, which was available in the PrimeHPC FX100 systems, everything got cranked up a bunch of notches, but oddly enough, the number of signaling lanes on the Tofu interconnect went down. The PrimeHPC FX100 systems were based on the 32-core Sparc64-XIfx processor, as we have explained in detail here. The Tofu 2 router was brought onto the chip, which cut down on a lot of latencies, and at the same time the core complex on the chip was split into two Core Memory Groups, or CMGs, each sharing four Tofu network interfaces that split across them on the internal bus of the chip. Each of the core groups had four Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) stacked memory interfaces, so once again, you had a Tofu network interface for each memory bank, albeit they were shared across the CMGs. Here's the important architectural bit: The Sparc64-XIfx chip had HMC memory stacked eight chips high and had four Tofu network interfaces to attack those stacks. The signaling rate on Tofu 2 was jacked way up to 25 GHz, but the lanes were can back to 40 to match the reduction in memory ports on the chip. The net was that the Tofu 2 link bandwidth went up to 12.5 GB/sec, a factor of 2.5X increase over Tofu 1, which may not have precisely match the quadrupling in cores but it was as close as Fujitsu could get it within a tight thermal envelope. The Tofu 2 interconnect had ten ports, moving in both directions, and that yielded 125 GB/sec into and out of the chip and an injection bandwidth of 50 GB/sec per processor, a factor of 2.25X larger than Tofu 1 in the K system. With the A64FX and its Tofu D interconnect, there are going to be four core groups, each with 12 worker cores and one helper core. (We think that there are three more latent cores in each group that are not activated because Fujitsu expects about that dud rate using the 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, its foundry.) The CMGs are all linked to each other over a ring bus, for a total of 48 worker cores, and the Tofu network interfaces hook into that same bus as a group and on the same die. Each processor has its own High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) memory, which is stacked four chips high instead of eight with the HMC, and that means the number of off chip channels to memory were cut in half. Thus, Fujitsu could go to the other side of the chip with the Tofu interconnect and once again cut the number of lanes in half to 20. Here's the interesting bit. To better balance out the way these 20 lanes, which run at 28 GHz, operate, Fujitsu added two more network interfaces for a total of six. With fewer lanes per port and only a modest speed increase, the link bandwidth per port actually fell by 45.6 percent to 6.8 GB/sec, which is only 36 percent higher than the Tofu 1 interconnect used in the K machine. But because there are 50 percent more network interfaces with Tofu D compared to either Tofu 1 or Tofu 2, the injection bandwidth comes in at 40.8 percent - twice that of Tofu 1 and 81.6 percent that of Tofu 2. That is a good tradeoff and yields more balanced performance between the compute and memory complexes and the network; we think that the Post-K machine will have well north of 300,000 nodes, and it is therefore going to also have to take the power down in the network while extending its scalability, which is why Fujitsu did not go to 50 GHz or 100 GHz lane signaling as the Ethernet and InfiniBand crowd are. The D in Tofu D is has triple meaning: It will be a dual rail network, rather than single rail like Tofu 1 and Tofu 2; it is all about integrating more network resources in a smaller node to increase the density of the overall Post-K system; and there is dynamic packet slicing on the Tofu protocol to provide more fault resilience. The K supercomputer and its follow-ons in the PrimeHPC FX100 line as well as the Post-K machine seek to have high injection bandwidth - which expresses how fast a near node in the cluster can jam data into a node or pull it out - as opposed to focusing on bi-section bandwidth - which expresses how a data exchange across the whole network would perform.

Now, Fujitsu is revealing some details on the third generation of its Torus Fusion, or Tofu, interconnect for lashing together those Arm server nodes into a powerful, exascale class machine that will come to market sometime in 2021. The Post-K system is being funded with $910 million through the Flagship 2020 project and was started back in 2014, two years after the \"Project Keisuko\" K supercomputer and the original Tofu interconnect went into production. After six years of being in the field, the K system, which cost $1.2 billion to develop and manufacture, is still one of the most efficient systems in terms of network and computational efficiency on a wide variety of workloads. The Post-K machine has to not only support traditional HPC simulation and modeling workloads, but must also support a certain amount of machine learning and data analytics workloads while also scaling to offer more than 100X the performance of the original K machine on applications. Some of the changes to the third generation of the Tofu 6D mesh/torus network, which is now being called Tofu D, appear to be aimed at this wider variety of workloads and to offering much greater node scalability than was available with Tofu 1 or Tofu 2.

The K supercomputer was a massive system, built by Fujitsu and housed at the Riken Advanced Institute for Computational Science campus in Kobe, Japan, with more than 80,000 nodes and using Sparc64 VIIIfx processors, a derivative of the Sun Microsystems Sparc processor developed under a license agreement that pre-dated Oracle buying out Sun in 2010. It was ranked as the top supercomputer when it was launched in June 2011 with a computation speed of over 8 petaflops. And in November 2011, K became the first computer to top 10 petaflops. It was eventually surpassed as the world's fastest supercomputer by the IBM's Sequoia, but even now, eight years later, it's still in the top 20 of supercomputers in the world. What's in the Post-K supercomputer? The new system, dubbed \"Post-K,\" will feature an Arm-based processor called A64FX, a high-performance CPU developed by Fujitsu, designed for exascale systems. The chip is based off the Arm8 design, which is popular in smartphones, with 48 cores plus four \"assistant\" cores and the ability to access up to 32GB of memory per chip. A64FX is the first CPU to adopt the Scalable Vector Extension, an instruction set specifically designed for Arm-based supercomputers. Fujitsu claims A64FX will offer a peak double precision floating point operations performance of over 2.7 teraflops per chip. The system will have one CPU per node and 384 nodes per rack. That comes out to one petaflop per rack. Contrast that with Summit, the top supercomputer in the world built by IBM for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory using IBM Power9 processors and Nvidia GPUs. A Summit rack has a peak computer of 864 teraflops. Let me put it another way: IBM's Power processor and Nvidia's Tesla are about to get pwned by a derivative chip to the one in your iPhone. Fujitsu will productize the Post-K design and sell it as the successor to the Fujitsu Supercomputer PrimeHPC FX100. The company said it is also considering measures such as developing an entry-level model that will be easy to deploy, or supplying these technologies to other vendors.

Fujitsu claims the A64FX will offer a peak double precision (64-bit) floating-point operations performance of over 2.7 teraflops. That pales in comparison to the 100 TFlops for an Nvidia Tesla V100, but the A64FX has a power draw of 160 watts vs. 300 watts for the Tesla. However, there is more going on. The 32GB of on-chip HBM2 and high-speed interconnects mean a much faster internal chip, and in early tests, Fujitsu is claiming a 2.5-times performance improvement over the Sparc XIIfx chips used in the K computer.

The supercomputer, named Fugaku after Mt. Fuji, also took the top spot in three other categories that measured performance in computational methods for industrial use, artificial intelligence applications and big data analytics. It is the first time that a supercomputer has topped the rankings in the four categories, according to Riken. The Japanese supercomputer, which was jointly developed with Fujitsu Ltd. at the institute's facility in Kobe, forms a key foundation for powerful simulations used in scientific research and the development of industrial and military technologies. \"We were able to stand out in all the key specifications for supercomputers, and demonstrate it is the world's highest performing. We expect it will aid in solving difficult societal problems such as the fight against the novel coronavirus,\" said Satoshi Matsuoka, the institute's computational science center director. Shinichi Kato, president of Fujitsu IT Products Ltd., also expressed his delight, saying, \"I feel extremely happy and honored to have been involved in creating Fugaku, which has ranked as the world's No.1 .\" Fujitsu IT Products, a wholly owned unit of Fujitsu, was in charge of the production of the supercomputer. Fugaku was picked as the world's No. 1 in June after performing over 415 quadrillion computations per second, around 2.8 times faster than the Summit system developed by the U.S. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which secured the top spot in the last ranking in November 2019. Another supercomputer developed by the United States ranked No. 3, while China held both the fourth and fifth spots. Fugaku was the only Japanese supercomputer to rank in the top 10, with the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Chiba Prefecture ranking 12th. The new Riken-Fujitsu supercomputer was transported to the institute's Center for Computational Science in Kobe in May, the same location that housed its predecessor, the K supercomputer that was decommissioned last summer. Currently being operated on a trial basis for research on potential medicines to fight the novel coronavirus, Fugaku is expected to be fully operational in the business year starting April 2021. The K supercomputer, which was the world's first supercomputer to make over 10 quadrillion computations per second, ranked No. 1 in June 2011 and retained the top spot for a year. Since then, the United States has dominated the ranking together with China. The enormous costs required to develop supercomputers means Japan can only budget to develop one every few years, unlike the United States and China. The K supercomputer became the subject of controversy in 2009 as then-ruling Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker Renho, who was a member of a government panel seeking to cut spending on less urgent items in the national budget, questioned whether Japan needed to pursue the No. 1 position amid an economic crisis.", "url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/06/ebec3baa008c-japans-new-supercomputer-ranked-fastest-in-world.html"}, {"title": "ARM-based Japanese supercomputer is now the fastest in the world", "date": "2020-06-23", "content": "A Japanese supercomputer has taken the top spot in the biannual Top500 supercomputer speed ranking.

Prior to this, the \"K computer\" designed by RIKEN and Fujitsu nine years ago gained the title, with a computation speed of more than ten PetaFLOPS. Now a brief by Fujitsu explains that Fugaku's Linpack performance is approximately \"40x that of K computer\", and \"more than twice as fast as the IBM Summit system.\" Summit topped the bi-annual rankings of the TOP500 supercomputers in November last year. Fugaku is based on the ARM architecture, and as per Fujitsu, has been optimized for supercomputing applications such as \"technical and scientific simulations and artificial intelligence applications.\" It comprises over 150,000 of high performance A64FX CPUs which are inter connected with the Tofu D Interconnect high-speed network. The combination makes the supercomputer huge and \"incredibly powerful.\" The high performance A64FX CPUs are also claimed to be \"extremely energy efficient\", consuming only approximately 30 Megawatts at full power. The CPUs realize high performance per unit of power and even adopt HBM2, a high-performance stacked memory. The company mentions Fugaku's peak performance to be 537 PetaFLOPS, i.e. more than 5 * 10 to the power of 17 Floating-Point Operations per second.

But in Japan, most choirs have returned to practice rooms and concert halls, bolstered by studies here showing that with safeguards such as limiting rehearsals to 30 minutes, proper ventilation, masking and social distancing, viral hazards can be lowered substantially. Analysis by Japan's Fugaku supercomputer shows that singing does spew about three times as many potentially coronavirus -laden particles into the air as talking, but Japanese researchers wanted more detail: Does singing in different languages create more potentially infectious droplets and aerosols? The answer, simply, is yes. At least three separate studies here have shown that when it comes to emitting droplets and aerosols, not all languages are equal. Researchers were commissioned last December by the Japan Association of Classical Music Presenters, which represents professional musicians, orchestras and concert hall managers, to run an experiment involving un-masked singers. Eight professional vocalists - equally divided between male tenors and female sopranos - took turns performing short solos in a laboratory-clean room. The subjects sang excerpts from three pieces commonly performed here: A popular Japanese children's song; Beethoven's Ode to Joy; and Verdi's La Traviata. In terms of vocal emissions, it was no contest: Trilling in German and Italian generated twice as many particles per minute as crooning in Japanese. But association director Toru Niwa cautioned that the takeaway from the research shouldn't be to avoid European music during the pandemic. While several amateur singing venues have yielded super-spreader incidents, Niwa said Japan's professional choirs haven't been tainted by a single community transmission event - regardless of the language being sung - despite returning to rehearsals and performances in live music halls. \"Classical music is basically the western canon,\" he said. \"If we stopped singing in French, Italian and German, we wouldn't be able to perform anymore.\" Indeed, the quirky annual Japanese rite of belting out the finale to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony throughout the month of December accounts for a major chunk of classical music revenues here. A separate experiment by the Japan Choral Association, which represents 4,500 amateur groups, had 20 child and adult singers perform solo excerpts, pitting a Japanese graduation tune against Beethoven's Ninth. The study found that singing in Japanese propelled particles a maximum distance of about 24 inches - only about half as far as warbling in German, which flung particles up to 44 inches from a singer's mouth. \"When singing in German, we advise our members to stand at the maximum distance from each other,\" said Masakazu Umeda, secretary-general of the choral association. Umeda and Niwa explained that their studies reflect how the Japanese language - with its soft, comparatively gently-voiced consonants - leaves a lighter footprint when it comes to vocal emissions. In fact, the Japan Choral Association found that singing in nonsense syllables composed entirely of the Japanese vowels \"ah, ee, oo, eh, oh\" yielded almost no emissions at all. Guidance for school choirs from Japan's Ministry of Education directs children to wear masks and keep singers at least 6.5 feet apart, ideally in a \"plaid\" pattern, alternating positioning between rows, to make everyone more visible to an audience. Distancing singers on stage for pro ensembles means choirs must get by with just 60 singers, instead of the usual 100 or more. Opera singers have been advised not to face each other when performing, and not to walk around the stage mid-song. Niwa said that by having singers stand in the alternating plaid pattern, with at least the recommended distance between them - whether they wear masks or not - \"the risk is substantially reduced.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-covid-19-singing-choir-research-languages-super-spreader-coronavirus/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Call for Collaborative Research Projects for the Fugaku Cloud Platform", "date": "2020-10-23", "content": "The RIKEN Center for Computational Science (RIKEN R-CCS) called for collaborative research project proposals for a trial cloud-like use service using the computational resources of the supercomputer Fugaku (hereinafter called \"Fugaku Cloud Platform\") and 7 projects has started from April 2020.

The development of the new technology was announced as part of a joint project between the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University, the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo, and Fujitsu Laboratories. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami highlighted the shortcomings in disaster mitigation and the need to utilize information for efficient and safe evacuations. While tsunami observation networks in Japanese coastal waters have been strengthened since then, using the data produced from those networks to predict a tsunami's path once it hits land has gained greater urgency. This is especially true since a major earthquake is likely to hit Japan's densely populated east coast sometime in the near future. Tsunami prediction technologies will allow authorities to obtain accurate information quickly and aid them in effectively directing evacuation orders. Fujitsu, Tohoku University, and The University of Tokyo leveraged the power of Fugaku to generate training data for 20,000 possible tsunami scenarios based on high-resolution simulations. These scenarios were used to streamline an AI model that uses offshore waveform data generated by the tsunami to predict flooding before landfall at high spatial resolution. Conventional prediction technologies require the use of supercomputers and make rapid prediction systems difficult to implement. The current AI model, however, can be run in seconds on ordinary PCs. When the model was applied to a simulation of tsunami flooding in Tokyo Bay following a large earthquake, it achieved highly accurate predictions with a regular PC within seconds. The results matched tsunami flooding of the tsunami source models released by the Cabinet Office of Japan. The research team will continue to make use of Fugaku's high-speed performance in the future by training the system with additional tsunami scenarios. Doing so will help realize AI that can predict tsunami flooding over even wider areas.", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686447"}]}, {"win label": 1, "news": [{"title": "Call for Collaborative Research Projects for the Fugaku Cloud Platform", "date": "2020-10-23", "content": "The RIKEN Center for Computational Science (RIKEN R-CCS) called for collaborative research project proposals for a trial cloud-like use service using the computational resources of the supercomputer Fugaku (hereinafter called \"Fugaku Cloud Platform\") and 7 projects has started from April 2020.

Fugaku, jointly developed by the Riken research institute and leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd., was scheduled to go into full operation on April 1, but things went more smoothly than forecast. The supercomputer had already been put into partial operations to study preventive measures against the virus. It will also be utilized for a wide range of other fields, including industrial applications. In fiscal 2021, Fugaku will be used to conduct research to predict torrential rainstorms and to develop new drugs, in addition to work on anti-coronavirus measures. It is also expected to be utilized in industrial fields. When Fugaku's predecessor, the K supercomputer, started operations, businesses could only utilize about 5 percent of its total calculation capacity. But with Fugaku, they can now use around 15 percent since it began operating and that usage could rise in the future. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association is trying to find new ways to develop improved cars faster and at less expense with Fugaku. Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. is planning to use Fugaku for research to study molecular structures of rubber materials and to stop tires from deteriorating. Fugaku and its developers are also attracting more attention from foreign entities. Fujitsu announced that it has received an order to make a supercomputer system for Portugal. The system, which will use Fugaku's central processing unit, is expected to be used in academic institutions in Portugal and other European countries. Fugaku was listed No. 1 in the world on the Top 500 supercomputer calculation speed ranking last June and November with a calculation speed of more than 400 quadrillion calculations per second.

Fugaku's performance numbers are immense, with its 442 petaflops of processing power making it suitable for carrying out high-resolution, large-scale, and long-duration simulations across multiple fields of research. The interesting thing about Fugaku, however, is that while it boasts incredible computing power, it was also designed to be as easy-to-use as possible. Designed to run simple applications like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, the whole aim of Fugaku's design was to make it as widely accessible to researchers from all sectors, ranging from medicine to engineering and automotive development. The head of RIKEN's Center for Computational Science, Satoshi Matusuoka, was quoted as saying that his team aimed to build a computer, that if compared to a car, would be \"something fast, but that your grandmother could drive to the supermarket.\" Fugaku recently completed a trial run that began in April 2020, where it worked on COVID-19 research, particularly visualizing how droplets could spread the virus from the mouth and move through masks, face shields, train cars, and more. Now, the supercomputer is fully operational and will be open for shared use. Projects that will make use of Fugaku's power will be selected by the Research Organization for Information Science and Technology - who have already picked out 74 projects to be implemented beginning April 2021, but are still inviting more applications as part of a call for Trial Access Projects. Fugaku becoming fully operational marks a significant achievement for the Japanese computing industry due to it breaking the nine-year dominance of the U.S. and China in regards to topping the list of the world's fastest supercomputers.

But in Japan, most choirs have returned to practice rooms and concert halls, bolstered by studies here showing that with safeguards such as limiting rehearsals to 30 minutes, proper ventilation, masking and social distancing, viral hazards can be lowered substantially. Analysis by Japan's Fugaku supercomputer shows that singing does spew about three times as many potentially coronavirus -laden particles into the air as talking, but Japanese researchers wanted more detail: Does singing in different languages create more potentially infectious droplets and aerosols? The answer, simply, is yes. At least three separate studies here have shown that when it comes to emitting droplets and aerosols, not all languages are equal. Researchers were commissioned last December by the Japan Association of Classical Music Presenters, which represents professional musicians, orchestras and concert hall managers, to run an experiment involving un-masked singers. Eight professional vocalists - equally divided between male tenors and female sopranos - took turns performing short solos in a laboratory-clean room. The subjects sang excerpts from three pieces commonly performed here: A popular Japanese children's song; Beethoven's Ode to Joy; and Verdi's La Traviata. In terms of vocal emissions, it was no contest: Trilling in German and Italian generated twice as many particles per minute as crooning in Japanese. But association director Toru Niwa cautioned that the takeaway from the research shouldn't be to avoid European music during the pandemic. While several amateur singing venues have yielded super-spreader incidents, Niwa said Japan's professional choirs haven't been tainted by a single community transmission event - regardless of the language being sung - despite returning to rehearsals and performances in live music halls. \"Classical music is basically the western canon,\" he said. \"If we stopped singing in French, Italian and German, we wouldn't be able to perform anymore.\" Indeed, the quirky annual Japanese rite of belting out the finale to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony throughout the month of December accounts for a major chunk of classical music revenues here. A separate experiment by the Japan Choral Association, which represents 4,500 amateur groups, had 20 child and adult singers perform solo excerpts, pitting a Japanese graduation tune against Beethoven's Ninth. The study found that singing in Japanese propelled particles a maximum distance of about 24 inches - only about half as far as warbling in German, which flung particles up to 44 inches from a singer's mouth. \"When singing in German, we advise our members to stand at the maximum distance from each other,\" said Masakazu Umeda, secretary-general of the choral association. Umeda and Niwa explained that their studies reflect how the Japanese language - with its soft, comparatively gently-voiced consonants - leaves a lighter footprint when it comes to vocal emissions. In fact, the Japan Choral Association found that singing in nonsense syllables composed entirely of the Japanese vowels \"ah, ee, oo, eh, oh\" yielded almost no emissions at all.

Fugaku, jointly developed by the Riken research institute and leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd., was scheduled to go into full operation on April 1, but things went more smoothly than forecast. The supercomputer had already been put into partial operations to study preventive measures against the virus. It will also be utilized for a wide range of other fields, including industrial applications. In fiscal 2021, Fugaku will be used to conduct research to predict torrential rainstorms and to develop new drugs, in addition to work on anti-coronavirus measures. It is also expected to be utilized in industrial fields. When Fugaku's predecessor, the K supercomputer, started operations, businesses could only utilize about 5 percent of its total calculation capacity. But with Fugaku, they can now use around 15 percent since it began operating and that usage could rise in the future. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association is trying to find new ways to develop improved cars faster and at less expense with Fugaku. Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. is planning to use Fugaku for research to study molecular structures of rubber materials and to stop tires from deteriorating. Fugaku and its developers are also attracting more attention from foreign entities. Fujitsu announced that it has received an order to make a supercomputer system for Portugal. The system, which will use Fugaku's central processing unit, is expected to be used in academic institutions in Portugal and other European countries.

Named Fugaku, the machine was created by Japanese scientific research institute RIKEN in collaboration with multinational IT developer Fujitsu. In June 2020, Fugaku was deemed the world's most powerful supercomputer in the TOP500 supercomputer speed rankings, overtaking IBM's Summit, which held the title since November 2018, and topping its performance by almost 300 percent. Fugaku's performance numbers are immense, with its 442 petaflops of processing power making it suitable for carrying out high-resolution, large-scale, and long-duration simulations across multiple fields of research. The interesting thing about Fugaku, however, is that while it boasts incredible computing power, it was also designed to be as easy-to-use as possible. Designed to run simple applications like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, the whole aim of Fugaku's design was to make it as widely accessible to researchers from all sectors, ranging from medicine to engineering and automotive development. The head of RIKEN's Center for Computational Science, Satoshi Matusuoka, was quoted as saying that his team aimed to build a computer, that if compared to a car, would be \"something fast, but that your grandmother could drive to the supermarket.\" Fugaku recently completed a trial run that began in April 2020, where it worked on COVID-19 research, particularly visualizing how droplets could spread the virus from the mouth and move through masks, face shields, train cars, and more. Now, the supercomputer is fully operational and will be open for shared use.

In 2011, K, was Japan's last supercomputer to top the list, and has now been replaced by Fugaku. \"I hope Fugaku will be cherished by the people as it can do what its predecessor K couldn't, including artificial intelligence and big data analytics,\" said Hiroshi Matsumoto, president of the RIKEN research institute during a ceremony at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, where the new supercomputer is now based.", "url": "https://sea.mashable.com/science/14861/worlds-most-powerful-supercomputer-now-up-and-running-will-help-fight-covid-19"}, {"title": "Supercomputer: ventilation key to fewer droplets in buses, taxis", "date": "2021-04-24", "content": "A partition separating the driver and passenger seats in a bus can prevent large droplets from reaching either side when someone coughs, according to simulations by the world's fastest supercomputer. An air conditioning system can also efficiently ventilate the air within minutes, while droplet-catching filters effectively remove particles even when the windows are closed. A team led by the government-affiliated Riken research institute used Japan's supercomputer Fugaku to run simulations of the spread of droplets from coughs in a local bus. The bus has two doors, one at the front and another at the back, and was carrying 63 passengers, or a passenger occupancy rate of 80 percent. It was traveling at a speed of 20 kph. Two ventilators, one at the front and another at the back, were turned on, with the air conditioner set to circulate air in the vehicle. If there is a partition between the driver and passenger seats, large droplets won't travel to the other side when either the driver or a passenger coughs, while small droplets will spread across the interior. Even if the windows are closed, the ventilators can pump in the same volume of fresh air as the air volume of the interior in three and a half minutes. When each of the five windows was cracked open by 5 centimeters, it took two and a half minutes. And if droplet-catching filters are installed inside the air conditioner, they grab the same amount of droplets whether the windows are open or closed. According to a representative of Isuzu Motors Ltd., which participated in the study, the filters used for the simulation are for experimental use, while coarser, dust-catching filters are used for local buses currently in operation. The automaker is preparing to commercialize filters that can catch small droplets in an effective manner. The researchers also ran simulations on a taxi with a driver and two passengers traveling at 40 kph in a city. When the air conditioner is running on fresh-air mode and is set to half its maximum airflow volume with the windows closed, it took 85 seconds for the taxi to be fully ventilated. With the windows on the driver's side and on the left rear passenger side cracked open by 5 cm, it took 68 seconds to completely replace the air, beating the closed-window scenario by just a little. The air fully ventilates within 45 seconds after closing the windows and putting the air conditioner on its maximum airflow setting. There is almost no benefit in opening the windows if the vehicle slows to 20 kph. When the driver coughs without wearing a mask, small droplets will spread throughout the inside of the car in the direction of the air conditioner's airflow. The droplets will effectively exit the vehicle if partitions are set up between the driver and passenger seats while the windows on the driver's side and the left rear passenger side are open. The amount is reduced by half 20 seconds later, with fewer droplets reaching the passenger seats. Opening the windows has a limited effect when a passenger coughs without a mask, and the partitions have limited usefulness when it comes to preventing small airborne droplets. The team concluded it would be better to reduce droplets by wearing a mask. The results can be applied to private vehicles. When sharing a car with people other than family members and other close people, wearing a mask is recommended.

But in Japan, most choirs have returned to practice rooms and concert halls, bolstered by studies here showing that with safeguards such as limiting rehearsals to 30 minutes, proper ventilation, masking and social distancing, viral hazards can be lowered substantially. Analysis by Japan's Fugaku supercomputer shows that singing does spew about three times as many potentially coronavirus -laden particles into the air as talking, but Japanese researchers wanted more detail: Does singing in different languages create more potentially infectious droplets and aerosols? The answer, simply, is yes. At least three separate studies here have shown that when it comes to emitting droplets and aerosols, not all languages are equal. Researchers were commissioned last December by the Japan Association of Classical Music Presenters, which represents professional musicians, orchestras and concert hall managers, to run an experiment involving un-masked singers. Eight professional vocalists - equally divided between male tenors and female sopranos - took turns performing short solos in a laboratory-clean room. The subjects sang excerpts from three pieces commonly performed here: A popular Japanese children's song; Beethoven's Ode to Joy; and Verdi's La Traviata. In terms of vocal emissions, it was no contest: Trilling in German and Italian generated twice as many particles per minute as crooning in Japanese. But association director Toru Niwa cautioned that the takeaway from the research shouldn't be to avoid European music during the pandemic. While several amateur singing venues have yielded super-spreader incidents, Niwa said Japan's professional choirs haven't been tainted by a single community transmission event - regardless of the language being sung - despite returning to rehearsals and performances in live music halls. \"Classical music is basically the western canon,\" he said. \"If we stopped singing in French, Italian and German, we wouldn't be able to perform anymore.\" Indeed, the quirky annual Japanese rite of belting out the finale to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony throughout the month of December accounts for a major chunk of classical music revenues here. A separate experiment by the Japan Choral Association, which represents 4,500 amateur groups, had 20 child and adult singers perform solo excerpts, pitting a Japanese graduation tune against Beethoven's Ninth. The study found that singing in Japanese propelled particles a maximum distance of about 24 inches - only about half as far as warbling in German, which flung particles up to 44 inches from a singer's mouth. \"When singing in German, we advise our members to stand at the maximum distance from each other,\" said Masakazu Umeda, secretary-general of the choral association. Umeda and Niwa explained that their studies reflect how the Japanese language - with its soft, comparatively gently-voiced consonants - leaves a lighter footprint when it comes to vocal emissions. In fact, the Japan Choral Association found that singing in nonsense syllables composed entirely of the Japanese vowels \"ah, ee, oo, eh, oh\" yielded almost no emissions at all. Guidance for school choirs from Japan's Ministry of Education directs children to wear masks and keep singers at least 6.5 feet apart, ideally in a \"plaid\" pattern, alternating positioning between rows, to make everyone more visible to an audience. Distancing singers on stage for pro ensembles means choirs must get by with just 60 singers, instead of the usual 100 or more. Opera singers have been advised not to face each other when performing, and not to walk around the stage mid-song. Niwa said that by having singers stand in the alternating plaid pattern, with at least the recommended distance between them - whether they wear masks or not - \"the risk is substantially reduced.\" ", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-covid-19-singing-choir-research-languages-super-spreader-coronavirus/"}, {"title": "Fugaku will be available for shared use from March 9", "date": "2021-02-09", "content": "The supercomputer Fugaku, which has been in development since 2014, will be made available for shared use starting on March 9.

The development of the new technology was announced as part of a joint project between the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University, the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo, and Fujitsu Laboratories. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami highlighted the shortcomings in disaster mitigation and the need to utilize information for efficient and safe evacuations. While tsunami observation networks in Japanese coastal waters have been strengthened since then, using the data produced from those networks to predict a tsunami's path once it hits land has gained greater urgency. This is especially true since a major earthquake is likely to hit Japan's densely populated east coast sometime in the near future. Tsunami prediction technologies will allow authorities to obtain accurate information quickly and aid them in effectively directing evacuation orders. Fujitsu, Tohoku University, and The University of Tokyo leveraged the power of Fugaku to generate training data for 20,000 possible tsunami scenarios based on high-resolution simulations. These scenarios were used to streamline an AI model that uses offshore waveform data generated by the tsunami to predict flooding before landfall at high spatial resolution. Conventional prediction technologies require the use of supercomputers and make rapid prediction systems difficult to implement. The current AI model, however, can be run in seconds on ordinary PCs. When the model was applied to a simulation of tsunami flooding in Tokyo Bay following a large earthquake, it achieved highly accurate predictions with a regular PC within seconds. The results matched tsunami flooding of the tsunami source models released by the Cabinet Office of Japan. The research team will continue to make use of Fugaku's high-speed performance in the future by training the system with additional tsunami scenarios. Doing so will help realize AI that can predict tsunami flooding over even wider areas.", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686447"}, {"title": "World's fastest supercomputer Fugaku begins its shared use", "date": "2021-03-09", "content": "On March 9, the development of the supercomputer Fugaku was completed, and shared use of the machine began.

This is especially true since a major earthquake is likely to hit Japan's densely populated east coast sometime in the near future. Tsunami prediction technologies will allow authorities to obtain accurate information quickly and aid them in effectively directing evacuation orders. Fujitsu, Tohoku University, and The University of Tokyo leveraged the power of Fugaku to generate training data for 20,000 possible tsunami scenarios based on high-resolution simulations. These scenarios were used to streamline an AI model that uses offshore waveform data generated by the tsunami to predict flooding before landfall at high spatial resolution. Conventional prediction technologies require the use of supercomputers and make rapid prediction systems difficult to implement. The current AI model, however, can be run in seconds on ordinary PCs. When the model was applied to a simulation of tsunami flooding in Tokyo Bay following a large earthquake, it achieved highly accurate predictions with a regular PC within seconds. The results matched tsunami flooding of the tsunami source models released by the Cabinet Office of Japan. The research team will continue to make use of Fugaku's high-speed performance in the future by training the system with additional tsunami scenarios. Doing so will help realize AI that can predict tsunami flooding over even wider areas.", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/686447"}, {"title": "World's fastest supercomputer Fugaku begins its shared use", "date": "2021-03-09", "content": "On March 9, the development of the supercomputer Fugaku was completed, and shared use of the machine began.

Fugaku, jointly developed by the Riken research institute and leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd., was scheduled to go into full operation on April 1, but things went more smoothly than forecast. The supercomputer had already been put into partial operations to study preventive measures against the virus. It will also be utilized for a wide range of other fields, including industrial applications. In fiscal 2021, Fugaku will be used to conduct research to predict torrential rainstorms and to develop new drugs, in addition to work on anti-coronavirus measures. It is also expected to be utilized in industrial fields. When Fugaku's predecessor, the K supercomputer, started operations, businesses could only utilize about 5 percent of its total calculation capacity. But with Fugaku, they can now use around 15 percent since it began operating and that usage could rise in the future. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association is trying to find new ways to develop improved cars faster and at less expense with Fugaku. Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. is planning to use Fugaku for research to study molecular structures of rubber materials and to stop tires from deteriorating. Fugaku and its developers are also attracting more attention from foreign entities. Fujitsu announced that it has received an order to make a supercomputer system for Portugal. The system, which will use Fugaku's central processing unit, is expected to be used in academic institutions in Portugal and other European countries. Fugaku was listed No. 1 in the world on the Top 500 supercomputer calculation speed ranking last June and November with a calculation speed of more than 400 quadrillion calculations per second. Its computational capabilities are about 100 times higher than the K supercomputer.

Named Fugaku, the machine was created by Japanese scientific research institute RIKEN in collaboration with multinational IT developer Fujitsu. In June 2020, Fugaku was deemed the world's most powerful supercomputer in the TOP500 supercomputer speed rankings, overtaking IBM's Summit, which held the title since November 2018, and topping its performance by almost 300 percent. Fugaku's performance numbers are immense, with its 442 petaflops of processing power making it suitable for carrying out high-resolution, large-scale, and long-duration simulations across multiple fields of research. The interesting thing about Fugaku, however, is that while it boasts incredible computing power, it was also designed to be as easy-to-use as possible. Designed to run simple applications like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, the whole aim of Fugaku's design was to make it as widely accessible to researchers from all sectors, ranging from medicine to engineering and automotive development. The head of RIKEN's Center for Computational Science, Satoshi Matusuoka, was quoted as saying that his team aimed to build a computer, that if compared to a car, would be \"something fast, but that your grandmother could drive to the supermarket.\" Fugaku recently completed a trial run that began in April 2020, where it worked on COVID-19 research, particularly visualizing how droplets could spread the virus from the mouth and move through masks, face shields, train cars, and more. Now, the supercomputer is fully operational and will be open for shared use. Projects that will make use of Fugaku's power will be selected by the Research Organization for Information Science and Technology - who have already picked out 74 projects to be implemented beginning April 2021, but are still inviting more applications as part of a call for Trial Access Projects. Fugaku becoming fully operational marks a significant achievement for the Japanese computing industry due to it breaking the nine-year dominance of the U.S. and China in regards to topping the list of the world's fastest supercomputers. In 2011, K, was Japan's last supercomputer to top the list, and has now been replaced by Fugaku. \"I hope Fugaku will be cherished by the people as it can do what its predecessor K couldn't, including artificial intelligence and big data analytics,\" said Hiroshi Matsumoto, president of the RIKEN research institute during a ceremony at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, where the new supercomputer is now based.", "url": "https://sea.mashable.com/science/14861/worlds-most-powerful-supercomputer-now-up-and-running-will-help-fight-covid-19"}, {"title": "Supercomputer: ventilation key to fewer droplets in buses, taxis", "date": "2021-04-24", "content": "A partition separating the driver and passenger seats in a bus can prevent large droplets from reaching either side when someone coughs, according to simulations by the world's fastest supercomputer. An air conditioning system can also efficiently ventilate the air within minutes, while droplet-catching filters effectively remove particles even when the windows are closed. A team led by the government-affiliated Riken research institute used Japan's supercomputer Fugaku to run simulations of the spread of droplets from coughs in a local bus. The bus has two doors, one at the front and another at the back, and was carrying 63 passengers, or a passenger occupancy rate of 80 percent. It was traveling at a speed of 20 kph. Two ventilators, one at the front and another at the back, were turned on, with the air conditioner set to circulate air in the vehicle. If there is a partition between the driver and passenger seats, large droplets won't travel to the other side when either the driver or a passenger coughs, while small droplets will spread across the interior. Even if the windows are closed, the ventilators can pump in the same volume of fresh air as the air volume of the interior in three and a half minutes. When each of the five windows was cracked open by 5 centimeters, it took two and a half minutes. And if droplet-catching filters are installed inside the air conditioner, they grab the same amount of droplets whether the windows are open or closed. According to a representative of Isuzu Motors Ltd., which participated in the study, the filters used for the simulation are for experimental use, while coarser, dust-catching filters are used for local buses currently in operation. The automaker is preparing to commercialize filters that can catch small droplets in an effective manner. The researchers also ran simulations on a taxi with a driver and two passengers traveling at 40 kph in a city. When the air conditioner is running on fresh-air mode and is set to half its maximum airflow volume with the windows closed, it took 85 seconds for the taxi to be fully ventilated. With the windows on the driver's side and on the left rear passenger side cracked open by 5 cm, it took 68 seconds to completely replace the air, beating the closed-window scenario by just a little. The air fully ventilates within 45 seconds after closing the windows and putting the air conditioner on its maximum airflow setting. There is almost no benefit in opening the windows if the vehicle slows to 20 kph. When the driver coughs without wearing a mask, small droplets will spread throughout the inside of the car in the direction of the air conditioner's airflow. The droplets will effectively exit the vehicle if partitions are set up between the driver and passenger seats while the windows on the driver's side and the left rear passenger side are open. The amount is reduced by half 20 seconds later, with fewer droplets reaching the passenger seats. Opening the windows has a limited effect when a passenger coughs without a mask, and the partitions have limited usefulness when it comes to preventing small airborne droplets. The team concluded it would be better to reduce droplets by wearing a mask. The results can be applied to private vehicles. When sharing a car with people other than family members and other close people, wearing a mask is recommended.

The company's Manufacturing Intelligence division has shown that the performance of next-generation aircraft and electric vehicles can be explored in greater detail and with many more iterations using the power of simulation. By exploiting cutting-edge semiconductors, manufacturers can analyze all the complexities of reality with less than half the energy use and at a fraction of the cost of traditional simulation methods. CFD simulations require significant computational power and resource. Consequently, engineers have to spend many hours simplifying a real product design just so that it can be simulated to make sure it will perform as needed. In some instances, 90% of an engineer's time can be dedicated to this manual process, and engineers are increasingly being challenged to 'scale-up' simulations to manage more elements. As a result, the cost and time to achieve these simulations is prohibitive and engineers can only simulate an approximation of a product. Now, Hexagon's Cradle CFD customers will have the opportunity to tap into the power of the ARM-based Fugaku computer architecture to achieve complex simulations quickly and easily. This is made possible through a new partnership which will allow customers to use Cradle CFD software on Fujitsu Limited's commercially available Supercomputer PRIMEHPC series that utilizes the Fugaku technology. Engineers will now be able to simulate complex designs without having to simplify them, not only saving time but also giving access to significantly enhanced detail. This in turn will enable them to explore multiple design options and do so quickly, using simulation more frequently to refine and test their designs and explore new concepts that cannot be explored with physical testing or simulation today. Manufacturers now stand to benefit from this increased speed and detail. Their engineers could also use this type of simulation routinely in their daily work, as the Fugaku architecture uses approximately a third of the energy of the computers they use currently, reducing cost and improving environmental sustainability. This development is revolutionary for engineers in a number of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and construction, all of which need the insights provided by large scale CFD simulation. This is particularly valuable at a time when the automotive and aerospace industries are racing to bring new forms of mobility and new electrified transport to market. For example, automotive OEMs are under pressure to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. By saving time on manual processes like meshing, manufacturers can run more simulations to better understand how the aerodynamics of a new model for impacts energy efficiency and range, and be able to iterate more between design and engineering and ultimately achieve the optimal design. Thermal management is also particularly important in electric vehicles, as managing the heat of a vehicle optimizes its performance, safety and longevity - all of which are major challenges for the EV market. Understanding these issues through higher resolution simulations enables engineers to achieve optimal designs and bring models with attractive design and range to market faster. Hexagon experts collaborated closely with Fujitsu Limited to tune the Cradle CFD code to run on Fugaku and complete test simulations. A typical family car was simulated in its entirety, which is only possible with enhanced computational power. This model comprised 70 million elements using 960 cores and was simulated until steady state using the RANS equation over 1000 cycles. In aerospace, the impact of turbulence that forms around the wings of an aircraft is of critical importance to how it is controlled and its safety. Turbulence is the result of many vortices, some of which are so small that they are not feasible to simulate using current methods. Using Cradle technology with Fugaku's extra computational resource, engineers can now achieve a higher resolution simulation to enable them to better understand the impact of turbulence on the structural safety of the aircraft and the forces it can withstand. This is important for the development of the next generation of aircraft, including supersonic and hypersonic, for which engineers need to understand the behaviour of shockwaves around the aircraft. The team successfully completed a test simulation of transonic compressible fluid around an aeroplane. Transonic analysis is essential to the design of safe and efficient aircraft, helping engineers understand what happens when the air flows around a wing control surface. The simulation comprised approximately 230 million elements was tested using 4,000 nodes and used 48,000 processes via Message Passing Interface and 4 threads via the OpenMP application programming interface.

The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. \"People should be cautious about how long they converse,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. **RISKS AT RESTAURANTS** Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated. Still, the risks became much higher on the lee side of the strong air flow, the research showed. Placing panels dividing people at the counter and those seated across the table, combined with turning the air conditioner on, were found to be helpful in reducing infection risks by about 80 percent, compared with no precautions at all. Panels block droplets and air currents moving upward and downward are created when air expelled from an air conditioner hits the panels, contributing to a drop in risk, according to the research team. \"It is important to prevent droplets from concentrating in a certain area and reduce the overall risks in a room,\" Tsubokura said. A ceiling fan will be effective in reducing infection risks as it circulates the air upward and downward, he added.

Specifically, the Japanese supercomputer won the \"TOP500\" computer speed category, the \"HPCG\" processing speed category, the \"HPL-AI\" artificial intelligence category, and also the \"Graph500\" big-data analysis category. Fugaku has once again shown its power across a broad range of functions. \"By winning four categories three times in a row, Fugaku has shown its global- level advancement across a wide range of fields,\" said Satoshi Matsuoka, Director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. Fugaku's predecessor, \"K,\" won the TOP500 ranking in June and November 2011, but Fugaku has now surpassed K with its three consecutive victories. Now Five Top Contenders: According to materials released by the organization in charge of the rankings, the top four supercomputers have been the same since June 2020. The Summit supercomputer, the Sierra supercomputer, and the Sunway TaihuLight were in second, third, and fourth positions respectively. However, there was a new supercomputer in fifth place: The Perlmutter, which was launched recently in spring 2021. Elsewhere in the rankings, the Japanese ABCI 2.0 supercomputer, upgraded from the ABCI, rose from 14th to 12th position. Fugaku Maintains Edge but Competition is Keen: On this occasion, Fugaku beat the second-placed supercomputer with performance differences that were up to 5.5 times better across the four categories. According to RIKEN, Fugaku has an impressive speed of 442 petaflops. This is about three times faster than that of the second-placed Summit, which has a speed of 148.6 petaflops. In the HPCG and HPL-AI categories, Fugaku is about 5.5 times and 1.7 times better than Summit, respectively. In the Graph500 category, Fugaku is about 4.3 times better than the second-placed Sunway TaihuLight. Once again, the Japanese Fugaku has the edge over its American and Chinese competitors. However, the U.S. and China are both keen to take the top spot, and it is unclear how long Fugaku can keep winning the number one position.

An air conditioning system can also efficiently ventilate the air within minutes, while droplet-catching filters effectively remove particles even when the windows are closed. A team led by the government-affiliated Riken research institute used Japan's supercomputer Fugaku to run simulations of the spread of droplets from coughs in a local bus. The bus has two doors, one at the front and another at the back, and was carrying 63 passengers, or a passenger occupancy rate of 80 percent. It was traveling at a speed of 20 kph. Two ventilators, one at the front and another at the back, were turned on, with the air conditioner set to circulate air in the vehicle. If there is a partition between the driver and passenger seats, large droplets won't travel to the other side when either the driver or a passenger coughs, while small droplets will spread across the interior. Even if the windows are closed, the ventilators can pump in the same volume of fresh air as the air volume of the interior in three and a half minutes. When each of the five windows was cracked open by 5 centimeters, it took two and a half minutes. And if droplet-catching filters are installed inside the air conditioner, they grab the same amount of droplets whether the windows are open or closed. According to a representative of Isuzu Motors Ltd., which participated in the study, the filters used for the simulation are for experimental use, while coarser, dust-catching filters are used for local buses currently in operation. The automaker is preparing to commercialize filters that can catch small droplets in an effective manner. The researchers also ran simulations on a taxi with a driver and two passengers traveling at 40 kph in a city. When the air conditioner is running on fresh-air mode and is set to half its maximum airflow volume with the windows closed, it took 85 seconds for the taxi to be fully ventilated. With the windows on the driver's side and on the left rear passenger side cracked open by 5 cm, it took 68 seconds to completely replace the air, beating the closed-window scenario by just a little. The air fully ventilates within 45 seconds after closing the windows and putting the air conditioner on its maximum airflow setting. There is almost no benefit in opening the windows if the vehicle slows to 20 kph. When the driver coughs without wearing a mask, small droplets will spread throughout the inside of the car in the direction of the air conditioner's airflow. The droplets will effectively exit the vehicle if partitions are set up between the driver and passenger seats while the windows on the driver's side and the left rear passenger side are open. The amount is reduced by half 20 seconds later, with fewer droplets reaching the passenger seats. Opening the windows has a limited effect when a passenger coughs without a mask, and the partitions have limited usefulness when it comes to preventing small airborne droplets. The team concluded it would be better to reduce droplets by wearing a mask. The results can be applied to private vehicles. When sharing a car with people other than family members and other close people, wearing a mask is recommended.

The company's Manufacturing Intelligence division has shown that the performance of next-generation aircraft and electric vehicles can be explored in greater detail and with many more iterations using the power of simulation. By exploiting cutting-edge semiconductors, manufacturers can analyze all the complexities of reality with less than half the energy use and at a fraction of the cost of traditional simulation methods. CFD simulations require significant computational power and resource. Consequently, engineers have to spend many hours simplifying a real product design just so that it can be simulated to make sure it will perform as needed. In some instances, 90% of an engineer's time can be dedicated to this manual process, and engineers are increasingly being challenged to 'scale-up' simulations to manage more elements. As a result, the cost and time to achieve these simulations is prohibitive and engineers can only simulate an approximation of a product. Now, Hexagon's Cradle CFD customers will have the opportunity to tap into the power of the ARM-based Fugaku computer architecture to achieve complex simulations quickly and easily. This is made possible through a new partnership which will allow customers to use Cradle CFD software on Fujitsu Limited's commercially available Supercomputer PRIMEHPC series that utilizes the Fugaku technology. Engineers will now be able to simulate complex designs without having to simplify them, not only saving time but also giving access to significantly enhanced detail. This in turn will enable them to explore multiple design options and do so quickly, using simulation more frequently to refine and test their designs and explore new concepts that cannot be explored with physical testing or simulation today. Manufacturers now stand to benefit from this increased speed and detail. Their engineers could also use this type of simulation routinely in their daily work, as the Fugaku architecture uses approximately a third of the energy of the computers they use currently, reducing cost and improving environmental sustainability. This development is revolutionary for engineers in a number of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and construction, all of which need the insights provided by large scale CFD simulation. This is particularly valuable at a time when the automotive and aerospace industries are racing to bring new forms of mobility and new electrified transport to market. For example, automotive OEMs are under pressure to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. By saving time on manual processes like meshing, manufacturers can run more simulations to better understand how the aerodynamics of a new model for impacts energy efficiency and range, and be able to iterate more between design and engineering and ultimately achieve the optimal design. Thermal management is also particularly important in electric vehicles, as managing the heat of a vehicle optimizes its performance, safety and longevity - all of which are major challenges for the EV market. Understanding these issues through higher resolution simulations enables engineers to achieve optimal designs and bring models with attractive design and range to market faster. Hexagon experts collaborated closely with Fujitsu Limited to tune the Cradle CFD code to run on Fugaku and complete test simulations. A typical family car was simulated in its entirety, which is only possible with enhanced computational power. This model comprised 70 million elements using 960 cores and was simulated until steady state using the RANS equation over 1000 cycles. In aerospace, the impact of turbulence that forms around the wings of an aircraft is of critical importance to how it is controlled and its safety. Turbulence is the result of many vortices, some of which are so small that they are not feasible to simulate using current methods. Using Cradle technology with Fugaku's extra computational resource, engineers can now achieve a higher resolution simulation to enable them to better understand the impact of turbulence on the structural safety of the aircraft and the forces it can withstand. This is important for the development of the next generation of aircraft, including supersonic and hypersonic, for which engineers need to understand the behaviour of shockwaves around the aircraft. The team successfully completed a test simulation of transonic compressible fluid around an aeroplane. Transonic analysis is essential to the design of safe and efficient aircraft, helping engineers understand what happens when the air flows around a wing control surface. The simulation comprised approximately 230 million elements was tested using 4,000 nodes and used 48,000 processes via Message Passing Interface and 4 threads via the OpenMP application programming interface.

The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. \"People should be cautious about how long they converse,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. **RISKS AT RESTAURANTS** Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated. Still, the risks became much higher on the lee side of the strong air flow, the research showed. Placing panels dividing people at the counter and those seated across the table, combined with turning the air conditioner on, were found to be helpful in reducing infection risks by about 80 percent, compared with no precautions at all. Panels block droplets and air currents moving upward and downward are created when air expelled from an air conditioner hits the panels, contributing to a drop in risk, according to the research team. \"It is important to prevent droplets from concentrating in a certain area and reduce the overall risks in a room,\" Tsubokura said. A ceiling fan will be effective in reducing infection risks as it circulates the air upward and downward, he added.

After previously topping the speed ranking - as well as three other categories - in both June and November 2020, Fugaku has once again claimed top spot in all four categories. Specifically, the Japanese supercomputer won the \"TOP500\" computer speed category, the \"HPCG\" processing speed category, the \"HPL-AI\" artificial intelligence category, and also the \"Graph500\" big-data analysis category. Fugaku has once again shown its power across a broad range of functions. \"By winning four categories three times in a row, Fugaku has shown its global- level advancement across a wide range of fields,\" said Satoshi Matsuoka, Director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. Fugaku's predecessor, \"K,\" won the TOP500 ranking in June and November 2011, but Fugaku has now surpassed K with its three consecutive victories. Now Five Top Contenders: According to materials released by the organization in charge of the rankings, the top four supercomputers have been the same since June 2020. The Summit supercomputer, the Sierra supercomputer, and the Sunway TaihuLight were in second, third, and fourth positions respectively. However, there was a new supercomputer in fifth place: The Perlmutter, which was launched recently in spring 2021. Elsewhere in the rankings, the Japanese ABCI 2.0 supercomputer, upgraded from the ABCI, rose from 14th to 12th position. Fugaku Maintains Edge but Competition is Keen: On this occasion, Fugaku beat the second-placed supercomputer with performance differences that were up to 5.5 times better across the four categories. According to RIKEN, Fugaku has an impressive speed of 442 petaflops. This is about three times faster than that of the second-placed Summit, which has a speed of 148.6 petaflops. In the HPCG and HPL-AI categories, Fugaku is about 5.5 times and 1.7 times better than Summit, respectively. In the Graph500 category, Fugaku is about 4.3 times better than the second-placed Sunway TaihuLight. Once again, the Japanese Fugaku has the edge over its American and Chinese competitors. However, the U.S. and China are both keen to take the top spot, and it is unclear how long Fugaku can keep winning the number one position. As the next challenge, Japan, the U.S. and China are all aiming to create an exascale supercomputer, which is even faster than anything currently in existence.

With the windows on the driver's side and on the left rear passenger side cracked open by 5 cm, it took 68 seconds to completely replace the air, beating the closed-window scenario by just a little. The air fully ventilates within 45 seconds after closing the windows and putting the air conditioner on its maximum airflow setting. There is almost no benefit in opening the windows if the vehicle slows to 20 kph. When the driver coughs without wearing a mask, small droplets will spread throughout the inside of the car in the direction of the air conditioner's airflow. The droplets will effectively exit the vehicle if partitions are set up between the driver and passenger seats while the windows on the driver's side and the left rear passenger side are open. The amount is reduced by half 20 seconds later, with fewer droplets reaching the passenger seats. Opening the windows has a limited effect when a passenger coughs without a mask, and the partitions have limited usefulness when it comes to preventing small airborne droplets. The team concluded it would be better to reduce droplets by wearing a mask. The results can be applied to private vehicles. When sharing a car with people other than family members and other close people, wearing a mask is recommended.

The company's Manufacturing Intelligence division has shown that the performance of next-generation aircraft and electric vehicles can be explored in greater detail and with many more iterations using the power of simulation. By exploiting cutting-edge semiconductors, manufacturers can analyze all the complexities of reality with less than half the energy use and at a fraction of the cost of traditional simulation methods. CFD simulations require significant computational power and resource. Consequently, engineers have to spend many hours simplifying a real product design just so that it can be simulated to make sure it will perform as needed. In some instances, 90% of an engineer's time can be dedicated to this manual process, and engineers are increasingly being challenged to 'scale-up' simulations to manage more elements. As a result, the cost and time to achieve these simulations is prohibitive and engineers can only simulate an approximation of a product. Now, Hexagon's Cradle CFD customers will have the opportunity to tap into the power of the ARM-based Fugaku computer architecture to achieve complex simulations quickly and easily. This is made possible through a new partnership which will allow customers to use Cradle CFD software on Fujitsu Limited's commercially available Supercomputer PRIMEHPC series that utilizes the Fugaku technology. Engineers will now be able to simulate complex designs without having to simplify them, not only saving time but also giving access to significantly enhanced detail. This in turn will enable them to explore multiple design options and do so quickly, using simulation more frequently to refine and test their designs and explore new concepts that cannot be explored with physical testing or simulation today. Manufacturers now stand to benefit from this increased speed and detail. Their engineers could also use this type of simulation routinely in their daily work, as the Fugaku architecture uses approximately a third of the energy of the computers they use currently, reducing cost and improving environmental sustainability. This development is revolutionary for engineers in a number of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and construction, all of which need the insights provided by large scale CFD simulation. This is particularly valuable at a time when the automotive and aerospace industries are racing to bring new forms of mobility and new electrified transport to market. For example, automotive OEMs are under pressure to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. By saving time on manual processes like meshing, manufacturers can run more simulations to better understand how the aerodynamics of a new model for impacts energy efficiency and range, and be able to iterate more between design and engineering and ultimately achieve the optimal design. Thermal management is also particularly important in electric vehicles, as managing the heat of a vehicle optimizes its performance, safety and longevity - all of which are major challenges for the EV market. Understanding these issues through higher resolution simulations enables engineers to achieve optimal designs and bring models with attractive design and range to market faster. Hexagon experts collaborated closely with Fujitsu Limited to tune the Cradle CFD code to run on Fugaku and complete test simulations. A typical family car was simulated in its entirety, which is only possible with enhanced computational power. This model comprised 70 million elements using 960 cores and was simulated until steady state using the RANS equation over 1000 cycles. In aerospace, the impact of turbulence that forms around the wings of an aircraft is of critical importance to how it is controlled and its safety. Turbulence is the result of many vortices, some of which are so small that they are not feasible to simulate using current methods. Using Cradle technology with Fugaku's extra computational resource, engineers can now achieve a higher resolution simulation to enable them to better understand the impact of turbulence on the structural safety of the aircraft and the forces it can withstand. This is important for the development of the next generation of aircraft, including supersonic and hypersonic, for which engineers need to understand the behaviour of shockwaves around the aircraft. The team successfully completed a test simulation of transonic compressible fluid around an aeroplane. Transonic analysis is essential to the design of safe and efficient aircraft, helping engineers understand what happens when the air flows around a wing control surface.

The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. \"People should be cautious about how long they converse,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. **RISKS AT RESTAURANTS** Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated.

An air conditioning system can also efficiently ventilate the air within minutes, while droplet-catching filters effectively remove particles even when the windows are closed. A team led by the government-affiliated Riken research institute used Japan's supercomputer Fugaku to run simulations of the spread of droplets from coughs in a local bus. The bus has two doors, one at the front and another at the back, and was carrying 63 passengers, or a passenger occupancy rate of 80 percent. It was traveling at a speed of 20 kph. Two ventilators, one at the front and another at the back, were turned on, with the air conditioner set to circulate air in the vehicle. If there is a partition between the driver and passenger seats, large droplets won't travel to the other side when either the driver or a passenger coughs, while small droplets will spread across the interior. Even if the windows are closed, the ventilators can pump in the same volume of fresh air as the air volume of the interior in three and a half minutes. When each of the five windows was cracked open by 5 centimeters, it took two and a half minutes. And if droplet-catching filters are installed inside the air conditioner, they grab the same amount of droplets whether the windows are open or closed. According to a representative of Isuzu Motors Ltd., which participated in the study, the filters used for the simulation are for experimental use, while coarser, dust-catching filters are used for local buses currently in operation. The automaker is preparing to commercialize filters that can catch small droplets in an effective manner.

The scientists from Chiba University and Nagoya University simulated the inner workings of the ball of gas in an effort to determine why different areas rotate at different speeds. Their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy at. All areas on Earth complete one spin in 24 hours. But it takes about 25 days for zones near the sun's equator to finish one rotation and about 30 days for those near the north and south poles. The phenomenon, known as solar differential rotation, was first observed around 1630, according to Chiba University. But there is still no definitive explanation for why this happens. Using around 5.4 billion points inside the sun, Fugaku calculated how energy from nuclear fusion inside the star is transferred to the surface by convection currents. The project simulated thermal migration and magnetic field changes based on observation data on the density, pressure and temperatures of the sun. The high-definition simulation successfully reproduced the equator rotating faster than the north and south poles, the scientists said.

The company's Manufacturing Intelligence division has shown that the performance of next-generation aircraft and electric vehicles can be explored in greater detail and with many more iterations using the power of simulation. By exploiting cutting-edge semiconductors, manufacturers can analyze all the complexities of reality with less than half the energy use and at a fraction of the cost of traditional simulation methods. CFD simulations require significant computational power and resource. Consequently, engineers have to spend many hours simplifying a real product design just so that it can be simulated to make sure it will perform as needed. In some instances, 90% of an engineer's time can be dedicated to this manual process, and engineers are increasingly being challenged to 'scale-up' simulations to manage more elements. As a result, the cost and time to achieve these simulations is prohibitive and engineers can only simulate an approximation of a product. Now, Hexagon's Cradle CFD customers will have the opportunity to tap into the power of the ARM-based Fugaku computer architecture to achieve complex simulations quickly and easily. This is made possible through a new partnership which will allow customers to use Cradle CFD software on Fujitsu Limited's commercially available Supercomputer PRIMEHPC series that utilizes the Fugaku technology. Engineers will now be able to simulate complex designs without having to simplify them, not only saving time but also giving access to significantly enhanced detail. This in turn will enable them to explore multiple design options and do so quickly, using simulation more frequently to refine and test their designs and explore new concepts that cannot be explored with physical testing or simulation today. Manufacturers now stand to benefit from this increased speed and detail. Their engineers could also use this type of simulation routinely in their daily work, as the Fugaku architecture uses approximately a third of the energy of the computers they use currently, reducing cost and improving environmental sustainability. This development is revolutionary for engineers in a number of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and construction, all of which need the insights provided by large scale CFD simulation. This is particularly valuable at a time when the automotive and aerospace industries are racing to bring new forms of mobility and new electrified transport to market. For example, automotive OEMs are under pressure to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. By saving time on manual processes like meshing, manufacturers can run more simulations to better understand how the aerodynamics of a new model for impacts energy efficiency and range, and be able to iterate more between design and engineering and ultimately achieve the optimal design. Thermal management is also particularly important in electric vehicles, as managing the heat of a vehicle optimizes its performance, safety and longevity - all of which are major challenges for the EV market. Understanding these issues through higher resolution simulations enables engineers to achieve optimal designs and bring models with attractive design and range to market faster. Hexagon experts collaborated closely with Fujitsu Limited to tune the Cradle CFD code to run on Fugaku and complete test simulations. A typical family car was simulated in its entirety, which is only possible with enhanced computational power. This model comprised 70 million elements using 960 cores and was simulated until steady state using the RANS equation over 1000 cycles. In aerospace, the impact of turbulence that forms around the wings of an aircraft is of critical importance to how it is controlled and its safety. Turbulence is the result of many vortices, some of which are so small that they are not feasible to simulate using current methods. Using Cradle technology with Fugaku's extra computational resource, engineers can now achieve a higher resolution simulation to enable them to better understand the impact of turbulence on the structural safety of the aircraft and the forces it can withstand. This is important for the development of the next generation of aircraft, including supersonic and hypersonic, for which engineers need to understand the behaviour of shockwaves around the aircraft. The team successfully completed a test simulation of transonic compressible fluid around an aeroplane. Transonic analysis is essential to the design of safe and efficient aircraft, helping engineers understand what happens when the air flows around a wing control surface. The simulation comprised approximately 230 million elements was tested using 4,000 nodes and used 48,000 processes via Message Passing Interface and 4 threads via the OpenMP application programming interface.

The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. \"People should be cautious about how long they converse,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. **RISKS AT RESTAURANTS** Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated. Still, the risks became much higher on the lee side of the strong air flow, the research showed. Placing panels dividing people at the counter and those seated across the table, combined with turning the air conditioner on, were found to be helpful in reducing infection risks by about 80 percent, compared with no precautions at all. Panels block droplets and air currents moving upward and downward are created when air expelled from an air conditioner hits the panels, contributing to a drop in risk, according to the research team. \"It is important to prevent droplets from concentrating in a certain area and reduce the overall risks in a room,\" Tsubokura said.

Here's a summary of the systems in the Top10: Fugaku remains the No. 1 system. It has 7,630,848 cores which allowed it to achieve an HPL benchmark score of 442 Pflop/s. This puts it 3x ahead of the No. 2 system in the list. Summit, an IBM-built system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, remains the fastest system in the U.S. and at the No. 2 spot worldwide. It has a performance of 148.8 Pflop/s on the HPL benchmark, which is used to rank the TOP500 list. Summit has 4,356 nodes, each housing two Power9 CPUs with 22 cores each and six NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, each with 80 streaming multiprocessors. The nodes are linked together with a Mellanox dual-rail EDR InfiniBand network. Sierra, a system at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, CA, USA, is at No. 3. Its architecture is very similar to the #2 systems Summit. It is built with 4,320 nodes with two Power9 CPUs and four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. Sierra achieved 94.6 Pflop/s. Sunway TaihuLight is a system developed by China's National Research Center of Parallel Computer Engineering & Technology and installed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China's Jiangsu province is listed at the No. 4 position with 93 Pflop/s. Perlmutter at No. 5 was newly listed in the TOP10 in last June. It is based on the HPE Cray \"Shasta\" platform, and a heterogeneous system with AMD EPYC based nodes and 1536 NVIDIA A100 accelerated nodes. Perlmutter improved its performance to 70.9 Pflop/s. Selene, now at No. 6, is an NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPOD installed in-house at NVIDIA in the USA. The system is based on an AMD EPYC processor with NVIDIA A100 for acceleration and a Mellanox HDR InfiniBand as a network. It achieved 63.4 Pflop/s. Tianhe-2A, a system developed by China's National University of Defense Technology and deployed at the National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, China, is now listed as the No. 7 system with 61.4 Pflop/s. A system called \"JUWELS Booster Module\" is No. 8. The BullSequana system build by Atos is installed at the Forschungszentrum Juelich in Germany. The system uses an AMD EPYC processor with NVIDIA A100 for acceleration and a Mellanox HDR InfiniBand as a network similar to the Selene System. This system is the most powerful system in Europe, with 44.1 Pflop/s. HPC5 at No. 9 is a PowerEdge system built by Dell and installed by the Italian company Eni S.p.A. It achieves a performance of 35.5 Pflop/s due to using NVIDIA Tesla V100 as accelerators and a Mellanox HDR InfiniBand as the network. Voyager-EUS2, a Microsoft Azure system installed at Microsoft in the U.S., is the only new system in the TOP10. It achieved 30.05 Pflop/s and is listed at No. 10. This architecture is based on an AMD EPYC processor with 48 cores and 2.45GHz working together with an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80 G.B. memory and utilizing a Mellanox HDR Infiniband for data transfer. Other TOP500 highlights: While there were not many changes to the Top10, we did see a smattering of shifts within the Top15. The new Voyager-EUS system from Microsoft followed its sibling into the No. 11 spot, while the SSC-21 system from Samsung introduced itself to the list at No. 12. Polaris, also a new system, came in at No. 13 while the new CEA-HF took No. 15. Like the last list, AMD processors are seeing a lot of success. Frontera, which has a Xeon Platinum 8280 processor, got bumped by Voyager-EUS2, which has an AMD EPYC processor. What's more, all of the new Top15 machines described above have AMD processors Unsurprisingly, systems from China and the USA dominated the list. Although China dropped from 186 systems to 173, the USA increased from 123 machines to 150. All told, these two countries account for nearly two-thirds of the supercomputers on the TOP500. The new edition of the list didn't showcase much change in terms of system interconnects. Ethernet still dominated at 240 machines, while Infiniband accounted for 180. Ominpath interconnects saw 40 spots on the list, there were 34 custom interconnects, and only 6 systems with proprietary networks. Green500 results: The system to claim the No. 1 spot for the Green500 was MN-3 from Preferred Networks in Japan. Relying on the MN-Core chip and an accelerator optimized for matrix arithmetic, this machine was able to achieve an incredible 39.38 gigaflops/watt power-efficiency. This machine provided a performance 29.7- gigaflops/watt on the last list, clearly showcasing some impressive improvement. It also enhanced its standing on the TOP500 list, moving from No. 337 to No. 302. The new SSC-21 Scalable Module an HPE Apollo 6500 system installed at Samsung Electronics in South Korea achieved an impressive 33.98 gigaflops/watt. They did so by submitting an power optimized run of the HPL benchmark. It is listed at position 292 in the TOP500. NVIDIA installed a new liquid cooled DGX A100 prototype system called Tethys. With a power optimized HPL run Tethys achieved 31.5 gigaflops/watt and garne red the No. 3 spot on the Green500. It is listed at position 296 in the TOP500. The Wilkes-3 system improved its results but was still pushed down to the No.4 spot on the Green500. Wilkes-3, which is housed at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., had a power-efficiency of 30.8 gigaflops/watt. However, it was pushed from No. 100 to No. 281 on the TOP500 list. The University of Florida in the USA with its HiPerGator AI system was pushed from the No. 2 spot to the No. 5 spot. This machine held steady at 29.52 gigaflops/watt. This NVIDIA system has 138,880 cores and relies on an AMD EPYC 7742 processor. Despite this impressive performance, HiPerGator AI was pushed from No. 22 to No. 31 on the TOP500 ## HPCG Results The TOP500 list has incorporated the High-Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark results, which provide an alternative metric for assessing supercomputer performance and is meant to complement the HPL measurement. The HPCG results here are very similar to the last list. Fugaku was the clear winner with 16.0 HPCG-petaflops, while Summit retained its No. 2 spot with 2.93 HPCG-petaflops. Perlmutter, a USA machine housed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, took the No. 3 spot with 1.91 HPCG-petaflops. ## HPL-AI Results The HPL-AI benchmark seeks to highlight the convergence of HPC and artificial intelligence workloads based on machine learning and deep learning by solving a system of linear equations using novel, mixed-precision algorithms that exploit modern hardware. Achieving an HPL-AI benchmark of 2 Exaflops, Fugaku is leading the pack in this regard. With such excellent metrics year-after-year, combined with a consideration by many as the first \"Exascale\" supercomputer, Fugaku is clearly an exciting system.

The scientists from Chiba University and Nagoya University simulated the inner workings of the ball of gas in an effort to determine why different areas rotate at different speeds. Their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy at. All areas on Earth complete one spin in 24 hours. But it takes about 25 days for zones near the sun's equator to finish one rotation and about 30 days for those near the north and south poles. The phenomenon, known as solar differential rotation, was first observed around 1630, according to Chiba University. But there is still no definitive explanation for why this happens. Using around 5.4 billion points inside the sun, Fugaku calculated how energy from nuclear fusion inside the star is transferred to the surface by convection currents. The project simulated thermal migration and magnetic field changes based on observation data on the density, pressure and temperatures of the sun. The high-definition simulation successfully reproduced the equator rotating faster than the north and south poles, the scientists said. Fugaku's predecessor, the K supercomputer, could do calculations using only around 100 million points, and it was unable to accurately reproduce the sun's complicated internal workings. That experiment wrongly had the equator turning at a slower pace than the poles. The Fugaku supercomputer could help researchers shed light on another mystery. The difference in rotation speeds is said to play a key role in the emergence every 11 years of more sunspots and increased solar activity. \"We will also work on figuring out the mechanism of the 11-year cycle--the biggest mystery in solar physics,\" said Hideyuki Hotta, an associate professor of physics at Chiba University.

The scientists from Chiba University and Nagoya University simulated the inner workings of the ball of gas in an effort to determine why different areas rotate at different speeds. Their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy at. All areas on Earth complete one spin in 24 hours. But it takes about 25 days for zones near the sun's equator to finish one rotation and about 30 days for those near the north and south poles. The phenomenon, known as solar differential rotation, was first observed around 1630, according to Chiba University. But there is still no definitive explanation for why this happens. Using around 5.4 billion points inside the sun, Fugaku calculated how energy from nuclear fusion inside the star is transferred to the surface by convection currents. The project simulated thermal migration and magnetic field changes based on observation data on the density, pressure and temperatures of the sun. The high-definition simulation successfully reproduced the equator rotating faster than the north and south poles, the scientists said. Fugaku's predecessor, the K supercomputer, could do calculations using only around 100 million points, and it was unable to accurately reproduce the sun's complicated internal workings. That experiment wrongly had the equator turning at a slower pace than the poles. The Fugaku supercomputer could help researchers shed light on another mystery. The difference in rotation speeds is said to play a key role in the emergence every 11 years of more sunspots and increased solar activity. \"We will also work on figuring out the mechanism of the 11-year cycle--the biggest mystery in solar physics,\" said Hideyuki Hotta, an associate professor of physics at Chiba University.

The Wilkes-3 system improved its results but was still pushed down to the No.4 spot on the Green500. Wilkes-3, which is housed at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., had a power-efficiency of 30.8 gigaflops/watt. However, it was pushed from No. 100 to No. 281 on the TOP500 list. The University of Florida in the USA with its HiPerGator AI system was pushed from the No. 2 spot to the No. 5 spot. This machine held steady at 29.52 gigaflops/watt. This NVIDIA system has 138,880 cores and relies on an AMD EPYC 7742 processor. Despite this impressive performance, HiPerGator AI was pushed from No. 22 to No. 31 on the TOP500 ## HPCG Results The TOP500 list has incorporated the High-Performance Conjugate Gradient Benchmark results, which provide an alternative metric for assessing supercomputer performance and is meant to complement the HPL measurement. The HPCG results here are very similar to the last list. Fugaku was the clear winner with 16.0 HPCG-petaflops, while Summit retained its No. 2 spot with 2.93 HPCG-petaflops. Perlmutter, a USA machine housed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, took the No. 3 spot with 1.91 HPCG-petaflops. ## HPL-AI Results The HPL-AI benchmark seeks to highlight the convergence of HPC and artificial intelligence workloads based on machine learning and deep learning by solving a system of linear equations using novel, mixed-precision algorithms that exploit modern hardware. Achieving an HPL-AI benchmark of 2 Exaflops, Fugaku is leading the pack in this regard.

Fugaku was jointly developed by RIKEN and Fujitsu and is currently installed in Kobe. In addition to this outstanding feat, the supercomputer has also contributed to scientific development and the resolution of social issues, including research on COVID-19. Some of its research has been nominated for the Gordon Bell Prize, commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize of Supercomputing, and won international acclaim. One of the most prestigious prizes in the field of computational science, the Gordon Bell Prize is awarded each year for the most outstanding research using supercomputers in the field of science and technology by the U.S.-based Association for Computing Machinery. A research team from the University of Tsukuba, Kyoto University, and others is among the finalists this year. The team has been researching the origins of the universe by simulating the motion of neutrinos, the smallest subatomic particles that make up matter, using Fugaku. Last year, a team from the National Institute for Environmental Studies, which aims to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, and a team from the University of Tokyo, which conducts research to replace tank experiments for ship design with simulations, were nominated but narrowly missed the award. A research team from RIKEN, Kobe University, and other institutions has been nominated for the special prize for contributing to the prevention of COVID-19 infections by simulating droplets produced by coughing or speaking. Since last year, ACM has been awarding a Gordon Bell Special Prize to honor research on COVID-19 that contributes to the understanding of infectious diseases and resolving the global crisis. The winners of these awards will be revealed on November 18 at an international conference currently held in the United States, where the supercomputer rankings were also announced. Although Fugaku has established its name worldwide for its outstanding performance and achievements, the era of its dominance may be coming to an end, as huge investments in supercomputers are being made overseas. According to data from the Japanese Ministry of Education, more than $4.7 billion USD have been invested in the development of supercomputers in the United States since 2016, and investment and development have also surged in Europe and China, where plans are in motion to develop an exascale supercomputer that can perform 100 trillion calculations per second.

In announcing this year's Special Prize, the award committee said the visualization of how droplets disperse based on the Fugaku's simulations helped to change the way people around the world acted during the pandemic. The Fugaku supercomputer went into full-scale mode from March and this is the first time research based on the supercomputer has been recognized with an international prize. Using the world's fastest supercomputer, researchers were able to estimate the complicated changes that occur to the droplets, even through minor changes in air flow, and when only miniscule amounts were involved. The research team in June 2020 began examining how saliva droplets disperse in a range of situations, such as coughing or choral singing. Over the course of its research, the team announced about 1,000 different simulations of aerosol dispersal in 50 separate situations, including in classrooms or during commutes. The team has also looked at differences arising from the type of face mask worn. The awards committee based its decision on the fact that governments and companies have used the results from the Riken research to encourage the use of face masks and to maintain social distancing as ways of decreasing the risk of COVID-19. \"We are very happy that Fugaku has received such a positive assessment for the impact it had on dealing with a real-time crisis,\" said Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the Riken Center for Computational Science.

However, usual computational approaches for modeling such interactions have limited usefulness and capability. Now, researchers from Japan have developed a technique that overcomes these limitations. In a study published this month in The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, a research team led by the University of Tsukuba describes a highly efficient method for simulating light-matter interactions at the atomic scale. What makes these interactions so difficult to simulate? One reason is that phenomena associated with the interactions encompass many areas of physics, involving both the propagation of light waves and the dynamics of electrons and ions in matter. Another reason is that such phenomena can cover a wide range of length and time scales. Given the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the problem, light-matter interactions are typically modeled using two separate computational methods. The first is electromagnetic analysis, whereby the electromagnetic fields of the light are studied; the second is a quantum-mechanical calculation of the optical properties of the matter. But these methods assume that the electromagnetic fields are weak and that there is a difference in the length scale. \"Our approach provides a unified and improved way to simulate light-matter interactions,\" says senior author of the study Professor Kazuhiro Yabana. \"We achieve this feat by simultaneously solving three key physics equations: the Maxwell equation for the electromagnetic fields, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for the electrons, and the Newton equation for the ions.\" The researchers implemented the method in their in-house software SALMON (Scalable Ab initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience), and they thoroughly optimized the simulation computer code to maximize its performance. They then tested the code by modeling light-matter interactions in a thin film of amorphous silicon dioxide, composed of more than 10,000 atoms. This simulation was carried out using almost 28,000 nodes of the fastest supercomputer in the world, Fugaku, at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan. \"We found that our code is extremely efficient, achieving the goal of one second per time step of the calculation that is needed for practical applications,\" says Professor Yabana. \"The performance is close to its maximum possible value, set by the bandwidth of the computer memory, and the code has the desirable property of excellent weak scalability.\" Although the team simulated light-matter interactions in a thin film in this work, their approach could be used to explore many phenomena in nanoscale optics and photonics.", "url": "https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/research-news/20220106140000.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Supercomputer simulation aims to resolve sun's rotation mystery", "date": "2021-09-29", "content": "In a world first, Japanese researchers used the Fugaku supercomputer to reproduce imbalances in the sun's rotation, a phenomenon that has puzzled astronomers for centuries.

MLPerf HPC includes three separate benchmarks, each measuring a supercomputer's performance on different tasks. CosmoFlow involves calculating cosmological parameters based on three-dimensional simulations of the distribution of dark matter.

However, usual computational approaches for modeling such interactions have limited usefulness and capability. Now, researchers from Japan have developed a technique that overcomes these limitations. In a study published this month in The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, a research team led by the University of Tsukuba describes a highly efficient method for simulating light-matter interactions at the atomic scale. What makes these interactions so difficult to simulate? One reason is that phenomena associated with the interactions encompass many areas of physics, involving both the propagation of light waves and the dynamics of electrons and ions in matter. Another reason is that such phenomena can cover a wide range of length and time scales. Given the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the problem, light-matter interactions are typically modeled using two separate computational methods. The first is electromagnetic analysis, whereby the electromagnetic fields of the light are studied; the second is a quantum-mechanical calculation of the optical properties of the matter. But these methods assume that the electromagnetic fields are weak and that there is a difference in the length scale. \"Our approach provides a unified and improved way to simulate light-matter interactions,\" says senior author of the study Professor Kazuhiro Yabana. \"We achieve this feat by simultaneously solving three key physics equations: the Maxwell equation for the electromagnetic fields, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for the electrons, and the Newton equation for the ions.\" The researchers implemented the method in their in-house software SALMON (Scalable Ab initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience), and they thoroughly optimized the simulation computer code to maximize its performance. They then tested the code by modeling light-matter interactions in a thin film of amorphous silicon dioxide, composed of more than 10,000 atoms. This simulation was carried out using almost 28,000 nodes of the fastest supercomputer in the world, Fugaku, at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan. \"We found that our code is extremely efficient, achieving the goal of one second per time step of the calculation that is needed for practical applications,\" says Professor Yabana. \"The performance is close to its maximum possible value, set by the bandwidth of the computer memory, and the code has the desirable property of excellent weak scalability.\" Although the team simulated light-matter interactions in a thin film in this work, their approach could be used to explore many phenomena in nanoscale optics and photonics.", "url": "https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/research-news/20220106140000.html"}, {"title": "Supercomputer underscores need for 'distance' to fight Omicron", "date": "2022-02-03", "content": "OSAKA-The probability of infection with the Omicron variant is greatly lowered with distance, mask wearing and other measures, but the strain still spreads more easily than the Delta strain, according to Fugaku supercomputer simulations. Before conducting the simulations, the team at the Riken research institute estimated that the Omicron variant was 1.5 times more contagious than the Delta variant, based on results of epidemiological research and other sources. One Fugaku simulation was of a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant who talked to someone for 15 minutes at a distance of 1 meter. The probability of the variant infecting the other person was around 60 percent on average, but the rate could surpass 90 percent at most, according to the researchers. When the team conducted the same simulation of a maskless person with the Delta variant, the highest infection probability was just over 80 percent, while the average infection probability was around 50 percent. If a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant maintained a 2-meter distance, the amount of space between talkers recommended by Japanese authorities, the highest infection probability reached around 60 percent, while the average infection probability was just over 20 percent. Even if someone infected with the Omicron wore a nonwoven face mask, the highest infection probability reached around 10 percent if the person stayed only 50 centimeters from the person he or she was talking to. When the team cut the distance to 25 centimeters, the highest infection probability was around 30 percent. Distances of 50 or 25 centimeters are about the space between people on a crowded train or between people whispering to each other in meetings. However, when the team increased the distance from the mask wearer to 1 meter, the risk of spreading the virus fell to near zero. The team also conducted a simulation on 16 people, consisting of customers or staff members, at a small restaurant furnished with tables and counters. If one of the 16 people was infected with the Omicron variant, another person would become infected after an hour if the restaurant only used its original mechanical ventilation system, the research team said. If the restaurant also used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner for ventilation, the risk of infection was halved. If the restaurant also used partition boards, the infection risk was reduced to almost one-third of the level under the original scenario. Although droplet particles traveled in the restaurant when it used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner, they accumulated and posed an infection risk in fewer areas inside the facility. This means using a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner can help lower the risk of infection. \"It is important to go back to the basics and to make sure that people take measures against infection, such as keeping a distance from people,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, leader of the team and professor at Kobe University. \"Also, in order to reduce the risk of infection to the level of that of the original novel coronavirus, we need more measures.\"", "url": "https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14539290"}, {"title": "Fugaku Supercomputer Reveals the Strength of Ryoyu Kobayashi", "date": "2022-02-10", "content": "Ryoyu Kobayashi won the gold medal in the men's ski jumping individual normal hill event at the Beijing Winter Olympics on Sunday, February 6. What is the secret of his strength? An analysis using the supercomputer \"FUGAKU\" has revealed that the secret lies in the fact that \"lift,\" the aerodynamic force that lifts the body by receiving the force of wind in the air, increases in the latter half of the jump for Kobayashi, which lead to his long flight distance. A research team including RIKEN, which operates FUGAKU, announced this on February 4. The team stated prior to the ski jumping event that the strength of Kobayashi is scientifically proven and researchers wanted him to jump with confidence, as noted in this study. In ski jumping, in addition to lift there is drag, which is the force of air resistance that slows down the jump in response to the wind. There is also air force such as turbulence of airflow, as well as conditions such as the movement, posture and physique of the athlete. These things are all intricately intertwined. A huge amount of calculation is required for high-precision simulation on a computer, and using Fugaku made it possible to reveal a part of the secret of the strength of the first-class ski jumper. The research team used \"motion capture\" technology to read human movements and then converted them into digital data to measure the jumps of other ski jumpers compared to Kobayashi. Based on the result, a three-dimensional computer graphics animation was created, and Fugaku was used to simulate the force of air acting around the athlete's body. Kobayashi's jump is characterized by a straight posture he assumes immediately after taking off. However, in general, such stretched posture is susceptible to wind resistance in the early stages of a jump and has been seen as a disadvantage to jumpers. Nevertheless, Kobayashi jumps a long distance, and even his team associates have wondered, \"why can he jump so far?\" Even in the simulation by Fugaku, Kobayashi's jump had a much sharper increase in drag immediately after takeoff, compared to the other jumpers. However, it was found that the drag force immediately began to decrease and was suppressed in the subsequent flight phases. Kobayashi's style of quickly leaning forward and stabilizing the flight posture seems to have led to these results. Furthermore, it was found that the lift of the other athletes decreased toward the latter half of their jumps, while the lift in Kobayashi's jump increased. In ski jumping, a jumper faces the wind with the front of his body at the beginning but towards the end he receives the wind from below his body. For this reason, it is thought that the drag increases and lift decreases sharply, resulting in a \"stall\" state toward the end of a jump. But Kobayashi seems to continue to generate lift by finely controlling his posture. Analyzing the airflow in the latter half of the jump, it was also found that the back airflow was less turbulent for Kobayashi than other athletes, and that an upward force was generated.", "url": "https://japan-forward.com/fugaku-supercomputer-reveals-the-strength-of-ryoyu-kobayashi/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Still waiting for Exascale: Japan's Fugaku outperforms all competition once again", "date": "2021-11-15", "content": "The 58th annual edition of the TOP500 saw little change in the Top10.

Based on an AMD EPYC processor with 48 cores and 2.45GHz working together with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and 80 GB of memory, Voyager-EUS2 also utilizes a Mellanox HDR Infiniband for data transfer. While there were no other changes to the positions of the systems in the Top10, Perlmutter at NERSC improved its performance to 70.9 Pflop/s. Housed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Perlmutter's increased performance couldn't move it from its previously held No. 5 spot. Fugaku continues to hold the No. 1 position that it first earned in June 2020. Its HPL benchmark score is 442 Pflop/s, which exceeded the performance of Summit at No. 2 by 3x. Installed at the Riken Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, it was co-developed by Riken and Fujitsu and is based on Fujitsu's custom ARM A64FX processor. Fugaku also uses Fujitsu's Tofu D interconnect to transfer data between nodes. In single or further-reduced precision, which are often used in machine learning and A.I. application, Fugaku has a peak performance above 1,000 PFlop/s. As a result, Fugaku is often introduced as the first \"Exascale\" supercomputer. While there were also reports about several Chinese systems reaching Exaflop level performance, none of these systems submitted an HPL result to the TOP500. Here's a summary of the systems in the Top10: Fugaku remains the No. 1 system. It has 7,630,848 cores which allowed it to achieve an HPL benchmark score of 442 Pflop/s.

However, usual computational approaches for modeling such interactions have limited usefulness and capability. Now, researchers from Japan have developed a technique that overcomes these limitations. In a study published this month in The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, a research team led by the University of Tsukuba describes a highly efficient method for simulating light-matter interactions at the atomic scale. What makes these interactions so difficult to simulate? One reason is that phenomena associated with the interactions encompass many areas of physics, involving both the propagation of light waves and the dynamics of electrons and ions in matter. Another reason is that such phenomena can cover a wide range of length and time scales. Given the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the problem, light-matter interactions are typically modeled using two separate computational methods. The first is electromagnetic analysis, whereby the electromagnetic fields of the light are studied; the second is a quantum-mechanical calculation of the optical properties of the matter. But these methods assume that the electromagnetic fields are weak and that there is a difference in the length scale. \"Our approach provides a unified and improved way to simulate light-matter interactions,\" says senior author of the study Professor Kazuhiro Yabana. \"We achieve this feat by simultaneously solving three key physics equations: the Maxwell equation for the electromagnetic fields, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for the electrons, and the Newton equation for the ions.\" The researchers implemented the method in their in-house software SALMON (Scalable Ab initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience), and they thoroughly optimized the simulation computer code to maximize its performance.

Before conducting the simulations, the team at the Riken research institute estimated that the Omicron variant was 1.5 times more contagious than the Delta variant, based on results of epidemiological research and other sources. One Fugaku simulation was of a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant who talked to someone for 15 minutes at a distance of 1 meter. The probability of the variant infecting the other person was around 60 percent on average, but the rate could surpass 90 percent at most, according to the researchers. When the team conducted the same simulation of a maskless person with the Delta variant, the highest infection probability was just over 80 percent, while the average infection probability was around 50 percent. If a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant maintained a 2-meter distance, the amount of space between talkers recommended by Japanese authorities, the highest infection probability reached around 60 percent, while the average infection probability was just over 20 percent. Even if someone infected with the Omicron wore a nonwoven face mask, the highest infection probability reached around 10 percent if the person stayed only 50 centimeters from the person he or she was talking to. When the team cut the distance to 25 centimeters, the highest infection probability was around 30 percent. Distances of 50 or 25 centimeters are about the space between people on a crowded train or between people whispering to each other in meetings. However, when the team increased the distance from the mask wearer to 1 meter, the risk of spreading the virus fell to near zero. The team also conducted a simulation on 16 people, consisting of customers or staff members, at a small restaurant furnished with tables and counters. If one of the 16 people was infected with the Omicron variant, another person would become infected after an hour if the restaurant only used its original mechanical ventilation system, the research team said. If the restaurant also used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner for ventilation, the risk of infection was halved. If the restaurant also used partition boards, the infection risk was reduced to almost one-third of the level under the original scenario. Although droplet particles traveled in the restaurant when it used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner, they accumulated and posed an infection risk in fewer areas inside the facility. This means using a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner can help lower the risk of infection. \"It is important to go back to the basics and to make sure that people take measures against infection, such as keeping a distance from people,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, leader of the team and professor at Kobe University. \"Also, in order to reduce the risk of infection to the level of that of the original novel coronavirus, we need more measures.\"", "url": "https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14539290"}, {"title": "Fugaku Supercomputer Reveals the Strength of Ryoyu Kobayashi", "date": "2022-02-10", "content": "Ryoyu Kobayashi won the gold medal in the men's ski jumping individual normal hill event at the Beijing Winter Olympics on Sunday, February 6. What is the secret of his strength? An analysis using the supercomputer \"FUGAKU\" has revealed that the secret lies in the fact that \"lift,\" the aerodynamic force that lifts the body by receiving the force of wind in the air, increases in the latter half of the jump for Kobayashi, which lead to his long flight distance. A research team including RIKEN, which operates FUGAKU, announced this on February 4. The team stated prior to the ski jumping event that the strength of Kobayashi is scientifically proven and researchers wanted him to jump with confidence, as noted in this study. In ski jumping, in addition to lift there is drag, which is the force of air resistance that slows down the jump in response to the wind. There is also air force such as turbulence of airflow, as well as conditions such as the movement, posture and physique of the athlete. These things are all intricately intertwined. A huge amount of calculation is required for high-precision simulation on a computer, and using Fugaku made it possible to reveal a part of the secret of the strength of the first-class ski jumper. The research team used \"motion capture\" technology to read human movements and then converted them into digital data to measure the jumps of other ski jumpers compared to Kobayashi. Based on the result, a three-dimensional computer graphics animation was created, and Fugaku was used to simulate the force of air acting around the athlete's body. Kobayashi's jump is characterized by a straight posture he assumes immediately after taking off. However, in general, such stretched posture is susceptible to wind resistance in the early stages of a jump and has been seen as a disadvantage to jumpers. Nevertheless, Kobayashi jumps a long distance, and even his team associates have wondered, \"why can he jump so far?\" Even in the simulation by Fugaku, Kobayashi's jump had a much sharper increase in drag immediately after takeoff, compared to the other jumpers. However, it was found that the drag force immediately began to decrease and was suppressed in the subsequent flight phases. Kobayashi's style of quickly leaning forward and stabilizing the flight posture seems to have led to these results. Furthermore, it was found that the lift of the other athletes decreased toward the latter half of their jumps, while the lift in Kobayashi's jump increased. In ski jumping, a jumper faces the wind with the front of his body at the beginning but towards the end he receives the wind from below his body. For this reason, it is thought that the drag increases and lift decreases sharply, resulting in a \"stall\" state toward the end of a jump. But Kobayashi seems to continue to generate lift by finely controlling his posture. Analyzing the airflow in the latter half of the jump, it was also found that the back airflow was less turbulent for Kobayashi than other athletes, and that an upward force was generated.", "url": "https://japan-forward.com/fugaku-supercomputer-reveals-the-strength-of-ryoyu-kobayashi/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Fugaku extends its reign as champion of supercomputers", "date": "2021-12-01", "content": "The supercomputer Fugaku-aptly named after Japan's tallest mountain, Mt.

Aptly named after Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest peak, Fugaku had maintained its title as the fastest in the world since June 2020. In the latest ranking, Fugaku recorded the same speed as the previous year at 442 quadrillion calculations per second.

It broke through the exascale threshold to perform 1.102 quintillion calculations per second. While Fugaku slipped to second in calculation speed, it maintained the top spot for the fifth time in a row in two other categories--the speed at which it can run applications, and in big data analysis. \"Even in the fierce development competition, we continue to be at the world's top level,\" said Toshiyuki Imamura, a team leader at the Riken research institute, which jointly developed Fugaku along with computer major Fujitsu Ltd.

However, usual computational approaches for modeling such interactions have limited usefulness and capability. Now, researchers from Japan have developed a technique that overcomes these limitations. In a study published this month in The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, a research team led by the University of Tsukuba describes a highly efficient method for simulating light-matter interactions at the atomic scale. What makes these interactions so difficult to simulate? One reason is that phenomena associated with the interactions encompass many areas of physics, involving both the propagation of light waves and the dynamics of electrons and ions in matter. Another reason is that such phenomena can cover a wide range of length and time scales. Given the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the problem, light-matter interactions are typically modeled using two separate computational methods. The first is electromagnetic analysis, whereby the electromagnetic fields of the light are studied; the second is a quantum-mechanical calculation of the optical properties of the matter. But these methods assume that the electromagnetic fields are weak and that there is a difference in the length scale. \"Our approach provides a unified and improved way to simulate light-matter interactions,\" says senior author of the study Professor Kazuhiro Yabana. \"We achieve this feat by simultaneously solving three key physics equations: the Maxwell equation for the electromagnetic fields, the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for the electrons, and the Newton equation for the ions.\" The researchers implemented the method in their in-house software SALMON (Scalable Ab initio Light-Matter simulator for Optics and Nanoscience), and they thoroughly optimized the simulation computer code to maximize its performance. They then tested the code by modeling light-matter interactions in a thin film of amorphous silicon dioxide, composed of more than 10,000 atoms. This simulation was carried out using almost 28,000 nodes of the fastest supercomputer in the world, Fugaku, at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan. \"We found that our code is extremely efficient, achieving the goal of one second per time step of the calculation that is needed for practical applications,\" says Professor Yabana. \"The performance is close to its maximum possible value, set by the bandwidth of the computer memory, and the code has the desirable property of excellent weak scalability.\" Although the team simulated light-matter interactions in a thin film in this work, their approach could be used to explore many phenomena in nanoscale optics and photonics.", "url": "https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/research-news/20220106140000.html"}, {"title": "Supercomputer underscores need for 'distance' to fight Omicron", "date": "2022-02-03", "content": "OSAKA-The probability of infection with the Omicron variant is greatly lowered with distance, mask wearing and other measures, but the strain still spreads more easily than the Delta strain, according to Fugaku supercomputer simulations. Before conducting the simulations, the team at the Riken research institute estimated that the Omicron variant was 1.5 times more contagious than the Delta variant, based on results of epidemiological research and other sources. One Fugaku simulation was of a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant who talked to someone for 15 minutes at a distance of 1 meter. The probability of the variant infecting the other person was around 60 percent on average, but the rate could surpass 90 percent at most, according to the researchers. When the team conducted the same simulation of a maskless person with the Delta variant, the highest infection probability was just over 80 percent, while the average infection probability was around 50 percent. If a maskless person infected with the Omicron variant maintained a 2-meter distance, the amount of space between talkers recommended by Japanese authorities, the highest infection probability reached around 60 percent, while the average infection probability was just over 20 percent. Even if someone infected with the Omicron wore a nonwoven face mask, the highest infection probability reached around 10 percent if the person stayed only 50 centimeters from the person he or she was talking to. When the team cut the distance to 25 centimeters, the highest infection probability was around 30 percent. Distances of 50 or 25 centimeters are about the space between people on a crowded train or between people whispering to each other in meetings. However, when the team increased the distance from the mask wearer to 1 meter, the risk of spreading the virus fell to near zero. The team also conducted a simulation on 16 people, consisting of customers or staff members, at a small restaurant furnished with tables and counters. If one of the 16 people was infected with the Omicron variant, another person would become infected after an hour if the restaurant only used its original mechanical ventilation system, the research team said. If the restaurant also used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner for ventilation, the risk of infection was halved. If the restaurant also used partition boards, the infection risk was reduced to almost one-third of the level under the original scenario. Although droplet particles traveled in the restaurant when it used a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner, they accumulated and posed an infection risk in fewer areas inside the facility. This means using a kitchen duct system and an air conditioner can help lower the risk of infection. \"It is important to go back to the basics and to make sure that people take measures against infection, such as keeping a distance from people,\" said Makoto Tsubokura, leader of the team and professor at Kobe University. \"Also, in order to reduce the risk of infection to the level of that of the original novel coronavirus, we need more measures.\"", "url": "https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14539290"}, {"title": "Fugaku Supercomputer Reveals the Strength of Ryoyu Kobayashi", "date": "2022-02-10", "content": "Ryoyu Kobayashi won the gold medal in the men's ski jumping individual normal hill event at the Beijing Winter Olympics on Sunday, February 6. What is the secret of his strength? An analysis using the supercomputer \"FUGAKU\" has revealed that the secret lies in the fact that \"lift,\" the aerodynamic force that lifts the body by receiving the force of wind in the air, increases in the latter half of the jump for Kobayashi, which lead to his long flight distance. A research team including RIKEN, which operates FUGAKU, announced this on February 4. The team stated prior to the ski jumping event that the strength of Kobayashi is scientifically proven and researchers wanted him to jump with confidence, as noted in this study. In ski jumping, in addition to lift there is drag, which is the force of air resistance that slows down the jump in response to the wind. There is also air force such as turbulence of airflow, as well as conditions such as the movement, posture and physique of the athlete. These things are all intricately intertwined. A huge amount of calculation is required for high-precision simulation on a computer, and using Fugaku made it possible to reveal a part of the secret of the strength of the first-class ski jumper. The research team used \"motion capture\" technology to read human movements and then converted them into digital data to measure the jumps of other ski jumpers compared to Kobayashi. Based on the result, a three-dimensional computer graphics animation was created, and Fugaku was used to simulate the force of air acting around the athlete's body. Kobayashi's jump is characterized by a straight posture he assumes immediately after taking off. However, in general, such stretched posture is susceptible to wind resistance in the early stages of a jump and has been seen as a disadvantage to jumpers. Nevertheless, Kobayashi jumps a long distance, and even his team associates have wondered, \"why can he jump so far?\" Even in the simulation by Fugaku, Kobayashi's jump had a much sharper increase in drag immediately after takeoff, compared to the other jumpers. However, it was found that the drag force immediately began to decrease and was suppressed in the subsequent flight phases. Kobayashi's style of quickly leaning forward and stabilizing the flight posture seems to have led to these results. Furthermore, it was found that the lift of the other athletes decreased toward the latter half of their jumps, while the lift in Kobayashi's jump increased. In ski jumping, a jumper faces the wind with the front of his body at the beginning but towards the end he receives the wind from below his body. For this reason, it is thought that the drag increases and lift decreases sharply, resulting in a \"stall\" state toward the end of a jump. But Kobayashi seems to continue to generate lift by finely controlling his posture. Analyzing the airflow in the latter half of the jump, it was also found that the back airflow was less turbulent for Kobayashi than other athletes, and that an upward force was generated.", "url": "https://japan-forward.com/fugaku-supercomputer-reveals-the-strength-of-ryoyu-kobayashi/"}, {"title": "Japanese firms initiate joint research on next-gen IT drug discovery technology", "date": "2022-05-17", "content": "Japan-based Fujitsu and RIKEN have launched a joint research project on next- generation IT drug discovery technology utilizing the supercomputer Fugaku.

While Fugaku slipped to second in calculation speed, it maintained the top spot for the fifth time in a row in two other categories--the speed at which it can run applications, and in big data analysis. \"Even in the fierce development competition, we continue to be at the world's top level,\" said Toshiyuki Imamura, a team leader at the Riken research institute, which jointly developed Fugaku along with computer major Fujitsu Ltd. After Fugaku became in June 2020 the first Japanese supercomputer to top the world ranking in nine years since its predecessor, K, it retained the title for three consecutive times on the twice-yearly ranking in calculation speed. Installed at the Riken center in Kobe, Fugaku had been used to study preventive measures against the novel coronavirus such as simulating the spread of the virus through droplet dispersion. The supercomputer was enlisted for the research even before it went into full-scale operation in March 2021.

These results were announced on May 30 at ISC 2022, an international conference on high-performance computing held at the Congress Center Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany, and online. According to R-CCS Director Satoshi Matsuoka, \"Fugaku's first place on the HPCG and Graph500 for the fifth consecutive terms and its second place on the TOP500 and HPL-AI rankings show that it is still at the top of the world in terms of performance, and will be able to play a key role in the development of Society 5.0, through which the Japanese government is aiming to create a super-smart society that can bring new value.

In mid-March, the Tokyo-based IT giant tested its flood prediction app during a tsunami-evacuation drill in a coastal area of Kawasaki Ward in Kawasaki. Members of a neighborhood association and other residents who had installed the app joined the drill. They often peered at their smartphones as they headed toward an evacuation site at a junior high school. The app on their screens showed different colors for the estimated arrival times of the waves and the height of the tsunami. The locations of the smartphone user and other participants were displayed on the map. It also showed whether people had been left behind in the danger zones. \"It feels realistic because shows, for example, how many minutes are left until the tsunami reaches the blue areas,\" said Masayuki Suyama, 75, head of the Fujisaki neighborhood association. Fujitsu worked with the Kawasaki city government for the app test. The company has been collaborating with Tohoku University and the University of Tokyo on tsunami flood prediction technology using the Fugaku supercomputer and an AI model. Project members used Fugaku, one of the world's fastest supercomputers in terms of calculation speed, to run simulations of several tens of thousands of scenarios. \"Training data\" was created to predict flooded areas based on offshore waveforms. The AI model then learned the data. After actual earthquakes, tsunami waveform data gathered by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and related organizations is entered into computers at municipal governments and other institutions. The trained AI model can generate flood predictions on those computer systems and send the forecast information to smartphones in each area in a matter of seconds. During the flood-simulation stage, the AI model also incorporates data concerning terrain, buildings and road conditions based on information provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan and other entities. The system can provide high-resolution tsunami flooding predictions in 3-by-3-meter units, Fujitsu said. After the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, people in coastal areas of the Tohoku region had to rely on announcements by the Japan Meteorological Agency for estimated tsunami heights and arrival times. But the actual arrival times differed largely from location to location. Many people died after mistakenly thinking that the tsunami risk ended as the predicted arrival time had passed or that the waves wouldn't reach their location. The tsunami observation network in Japan has since been reinforced, and the capabilities of supercomputers and AI have significantly improved. Smartphones equipped with location information functions are now widely available. \"We aim to build a system that will allow everyone to escape ,\" said Yusuke Oishi, 43, a Fujitsu researcher on the development team. COVERAGE AREA STILL LIMITED: However, a number of challenges must be overcome to put the app into practical use. Under the Meteorological Service Law, business operators must obtain government permission to provide tsunami prediction information. According to the JMA, operators are prohibited from spreading flood predictions to an unspecified number of people to avoid confusion caused by data that may conflict with warnings issued by the agency. Unexpected events and measurement errors are always a risk during natural disasters. App users could wrongly assume they are out of harm's way based on locations shown on an app's map. For those reasons, only those briefed in advance about the uncertainty of predictions will be provided with detailed flooding information via Fujitsu's app. They include neighborhood association members in charge of disaster- preparedness and volunteer firefighters, who will use the app to call for evacuations. \"In light of the results of the trial run, we want to continue considering how to provide information and to whom,\" a Fujitsu representative said. The Wakayama and Mie prefectural governments have jointly developed a tsunami flooding forecast system using an observation network set up on the seafloor by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology. The two prefectures have gained permission for forecasting services. But their clients are limited to municipal governments along the coast and other officials. Individual users have been excluded.

The HPCG is a performance ranking for computing methods often used for real-world applications, and the Graph500 ranks systems based on graph analytic performance, an important element in data-intensive workloads. The results of the rankings were announced on November 14 at the SC22, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, which is currently being held in Dallas, the United States. The results this time were made with Fugaku's full complement of 158,976 nodes fit into 432 racks. On HPCG, it scored 16.00 petaflops. On the TOP500, it achieved a LINPACK score of 442.01 petaflops, and on HPL-AI it gained a score of 2.004 exaflops. The top ranking on Graph500 was won by a collaboration involving RIKEN, Kyushu University, Fixstars Corporation, and Fujitsu. It earned a score of 102,955 gigaTEPS. Fugaku has been creating impressive results at the social implementation level in a wide range of fields, including life sciences, disaster prevention and mitigation, energy, manufacturing, basic science, and socioeconomic applications, since its trial use started in April 2020 and the shared use started in March 2021. Fujitsu launched a cloud service Fujitsu Computing as a Service on October 25 in Japan. This service makes it easy for anyone, not only professional engineers, to use advanced computing resources based on Fugaku and other HPC technologies, as well as Fujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer, which solves combinatorial optimization problems rapidly, and software technologies such as AI. Moving forward, Fujitsu will continue to collaborate with customers to accelerate initiatives leveraging the technological capabilities offered by its CaaS platform to contribute to the solution of issues facing society, including infectious disease countermeasures, personnel shortages in transportation and delivery, and the development of new high-performance materials.", "url": "https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2022/1115-01.html"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Supercomputer Fugaku retains first place worldwide in HPCG and Graph500 rankings", "date": "2022-11-15", "content": "The supercomputer Fugaku, jointly developed by RIKEN and Fujitsu, has successfully retained the top spot for six consecutive terms in multiple major high-performance computer rankings including HPCG and Graph500 BFS, and has also taken second place for the TOP500 and third place for the HPL-AI rankings.
