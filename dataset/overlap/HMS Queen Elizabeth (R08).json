He said the \u00a33.8bn contract would lead to the construction of the largest vessels ever sailed by the Royal Navy. The new 65,000-tonne carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales - will enter service in 2014 and 2016. Mr Browne said the work would support and create 10,000 jobs across the UK, including those at yards on the Clyde, Rosyth, Portsmouth and Barrow. The contract was described as a \"major project\" for the shipbuilding industry by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The work will be shared among a number of companies, including BAE Systems' Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow, which employ 3,000 people. The ships will be built in sections and then assembled at the Rosyth dockyard in Fife. Making the announcement, Mr Browne said the carriers would \"provide our front-line forces with the modern, world class capabilities they will need over the coming decades\". \"The carriers represent a step-change in our capabilities, enabling us to deliver increased strategic effect and influence around the world at a time and place of our choosing.\" However, he said the carriers could not be built without a change in the maritime sector. \"I am pleased that VT Group and BAE Systems intend to form a joint venture in naval shipbuilding and support,\" said Mr Browne. \"The creation of such a joint venture will enable the Royal Navy to work with the industry to deliver the infrastructure the navy will need to support the fleet in the future while retaining all three of our existing naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and Faslane. \"This will be good news for the three communities.\" However, he warned there would be \"some reductions\" in the 17,800 personnel currently employed at the bases. The Ministry of Defence said about 40% of the carriers work would be carried out by the joint venture between BAE Systems and VT Group - 15% in Portsmouth and 25% in Glasgow. Thales and Babcock will each have 16% of the contract, while the remaining 28% will be carried out by BAE Systems at Barrow and by its Integrated System Technologies (Insyte) division, based in Surrey. Shadow Defence Secretary Liam Fox welcomed the announcement but said it came at \"a high price\" for the navy. \"Since 1997, the Royal Navy has faced significant cuts in force levels completely at odds with the government's own strategic defence review which called for 32 surface combatants,\" he said. \"We welcome the retention of three of our existing naval bases, but there will be a strong suspicion that we are not being told the full story today.\" Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Willie Rennie said: \"I am sure the communities of the three navy bases will welcome the decision but will perhaps wait with trepidation about the potential losses in jobs.\" Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said he was pleased that the announcement would safeguard thousands of Scottish jobs. Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the leader of Portsmouth City Council, said it would have \"ripped the soul out of the city\" if the navy had pulled out. He said: \"This is an absolutely wonderful and brilliant day for the city and for the campaign we have waged to try to make sure we keep the navy base here in Portsmouth. \"The presumption last August when the review was launched was that Portsmouth would close but we have been able to turn that around completely so that Portsmouth remains the home of the navy.\"", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6914788.stm"}, {"title": "MoD gives nod for aircraft carriers", "date": "2007-07-25", "content": "Two new aircraft carriers, each of them the size of the QE2, will enter service within the next 10 years, ministers confirmed on Wednesday, portraying the navy as winners in a tight defence spending settlement. The 65,000 tonne ships, to be built at four shipyards around the country, will form the vanguard of Britain's defence capability and should allow the UK to take on worldwide missions well into the future. However, French hopes of a significant role in construction of the vessels have been dashed. Senior defence officials said that, after negotiations between London and Paris, none of the main blocks would be built in France. The announcement coincided with a merger of the shipbuilding assets of BAE Systems and VT Group, which will have lead roles in building the carriers. It came as Des Browne, the defence secretary, secured a 1.5 per cent average annual real terms increase in his department's budget for the three years covered by the forthcoming comprehensive spending review. The Ministry of Defence said the settlement amounted to an extra \u00a37.7bn by 2011. However, defence's share of the public spending cake would continue to shrink and officials conceded that \"at the margins of our programme there might be some changed priorities\". Mr Browne said the \u00a33.9bn carrier order would lead to the construction of the largest vessels ever sailed by the navy and safeguard 10,000 jobs in shipyards across the country - including at Clyde, Portsmouth and Barrow. Called HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the first of the two ships is due to enter service in 2014 and the second in 2016. They will house 40 aircraft each, including, it is planned, 36 F-35 joint strike fighters. Gordon Brown, the prime minister, described the contract as a \"major project\" for the shipbuilding industry. A number of companies will share the work. The ships will be built in sections and assembled at the Rosyth naval base in Fife. BAE Systems and VT Group, members of the industry alliance - including Babcock and France's Thales - that will design and build the carriers, on Wednesday outlined plans for a joint venture combining their yards at Glasgow, Filton and Portsmouth. The venture would lead to \"significant cost savings\" and make the naval industry more competitive in export markets, said BAE. According to Mr Browne, it would enable the navy \"to support the fleet in the future while retaining all three of our existing naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and Faslane\". There would be \"some reductions\" in the 17,800 personnel employed at the three bases. Lord Drayson, the defence equipment minister, said new working practices would be introduced, but insisted the bases would not be \"salami-sliced\". There had been fears Portsmouth would close. The carriers form a big part of the Ministry of Defence's spending settlement, which includes \u00a3550m for upgrading barracks. Officials conceded the department would have liked a bigger annual rise, but said the government was constrained on spending. Liam Fox, the shadow defence secretary, welcomed the news, but said that it came at \"a high price\" for the navy which had \"faced significant cuts in force levels\".", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140523101139/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/73075b0c-3ad8-11dc-8f9e-0000779fd2ac.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Work begins on aircraft carriers", "date": "2009-07-07", "content": "The Princess Royal has cut the first steel for Britain's biggest new warship to mark the start of construction work.

It is understood that India has recently lodged a firm expression of interest to buy one of the two state-of-the-art 65,000 tonne carriers, which are still being built by BAE Systems in the UK. Any sale of the long-delayed carriers would be highly controversial and would leave the Royal Navy with just one carrier. It could also force Britain to borrow from the French navy, which itself only has one carrier and is reluctant to build any more. Last summer French president Nicolas Sarkozy proposed to Gordon Brown that the two navies co-ordinate the maintenance and retrofitting of their carriers, so that at least one of them is at sea at any time. The government has accepted it would cost more to cancel the contract for one of the carriers than it would to carry on building. BAE Systems is also keen to increase its arms exports and would welcome the sale of such a flagship piece of hardware to a country such as India, which is keen to upgrade its military, particularly its air force. According to senior defence sources, Whitehall officials are examining the feasibility of selling one of the carriers. It is understood they are planning to put forward the option as part of the government's strategic defence review, which will start early next year. The review will publish its conclusions after the general election. Whichever party wins the election, the review is expected to result in savage cuts to the UK's military budget. \"Selling a carrier is one very serious option,\" a defence source said this weekend, although the government is a long way from committing to any sale. It could take between six and 12 months to reach a decision, he added. The \u00a34bn aircraft carrier programme has been dogged by controversy and has become a totemic in the issue over how public spending - and in particular the military budget - should be cut. The programme has already been delayed by two years to push back spending commitments, which will end up costing the taxpayer more in the long run. Construction finally began in July on HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is due to come into service in 2016. Preparatory work on the HMS Prince of Wales, due for launch in 2018, has also started. The two carriers will replace the ageing Invincible class carrier fleet, and are three times the size. Military chief and the companies involved in building the carriers had feared the government could scrap one of the carriers altogether to save money. But it is understood that the financial penalties the government would be required to pay to BAE Systems, the company building the ships, would be prohibitive. The company is currently drawing up a formal estimate of the cost the government would incur from cancelling the order. About 10,000 jobs in Portsmouth, Barrow-in-Furness, Fife and Glasgow depend on the work. Now that construction of both carriers will almost certainly go ahead, the government is desperate to find other ways to cut costs. Another option under consideration is to only equip one of the carriers with aircraft, leaving the other to only operate with helicopters, which could save more than \u00a33bn. Alternatively, the two carriers could share one complement of planes. The original plan envisaged equipping each carrier with 75 new US-made Joint Strike Fighter planes, but the cost has soared from the original price tag of \u00a318m each. Asked about the plan for a sale of the one of the carriers, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said lots of options for the carriers were being considered, but stressed that no decision had been taken. \"We have got the strategic defence review coming up, so all options are on the table,\" she said. The debate over whether British soldiers fighting in Afghanistan have the equipment they need - most notably enough helicopters to enable them to avoid heavily mined roads - has brought the issue of military spending to the fore. Military analysts say that the navy's budget, such as that earmarked for the carriers under review, is most vulnerable to cuts, compared to that of the army and air force.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/16/royal-navy-aircraft-carrier-sale"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Work begins on aircraft carriers", "date": "2009-07-07", "content": "The Princess Royal has cut the first steel for Britain's biggest new warship to mark the start of construction work.

The news was controversial. Many wondered why aircraft carriers were needed at all, let alone two each displacing some 65,000 tons and approaching the size of the US Navy's Nimitz class carriers. The carriers would be bigger than the current largest in European waters; the French Charles De Gaul and considerably larger and more capable than the RN's current Invincible class carrier. Arguments were abound; the money could be spent on civilian infrastructure or dealing with the financial crisis. Were carriers even needed now that the threat of the Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia was perceived as \"no threat\"? How could huge surface vessels help solve problems in places like Iraq and the landlocked Afghanistan? Now the intent of this article is not to defend the carrier par se, but I shall maintain that the decision for carrier capability (the ultimate modern expression of modern military power, and the finest expeditionary tool for foreign policy in the new security climate) was not only a good one but somewhat essential for both Britain and the Royal Navy. However, the construction of the vessels themselves brought forth new problems. The main weapon of the carrier is the air flight. The aircraft. Since the Battle of Midway in the Second World War, the carrier has been the supreme naval instrument. Its air flight can obtain air superiority over land and sea, deciding large conflicts, but also they can protect a fleet on the move, project force inland over vast ranges, and assist in all manner of operations short of war. However, for the \"Lilly-bet\" class this was a problem from the start. The scandalous conduct of the Royal Air Force/Farce in procuring the splendid Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter has caused some consternation. The plane cannot be converted to be capable of carrier-born operations and since the Fleet Air Arm lost its proper fighter capability to the RAF, it is the only fighter plane the RAF wants to fly. The unholy trinity of Royal Air Force, Ministry of Defense and British Aerospace have successfully grafted the Eurofighter to British defense. Very well, it is an exceptional air superiority fighter, but it cannot be put on board a carrier. This means it cannot fill the now long-empty boots of the RN's old warhorse the Sea Harrier or for that matter the RAF Harrier (Which weren't fighters anyway). The F-35 Lightning II was chosen to be the aircraft of choice for the air flights. However the road was far from clear. The Eurofighter was ordered on an allied project with three other European nations sometime back before your correspondent went to school. Due to various problems with working with a host of other companies and BAE's usual problems, it only arrived in service in 2004, officially. It has been so long in development that its questionably if it can stand up to the test of modern combat. Due to its expected deployment the Sea Harrier (the only British aircraft to shoot anything down in living memory) was pulled from service, and along with it the capable but aging Jaguar \"bomber\" jet which was a fine ground attack vehicle. The Eurofighter propaganda says that it's a multirole fighter capable of ground-attack but the software apparently doesn't allow it. The F-35 was designed and built in a sensible amount of time for a professional air-force (we'll say nothing of the \"Air National Guard\"), it is a highly capable and deadly system perhaps the best in air-to-air operations (though it must be said that the Eurofighter has given it a run for its money) and it can hit things on the ground as a superb ground-attack vehicle. So, the F-35 was decided as the fighter of choice to chuck off the carriers but this decision has been gone forward and back on since the beginning and its getting to the point where the MOD are even turning on their chums the RAF and BAE. Further foolishness is apparent when one considers even how this brilliant craft was going to be \"adapted\" for British use. There are three variants of the F-35 planned/in production/service: The US Air Force version which is a highly capable air superiority platform in its own right and will keep Ivan at bay; the American carrier version, which takes off using a catapult and a straight runway from American craft, a very sensible design of deck configuration; and the third version, machinated perhaps by BAE's presence on the project, which is somewhat tailored to small carrier requirements. However, after previous projects \"altered\" for British use, the Americans are reluctant to hand over anything to Rolls Royce as they're one of the only British defense companies who know what they're doing and can stick an RR engine in an F-35 which would put even the American versions to shame and could then be mass produced and sold to anyone who wants a carrier-born aircraft but hasn't got a big enough ship. This is due to the design of the carrier's deck; a ski-jump system with no catapult or arrestor wires like on an American ship. This means that the British version of the F-35 would require something of a STOVL (short takeoff Vertical Landing) capability, not a big deal, as there's three variants in at design level. The aircraft would take off from a short ski-jump runway and then would be able to \"hover\" down onto the deck much like the famous Harrier. This decision is very much an inheritance from the days of Harrier. Despite the size of the Queen Elizabeth class allowing a straight runway to be built, some slack jobsworths couldn't decide at the time what plane was likely to be put on it so they stuck with what they knew and fortunately for them, it seems BAE has chummed up to the American industry to be a principle partner on the subject. If BAE can use their position to get the RR engines into the STOVL F-35B - the only engines which will work on this version it must be pointed out - then perhaps some loose ends can be roughly tied up. The expenses mount though as one considers that all that would be required is a reconfiguration of the Queen Elizabeth class deck (a provision already well catered for) and the adoption of the American carrier variant capable of using catapult and arrestor wires. Whilst the F-35B and current deck configuration will do, it seems to be a lot of horsing around making new problems when there was simple solution: Copy the yanks, it'd be cheaper. Things worsened. In October the Times reported that the second carrier was to be converted to a rotary-wing carrier, a sort of assault ship similar to the current HMS Ocean. The paper said that this was due to the cost of maintaining two wings of F-35 fighters, one for each carrier. HMS Ocean needs replacement urgently. There have been times when this civilian-quality half-measure was flooded with fuel in the engine rooms. However, does this mean that the second carrier would be converted to replace the Ocean or provide something like it? It's unlikely. The necessary alterations would rack up an astronomical bill. Corridors would need to be widened, dockits for assault boats put in place, perhaps even larger docks, command and control facilities for over four separate commands, larger aircraft lifts for troop transport helicopters, and this is just the beginning. The costs to convert the vessel would end up more than building and running the original. What is more, the plan was to have two ships. One to be in refit while the other was on service with the one air-flight. This rules out conversion based on the cost of two wings. What's more likely is that in an emergency the second carrier deploying from refit in the emergency, would field a force of F-35s either on loan or \"spares\" for the first carrier. Worrying, but better than the expected alternative. What is more, reliable sources inform your correspondent that it would be too expensive to cancel the second ship anyway, even now, before her hull has been laid. Just last month The Guardian reported that India is expressing an interest in purchasing the second ship which may be sold off under government sale. Either selling it off or converting it still leaves the Royal Navy with one carrier and what is worse President Sarkozy of France offered the prime minister the option of working with the French navy to maintain a ship at sea between the two states. In other words, the French carrier would be in refit while the Queen Elizabeth would be at sea, and vice versa so that the other could be \"borrowed\" in an emergency. The move will leave the navy without a carrier when the Queen Elizabeth goes into refit, leaving open the possibility that it might have to borrow one from the French navy. In a meeting with Brown last year, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, had suggested that refits of French and British aircraft carriers should be coordinate. While it's a bit depressing and yet comical that the Royal Navy and French Navy, perhaps the world's oldest service enemies, would have to coordinate their carrier options, it also makes little sense. The Guardian article above said that the French did not want to purchase any more carriers, which seems strange as they had ordered a third carrier of the Queen Elizabeth class. This would leave them with just the Charles De Gaul, which is nuclear powered and a danger to be on. British crews would have to have a lot of retraining to use the propulsion system and features on board the French carrier and likewise for the French who would not be used to the large fuel turbines on the Queen Elizabeth. The upcoming Strategic Defense Review, will give us some clearer understanding of what the future has in store for the troubled project. What is certain is that a Conservative government would be under the same constraints as a Labour one and from where the Navy must be standing the rock and hard place analogy is applicable concerning the two parties.

Now the intent of this article is not to defend the carrier par se, but I shall maintain that the decision for carrier capability (the ultimate modern expression of modern military power, and the finest expeditionary tool for foreign policy in the new security climate) was not only a good one but somewhat essential for both Britain and the Royal Navy. However, the construction of the vessels themselves brought forth new problems. The main weapon of the carrier is the air flight. The aircraft. Since the Battle of Midway in the Second World War, the carrier has been the supreme naval instrument. Its air flight can obtain air superiority over land and sea, deciding large conflicts, but also they can protect a fleet on the move, project force inland over vast ranges, and assist in all manner of operations short of war. However, for the \"Lilly-bet\" class this was a problem from the start. The scandalous conduct of the Royal Air Force/Farce in procuring the splendid Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter has caused some consternation. The plane cannot be converted to be capable of carrier-born operations and since the Fleet Air Arm lost its proper fighter capability to the RAF, it is the only fighter plane the RAF wants to fly. The unholy trinity of Royal Air Force, Ministry of Defense and British Aerospace have successfully grafted the Eurofighter to British defense. Very well, it is an exceptional air superiority fighter, but it cannot be put on board a carrier. This means it cannot fill the now long-empty boots of the RN's old warhorse the Sea Harrier or for that matter the RAF Harrier (Which weren't fighters anyway). The F-35 Lightning II was chosen to be the aircraft of choice for the air flights. However the road was far from clear. The Eurofighter was ordered on an allied project with three other European nations sometime back before your correspondent went to school. Due to various problems with working with a host of other companies and BAE's usual problems, it only arrived in service in 2004, officially. It has been so long in development that its questionably if it can stand up to the test of modern combat. Due to its expected deployment the Sea Harrier (the only British aircraft to shoot anything down in living memory) was pulled from service, and along with it the capable but aging Jaguar \"bomber\" jet which was a fine ground attack vehicle. The Eurofighter propaganda says that it's a multirole fighter capable of ground-attack but the software apparently doesn't allow it. The F-35 was designed and built in a sensible amount of time for a professional air-force (we'll say nothing of the \"Air National Guard\"), it is a highly capable and deadly system perhaps the best in air-to-air operations (though it must be said that the Eurofighter has given it a run for its money) and it can hit things on the ground as a superb ground-attack vehicle. So, the F-35 was decided as the fighter of choice to chuck off the carriers but this decision has been gone forward and back on since the beginning and its getting to the point where the MOD are even turning on their chums the RAF and BAE. Further foolishness is apparent when one considers even how this brilliant craft was going to be \"adapted\" for British use. There are three variants of the F-35 planned/in production/service: The US Air Force version which is a highly capable air superiority platform in its own right and will keep Ivan at bay; the American carrier version, which takes off using a catapult and a straight runway from American craft, a very sensible design of deck configuration; and the third version, machinated perhaps by BAE's presence on the project, which is somewhat tailored to small carrier requirements. However, after previous projects \"altered\" for British use, the Americans are reluctant to hand over anything to Rolls Royce as they're one of the only British defense companies who know what they're doing and can stick an RR engine in an F-35 which would put even the American versions to shame and could then be mass produced and sold to anyone who wants a carrier-born aircraft but hasn't got a big enough ship. This is due to the design of the carrier's deck; a ski-jump system with no catapult or arrestor wires like on an American ship. This means that the British version of the F-35 would require something of a STOVL (short takeoff Vertical Landing) capability, not a big deal, as there's three variants in at design level. The aircraft would take off from a short ski-jump runway and then would be able to \"hover\" down onto the deck much like the famous Harrier. This decision is very much an inheritance from the days of Harrier. Despite the size of the Queen Elizabeth class allowing a straight runway to be built, some slack jobsworths couldn't decide at the time what plane was likely to be put on it so they stuck with what they knew and fortunately for them, it seems BAE has chummed up to the American industry to be a principle partner on the subject. If BAE can use their position to get the RR engines into the STOVL F-35B - the only engines which will work on this version it must be pointed out - then perhaps some loose ends can be roughly tied up. The expenses mount though as one considers that all that would be required is a reconfiguration of the Queen Elizabeth class deck (a provision already well catered for) and the adoption of the American carrier variant capable of using catapult and arrestor wires. Whilst the F-35B and current deck configuration will do, it seems to be a lot of horsing around making new problems when there was simple solution: Copy the yanks, it'd be cheaper. Things worsened. In October the Times reported that the second carrier was to be converted to a rotary-wing carrier, a sort of assault ship similar to the current HMS Ocean. The paper said that this was due to the cost of maintaining two wings of F-35 fighters, one for each carrier. HMS Ocean needs replacement urgently. There have been times when this civilian-quality half-measure was flooded with fuel in the engine rooms. However, does this mean that the second carrier would be converted to replace the Ocean or provide something like it? It's unlikely. The necessary alterations would rack up an astronomical bill. Corridors would need to be widened, dockits for assault boats put in place, perhaps even larger docks, command and control facilities for over four separate commands, larger aircraft lifts for troop transport helicopters, and this is just the beginning. The costs to convert the vessel would end up more than building and running the original. What is more, the plan was to have two ships. One to be in refit while the other was on service with the one air-flight. This rules out conversion based on the cost of two wings. What's more likely is that in an emergency the second carrier deploying from refit in the emergency, would field a force of F-35s either on loan or \"spares\" for the first carrier. Worrying, but better than the expected alternative. What is more, reliable sources inform your correspondent that it would be too expensive to cancel the second ship anyway, even now, before her hull has been laid. Just last month The Guardian reported that India is expressing an interest in purchasing the second ship which may be sold off under government sale. Either selling it off or converting it still leaves the Royal Navy with one carrier and what is worse President Sarkozy of France offered the prime minister the option of working with the French navy to maintain a ship at sea between the two states. In other words, the French carrier would be in refit while the Queen Elizabeth would be at sea, and vice versa so that the other could be \"borrowed\" in an emergency. The move will leave the navy without a carrier when the Queen Elizabeth goes into refit, leaving open the possibility that it might have to borrow one from the French navy. In a meeting with Brown last year, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, had suggested that refits of French and British aircraft carriers should be coordinate. While it's a bit depressing and yet comical that the Royal Navy and French Navy, perhaps the world's oldest service enemies, would have to coordinate their carrier options, it also makes little sense. The Guardian article above said that the French did not want to purchase any more carriers, which seems strange as they had ordered a third carrier of the Queen Elizabeth class. This would leave them with just the Charles De Gaul, which is nuclear powered and a danger to be on. British crews would have to have a lot of retraining to use the propulsion system and features on board the French carrier and likewise for the French who would not be used to the large fuel turbines on the Queen Elizabeth. The upcoming Strategic Defense Review, will give us some clearer understanding of what the future has in store for the troubled project.

About 10,000 jobs in Portsmouth, Barrow-in-Furness, Fife and Glasgow depend on the work. Now that construction of both carriers will almost certainly go ahead, the government is desperate to find other ways to cut costs. Another option under consideration is to only equip one of the carriers with aircraft, leaving the other to only operate with helicopters, which could save more than \u00a33bn. Alternatively, the two carriers could share one complement of planes. The original plan envisaged equipping each carrier with 75 new US-made Joint Strike Fighter planes, but the cost has soared from the original price tag of \u00a318m each.

He said: \"Here in Portsmouth work is just beginning but across the country in Devon, Newcastle, Glasgow and Rosyth work is already under way. \"In all, six shipyards across the UK will be involved in the manufacture of the ships' hulls, supporting up to 8,000 jobs in the construction and up to another 3,000 throughout the supply chain. \"The progress already being made to deliver these assets, which will be a cornerstone of future defence policy, is a testament to the skill and professionalism of UK industry.\" The steel-cutting which began yesterday is for the first of three blocks that BAE Systems Surface Ships will build for the ships in Portsmouth. At 70m long and 40m wide, the block will use 6,000 tonnes of steel. It will house space for machinery and supplies as well as switchboards and some accommodation. BAE Systems' role in the carrier build programme at Portsmouth is in the order of \u00a3800m, forming a substantial element of the workload at the naval base, where the company employs over 3,000 people, including around 200 apprentices. First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, said: \"The two ships of the Queen Elizabeth Class will be the largest and most powerful warships ever built for the UK, each equalling four acres 16,000 square metres from which to project air power anywhere in the world. \"With eighty per cent of the world's land mass within 500 miles 800km of the ocean, the carriers will provide unparalleled access and flexibility. They are vital joint assets for the future of defence.\" Managing Director of BAE Systems Surface Ships, Alan Johnston, said: \"This is a very proud day for our workforce here in Portsmouth and comes on the back of our work on the Clyde, where another large part of the carrier's hull is already taking shape. \"The design and build of ships of this magnitude is a massive engineering feat and a real testament to skills harnessed in our industry across the UK. \"We will continue to work closely with our partners in the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and to invest in the skills of our employees and our facilities not only to deliver the Royal Navy's future flagships, but also to secure the long-term future of the UK's warship building industry.\" Construction of the ships is progressing, and a national project that draws on the skills of shipyards throughout the UK is underway. This includes the shipyards at Glasgow, Rosyth, Newcastle, Devon and Birkenhead, as well as around a further 100 contracts throughout the supply chain. Some of the sections of the first ship's flight deck, called sponsons, have already been delivered to Rosyth, where the ships will be assembled. In spring, the first of the blocks of hull are also due to leave for the Scottish shipyard from Appledore in Devon. Many of the key components for the ships, such as the diesel generators and the turbines, have also already been manufactured.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161109194127/http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/tna/%2B/http%3A//www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/ConstructionBeginsAtNavysNewCarriersPortsmouthBase.htm"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth and the Future of the Royal Navy", "date": "2009-12-20", "content": "Earlier this year, public interest in the reforming of the Royal Navy was highlighted by the order for two aircraft carriers to be constructed by the \"Carrier Alliances\" of BAES/VT planned Joint Venture, Thales, Babcock and BAES. The news was controversial. Many wondered why aircraft carriers were needed at all, let alone two each displacing some 65,000 tons and approaching the size of the US Navy's Nimitz class carriers. The carriers would be bigger than the current largest in European waters; the French Charles De Gaul and considerably larger and more capable than the RN's current Invincible class carrier. Arguments were abound; the money could be spent on civilian infrastructure or dealing with the financial crisis. Were carriers even needed now that the threat of the Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia was perceived as \"no threat\"? How could huge surface vessels help solve problems in places like Iraq and the landlocked Afghanistan? Now the intent of this article is not to defend the carrier par se, but I shall maintain that the decision for carrier capability (the ultimate modern expression of modern military power, and the finest expeditionary tool for foreign policy in the new security climate) was not only a good one but somewhat essential for both Britain and the Royal Navy. However, the construction of the vessels themselves brought forth new problems. The main weapon of the carrier is the air flight. The aircraft. Since the Battle of Midway in the Second World War, the carrier has been the supreme naval instrument. Its air flight can obtain air superiority over land and sea, deciding large conflicts, but also they can protect a fleet on the move, project force inland over vast ranges, and assist in all manner of operations short of war. However, for the \"Lilly-bet\" class this was a problem from the start. The scandalous conduct of the Royal Air Force/Farce in procuring the splendid Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter has caused some consternation. The plane cannot be converted to be capable of carrier-born operations and since the Fleet Air Arm lost its proper fighter capability to the RAF, it is the only fighter plane the RAF wants to fly. The unholy trinity of Royal Air Force, Ministry of Defense and British Aerospace have successfully grafted the Eurofighter to British defense. Very well, it is an exceptional air superiority fighter, but it cannot be put on board a carrier. This means it cannot fill the now long-empty boots of the RN's old warhorse the Sea Harrier or for that matter the RAF Harrier (Which weren't fighters anyway). The F-35 Lightning II was chosen to be the aircraft of choice for the air flights. However the road was far from clear. The Eurofighter was ordered on an allied project with three other European nations sometime back before your correspondent went to school. Due to various problems with working with a host of other companies and BAE's usual problems, it only arrived in service in 2004, officially. It has been so long in development that its questionably if it can stand up to the test of modern combat. Due to its expected deployment the Sea Harrier (the only British aircraft to shoot anything down in living memory) was pulled from service, and along with it the capable but aging Jaguar \"bomber\" jet which was a fine ground attack vehicle. The Eurofighter propaganda says that it's a multirole fighter capable of ground-attack but the software apparently doesn't allow it. The F-35 was designed and built in a sensible amount of time for a professional air-force (we'll say nothing of the \"Air National Guard\"), it is a highly capable and deadly system perhaps the best in air-to-air operations (though it must be said that the Eurofighter has given it a run for its money) and it can hit things on the ground as a superb ground-attack vehicle. So, the F-35 was decided as the fighter of choice to chuck off the carriers but this decision has been gone forward and back on since the beginning and its getting to the point where the MOD are even turning on their chums the RAF and BAE. Further foolishness is apparent when one considers even how this brilliant craft was going to be \"adapted\" for British use. There are three variants of the F-35 planned/in production/service: The US Air Force version which is a highly capable air superiority platform in its own right and will keep Ivan at bay; the American carrier version, which takes off using a catapult and a straight runway from American craft, a very sensible design of deck configuration; and the third version, machinated perhaps by BAE's presence on the project, which is somewhat tailored to small carrier requirements. However, after previous projects \"altered\" for British use, the Americans are reluctant to hand over anything to Rolls Royce as they're one of the only British defense companies who know what they're doing and can stick an RR engine in an F-35 which would put even the American versions to shame and could then be mass produced and sold to anyone who wants a carrier-born aircraft but hasn't got a big enough ship. This is due to the design of the carrier's deck; a ski-jump system with no catapult or arrestor wires like on an American ship. This means that the British version of the F-35 would require something of a STOVL (short takeoff Vertical Landing) capability, not a big deal, as there's three variants in at design level. The aircraft would take off from a short ski-jump runway and then would be able to \"hover\" down onto the deck much like the famous Harrier. This decision is very much an inheritance from the days of Harrier. Despite the size of the Queen Elizabeth class allowing a straight runway to be built, some slack jobsworths couldn't decide at the time what plane was likely to be put on it so they stuck with what they knew and fortunately for them, it seems BAE has chummed up to the American industry to be a principle partner on the subject. If BAE can use their position to get the RR engines into the STOVL F-35B - the only engines which will work on this version it must be pointed out - then perhaps some loose ends can be roughly tied up. The expenses mount though as one considers that all that would be required is a reconfiguration of the Queen Elizabeth class deck (a provision already well catered for) and the adoption of the American carrier variant capable of using catapult and arrestor wires. Whilst the F-35B and current deck configuration will do, it seems to be a lot of horsing around making new problems when there was simple solution: Copy the yanks, it'd be cheaper. Things worsened. In October the Times reported that the second carrier was to be converted to a rotary-wing carrier, a sort of assault ship similar to the current HMS Ocean. The paper said that this was due to the cost of maintaining two wings of F-35 fighters, one for each carrier. HMS Ocean needs replacement urgently. There have been times when this civilian-quality half-measure was flooded with fuel in the engine rooms. However, does this mean that the second carrier would be converted to replace the Ocean or provide something like it? It's unlikely. The necessary alterations would rack up an astronomical bill. Corridors would need to be widened, dockits for assault boats put in place, perhaps even larger docks, command and control facilities for over four separate commands, larger aircraft lifts for troop transport helicopters, and this is just the beginning. The costs to convert the vessel would end up more than building and running the original. What is more, the plan was to have two ships. One to be in refit while the other was on service with the one air-flight. This rules out conversion based on the cost of two wings. What's more likely is that in an emergency the second carrier deploying from refit in the emergency, would field a force of F-35s either on loan or \"spares\" for the first carrier. Worrying, but better than the expected alternative. What is more, reliable sources inform your correspondent that it would be too expensive to cancel the second ship anyway, even now, before her hull has been laid. Just last month The Guardian reported that India is expressing an interest in purchasing the second ship which may be sold off under government sale. Either selling it off or converting it still leaves the Royal Navy with one carrier and what is worse President Sarkozy of France offered the prime minister the option of working with the French navy to maintain a ship at sea between the two states. In other words, the French carrier would be in refit while the Queen Elizabeth would be at sea, and vice versa so that the other could be \"borrowed\" in an emergency. The move will leave the navy without a carrier when the Queen Elizabeth goes into refit, leaving open the possibility that it might have to borrow one from the French navy. In a meeting with Brown last year, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, had suggested that refits of French and British aircraft carriers should be coordinate. While it's a bit depressing and yet comical that the Royal Navy and French Navy, perhaps the world's oldest service enemies, would have to coordinate their carrier options, it also makes little sense. The Guardian article above said that the French did not want to purchase any more carriers, which seems strange as they had ordered a third carrier of the Queen Elizabeth class. This would leave them with just the Charles De Gaul, which is nuclear powered and a danger to be on. British crews would have to have a lot of retraining to use the propulsion system and features on board the French carrier and likewise for the French who would not be used to the large fuel turbines on the Queen Elizabeth. The upcoming Strategic Defense Review, will give us some clearer understanding of what the future has in store for the troubled project. What is certain is that a Conservative government would be under the same constraints as a Labour one and from where the Navy must be standing the rock and hard place analogy is applicable concerning the two parties. Controversy continues around public spending, particularly on defense with the tired refrain of \"helicopters and body armour\" is still echoed in the broadsheets and the tabloids on the Afghan campaign.", "url": "https://atlanticsentinel.com/2009/12/hms-queen-elizabeth-and-the-future-of-the-royal-navy/"}, {"title": "Royal Navy aircraft carrier may be sold to India", "date": "2009-11-17", "content": "One of the Royal Navy's new \u00a32bn aircraft carriers could be sold off under government cost-cutting plans, the Guardian has learned. It is understood that India has recently lodged a firm expression of interest to buy one of the two state-of-the-art 65,000 tonne carriers, which are still being built by BAE Systems in the UK. Any sale of the long-delayed carriers would be highly controversial and would leave the Royal Navy with just one carrier. It could also force Britain to borrow from the French navy, which itself only has one carrier and is reluctant to build any more. Last summer French president Nicolas Sarkozy proposed to Gordon Brown that the two navies co-ordinate the maintenance and retrofitting of their carriers, so that at least one of them is at sea at any time. The government has accepted it would cost more to cancel the contract for one of the carriers than it would to carry on building. BAE Systems is also keen to increase its arms exports and would welcome the sale of such a flagship piece of hardware to a country such as India, which is keen to upgrade its military, particularly its air force. According to senior defence sources, Whitehall officials are examining the feasibility of selling one of the carriers. It is understood they are planning to put forward the option as part of the government's strategic defence review, which will start early next year. The review will publish its conclusions after the general election. Whichever party wins the election, the review is expected to result in savage cuts to the UK's military budget. \"Selling a carrier is one very serious option,\" a defence source said this weekend, although the government is a long way from committing to any sale. It could take between six and 12 months to reach a decision, he added. The \u00a34bn aircraft carrier programme has been dogged by controversy and has become a totemic in the issue over how public spending - and in particular the military budget - should be cut. The programme has already been delayed by two years to push back spending commitments, which will end up costing the taxpayer more in the long run. Construction finally began in July on HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is due to come into service in 2016. Preparatory work on the HMS Prince of Wales, due for launch in 2018, has also started. The two carriers will replace the ageing Invincible class carrier fleet, and are three times the size. Military chief and the companies involved in building the carriers had feared the government could scrap one of the carriers altogether to save money. But it is understood that the financial penalties the government would be required to pay to BAE Systems, the company building the ships, would be prohibitive. The company is currently drawing up a formal estimate of the cost the government would incur from cancelling the order. About 10,000 jobs in Portsmouth, Barrow-in-Furness, Fife and Glasgow depend on the work. Now that construction of both carriers will almost certainly go ahead, the government is desperate to find other ways to cut costs. Another option under consideration is to only equip one of the carriers with aircraft, leaving the other to only operate with helicopters, which could save more than \u00a33bn. Alternatively, the two carriers could share one complement of planes. The original plan envisaged equipping each carrier with 75 new US-made Joint Strike Fighter planes, but the cost has soared from the original price tag of \u00a318m each. Asked about the plan for a sale of the one of the carriers, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said lots of options for the carriers were being considered, but stressed that no decision had been taken. \"We have got the strategic defence review coming up, so all options are on the table,\" she said. The debate over whether British soldiers fighting in Afghanistan have the equipment they need - most notably enough helicopters to enable them to avoid heavily mined roads - has brought the issue of military spending to the fore. Military analysts say that the navy's budget, such as that earmarked for the carriers under review, is most vulnerable to cuts, compared to that of the army and air force.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/16/royal-navy-aircraft-carrier-sale"}, {"title": "Cammell Laird wins \u00a350m Royal Navy warship contract", "date": "2010-01-25", "content": "CAMMELL Laird has secured a \u00a350m contract to build the flight deck for the Royal Navy's largest-ever warship. The three-year deal is for the next-generation aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The deal will create jobs at Cammell Laird and among the region's supply chain, as well as safeguarding jobs among the existing workforce. The yard directly employs almost 700 staff and provides work for a similar number of sub-contractors. It is a hugely significant deal for the Birkenhead shipyard, which has spent nearly nine years repairing its reputation from the embers of the firm that collapsed in 2001. Contracts initially worth \u00a344m have now been signed, nine months after Cammell Laird was named preferred bidder, alongside the Teesside yard of A&P, for the Ministry of Defence contract. The \u00a34bn Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers - a two-ship class that includes the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales - are to replace the ageing Invincible class aircraft carriers. HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to enter service around 2016 with its sister vessel to follow two years later. When Cammell Laird was awarded preferred bidder status, chief executive John Syvret described it as \"a major endorsement of the skills and expertise\" of the shipyard. Looking ahead to the successful completion of the deal, he said it would \"safeguard and generate jobs for local people and work for local businesses\". The yard plans to use its giant shipbuilding hall, which is the biggest of its kind in Europe, to work on the aircraft carrier. Once complete, the flight decks are likely to be transported from the hall to the river's edge and lifted onto barges to be sailed up to Rosyth, in Scotland, where both vessels will be assembled. A variety of UK shipyards has won contracts to construct parts of the vessels and work on cutting the first steel for the carriers in Govan took place last July. The Minister for Defence Equipment and Support, Quentin Davies, reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the carrier programme this month when \u00a3333m of contract awards were announced.

The upcoming Strategic Defense Review, will give us some clearer understanding of what the future has in store for the troubled project. What is certain is that a Conservative government would be under the same constraints as a Labour one and from where the Navy must be standing the rock and hard place analogy is applicable concerning the two parties.

The Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales, due to enter naval service in 2016 and 2018, will cost an estimated \u00a35bn. Plans to equip them with US Joint Strike Fighters will more than double the price. The Guardian has learned there is widespread scepticism among officials advising the National Security Council (NSC) about the need for such \"force projection\" as well as for a like-for-like replacement for the Trident nuclear missile system. Later this week, the NSC will examine for the first time detailed plans for the strategic defence and security review due to be completed by the end of October. It has already considered three broad strategic options facing the UK - \"vigilant\", ie concentrating on home defence; investing in agile or \"adaptable\" forces; or \"committed\" - focusing on being ready to intervene in any future overseas conflict. The NSC has chosen the \"adaptable\" option. Cost-cutting measures being considered for the carriers include slashing the number of strike aircraft to go on them and buying cheaper planes, which would be launched by catapult. This would have the added advantage of what officials call \"interoperability\" with France, whose navy aircraft all use catapults. David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, are expected to announce specific plans for defence co-operation at their summit in Britain in early November.

But the construction of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is a mammoth task. Imagine an aircraft carrier as a 65,000-tonne jigsaw puzzle and you have got a good idea of the scale of the building of HMS Queen Elizabeth. The pieces are being built at six shipyards around the UK and will be slotted together at Rosyth in Fife using an enormous crane which was transported by sea from China. Around 10,000 workers across Britain are employed on the \u00a35bn project with up to 25,000 engaged in building components for the Lockheed Martin F-35 aircraft. The carrier will have between 12 and 40 F-35s, or Joint Strike Fighters, costing around \u00a365m each. \"It's the biggest shipbuilding project for the Royal Navy ever and is second only in engineering terms to the Olympics,\" says the man in charge of the whole project, David Downs, engineering director with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) consortium. \"All my nights are sleepless, worrying about it,\" he jokes. The Queen Elizabeth and sister ship Prince of Wales will be far bigger than the Ark Royal but still significantly smaller than US equivalents. Downs and his team designed the ships using computer software - every inch mapped out electronically with laser-guided measurements which ensure the parts fit together.

BAE Systems is part of ACA and at its Govan yard in Glasgow, integrated work teams manager David Thomas gives a tour around one huge segment of the ship. Clambering under the hulk, wearing only a hard hat for protection, it's hard not to think of what would happen if the frame holding up 14,000 tons of steel gave way. But Thomas is reassuring on the yard's safety record. He has been supervising the insertion of some of the 450 prefabricated cabins and 150 shower rooms - made by a firm on Teesside - in the ship's innards. He carries with him a small manual showing where everything fitted. Anyone who finds the instructions to flatpack furniture a challenge would find it mind-boggling. The whole process starts with the arrival of huge sheets of steel. They are \"burned\" into various shapes and sizes - some of them quite small - which are welded into position. Gradually the sections become bigger as deck after deck is welded together. One of the Govan team is Lyn Gordon, 23, an apprentice fabricator and one of a number of women working on the project. \"My fascination with shipbuilding came from living on the Clyde,\" she says. \"I realise that it will eventually be an aircraft carrier and I will get to see it turning from a sheet of a metal, to a component, to HMS Queen Elizabeth.\" The first segment from Govan should be ready this summer and will be towed by barge, around the northern tip of Scotland, to Rosyth. At Rosyth the dry dock is ready for the assembly process. Last month the crane arrived from Shanghai, having squeezed under the Forth Bridge at low tide. Rosyth has List X status, meaning everyone working there has to be security cleared, including the 50 Chinese workers who are helping to erect the 93m crane. The first piece of steel was cut in 2009 but HMS Queen Elizabeth will not be finished until 2016 at the earliest, and may not be ready for action until 2020. The construction of her sister ship, the HMS Prince of Wales, will overlap and the current plan is for one of them to be operational while the other would be kept in \"extended readiness\". With the Ark Royal's fleet of Harrier jump jets being decommissioned the Navy will be without carrier-based planes for almost a decade.

Aircraft carriers are arguably the ultimate symbol of military prestige, a mobile projection of military might. The Royal Navy pioneered carriers, explains Hewitt, head of attractions and collections at the Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust. The first carriers were converted ships like the 7,500 ton Ark Royal, whose biplanes first saw action in February 1915 against the Turks in the Dardanelles. Since the 1930s, US carriers have dwarfed their British allies, Hewitt notes. \"The US carriers were designed for the Pacific and to be away from base indefinitely. The British carriers were designed to operate in the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic or from bases in Singapore or India.\" HMS Invincible, which fought in the Falklands, and HMS Ark Royal, which was recently pensioned off, weighed in at a puny 22,000 tons compared to the American carriers such as the USS George H W Bush, at 101,000 tons.

Originally the shorter route around the north of Scotland had been planned. However, bad weather in the north of the UK forced reconsideration and the route was changed to around the south of England and up to Rosyth through the North Sea. Employees at BAE Systems' Govan shipyard, where the section was pieced together, and members of the public watched as a large seagoing barge carrying the aft section of hull made its way along the Clyde, past new destroyer HMS Duncan in the final stages of completion at Scotstoun, and under the Erskine Bridge. Travelling around the south coast of England, the block - the final section of the hull to be finished - is scheduled to arrive at Rosyth early next week where it will be joined to the rest of HMS Queen Elizabeth. Lower Block 04 is 86 metres long, 40 metres wide and 23 metres high and contains the carrier's two main engine rooms, the sick bay and quarters for some of the 1,500 sailors and air group personnel who will serve in her later this decade. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"Our next generation of aircraft carriers is on track, with HMS Queen Elizabeth due to begin sea trials in 2017 and flight trials from her deck using our Lightning II fast jets in 2018. We are regenerating our carrier strike capability with the largest aircraft carriers Britain has ever had and fifth-generation stealth jets.\" \"Scotland has a world class shipbuilding industry that has benefited to the tune of around \u00a31.3bn from the Queen Elizabeth Class carriers. More than 2,000 people work on the carriers at Rosyth, with a further 2,000 on the Clyde.\" BAE Systems' Angus Holt, in charge of block delivery for the Queen Elizabeth Class, said: \"There's a real sense of pride here in the yard and across the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.\" \"This is the final hull section of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her arrival in Rosyth will mark an exciting and significant phase in the programme when we will really see the immense scale of the nation's flagships.\" The giant block was edged out of the firm's shipbuilding hall at Govan a fortnight ago and prepared for its journey by being firmly secured to the seagoing barge. The carrier team closely monitored weather forecasts to plan a smooth journey to the east coast. On its arrival in the Firth of Forth, the block will be floated off the specialist barge and moved into position in dry dock, ready to join the other sections already in place. Around 250 employees from the Clyde will follow the block to Rosyth where they will work in partnership with Babcock to complete the assembly phase. Meanwhile, production on both Lower Blocks 03 and 04 of Queen Elizabeth's sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, continues to progress at Govan, while the aft island for the first ship is under construction at the company's Scotstoun yard. Half-a-dozen yards around the UK are involved in the carrier project, with some 10,000 people directly or indirectly involved in building sections and parts or providing equipment for the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales. With the Olympics now over, the construction of the aircraft carriers is the biggest and most complex engineering project in the UK.", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-section-of-hms-queen-elizabeth-leaves-shipyard"}, {"title": "GIGANTIC PIECE OF HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH ARRIVES TO JOIN THE REST OF THE SHIP", "date": "2012-11-12", "content": "LAST week we brought you a giant section of HMS Queen Elizabeth obscuring iconic Dumbarton Rock. This week we bring you that same giant section of HMS Queen Elizabeth passing beneath Britain's most famous railway crossing, the Forth Bridge. Shortly before 11am on November 11 Lower Block 04 was carried on a large ocean-going barge under the Forth road and rail bridges, thus safely completing a 1200-mile journey from the Clyde. The section - which weighs 11,300 tonnes and is the final piece of the hull to be finished - was due to travel around the top of Scotland, but the autumn weather meant instead rounding Land's End and passing up the Channel to Fife. Some of the 1,000-plus people involved in the carrier project at Rosyth - one of six yards around in the UK committed to the Queen Elizabeth-class project - are now preparing to remove the sea fastenings which have fixed the block to the barge so it can join the rest of the ship. \"This marks a huge milestone for the programme to deliver the nation's flagships,\" said Ian Booth, director of the carrier project which is the biggest engineering project currently under way in the UK. \"Now it is at Rosyth that the hard work continues as we begin the massive task of joining it to the sections of Queen Elizabeth already in place.\" All sections of the hull are now built, but not all are at Rosyth - and not all have yet been attached to the carrier, which is roughly 50 per cent complete. The rear half of No.1 dock at the yard, which was enlarged especially to accommodate Queen Elizabeth and her sister, will be flooded allowing Lower Block 04 to be floated in. Once in and attached, the water will be drained and the complex task of getting the equipment in the section to 'talk' to the rest of the systems in Queen Elizabeth. The block is 86 metres (282ft) long, 40 metres (131ft) wide and 23 metres (75ft) high and contains the carrier's two main engine rooms, the sick bay and quarters for some of the 1,500 sailors and air group personnel who will serve in her later this decade.

The first of the two ships, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is 80% complete internally according to Rear Admiral Russell Harding, the head of the U.K. Fleet Air Arm, speaking at the Defence Services Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition in London Sept. 10. The vessel is due to be launched \"some time in 2014\" while work on the sister ship, the HMS Prince of Wales, is proceeding apace. The carriers will form the centerpiece of the Responsive Force Task Group (RFTG), capable of embarking a wide variety of rotary-wing platforms as well as a squadron of the U.K.'s planned F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters. Although the last Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) called for an embarked complement of 12 JSFs on the ship, Harding suggested that a new Joint Air Maneuver Package could be developed in support of amphibious operations. A surge force of up to 24 JSFs could deploy on the ship along with what he described as a Maritime Force Protection package of nine Merlin Mk. 2 helicopters equipped for the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission, while a further four or five would be available to provide an airborne early warning capability. A littoral maneuver package also is envisaged, potentially using the Royal Air Force's Chinooks, the upgraded Merlin Mk. 4, Army Apache attack helicopters and the Wildcat helicopter. Studies are being carried out by the U.K. Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) to see if the ship can operate safely with more landing spots than the six currently planned. Harding suggests that by adding a further four landing spots, the ship will be able to lift a company-sized unit of troops (up to 250 soldiers) in a single group lift using medium helicopters. \"This is possible,\" Harding said. \"We just need to decide how we paint the lines on the flight deck.\" Significant work has gone into reducing the manpower levels of the ship. Current crew complement for the vessel alone is 679 sailors, compared to 3,200 for a Nimitz-class carrier of the U.S. Navy. Harding said such savings were possible through the use of greater automation. He described the weapon-handling system as similar to that found in an \"Amazon.com warehouse.\" As the entry into service of the carriers nears, the U.K. is planning to send more than 300 personnel from officers to sailors to gain experience in carrier operations with the U.S. Navy on its CVNs and with the U.S. Marine Corps on its LHDs. And while more pilots will be involved in exchanges with Navy Hornet squadrons and Marine Harrier units, one officer will exchange on the French navy's Dassault Super Etendard carrier-borne fighter bomber in a bid to gain experience flying operations from small deck carriers. The future of the HMS Prince of Wales is currently unclear. In the 2010 SDSR, it was decided that the ship would go into \"extended reserve.\" Harding told delegates that the final decision would be made during SDSR 2015 but said that with the money spent on the ship, retaining it as a backup to the Queen Elizabeth on an extended readiness might be a cost-effective solution.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110305/http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=%2Farticle-xml%2Fawx_09_11_2013_p0-615007.xml"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Aft island of Queen Elizabeth carrier in place", "date": "2013-06-08", "content": "After an air horn sounded, a huge Goliath crane was used to lower the 750-tonne section of the aircraft carrier, known as Upper Block 14, into place.

Rear Admiral Steve Brunton said: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth will be at the centre of the UK's defence capability for the 50 years she is expected to be in service.\" \"She will be absolutely unique and, combined with assets across the rest of the UK's Armed Forces, will provide this country with an unprecedented level of capability, protecting UK interests and providing humanitarian support across the globe.\" HMS Queen Elizabeth is the first aircraft carrier to use an innovative design of 2 islands. The forward island, which has already been erected, houses the ship's bridge, while the 30-metre-tall aft island will house the air traffic control equipment, making it the centre of all onboard flight operations. Apprentice Gordon Currie, who operated the horn which marked the start of the manoeuvre to lower the island, said: \"It is a huge honour to sound the horn and signal the final stage in the lift. I am just one of hundreds of workers working on this incredible ship, and it is something I will always be really proud of.\" The aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales are being delivered by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, a unique partnering relationship between BAE Systems, Thales UK, Babcock and the Ministry of Defence.", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/aft-island-of-queen-elizabeth-carrier-in-place"}, {"title": "U.K. Royal Navy Widening Scope Of Carrier Use", "date": "2013-09-11", "content": "The U.K. Royal Navy is broadening the scope of how it might use its future fleet of Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The first of the two ships, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is 80% complete internally according to Rear Admiral Russell Harding, the head of the U.K. Fleet Air Arm, speaking at the Defence Services Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition in London Sept. 10. The vessel is due to be launched \"some time in 2014\" while work on the sister ship, the HMS Prince of Wales, is proceeding apace. The carriers will form the centerpiece of the Responsive Force Task Group (RFTG), capable of embarking a wide variety of rotary-wing platforms as well as a squadron of the U.K.'s planned F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters. Although the last Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) called for an embarked complement of 12 JSFs on the ship, Harding suggested that a new Joint Air Maneuver Package could be developed in support of amphibious operations. A surge force of up to 24 JSFs could deploy on the ship along with what he described as a Maritime Force Protection package of nine Merlin Mk. 2 helicopters equipped for the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission, while a further four or five would be available to provide an airborne early warning capability. A littoral maneuver package also is envisaged, potentially using the Royal Air Force's Chinooks, the upgraded Merlin Mk. 4, Army Apache attack helicopters and the Wildcat helicopter. Studies are being carried out by the U.K. Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) to see if the ship can operate safely with more landing spots than the six currently planned. Harding suggests that by adding a further four landing spots, the ship will be able to lift a company-sized unit of troops (up to 250 soldiers) in a single group lift using medium helicopters. \"This is possible,\" Harding said. \"We just need to decide how we paint the lines on the flight deck.\" Significant work has gone into reducing the manpower levels of the ship. Current crew complement for the vessel alone is 679 sailors, compared to 3,200 for a Nimitz-class carrier of the U.S. Navy. Harding said such savings were possible through the use of greater automation. He described the weapon-handling system as similar to that found in an \"Amazon.com warehouse.\" As the entry into service of the carriers nears, the U.K. is planning to send more than 300 personnel from officers to sailors to gain experience in carrier operations with the U.S. Navy on its CVNs and with the U.S. Marine Corps on its LHDs. And while more pilots will be involved in exchanges with Navy Hornet squadrons and Marine Harrier units, one officer will exchange on the French navy's Dassault Super Etendard carrier-borne fighter bomber in a bid to gain experience flying operations from small deck carriers.

Next month HMS Queen Elizabeth is to be named by her namesake the Queen in a traditional champagne ceremony at Rosyth, where she has been constructed from components forged across the county. Then she will free the giant dry dock for her sister ship the Prince of Wales, but for now she is firmly in place and today, The Independent had early access to the warship before she floats for the first time. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is designed around the F-35B Lightning II jet and once operational in 2020 will be capable of tasks ranging from humanitarian assistance to air strikes on the first day of a high-intensity conflict,\" said Captain Simon Petitt, the Royal Naval officer in charge, who is working with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, including BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales, to bring the ship into service. She may not be operational just yet - she officially becomes a military vessel in 2017 - but HMS Queen Elizabeth has taken form already, towering above the quayside with a 4.5-acre flight deck, dwarfing the size of the Royal Navy's previous generation of carriers. When deployed she will have a range of 10,000 miles, be able to steam 500 miles a day and be able to carry a mixture of 40 jets and helicopters, as well as up to 1,600 embarked service personal, including a crew of 679. She will, as the Royal Navy loves to say, be able to \"project force\". There was hubbub of activity today, with 1,400 workers putting on the last of seven paints of battleship grey ahead of the Royal visit, but the new class of warship has been plagued by overuns and delays, doubling in cost from \u00a33.1bn to \u00a36.2bn, and recently earned an embarrassing \"red\" warning from the Major Projects Authority. On board ship though most workers seem more keen on pointing out the vast \"Goliath\" crane which help pull together the ship's 40,000 tonnes of steel and 17 million individual parts. Inside it boasts 3,013 modern-looking compartments with 3.1 million metres of cable, 362,000 miles of pipes and 250,000 litres of battleship grey paintwork. In places it looks very much complete. Next month the Queen will be joined by David Cameron, but also Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, to name the ship. Captain Petitt said, \"It's a day to celebrate the industry of shipbuilding, I'll leave the worrying about the seating plan to the First Sea Lord's Office.\" On the rust-coloured deck, scaffolding contractor Gerard McCue, 52, is happy for the Queen \"to visit\" and \"perhaps\" remain head of state, but is adamant he'll be voting for independence and that one of the two carriers should remain Scottish. \"We're waiting for a yes vote on 18 September then we should seize this ship for Scotland. I'm all for common defence and the Queen is welcome as a head of state to name her, but I will be voting yes, to vote for Scotland and Scottish jobs.

A bottle of whisky was smashed on the hull of the 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth - the first of two new Royal Navy aircraft carriers being built. The Red Arrows flew over the dockyard before the ship was officially named. First Sea Lord Admiral George Zambellas said the ship was \"fit for a Queen\". \"HMS Queen Elizabeth will be a national instrument of power and a national symbol of authority,\" he said in a speech. \"That means she will be a national icon too, all the while keeping the great in Great Britain and the royal in Royal Navy.\" 'Inspiration and pride':Addressing the audience, the Queen said the \"innovative and first class\" warship, the largest ever to be built in the UK, ushered in an \"exciting new era\". \"In sponsoring this new aircraft carrier, I believe the Queen Elizabeth will be a source of inspiration and pride for us all,\" she said. \"May God bless her and all who sail in her.\" About 3,500 people involved in the design and construction of the carrier watched the celebrations, alongside dignitaries and politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron, First Minister Alex Salmond and former prime minister Gordon Brown. Mr Cameron said it was a \"very proud day\" for Scotland and the UK, while Mr Salmond said it was a \"huge day\" for the workers and their families. Ian Booth, of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance which is overseeing the ship's construction, said it was a \"historic occasion\". \"The ship truly reflects the very best of British design and ingenuity,\" he said in a speech. The Red Arrows flypast was followed by a procession of three generations of Royal Navy aircraft, including a historic 1950s de Havilland Sea Vixen fighter - the last and only flying aircraft of its kind in the world. The Queen oversaw the ceremony by pressing a button to release a bottle of Islay malt whisky - suspended at the front of the ship - to smash on to the hull. The naming ceremony, a naval tradition dating back thousands of years, marked the first time in more than 15 years that the Queen has christened a Royal Navy warship. Six shipyards in the UK including Tyne, Rosyth and Appledore have been involved in building parts of the carrier. More than 10,000 people at more than 100 companies have worked on HMS Queen Elizabeth, which has been beset by construction and design delays. The estimated cost of the vessel and its sister ship is \u00a36.2bn, well over the initial projected cost of \u00a33.65bn. The warship is as long as 25 buses and can carry 40 jets and helicopters at a time. It will have a permanent crew of almost 1,600 when it enters service in 2020. Mr Booth described it as a \"floating military city that can deploy aircraft, that can act as a disaster relief centre\". Analysis: Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent It so happens that the Royal Navy has chosen to name and float its new aircraft carrier on American Independence Day. Yet this ceremony signals the UK's intention to continue to independently project military power in the world for decades to come. Albeit that the largest warship ever built in Britain will carry fighter jets made largely in the US. But one question that arises is: in whose name will HMS Queen Elizabeth and its air crews operate when they come into service in 2020? Will it be the flagship of the UK as it currently exists or only for England, Wales and Northern Ireland if Scotland chooses its own independence in September's referendum? The UK government argues that the union offers Scotland greater security as well as greater job prospects for thousands of Scottish defence workers. The Scottish government believes NATO would guarantee an independent Scotland's defence and that shipyards such as Rosyth and Govan would continue to prosper by winning orders from both the UK and Scottish defence ministries. The huge choice that Scotland faces looms large at the naming of a very big ship. Major construction: The carrier has still to be fitted out and floated, to make way for the assembly of its sister ship HMS Prince of Wales. Assembly of HMS Prince of Wales is set to begin at Rosyth later this year. The naming of the first of the two ships comes five years after the first metal was cut on the vessel and 33 months after the first section entered the dry dock at Rosyth for assembly. Firefighters had to be called to a fire on board HMS Elizabeth last month. A small fire had started in one of the vessel's hull compartments but fire crews only reported minor damage. The US last month grounded all of its F-35 Lightning II fighters, the type of aircraft due to fly operationally from HMS Queen Elizabeth, after one caught fire on a runway. The US Department of Defence (DoD) said all 97 stealth fighters would face additional engine inspections following the incident at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on 23 June. The F-35 is due to make its international debut at the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford from 11 July but the DoD said it would make a final decision on whether it attends early next week.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28146412"}, {"title": "U.K. Carrier Floated For The First Time", "date": "2014-07-04", "content": "The first of two new aircraft carriers for the U.K. has been floated out of its dry dock for the first time. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) - the consortium charged with the construction of the 65,000-tonne carriers - floated HMS Queen Elizabeth from its dry dock at the Rosyth naval shipyard near Edinburgh, Scotland, on July 17. Engineers began flooding the dock earlier in the week in preparation for the move, which comes less than two weeks after the naming ceremony of the ship, when it was christened by its namesake on July 4. The ship has now been moved to a nearby berth, where engineers will continue to outfit the vessel with its various systems as well as add its propellers, which will drive it to a maximum speed of 28 kt. According to BAE Systems, one of the companies in ACA, maneuvering the ship from its dock took three hours, with just two meters of clearance on either side. Now that the dock has been vacated, it will be used to begin assembly of HMS Prince of Wales. Significant component blocks for the second ship have already begun arriving at Rosyth, and assembly is due to start in September. Meanwhile, the internal fitting-out of Queen Elizabeth is planned for completion in December 2015. Royal Navy personnel will begin training on the ship in May 2016, with sea trials due to be undertaken that August. Acceptance should occur in May 2017, and the Royal Navy hopes that the first F-35Bs will land on the vast, 4.5-acre flight deck, stationed somewhere off the U.S. east coast, towards the end of 2018. Flight trials with helicopters will take place during 2017. The future of HMS Prince of Wales remains uncertain, however, as it was slated to be in the 2010 government Strategic Defense and Security Review.

A bottle of whisky was smashed on the hull of the 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth - the first of two new Royal Navy aircraft carriers being built. The Red Arrows flew over the dockyard before the ship was officially named. First Sea Lord Admiral George Zambellas said the ship was \"fit for a Queen\". \"HMS Queen Elizabeth will be a national instrument of power and a national symbol of authority,\" he said in a speech. \"That means she will be a national icon too, all the while keeping the great in Great Britain and the royal in Royal Navy.\" 'Inspiration and pride':Addressing the audience, the Queen said the \"innovative and first class\" warship, the largest ever to be built in the UK, ushered in an \"exciting new era\". \"In sponsoring this new aircraft carrier, I believe the Queen Elizabeth will be a source of inspiration and pride for us all,\" she said. \"May God bless her and all who sail in her.\" About 3,500 people involved in the design and construction of the carrier watched the celebrations, alongside dignitaries and politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron, First Minister Alex Salmond and former prime minister Gordon Brown. Mr Cameron said it was a \"very proud day\" for Scotland and the UK, while Mr Salmond said it was a \"huge day\" for the workers and their families. Ian Booth, of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance which is overseeing the ship's construction, said it was a \"historic occasion\". \"The ship truly reflects the very best of British design and ingenuity,\" he said in a speech. The Red Arrows flypast was followed by a procession of three generations of Royal Navy aircraft, including a historic 1950s de Havilland Sea Vixen fighter - the last and only flying aircraft of its kind in the world. The Queen oversaw the ceremony by pressing a button to release a bottle of Islay malt whisky - suspended at the front of the ship - to smash on to the hull. The naming ceremony, a naval tradition dating back thousands of years, marked the first time in more than 15 years that the Queen has christened a Royal Navy warship. Six shipyards in the UK including Tyne, Rosyth and Appledore have been involved in building parts of the carrier. More than 10,000 people at more than 100 companies have worked on HMS Queen Elizabeth, which has been beset by construction and design delays. The estimated cost of the vessel and its sister ship is \u00a36.2bn, well over the initial projected cost of \u00a33.65bn. The warship is as long as 25 buses and can carry 40 jets and helicopters at a time. It will have a permanent crew of almost 1,600 when it enters service in 2020. Mr Booth described it as a \"floating military city that can deploy aircraft, that can act as a disaster relief centre\". Analysis: Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political correspondent It so happens that the Royal Navy has chosen to name and float its new aircraft carrier on American Independence Day. Yet this ceremony signals the UK's intention to continue to independently project military power in the world for decades to come. Albeit that the largest warship ever built in Britain will carry fighter jets made largely in the US. But one question that arises is: in whose name will HMS Queen Elizabeth and its air crews operate when they come into service in 2020? Will it be the flagship of the UK as it currently exists or only for England, Wales and Northern Ireland if Scotland chooses its own independence in September's referendum? The UK government argues that the union offers Scotland greater security as well as greater job prospects for thousands of Scottish defence workers. The Scottish government believes NATO would guarantee an independent Scotland's defence and that shipyards such as Rosyth and Govan would continue to prosper by winning orders from both the UK and Scottish defence ministries. The huge choice that Scotland faces looms large at the naming of a very big ship. Major construction: The carrier has still to be fitted out and floated, to make way for the assembly of its sister ship HMS Prince of Wales. Assembly of HMS Prince of Wales is set to begin at Rosyth later this year. The naming of the first of the two ships comes five years after the first metal was cut on the vessel and 33 months after the first section entered the dry dock at Rosyth for assembly. Firefighters had to be called to a fire on board HMS Elizabeth last month. A small fire had started in one of the vessel's hull compartments but fire crews only reported minor damage. The US last month grounded all of its F-35 Lightning II fighters, the type of aircraft due to fly operationally from HMS Queen Elizabeth, after one caught fire on a runway. The US Department of Defence (DoD) said all 97 stealth fighters would face additional engine inspections following the incident at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on 23 June.

The Type 997 Artisan 3D (Advanced Radar Target Indication Situational Awareness and Navigation) is a medium range air and surface surveillance 3D radar developed and built by BAE Systems. The new system is currently installed on HMS Ocean and is being fitted to the Type 23 frigates. It will also equip the under construction and in future the Type 26 Frigates. The Type 997 has a range of 200 km and is reportedly capable of tracking more than 800 or 900 targets at once. BAE Systems state that Artisan is capable of tracking targets the size of small birds or tennis balls travelling at Mach 3 with \"unrivalled detection performance and world beating electronic protection measures against even the most complex jammers\". The Queen Elizabeth class vessels will feature two ship's radars, the BAE Systems S1850M, the same as fitted to the Type 45 destroyers for long range wide area search and Artisan 3D. The S1850M is a long range passive electronically scanned array radar. The system is advertised as being capable of fully automatic detection, track initiation and tracking of up to 1,000 targets at a range of 400 kilometres. It is also claimed to be highly capable of detecting stealth targets and able to detect and track outer atmosphere objects at short range, making it capable of forming part of a Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence system.

Tiny launch HMS Gleaner - previously used to scan the wreck of the Mary Rose in the Solent - has spent weeks surveying every inch of the Forth estuary to ensure carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth leaves Rosyth dockyard without a hitch next spring. Nineteen times longer, 15 times wider and a staggering 3,000 times heavier, the new carrier dwarfed the small survey craft as she scanned the huge inner basin at Rosyth, where Queen Elizabeth is in the final stages of completion. The future flagship - the largest vessel ever to fly the White Ensign - is due to begin trials in the North Sea next spring ahead of her debut in her home base of Portsmouth. But with data on the Forth estuary 60 years old, Plymouth-based Gleaner and a specialist team of military surveyors were dispatched to Scotland to gather information on the tides, river bed and the three crossings - one rail, two road - to ensure the carrier's first departure runs smoothly. HMS Queen Elizabeth has already been fitted with a special main mast which can be lowered to allow the ship to safely pass beneath the bridges. But taking nothing to chance, Army surveyors from 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) from RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire used the latest theodolites to measure the bridge heights, while Gleaner's crew did the same using a new laser scanner.

Darkness made getting the \"money shot\" of the ship going under the bridges technically difficult. Her planned return to Rosyth, at some point halfway through her trials period, may provide a better photo opportunity. At sea: Overall media coverage of QE going to sea was pretty muted. Her arrival in Portsmouth sometime in September or October will make a more compelling story as the ship comes into her home port where thousands are expected to be watching. Despite the great photos, it should be remembered that in some ways QE is akin to a newborn. Apart from light machine guns she is unarmed, is still owned by the builders and will not be an operational warship until 2020. Just one week into her trials programme she has not ventured far into the North Sea and returned to anchor at times. She has conducted short passages and racetrack courses testing ship handling and gradually building up to higher speeds, reportedly going above 26 knots. Urban myths abound: The empty flight deck of QE on trials has inspired the further repetition of the urban myth that she is \"an aircraft carrier with no aircraft\". This is not the case and F-35s will fly from her next year. Although the F-35 programme is delivering more slowly than everyone would like, the UK will own around 20 of the aircraft by the time HMS Queen Elizabeth achieves initial operating capability in 2020. Even if there were squadrons of aircraft ready to go, the ship would not be embarking them on initial sea trials. The first aircraft to land on the ship was a Merlin helicopter on a simple sortie to deliver a few supplies and exchange personnel. Some in the media became overly-alarmed that Russian naval units and aircraft are likely to conduct surveillance on QE. Obtaining acoustic and electromagnetic signatures of naval vessels is a routine task conducted by most militaries on each other. From now, and for most of her sea-going life QE is likely to be escorted by RN units, possibly with an SSN nearby to ward off other submarines that may attempt to shadow her. So far QE has been operating in shallow and noisy coastal waters where submarines would struggle to glean anything very useful. Laughably the Mail on Sunday warned that, QE transmitting on AIS during her trials posed a security risk and would \"allow Putin to track her with a smartphone app\".

Obviously, it can be turned off when needing to be covert, but a ship conducting trials is not attempting to hide). Many media outlets continue to repeat the total falsehood that computers aboard QE use the insecure and outdated Operating System Windows XP, supposedly leaving her vulnerable to cyber attacks. Most of the RN surface fleet currently uses Windows for Warships, a much modified and more secure OS, based on Windows 2000 with little in common with Microsoft's consumer offerings. However, QE does not have any Microsoft software on board and uses a completely new system called Shared Infrastructure. UK Defence Journal has investigated this matter in detail. Friendly fire from an Army-centric press: Journalist Max Hastings, was the self-proclaimed \"first man into Port Stanley\" after the liberation of the Falklands, a victory only made possible by aircraft carriers. Frothing at the mouth in the Daily Mail, Hastings demanded the QE \"be scuttled\". Almost every line of his anti-carrier rhetoric is false or a distortion of the truth. The Times, which should know better, ran an editorial probably delivered straight from Marlborough Lines, rehearsing old complaints that aircraft carriers are too expensive and the Army's dire state is their fault. The Guardian was a slightly kinder in a rambling piece about past naval glories, trying to cast the carriers as an outdated throwback and concluding they are \"ugly\". It was, of course, the same media who were (rightly) castigating David Cameron back in 2011 that we had no aircraft carriers during the Libyan campaign. Back in 2014 we wrote an antidote to the all the partisan and ill-informed criticism we predicted the carrier project would receive as they progressed.

It fell to 26-year-old pilot Lieutenant Luke Wraith from Yorkshire to set the 14-tonne helicopter safely down on the aircraft carrier, just days after she left Rosyth to begin trials in the North Sea. He had a four-acre flight deck - almost the size of three football pitches - to aim for, where experienced aircraft handlers were waiting to guide him safely in and then lash the helicopter firmly down. \"I was pretty nervous - not about making a safe landing, but knowing that every other pilot in the Navy would watch the footage and critique it,\" said Lt Wraith, of 820 Naval Air Squadron. \"I'm actually quite surprised it ended up being me because I only got my flying wings 18 months ago - I was expecting it to be someone much more senior.\" Watching the historic landing from the ship's 'aircraft control tower' - called the Flyco - in the rear of HMS Queen Elizabeth's two islands was the man in charge of all her flying operations, Commander Mark Deller. His team trained around the world - on simulators, on US Navy carriers and on a mock-up flight deck at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall - to ensure they were ready for the first helicopter. \"I sense all my team are pleased to be off the wall and back at sea, doing what we do best, Cdr Deller said. \"There are smiles everywhere on deck and that's a good sign. Operating live helicopters adds another dimension to our understanding of how our flight deck behaves. \"We've proven our initial ability to operate aircraft safely. Now our focus is getting the ship and all her systems fully tested and set to work ready to commence full fixed wing flying trials next year.\" Also observing was Captain Jerry Kyd, Queen Elizabeth's first Commanding Officer. He said: \"It's an exciting and historic event which marks the beginning of the ship's life as the nation's flagship and the future of carrier-based aviation. \"It's been a demanding but proud and exciting week for us, the ship is bustling with activity and it's been fantastic to see this extend now to the flight deck just four days after sailing.\" The squadron will be assigned to HMS Queen Elizabeth throughout the carrier's 50-year lifespan, protecting the ship against any submarine threats, and flying personnel and equipment on and off. Normally based at Culdrose, the squadron is currently operating from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. It has been training for more than 18 months for its mission with the 65,000-tonne warship. For the historical record, there were five people in the first aircraft to land on the new carrier. Lt Wraith was joined in the cockpit by his squadron's senior pilot Lt Cdr Steve Moseley, observer Lt Chris Bugg and aircrewmen Petty Officers Nigel Stockdale and Jonathan Holding. \"To have a 'first' in your log book is very special, but to have the first landing on the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy is something very special indeed,\" said Lt Cdr Moseley, a graduate of the US Navy's Test Pilot School. \"We were the final link in the chain in a process that has involved thousands of people all working very hard towards this iconic occasion. \"The challenge for us was to be prepared for any eventuality, but also to have faith in the team whose job it has been to ensure that carrier aviation is as safe as possible.\" Stepping back and letting his team get on with the task in hand was 820's Commanding Officer Cdr Jon Holroyd. \"For me, it's a very humbling moment, filled with pride - pride leading a team of such capable individuals, from the maintenance team who ensure the aircraft are prepared and ready, the survival equipment team who ensure the aircrew are best supported and the logistical effort that makes the team work.\" ", "url": "https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/july/03/170703-young-pilot-makes-history-with-first-deck-landing-on-hms-queen-elizabeth"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth encounters propeller shaft debris issue on trials", "date": "2017-07-10", "content": "Aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts officials have confirmed, quashing earlier rumours of a major malfunction. The UK Defence Journal received information that the supercarrier had experienced issues relating to her propeller from a source at Invergordon, where the vessel is currently berthed and taking on fuel. \"Divers were down at the propellers yesterday\" said the source who then added that he believed it was something to do with one of the propeller shafts. The source also pointed out to us that it was a similar story from many of the crew he spoke to at Invergordon. We reached out to the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and a spokesperson confirmed that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is making progress through her sea trials programme, which is designed to test the full spectrum of her systems. The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts. This was subsequently cleared and an investigation has been undertaken. The ship is currently in Invergordon for one of her planned stops during the trials programme, to store and re-fuel the ship. As a precautionary measure, we will use this opportunity to complete further thorough checks and ensure sea trials continue safely.\" The sea trials will monitor speed, manoeuvrability, power and propulsion as well as undertaking weapons trials and additional tests on her levels of readiness. Following this initial period, HMS Queen Elizabeth will return to Rosyth for further testing and maintenance before heading back to sea for a second stage which aims to test her Mission Systems. She will transit to her home port of Portsmouth Naval Base to be handed over to the Royal Navy later this year. Admiral Sir Philip Jones First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff said: \"This is a hugely significant moment for the Royal Navy, for all our Armed Forces and for our island nation. Once in service HMS Queen Elizabeth will be the largest aircraft carrier in the world outside the United States, and the first designed from the outset to operate a fifth generation aircraft. Already this ship represents the best of the UK's industrial and engineering expertise, and once in service she will symbolise our military power and authority in the world for decades to come. There is still much work to do between now and then, but be in no doubt: a new era of British maritime power is about to begin.\" It should be noted that the point of sea trials is to find issues and rectify them. Things will go wrong as the vessel is essentially a giant prototype and while this isn't one of those 'things going wrong', we remain confident that she'll pass her trials with flying colours.", "url": "https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/hms-queen-elizabeth-encounters-propeller-shaft-debris-issue-trials/"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth undergoing rectification and repair work due to propeller issues", "date": "2017-07-19", "content": "It has been confirmed that HMS Queen Elizabeth is currently having rectification and repair work done after a propeller issue was identified in sea trials. Multiple sources, some on board the vessel, have told the UK Defence Journal that an issue has been identified with the prop shaft, specifically that the part of the frame/bracket holding the prop shaft in place is 12mm out of alignment, causing the prop to be slightly at an angle leading to 'cavitation, excess noise and drag'. It's possible that this may have been caused by debris as earlier in the month as HMS Queen Elizabeth picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance confirmed at the time that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts. This was subsequently cleared and an investigation has been undertaken.\" HMS Queen Elizabeth visited Invergordon for a planned stop to re-fuel and store the ship however she has been alongside longer than planned. We understand that the opportunity has been taken to undertake some engineering work, but sources close to the programme assure us that \"this is very much in hand and, whilst I'm aware of the speculation, we expect this to be routinely undertaken and for sea trials to continue successfully.\" Earlier in the week a crew member told us that \"On the 24th of this month we are going back to dry dock as on the props need to completely stripped apart\", he did add however that this was only a rumour and may not be the case. We reached out to the ACA for comment who responded by suggesting that this isn't out of the ordinary: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is making progress through the sea trials programme, designed to test the full spectrum of her vast and complex systems. We fully anticipate this will identify areas for improvement that will be addressed at sea, during routine port stops or as part of the planned engineering period.\" Sea trials monitor speed, manoeuvrability, power and propulsion as well as undertaking weapons trials and additional tests on her levels of readiness.

The 70,600 tonne vessel reached speeds of 27.1, 29 knots and 32 knots on separate occasions. The automatic identification system (AIS) is a tracking system used for collision avoidance on ships and by vessel traffic services. Information provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed, can be displayed on a screen or in a simpler format on many websites. Speaking to a naval architect involved in the programme, I was told: \"While the vessel will never routinely cruise at that speed, ships of this size including bigger American supercarriers never do, she will be capable of this speed even when loaded as verified by recent builders trials. 32 knots however is likely the maximum, she's not going to go any faster.\" Each ship features two power MT30 Gas turbines, that according to Rolls Royce are part of their efforts pioneering the use of aero-derivative gas turbines: \"Rolls-Royce pioneered the use of aero-derivative gas turbines in marine propulsion, primarily for naval vessels. The MT30 Gas turbines that power the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are the most powerful in-service gas turbines in the world. Designed for the 21st century navies, the MT30 integrates the very latest in gas turbine technology to give efficiency and reliability with a market leading power to weight ratio.

Produced in Bristol, the MT30 Gas turbine and alternator sets are each located under one of the ships islands.\" Navies rarely give accurate estimations of speed, preferring to keep potential opponents guessing, but HMS Queen Elizabeth has comfortably exceeded her original maximum and it was earlier estimated by some that the design is capable of 32 knots, that has now been verified.", "url": "https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/hms-queen-elizabeth-exceeds-stated-maximum-speed-trials/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth sets sail from Rosyth for sea trials", "date": "2017-06-26", "content": "The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier has left its home port for the first time. HMS Queen Elizabeth - one of two new carriers being built at Rosyth dockyard in Fife at a cost of more than \u00a36bn - is to begin sea trials. It is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy. The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches. The ship is now waiting for low tide to go under the Forth bridges. Once in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft. The 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Ark Royal was scrapped in 2010. Eleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth. It then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary. Once low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare. Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power. \"I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,\" he added. \"Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection.\" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time. \"This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come. She is built by the best, crewed by the best and will deliver for Britain. \"For the next 50 years she will deploy around the world, demonstrating British power and our commitment to confronting the emerging challenges from a dangerous world. The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. \" The start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortages could delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a \"critical phase\", with many risks to manage. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged \"challenges\" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026. 'Russian military interest': The technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule. The NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening. He said the Royal Navy expected Russia's military to take an interest while the warship was being tested in the North Sea.

To reach open sea, he will have to conduct two complicated manoeuvres, firstly to take it from the Rosyth dockyard basin where the carrier was built and then under the three Forth bridges. The calculations are fine but the prospect of miscalculation does not appear to scare him. As well as all the electronic devices available to him, he will make a gesture towards tradition, conducting a final check with an instrument used by mariners since at least the 18th century, a sextant, before heading under the bridges. The gap could be so small, even with the mast lowered, that he joked he might be able to run his fingers under the bridge. And what will he do if he gets the calculation wrong? \"Duck,\" he said. Work began in 2009 on the \u00a33.5bn carrier, which has been dogged by delays and overruns in cost and questions over whether there will be enough money to put a full complement of planes aboard. After about six weeks of sea trials in the North Sea, the plan is for the carrier to return to Rosyth for adjustments before sailing later this year to its home port, Portsmouth. The first of the planes is planned to arrive next year and the carrier is scheduled to be operational in 2020, bound for anywhere from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. HMS Queen Elizabeth and a second carrier, the Prince of Wales, also being built at Rosyth and still covered in scaffolding, will together cost more than \u00a36bn. The carriers, along with the Trident nuclear programme, account for a huge chunk of the defence budget. Critics within the military complain such high-profile projects have been at the expense of surface ships, soldiers and the air force. They also question whether aircraft carriers are anachronistic and vulnerable to attack from increasingly sophisticated missiles. Asked by the Guardian whether the carrier is a white elephant, Kyd unsurprisingly, disagreed. \"These assets give you a global presence, a serious punch, anywhere you want, at immediate notice,\" he said. \"I think it is a pretty good investment at \u00a36bn. In 50 years from now, we will look back and say that was extremely good value and they will be used a lot.\" Each carrier can hold 36 planes and four helicopters. The navy is hoping to have 24 F-35s by 2023 and a further 24 by 2025. In addition, the US marines will fly their own F-35s off the carriers, though the number is still under discussion. The carrier has a crew of about 700 which could theoretically double depending on the number of planes aboard. One of the biggest fears is from fire and, to counter that, it has 750 doors that can seal off compartments. About 15% of the 700 crew members are female, compared with a navy average of about 9%. Three of the crew are Muslim. One of them, Mohamed Khan, the head chef, would normally be off at present because of Ramadan but he did not want to miss out on the preparations for going to sea. \"Normally I take the whole month off, but this is the biggest ship ever and I wanted to be a part of that,\" said Khan, 42, who has been in the navy for 16 years.

He had a four-acre flight deck - almost the size of three football pitches - to aim for, where experienced aircraft handlers were waiting to guide him safely in and then lash the helicopter firmly down. \"I was pretty nervous - not about making a safe landing, but knowing that every other pilot in the Navy would watch the footage and critique it,\" said Lt Wraith, of 820 Naval Air Squadron. \"I'm actually quite surprised it ended up being me because I only got my flying wings 18 months ago - I was expecting it to be someone much more senior.\" Watching the historic landing from the ship's 'aircraft control tower' - called the Flyco - in the rear of HMS Queen Elizabeth's two islands was the man in charge of all her flying operations, Commander Mark Deller. His team trained around the world - on simulators, on US Navy carriers and on a mock-up flight deck at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall - to ensure they were ready for the first helicopter. \"I sense all my team are pleased to be off the wall and back at sea, doing what we do best, Cdr Deller said. \"There are smiles everywhere on deck and that's a good sign.

He said: \"It's an exciting and historic event which marks the beginning of the ship's life as the nation's flagship and the future of carrier-based aviation. \"It's been a demanding but proud and exciting week for us, the ship is bustling with activity and it's been fantastic to see this extend now to the flight deck just four days after sailing.\" The squadron will be assigned to HMS Queen Elizabeth throughout the carrier's 50-year lifespan, protecting the ship against any submarine threats, and flying personnel and equipment on and off. Normally based at Culdrose, the squadron is currently operating from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. It has been training for more than 18 months for its mission with the 65,000-tonne warship. For the historical record, there were five people in the first aircraft to land on the new carrier. Lt Wraith was joined in the cockpit by his squadron's senior pilot Lt Cdr Steve Moseley, observer Lt Chris Bugg and aircrewmen Petty Officers Nigel Stockdale and Jonathan Holding. \"To have a 'first' in your log book is very special, but to have the first landing on the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy is something very special indeed,\" said Lt Cdr Moseley, a graduate of the US Navy's Test Pilot School. \"We were the final link in the chain in a process that has involved thousands of people all working very hard towards this iconic occasion. \"The challenge for us was to be prepared for any eventuality, but also to have faith in the team whose job it has been to ensure that carrier aviation is as safe as possible.\" Stepping back and letting his team get on with the task in hand was 820's Commanding Officer Cdr Jon Holroyd. \"For me, it's a very humbling moment, filled with pride - pride leading a team of such capable individuals, from the maintenance team who ensure the aircraft are prepared and ready, the survival equipment team who ensure the aircrew are best supported and the logistical effort that makes the team work.\" ", "url": "https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/july/03/170703-young-pilot-makes-history-with-first-deck-landing-on-hms-queen-elizabeth"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth encounters propeller shaft debris issue on trials", "date": "2017-07-10", "content": "Aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts officials have confirmed, quashing earlier rumours of a major malfunction. The UK Defence Journal received information that the supercarrier had experienced issues relating to her propeller from a source at Invergordon, where the vessel is currently berthed and taking on fuel. \"Divers were down at the propellers yesterday\" said the source who then added that he believed it was something to do with one of the propeller shafts. The source also pointed out to us that it was a similar story from many of the crew he spoke to at Invergordon. We reached out to the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and a spokesperson confirmed that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is making progress through her sea trials programme, which is designed to test the full spectrum of her systems.

It's possible that this may have been caused by debris as earlier in the month as HMS Queen Elizabeth picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance confirmed at the time that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts.

The Nimitz-class US carrier has more than 60 Royal Navy sailors and Royal Marines on board, who have been working with their US counterparts to hone carrier strike skills ahead of HMS Queen Elizabeth's entry into service. The series of war games have seen the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, Commodore Andrew Betton, and his team direct jets, firepower and personnel across the task group for the last ten days to ensure readiness for the UK's own carrier strike capability. During a pause in the exercise's high tempo activities, there was a chance for HMS Queen Elizabeth to join the carrier strike group for a brief period as she continues her own contractor sea trials ahead of her much-anticipated first entry into her new home port in Portsmouth, expected to be in just under two weeks. Captain Jerry Kyd, HMS Queen Elizabeth's Commanding Officer, said: \"The USS George HW Bush battle group is an awesome embodiment of maritime power projection. \"And given that the United Kingdom's Carrier Strike Group Commander and his staff are embedded on board the US carrier for Saxon Warrior shows the closeness of our relationship with the US Navy and the importance that both nations place on the delivery of the UK's Carrier Strike programme. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is at the start of her journey to generate to full warfighting capability, but we are working hard to ready ourselves to take our place in operations and the line of battle alongside our closest allies.\" As well as the USS George HW Bush, the group includes two Portsmouth-based Type 23 frigates, HMS Westminster and HMS Iron Duke, destroyer USS Donald Cook, missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the Norwegian frigate HNoMS Helge Ingstad. Captain Ken Houlberg, Chief of Staff to the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, said: \"The US Navy, out of huge generosity, has given us the whole of their carrier strike group so that we can practise the command and control of a carrier doing these operations in British waters so that when HMS Queen Elizabeth comes into service later this year we will be well on the way to forming our own carrier strike capability.\" The exercise, which has been at play for nearly a week, has seen UK staff work with their American counterparts to fight off a series of simulated threats from enemy forces, using all the air, surface and sub-surface assets of the entire task group. There are 15 ships from across NATO taking part in the exercise, called Exercise Saxon Warrior, with more than 100 aircraft and nearly 10,000 people. Lieutenant Commander James Capps, a Royal Navy fixed wing pilot who is the Fixed Wing Operations Officer on the exercise, said: \"We are extremely fortunate.

HMS Queen Elizabeth - one of two new carriers being built at Rosyth dockyard in Fife at a cost of more than \u00a36bn - is to begin sea trials. It is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy. The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches. The ship is now waiting for low tide to go under the Forth bridges. Once in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft. The 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Ark Royal was scrapped in 2010. Eleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth. It then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary. Once low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare. Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power. \"I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,\" he added. \"Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection.\" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time. \"This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come.

The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. \" The start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortages could delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a \"critical phase\", with many risks to manage. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged \"challenges\" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026. 'Russian military interest': The technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule. The NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening. He said the Royal Navy expected Russia's military to take an interest while the warship was being tested in the North Sea.

To reach open sea, he will have to conduct two complicated manoeuvres, firstly to take it from the Rosyth dockyard basin where the carrier was built and then under the three Forth bridges. The calculations are fine but the prospect of miscalculation does not appear to scare him. As well as all the electronic devices available to him, he will make a gesture towards tradition, conducting a final check with an instrument used by mariners since at least the 18th century, a sextant, before heading under the bridges. The gap could be so small, even with the mast lowered, that he joked he might be able to run his fingers under the bridge. And what will he do if he gets the calculation wrong? \"Duck,\" he said. Work began in 2009 on the \u00a33.5bn carrier, which has been dogged by delays and overruns in cost and questions over whether there will be enough money to put a full complement of planes aboard. After about six weeks of sea trials in the North Sea, the plan is for the carrier to return to Rosyth for adjustments before sailing later this year to its home port, Portsmouth. The first of the planes is planned to arrive next year and the carrier is scheduled to be operational in 2020, bound for anywhere from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. HMS Queen Elizabeth and a second carrier, the Prince of Wales, also being built at Rosyth and still covered in scaffolding, will together cost more than \u00a36bn. The carriers, along with the Trident nuclear programme, account for a huge chunk of the defence budget. Critics within the military complain such high-profile projects have been at the expense of surface ships, soldiers and the air force. They also question whether aircraft carriers are anachronistic and vulnerable to attack from increasingly sophisticated missiles. Asked by the Guardian whether the carrier is a white elephant, Kyd unsurprisingly, disagreed. \"These assets give you a global presence, a serious punch, anywhere you want, at immediate notice,\" he said. \"I think it is a pretty good investment at \u00a36bn. In 50 years from now, we will look back and say that was extremely good value and they will be used a lot.\" Each carrier can hold 36 planes and four helicopters. The navy is hoping to have 24 F-35s by 2023 and a further 24 by 2025. In addition, the US marines will fly their own F-35s off the carriers, though the number is still under discussion. The carrier has a crew of about 700 which could theoretically double depending on the number of planes aboard. One of the biggest fears is from fire and, to counter that, it has 750 doors that can seal off compartments. About 15% of the 700 crew members are female, compared with a navy average of about 9%. Three of the crew are Muslim. One of them, Mohamed Khan, the head chef, would normally be off at present because of Ramadan but he did not want to miss out on the preparations for going to sea. \"Normally I take the whole month off, but this is the biggest ship ever and I wanted to be a part of that,\" said Khan, 42, who has been in the navy for 16 years. He added that, to compensate, under Islamic law he will have to fast for 30 days before the next Ramadan and make charitable payments. Among improvements for the crew are bigger bunks, three feet wide compared with two foot, three inches before. The captain too gets a bigger bunk but not a double bed, as do his American counterparts. The British navy is too puritanical for that, Kyd laughed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/26/hms-queen-elizabeth-aircraft-carrier-takes-to-the-seas"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth - her first week at sea", "date": "2017-07-03", "content": "On the afternoon of 26th June HMS Queen Elizabeth put sea for the first time. This was a significant milestone in modern Royal Navy history. She is the first British aircraft carrier completed since 1985 and the first true aircraft carrier in the world designed to operate 5th generation fixed wing aircraft. A good week for the RN: The RN still has many long-term problems and challenges but can look back on the past week with great satisfaction. Besides the successful departure of HMS Queen Elizabeth, The RN now has 3 ships assigned to NATO duties. HMS Sutherland will join the latter part of NATO anti-submarine exercise Dynamic Mongoose off Iceland, HMS Duncan is about to assume leadership of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 which will enter the Black Sea. HMS Enterprise will deploy to the Mediterranean as the flagship of Standing NATO Mine Counter Measures Group 2. A Wildcat helicopter from HMS Monmouth working with RFA Cardigan Bay, operating in the Indian Ocean saved the life of a sailor from a sinking oil tanker. The second MARS tanker, RFA Tiderace was accepted off-contract from the builders in South Korea while the first ship RFA Tidespring has left dry dock in Falmouth as she progresses towards becoming operational next year. Finally, the order for the first three Type 26 Frigates was officially announced on 2nd July and steel will be cut in August. The story of QE's first week at sea is best told using the stunning official video and images of this mighty ship, in her natural element at last. Leaving the basin: Monday 26th. 16.00 A fine demonstration of seamanship and teamwork. Eleven tugs took this ship out of the basin and through a very narrow lock with inches to spare. Not even a scratch on the paintwork. Under the bridges: Monday 26th 23.40. Low tide at midnight meant the ship had to pass under the Forth bridges in the dark. As had been carefully calculated, she cleared the bridges with just a couple of meters of headroom. From a media perspective, the timing made a live broadcast of the spectacle a non-starter. Darkness made getting the \"money shot\" of the ship going under the bridges technically difficult. Her planned return to Rosyth, at some point halfway through her trials period, may provide a better photo opportunity. At sea: Overall media coverage of QE going to sea was pretty muted. Her arrival in Portsmouth sometime in September or October will make a more compelling story as the ship comes into her home port where thousands are expected to be watching. Despite the great photos, it should be remembered that in some ways QE is akin to a newborn. Apart from light machine guns she is unarmed, is still owned by the builders and will not be an operational warship until 2020. Just one week into her trials programme she has not ventured far into the North Sea and returned to anchor at times. She has conducted short passages and racetrack courses testing ship handling and gradually building up to higher speeds, reportedly going above 26 knots. Urban myths abound: The empty flight deck of QE on trials has inspired the further repetition of the urban myth that she is \"an aircraft carrier with no aircraft\". This is not the case and F-35s will fly from her next year. Although the F-35 programme is delivering more slowly than everyone would like, the UK will own around 20 of the aircraft by the time HMS Queen Elizabeth achieves initial operating capability in 2020. Even if there were squadrons of aircraft ready to go, the ship would not be embarking them on initial sea trials. The first aircraft to land on the ship was a Merlin helicopter on a simple sortie to deliver a few supplies and exchange personnel. Some in the media became overly-alarmed that Russian naval units and aircraft are likely to conduct surveillance on QE. Obtaining acoustic and electromagnetic signatures of naval vessels is a routine task conducted by most militaries on each other. From now, and for most of her sea-going life QE is likely to be escorted by RN units, possibly with an SSN nearby to ward off other submarines that may attempt to shadow her. So far QE has been operating in shallow and noisy coastal waters where submarines would struggle to glean anything very useful. Laughably the Mail on Sunday warned that, QE transmitting on AIS during her trials posed a security risk and would \"allow Putin to track her with a smartphone app\". (AIS is a statutory navigational safety requirement, even for warships in coastal waters for reasons of safety and common sense. Obviously, it can be turned off when needing to be covert, but a ship conducting trials is not attempting to hide). Many media outlets continue to repeat the total falsehood that computers aboard QE use the insecure and outdated Operating System Windows XP, supposedly leaving her vulnerable to cyber attacks. Most of the RN surface fleet currently uses Windows for Warships, a much modified and more secure OS, based on Windows 2000 with little in common with Microsoft's consumer offerings. However, QE does not have any Microsoft software on board and uses a completely new system called Shared Infrastructure. UK Defence Journal has investigated this matter in detail. Friendly fire from an Army-centric press: Journalist Max Hastings, was the self-proclaimed \"first man into Port Stanley\" after the liberation of the Falklands, a victory only made possible by aircraft carriers. Frothing at the mouth in the Daily Mail, Hastings demanded the QE \"be scuttled\". Almost every line of his anti-carrier rhetoric is false or a distortion of the truth. The Times, which should know better, ran an editorial probably delivered straight from Marlborough Lines, rehearsing old complaints that aircraft carriers are too expensive and the Army's dire state is their fault. The Guardian was a slightly kinder in a rambling piece about past naval glories, trying to cast the carriers as an outdated throwback and concluding they are \"ugly\". It was, of course, the same media who were (rightly) castigating David Cameron back in 2011 that we had no aircraft carriers during the Libyan campaign. Back in 2014 we wrote an antidote to the all the partisan and ill-informed criticism we predicted the carrier project would receive as they progressed. Mine's better than yours: The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon rather unwisely taunted the Russians by saying \"you saw that old, dilapidated Kuznetsov sailing through the Channel, a few months ago, I think the Russians will look at this ship [QE] with a little bit of envy\". Although it is true that QE will eventually be far in advance of the ancient Kuznetsov, it should be pointed out that she will be unable to properly conduct combat operations before 2021. The Kuznetsov's air group is unimpressive but she carries a battery of potent anti-ship missiles while, in part thanks to Fallon, the RN will have no heavyweight anti-ship missiles at all by next year. The Russian surface fleet is mostly old and they have not managed to build a new major surface combatant since the Soviet era. However, the Russian Navy is still very much more powerful than the hollowed-out Royal Navy by any measure. Their surface fleet may be semi-obsolete but it is their submarines that are the real cause for concern.", "url": "https://www.navylookout.com/hms-queen-elizabeth-her-first-week-at-sea/"}, {"title": "Young pilot makes history with first deck landing on HMS Queen Elizabeth", "date": "2017-07-03", "content": "A Merlin helicopter has landed on HMS Queen Elizabeth's enormous flight deck - the first aircraft to ever touch down on Britain's biggest warship.

Lt Wraith was joined in the cockpit by his squadron's senior pilot Lt Cdr Steve Moseley, observer Lt Chris Bugg and aircrewmen Petty Officers Nigel Stockdale and Jonathan Holding. \"To have a 'first' in your log book is very special, but to have the first landing on the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy is something very special indeed,\" said Lt Cdr Moseley, a graduate of the US Navy's Test Pilot School. \"We were the final link in the chain in a process that has involved thousands of people all working very hard towards this iconic occasion. \"The challenge for us was to be prepared for any eventuality, but also to have faith in the team whose job it has been to ensure that carrier aviation is as safe as possible.\" Stepping back and letting his team get on with the task in hand was 820's Commanding Officer Cdr Jon Holroyd. \"For me, it's a very humbling moment, filled with pride - pride leading a team of such capable individuals, from the maintenance team who ensure the aircraft are prepared and ready, the survival equipment team who ensure the aircrew are best supported and the logistical effort that makes the team work.\" ", "url": "https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/july/03/170703-young-pilot-makes-history-with-first-deck-landing-on-hms-queen-elizabeth"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth encounters propeller shaft debris issue on trials", "date": "2017-07-10", "content": "Aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts officials have confirmed, quashing earlier rumours of a major malfunction.

The source also pointed out to us that it was a similar story from many of the crew he spoke to at Invergordon. We reached out to the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and a spokesperson confirmed that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is making progress through her sea trials programme, which is designed to test the full spectrum of her systems. The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts. This was subsequently cleared and an investigation has been undertaken. The ship is currently in Invergordon for one of her planned stops during the trials programme, to store and re-fuel the ship. As a precautionary measure, we will use this opportunity to complete further thorough checks and ensure sea trials continue safely.\" The sea trials will monitor speed, manoeuvrability, power and propulsion as well as undertaking weapons trials and additional tests on her levels of readiness. Following this initial period, HMS Queen Elizabeth will return to Rosyth for further testing and maintenance before heading back to sea for a second stage which aims to test her Mission Systems.

Admiral Sir Philip Jones First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff said: \"This is a hugely significant moment for the Royal Navy, for all our Armed Forces and for our island nation. Once in service HMS Queen Elizabeth will be the largest aircraft carrier in the world outside the United States, and the first designed from the outset to operate a fifth generation aircraft. Already this ship represents the best of the UK's industrial and engineering expertise, and once in service she will symbolise our military power and authority in the world for decades to come. There is still much work to do between now and then, but be in no doubt: a new era of British maritime power is about to begin.\" It should be noted that the point of sea trials is to find issues and rectify them.

It's possible that this may have been caused by debris as earlier in the month as HMS Queen Elizabeth picked up an item of debris around one of her propeller shafts. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance confirmed at the time that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts.

The Nimitz-class US carrier has more than 60 Royal Navy sailors and Royal Marines on board, who have been working with their US counterparts to hone carrier strike skills ahead of HMS Queen Elizabeth's entry into service. The series of war games have seen the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, Commodore Andrew Betton, and his team direct jets, firepower and personnel across the task group for the last ten days to ensure readiness for the UK's own carrier strike capability. During a pause in the exercise's high tempo activities, there was a chance for HMS Queen Elizabeth to join the carrier strike group for a brief period as she continues her own contractor sea trials ahead of her much-anticipated first entry into her new home port in Portsmouth, expected to be in just under two weeks. Captain Jerry Kyd, HMS Queen Elizabeth's Commanding Officer, said: \"The USS George HW Bush battle group is an awesome embodiment of maritime power projection. \"And given that the United Kingdom's Carrier Strike Group Commander and his staff are embedded on board the US carrier for Saxon Warrior shows the closeness of our relationship with the US Navy and the importance that both nations place on the delivery of the UK's Carrier Strike programme. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is at the start of her journey to generate to full warfighting capability, but we are working hard to ready ourselves to take our place in operations and the line of battle alongside our closest allies.\" As well as the USS George HW Bush, the group includes two Portsmouth-based Type 23 frigates, HMS Westminster and HMS Iron Duke, destroyer USS Donald Cook, missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the Norwegian frigate HNoMS Helge Ingstad. Captain Ken Houlberg, Chief of Staff to the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, said: \"The US Navy, out of huge generosity, has given us the whole of their carrier strike group so that we can practise the command and control of a carrier doing these operations in British waters so that when HMS Queen Elizabeth comes into service later this year we will be well on the way to forming our own carrier strike capability.\" The exercise, which has been at play for nearly a week, has seen UK staff work with their American counterparts to fight off a series of simulated threats from enemy forces, using all the air, surface and sub-surface assets of the entire task group. There are 15 ships from across NATO taking part in the exercise, called Exercise Saxon Warrior, with more than 100 aircraft and nearly 10,000 people. Lieutenant Commander James Capps, a Royal Navy fixed wing pilot who is the Fixed Wing Operations Officer on the exercise, said: \"We are extremely fortunate.

The engineering period marked a midpoint in her sea trials programme, which was designed in two main phases, the first period at sea having tested the power and propulsion systems and putting the 65,000 tonne vessel through her paces. The successful first phase of sea trials demonstrated the platform stability and manoeuvrability. Captain Jerry Kyd, in this role as Admiralty Trials Master for the ACA, said \"She was stable and strong, which is important for aviation operations from an aircraft carrier flight deck. Very quickly we were able to run her at full power and she performed extremely well.\" Following her triumphant arrival in Portsmouth, we've spent almost eleven weeks reviewing the first period of time at sea and preparing the ship's systems for her Mission Systems trials. This period of time has also seen engineering work mature in readiness for her handover to the Royal Navy later this year. The next phase of trials will primarily test the ship's sensors, which include the radar and communications systems; the essential technologies which ultimately transform a ship into a complex warship. During this period, we'll also undertake further propulsion trials and conduct air flow pattern tests, which demonstrate how air across the flight deck will affect aircraft taking off and landing. The ship will again be operated by a combined team of Royal Navy and industry colleagues, working together under the Alliance banner.

HMS Queen Elizabeth - one of two new carriers being built at Rosyth dockyard in Fife at a cost of more than \u00a36bn - is to begin sea trials. It is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy. The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches. The ship is now waiting for low tide to go under the Forth bridges. Once in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft. The 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Ark Royal was scrapped in 2010. Eleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth. It then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary. Once low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare. Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power. \"I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,\" he added. \"Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection.\" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time. \"This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come.

The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. \" The start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortages could delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a \"critical phase\", with many risks to manage. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged \"challenges\" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026. 'Russian military interest': The technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule. The NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening.

To reach open sea, he will have to conduct two complicated manoeuvres, firstly to take it from the Rosyth dockyard basin where the carrier was built and then under the three Forth bridges. The calculations are fine but the prospect of miscalculation does not appear to scare him. As well as all the electronic devices available to him, he will make a gesture towards tradition, conducting a final check with an instrument used by mariners since at least the 18th century, a sextant, before heading under the bridges. The gap could be so small, even with the mast lowered, that he joked he might be able to run his fingers under the bridge. And what will he do if he gets the calculation wrong? \"Duck,\" he said. Work began in 2009 on the \u00a33.5bn carrier, which has been dogged by delays and overruns in cost and questions over whether there will be enough money to put a full complement of planes aboard. After about six weeks of sea trials in the North Sea, the plan is for the carrier to return to Rosyth for adjustments before sailing later this year to its home port, Portsmouth. The first of the planes is planned to arrive next year and the carrier is scheduled to be operational in 2020, bound for anywhere from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. HMS Queen Elizabeth and a second carrier, the Prince of Wales, also being built at Rosyth and still covered in scaffolding, will together cost more than \u00a36bn. The carriers, along with the Trident nuclear programme, account for a huge chunk of the defence budget. Critics within the military complain such high-profile projects have been at the expense of surface ships, soldiers and the air force. They also question whether aircraft carriers are anachronistic and vulnerable to attack from increasingly sophisticated missiles. Asked by the Guardian whether the carrier is a white elephant, Kyd unsurprisingly, disagreed. \"These assets give you a global presence, a serious punch, anywhere you want, at immediate notice,\" he said. \"I think it is a pretty good investment at \u00a36bn. In 50 years from now, we will look back and say that was extremely good value and they will be used a lot.\" Each carrier can hold 36 planes and four helicopters. The navy is hoping to have 24 F-35s by 2023 and a further 24 by 2025. In addition, the US marines will fly their own F-35s off the carriers, though the number is still under discussion. The carrier has a crew of about 700 which could theoretically double depending on the number of planes aboard. One of the biggest fears is from fire and, to counter that, it has 750 doors that can seal off compartments. About 15% of the 700 crew members are female, compared with a navy average of about 9%. Three of the crew are Muslim. One of them, Mohamed Khan, the head chef, would normally be off at present because of Ramadan but he did not want to miss out on the preparations for going to sea. \"Normally I take the whole month off, but this is the biggest ship ever and I wanted to be a part of that,\" said Khan, 42, who has been in the navy for 16 years. He added that, to compensate, under Islamic law he will have to fast for 30 days before the next Ramadan and make charitable payments. Among improvements for the crew are bigger bunks, three feet wide compared with two foot, three inches before. The captain too gets a bigger bunk but not a double bed, as do his American counterparts. The British navy is too puritanical for that, Kyd laughed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/26/hms-queen-elizabeth-aircraft-carrier-takes-to-the-seas"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth - her first week at sea", "date": "2017-07-03", "content": "On the afternoon of 26th June HMS Queen Elizabeth put sea for the first time. This was a significant milestone in modern Royal Navy history. She is the first British aircraft carrier completed since 1985 and the first true aircraft carrier in the world designed to operate 5th generation fixed wing aircraft. A good week for the RN: The RN still has many long-term problems and challenges but can look back on the past week with great satisfaction. Besides the successful departure of HMS Queen Elizabeth, The RN now has 3 ships assigned to NATO duties. HMS Sutherland will join the latter part of NATO anti-submarine exercise Dynamic Mongoose off Iceland, HMS Duncan is about to assume leadership of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 which will enter the Black Sea. HMS Enterprise will deploy to the Mediterranean as the flagship of Standing NATO Mine Counter Measures Group 2. A Wildcat helicopter from HMS Monmouth working with RFA Cardigan Bay, operating in the Indian Ocean saved the life of a sailor from a sinking oil tanker. The second MARS tanker, RFA Tiderace was accepted off-contract from the builders in South Korea while the first ship RFA Tidespring has left dry dock in Falmouth as she progresses towards becoming operational next year. Finally, the order for the first three Type 26 Frigates was officially announced on 2nd July and steel will be cut in August. The story of QE's first week at sea is best told using the stunning official video and images of this mighty ship, in her natural element at last. Leaving the basin: Monday 26th. 16.00 A fine demonstration of seamanship and teamwork. Eleven tugs took this ship out of the basin and through a very narrow lock with inches to spare. Not even a scratch on the paintwork. Under the bridges: Monday 26th 23.40. Low tide at midnight meant the ship had to pass under the Forth bridges in the dark. As had been carefully calculated, she cleared the bridges with just a couple of meters of headroom. From a media perspective, the timing made a live broadcast of the spectacle a non-starter. Darkness made getting the \"money shot\" of the ship going under the bridges technically difficult. Her planned return to Rosyth, at some point halfway through her trials period, may provide a better photo opportunity. At sea: Overall media coverage of QE going to sea was pretty muted. Her arrival in Portsmouth sometime in September or October will make a more compelling story as the ship comes into her home port where thousands are expected to be watching. Despite the great photos, it should be remembered that in some ways QE is akin to a newborn. Apart from light machine guns she is unarmed, is still owned by the builders and will not be an operational warship until 2020. Just one week into her trials programme she has not ventured far into the North Sea and returned to anchor at times. She has conducted short passages and racetrack courses testing ship handling and gradually building up to higher speeds, reportedly going above 26 knots. Urban myths abound: The empty flight deck of QE on trials has inspired the further repetition of the urban myth that she is \"an aircraft carrier with no aircraft\". This is not the case and F-35s will fly from her next year. Although the F-35 programme is delivering more slowly than everyone would like, the UK will own around 20 of the aircraft by the time HMS Queen Elizabeth achieves initial operating capability in 2020. Even if there were squadrons of aircraft ready to go, the ship would not be embarking them on initial sea trials. The first aircraft to land on the ship was a Merlin helicopter on a simple sortie to deliver a few supplies and exchange personnel. Some in the media became overly-alarmed that Russian naval units and aircraft are likely to conduct surveillance on QE. Obtaining acoustic and electromagnetic signatures of naval vessels is a routine task conducted by most militaries on each other. From now, and for most of her sea-going life QE is likely to be escorted by RN units, possibly with an SSN nearby to ward off other submarines that may attempt to shadow her. So far QE has been operating in shallow and noisy coastal waters where submarines would struggle to glean anything very useful. Laughably the Mail on Sunday warned that, QE transmitting on AIS during her trials posed a security risk and would \"allow Putin to track her with a smartphone app\". (AIS is a statutory navigational safety requirement, even for warships in coastal waters for reasons of safety and common sense. Obviously, it can be turned off when needing to be covert, but a ship conducting trials is not attempting to hide). Many media outlets continue to repeat the total falsehood that computers aboard QE use the insecure and outdated Operating System Windows XP, supposedly leaving her vulnerable to cyber attacks. Most of the RN surface fleet currently uses Windows for Warships, a much modified and more secure OS, based on Windows 2000 with little in common with Microsoft's consumer offerings. However, QE does not have any Microsoft software on board and uses a completely new system called Shared Infrastructure. UK Defence Journal has investigated this matter in detail. Friendly fire from an Army-centric press: Journalist Max Hastings, was the self-proclaimed \"first man into Port Stanley\" after the liberation of the Falklands, a victory only made possible by aircraft carriers. Frothing at the mouth in the Daily Mail, Hastings demanded the QE \"be scuttled\". Almost every line of his anti-carrier rhetoric is false or a distortion of the truth. The Times, which should know better, ran an editorial probably delivered straight from Marlborough Lines, rehearsing old complaints that aircraft carriers are too expensive and the Army's dire state is their fault. The Guardian was a slightly kinder in a rambling piece about past naval glories, trying to cast the carriers as an outdated throwback and concluding they are \"ugly\". It was, of course, the same media who were (rightly) castigating David Cameron back in 2011 that we had no aircraft carriers during the Libyan campaign. Back in 2014 we wrote an antidote to the all the partisan and ill-informed criticism we predicted the carrier project would receive as they progressed. Mine's better than yours: The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon rather unwisely taunted the Russians by saying \"you saw that old, dilapidated Kuznetsov sailing through the Channel, a few months ago, I think the Russians will look at this ship [QE] with a little bit of envy\". Although it is true that QE will eventually be far in advance of the ancient Kuznetsov, it should be pointed out that she will be unable to properly conduct combat operations before 2021. The Kuznetsov's air group is unimpressive but she carries a battery of potent anti-ship missiles while, in part thanks to Fallon, the RN will have no heavyweight anti-ship missiles at all by next year. The Russian surface fleet is mostly old and they have not managed to build a new major surface combatant since the Soviet era. However, the Russian Navy is still very much more powerful than the hollowed-out Royal Navy by any measure. Their surface fleet may be semi-obsolete but it is their submarines that are the real cause for concern.", "url": "https://www.navylookout.com/hms-queen-elizabeth-her-first-week-at-sea/"}, {"title": "Young pilot makes history with first deck landing on HMS Queen Elizabeth", "date": "2017-07-03", "content": "A Merlin helicopter has landed on HMS Queen Elizabeth's enormous flight deck - the first aircraft to ever touch down on Britain's biggest warship. It fell to 26-year-old pilot Lieutenant Luke Wraith from Yorkshire to set the 14-tonne helicopter safely down on the aircraft carrier, just days after she left Rosyth to begin trials in the North Sea. He had a four-acre flight deck - almost the size of three football pitches - to aim for, where experienced aircraft handlers were waiting to guide him safely in and then lash the helicopter firmly down. \"I was pretty nervous - not about making a safe landing, but knowing that every other pilot in the Navy would watch the footage and critique it,\" said Lt Wraith, of 820 Naval Air Squadron. \"I'm actually quite surprised it ended up being me because I only got my flying wings 18 months ago - I was expecting it to be someone much more senior.\" Watching the historic landing from the ship's 'aircraft control tower' - called the Flyco - in the rear of HMS Queen Elizabeth's two islands was the man in charge of all her flying operations, Commander Mark Deller. His team trained around the world - on simulators, on US Navy carriers and on a mock-up flight deck at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall - to ensure they were ready for the first helicopter. \"I sense all my team are pleased to be off the wall and back at sea, doing what we do best, Cdr Deller said. \"There are smiles everywhere on deck and that's a good sign. Operating live helicopters adds another dimension to our understanding of how our flight deck behaves. \"We've proven our initial ability to operate aircraft safely. Now our focus is getting the ship and all her systems fully tested and set to work ready to commence full fixed wing flying trials next year.\" Also observing was Captain Jerry Kyd, Queen Elizabeth's first Commanding Officer. He said: \"It's an exciting and historic event which marks the beginning of the ship's life as the nation's flagship and the future of carrier-based aviation. \"It's been a demanding but proud and exciting week for us, the ship is bustling with activity and it's been fantastic to see this extend now to the flight deck just four days after sailing.\" The squadron will be assigned to HMS Queen Elizabeth throughout the carrier's 50-year lifespan, protecting the ship against any submarine threats, and flying personnel and equipment on and off.

The series of war games have seen the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, Commodore Andrew Betton, and his team direct jets, firepower and personnel across the task group for the last ten days to ensure readiness for the UK's own carrier strike capability. During a pause in the exercise's high tempo activities, there was a chance for HMS Queen Elizabeth to join the carrier strike group for a brief period as she continues her own contractor sea trials ahead of her much-anticipated first entry into her new home port in Portsmouth, expected to be in just under two weeks. Captain Jerry Kyd, HMS Queen Elizabeth's Commanding Officer, said: \"The USS George HW Bush battle group is an awesome embodiment of maritime power projection. \"And given that the United Kingdom's Carrier Strike Group Commander and his staff are embedded on board the US carrier for Saxon Warrior shows the closeness of our relationship with the US Navy and the importance that both nations place on the delivery of the UK's Carrier Strike programme. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is at the start of her journey to generate to full warfighting capability, but we are working hard to ready ourselves to take our place in operations and the line of battle alongside our closest allies.\" As well as the USS George HW Bush, the group includes two Portsmouth-based Type 23 frigates, HMS Westminster and HMS Iron Duke, destroyer USS Donald Cook, missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the Norwegian frigate HNoMS Helge Ingstad. Captain Ken Houlberg, Chief of Staff to the Commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, said: \"The US Navy, out of huge generosity, has given us the whole of their carrier strike group so that we can practise the command and control of a carrier doing these operations in British waters so that when HMS Queen Elizabeth comes into service later this year we will be well on the way to forming our own carrier strike capability.\" The exercise, which has been at play for nearly a week, has seen UK staff work with their American counterparts to fight off a series of simulated threats from enemy forces, using all the air, surface and sub-surface assets of the entire task group.

The successful first phase of sea trials demonstrated the platform stability and manoeuvrability. Captain Jerry Kyd, in this role as Admiralty Trials Master for the ACA, said \"She was stable and strong, which is important for aviation operations from an aircraft carrier flight deck. Very quickly we were able to run her at full power and she performed extremely well.\" Following her triumphant arrival in Portsmouth, we've spent almost eleven weeks reviewing the first period of time at sea and preparing the ship's systems for her Mission Systems trials. This period of time has also seen engineering work mature in readiness for her handover to the Royal Navy later this year. The next phase of trials will primarily test the ship's sensors, which include the radar and communications systems; the essential technologies which ultimately transform a ship into a complex warship. During this period, we'll also undertake further propulsion trials and conduct air flow pattern tests, which demonstrate how air across the flight deck will affect aircraft taking off and landing.

This was a significant milestone in modern Royal Navy history. She is the first British aircraft carrier completed since 1985 and the first true aircraft carrier in the world designed to operate 5th generation fixed wing aircraft. A good week for the RN: The RN still has many long-term problems and challenges but can look back on the past week with great satisfaction. Besides the successful departure of HMS Queen Elizabeth, The RN now has 3 ships assigned to NATO duties. HMS Sutherland will join the latter part of NATO anti-submarine exercise Dynamic Mongoose off Iceland, HMS Duncan is about to assume leadership of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 which will enter the Black Sea. HMS Enterprise will deploy to the Mediterranean as the flagship of Standing NATO Mine Counter Measures Group 2. A Wildcat helicopter from HMS Monmouth working with RFA Cardigan Bay, operating in the Indian Ocean saved the life of a sailor from a sinking oil tanker. The second MARS tanker, RFA Tiderace was accepted off-contract from the builders in South Korea while the first ship RFA Tidespring has left dry dock in Falmouth as she progresses towards becoming operational next year. Finally, the order for the first three Type 26 Frigates was officially announced on 2nd July and steel will be cut in August. The story of QE's first week at sea is best told using the stunning official video and images of this mighty ship, in her natural element at last. Leaving the basin: Monday 26th. 16.00 A fine demonstration of seamanship and teamwork. Eleven tugs took this ship out of the basin and through a very narrow lock with inches to spare. Not even a scratch on the paintwork. Under the bridges: Monday 26th 23.40. Low tide at midnight meant the ship had to pass under the Forth bridges in the dark. As had been carefully calculated, she cleared the bridges with just a couple of meters of headroom. From a media perspective, the timing made a live broadcast of the spectacle a non-starter. Darkness made getting the \"money shot\" of the ship going under the bridges technically difficult. Her planned return to Rosyth, at some point halfway through her trials period, may provide a better photo opportunity. At sea: Overall media coverage of QE going to sea was pretty muted. Her arrival in Portsmouth sometime in September or October will make a more compelling story as the ship comes into her home port where thousands are expected to be watching. Despite the great photos, it should be remembered that in some ways QE is akin to a newborn. Apart from light machine guns she is unarmed, is still owned by the builders and will not be an operational warship until 2020. Just one week into her trials programme she has not ventured far into the North Sea and returned to anchor at times. She has conducted short passages and racetrack courses testing ship handling and gradually building up to higher speeds, reportedly going above 26 knots. Urban myths abound: The empty flight deck of QE on trials has inspired the further repetition of the urban myth that she is \"an aircraft carrier with no aircraft\". This is not the case and F-35s will fly from her next year. Although the F-35 programme is delivering more slowly than everyone would like, the UK will own around 20 of the aircraft by the time HMS Queen Elizabeth achieves initial operating capability in 2020. Even if there were squadrons of aircraft ready to go, the ship would not be embarking them on initial sea trials. The first aircraft to land on the ship was a Merlin helicopter on a simple sortie to deliver a few supplies and exchange personnel. Some in the media became overly-alarmed that Russian naval units and aircraft are likely to conduct surveillance on QE. Obtaining acoustic and electromagnetic signatures of naval vessels is a routine task conducted by most militaries on each other. From now, and for most of her sea-going life QE is likely to be escorted by RN units, possibly with an SSN nearby to ward off other submarines that may attempt to shadow her. So far QE has been operating in shallow and noisy coastal waters where submarines would struggle to glean anything very useful. Laughably the Mail on Sunday warned that, QE transmitting on AIS during her trials posed a security risk and would \"allow Putin to track her with a smartphone app\". (AIS is a statutory navigational safety requirement, even for warships in coastal waters for reasons of safety and common sense. Obviously, it can be turned off when needing to be covert, but a ship conducting trials is not attempting to hide). Many media outlets continue to repeat the total falsehood that computers aboard QE use the insecure and outdated Operating System Windows XP, supposedly leaving her vulnerable to cyber attacks. Most of the RN surface fleet currently uses Windows for Warships, a much modified and more secure OS, based on Windows 2000 with little in common with Microsoft's consumer offerings. However, QE does not have any Microsoft software on board and uses a completely new system called Shared Infrastructure. UK Defence Journal has investigated this matter in detail. Friendly fire from an Army-centric press: Journalist Max Hastings, was the self-proclaimed \"first man into Port Stanley\" after the liberation of the Falklands, a victory only made possible by aircraft carriers. Frothing at the mouth in the Daily Mail, Hastings demanded the QE \"be scuttled\". Almost every line of his anti-carrier rhetoric is false or a distortion of the truth. The Times, which should know better, ran an editorial probably delivered straight from Marlborough Lines, rehearsing old complaints that aircraft carriers are too expensive and the Army's dire state is their fault. The Guardian was a slightly kinder in a rambling piece about past naval glories, trying to cast the carriers as an outdated throwback and concluding they are \"ugly\". It was, of course, the same media who were (rightly) castigating David Cameron back in 2011 that we had no aircraft carriers during the Libyan campaign. Back in 2014 we wrote an antidote to the all the partisan and ill-informed criticism we predicted the carrier project would receive as they progressed. Mine's better than yours: The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon rather unwisely taunted the Russians by saying \"you saw that old, dilapidated Kuznetsov sailing through the Channel, a few months ago, I think the Russians will look at this ship [QE] with a little bit of envy\". Although it is true that QE will eventually be far in advance of the ancient Kuznetsov, it should be pointed out that she will be unable to properly conduct combat operations before 2021. The Kuznetsov's air group is unimpressive but she carries a battery of potent anti-ship missiles while, in part thanks to Fallon, the RN will have no heavyweight anti-ship missiles at all by next year. The Russian surface fleet is mostly old and they have not managed to build a new major surface combatant since the Soviet era. However, the Russian Navy is still very much more powerful than the hollowed-out Royal Navy by any measure. Their surface fleet may be semi-obsolete but it is their submarines that are the real cause for concern.", "url": "https://www.navylookout.com/hms-queen-elizabeth-her-first-week-at-sea/"}, {"title": "Young pilot makes history with first deck landing on HMS Queen Elizabeth", "date": "2017-07-03", "content": "A Merlin helicopter has landed on HMS Queen Elizabeth's enormous flight deck - the first aircraft to ever touch down on Britain's biggest warship.

He had a four-acre flight deck - almost the size of three football pitches - to aim for, where experienced aircraft handlers were waiting to guide him safely in and then lash the helicopter firmly down. \"I was pretty nervous - not about making a safe landing, but knowing that every other pilot in the Navy would watch the footage and critique it,\" said Lt Wraith, of 820 Naval Air Squadron. \"I'm actually quite surprised it ended up being me because I only got my flying wings 18 months ago - I was expecting it to be someone much more senior.\" Watching the historic landing from the ship's 'aircraft control tower' - called the Flyco - in the rear of HMS Queen Elizabeth's two islands was the man in charge of all her flying operations, Commander Mark Deller.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance confirmed at the time that divers had been investigating the debris around one of the propeller shafts: \"The ship is performing well, however an item of debris was caught around one of the propeller shafts. This was subsequently cleared and an investigation has been undertaken.\" HMS Queen Elizabeth visited Invergordon for a planned stop to re-fuel and store the ship however she has been alongside longer than planned. We understand that the opportunity has been taken to undertake some engineering work, but sources close to the programme assure us that \"this is very much in hand and, whilst I'm aware of the speculation, we expect this to be routinely undertaken and for sea trials to continue successfully.\" Earlier in the week a crew member told us that \"On the 24th of this month we are going back to dry dock as on the props need to completely stripped apart\", he did add however that this was only a rumour and may not be the case. We reached out to the ACA for comment who responded by suggesting that this isn't out of the ordinary: \"HMS Queen Elizabeth is making progress through the sea trials programme, designed to test the full spectrum of her vast and complex systems. We fully anticipate this will identify areas for improvement that will be addressed at sea, during routine port stops or as part of the planned engineering period.\" Sea trials monitor speed, manoeuvrability, power and propulsion as well as undertaking weapons trials and additional tests on her levels of readiness. Following this initial period, HMS Queen Elizabeth will return to Rosyth for further testing and maintenance before heading back to sea for a second stage which aims to test her Mission Systems. She will transit to her home port of Portsmouth Naval Base to be handed over to the Royal Navy later this year. It remains to be seen what the true cause of this issue is, however, it doesn't appear to be a major issue.", "url": "https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/hms-queen-elizabeth-undergoing-rectification-work-due-propeller-issues/"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth exceeds stated maximum speed on trials", "date": "2017-07-24", "content": "According to BAE HMS Queen Elizabeth has a maximum speed of 25 knots but typically in projects like this, the maximums are understated.

The automatic identification system (AIS) is a tracking system used for collision avoidance on ships and by vessel traffic services. Information provided by AIS equipment, such as unique identification, position, course, and speed, can be displayed on a screen or in a simpler format on many websites. Speaking to a naval architect involved in the programme, I was told: \"While the vessel will never routinely cruise at that speed, ships of this size including bigger American supercarriers never do, she will be capable of this speed even when loaded as verified by recent builders trials. 32 knots however is likely the maximum, she's not going to go any faster.\" Each ship features two power MT30 Gas turbines, that according to Rolls Royce are part of their efforts pioneering the use of aero-derivative gas turbines: \"Rolls-Royce pioneered the use of aero-derivative gas turbines in marine propulsion, primarily for naval vessels. The MT30 Gas turbines that power the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are the most powerful in-service gas turbines in the world. Designed for the 21st century navies, the MT30 integrates the very latest in gas turbine technology to give efficiency and reliability with a market leading power to weight ratio. It has been designed to minimise maintenance costs and first entered service in 2008 powering the US Navy's first littoral combat ship - USS Freedom. Produced in Bristol, the MT30 Gas turbine and alternator sets are each located under one of the ships islands.\" Navies rarely give accurate estimations of speed, preferring to keep potential opponents guessing, but HMS Queen Elizabeth has comfortably exceeded her original maximum and it was earlier estimated by some that the design is capable of 32 knots, that has now been verified.", "url": "https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/hms-queen-elizabeth-exceeds-stated-maximum-speed-trials/"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth on track for first entry to Portsmouth", "date": "2017-08-07", "content": "Britain's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is set to enter her new home in Portsmouth in around two weeks.

Capability through collaboration: Close collaboration and a spirit of teamwork within the Aircraft Carrier Alliance created a solid foundation for equipping the new carriers with world-class capabilities. Thales and BAE Systems, for example, delivered the long-range S1850M radar, which can track up to 1,000 air targets simultaneously, at a range of around 400 kilometres. Another radar system, is capable of detecting objects as small as a tennis ball, travelling at three times the speed of sound more than 25 Km away.

During this voyage, she will conduct Operational Sea Training and head into the Eastern Atlantic to commence what will be the first of many flying trials, beginning with the Merlin helicopter. Since commissioning on 7th December, the ship has been alongside conducting further engineering work and the minor leak on the stern seal that was the cause of such media hysteria before Christmas has been remedied. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance and their contractors are expected to continue final snagging work on the ship for up to 6 months beyond the commissioning date. The ship had been scheduled to depart on the 30th January but sailing had to be delyed until today. Following a routine full electrical failure test, as a computer system came back online it activated the hangar sprinkler system and water pumps in the firemain system. No serious damage was done and the software fault was remedied. With a known defect in the firefighting system, Captain Kydd sensibly decided to postpone sailing. Unfortunately, a video of the sprinkler activation was passed to the media, who did not miss another opportunity to exaggerate further minor problems with QE. Defects like this are normal on complex warships the world over, but issues with this particular ship attract extraordinary attention. SAT (Air): While still in Portsmouth, a Merlin Mk2, 'Dolphin 14' from 820 Naval Air Squadron landed on board for two days in mid-January to conduct Sea Acceptance Trials (Air) which tested that the systems on the flight deck and in the hangar designed to support embarked were working correctly. The aircraft was connected to electrical supplies and the telebrief system which allows non-wireless communication with the ship before take off. Refuelling arrangements were also tested and firefighting and rescue crews took the opportunity to rehearse emergency drills, damage control and fuel spillage procedures with a real aircraft. Taken below the Merlin was lashed down in the mid-section of the hangar with the fire-curtains lowered. This completion of this short trial gives confidence that the ship is ready and safe to operate aircraft at sea. FOST: A specialist team from FOST (Flag Officer Sea Training) has been on board for some time starting to compile the unique Queen Elizabeth class training syllabus for a new class of ship that is very much larger than anything else there's been in the fleet for a long time. For the first 2 weeks, the ship is likely to operate in the Western Approaches as the FOST staff focus on ensuring the ship's company is fully competent in safety and survival procedures. Fire, flood, casualty and evacuation exercises are likely to be the main focus, the warfare elements that usually comprise a large part of a FOST period will be conducted at a later date. Further sea training periods are scheduled for next year and beyond as more aircraft are embarked and the ship becomes more 'warlike', before achieving initial operating capability in 2020. FOCRW: With sea training completed, the focus will be on conducting First of Class Rotary Wing (FOCRW) trials. The Air Test and Evaluation Collaboration (ATEC) is an MoD-QinetiQ partnership based at MoD Boscombe Down which will provide test pilots, two Chinooks and two Merlin Mk2s. The ship and the aircraft are fitted with sensors and instruments to determine the sea states, roll, pitch and wind limits within which it is safe to fy from the Queen Elizabeth class. Data from these repetitive trials will be used to compile the Ship Helicopter Operating Limitations (SHOL) clearances. Every aircraft type has to be tested and certified for each class of ship it may fly from, to ensure the limits of safe operation are understood. (First of class, RFA Tidespring recently conducted SHOL trials with a Merlin). In time, the QEC will be required to conduct trials with other types including Wildcat, Apache and the F-35B Lightning II (in late 2018). It should be assumed that such a stable ship with a huge flight deck will have higher tolerances for operating helicopters in more extreme conditions than the smaller frigates or auxiliaries. The twin-island design of the QEC is also intended to reduce air turbulence across the deck. The Eastern Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay should provide a variety of testing weather conditions for flying and test the ship in higher sea states than have been experienced so far. A full Merlin Squadron (820 NAS) will embark for the first time in mid-2018. CHF: While trials are being conducted with the Merlin MK2s, the ship will also be supported by Comando Helicopter Force Mk3s from 845 NAS. The aircraft will provide logistic support for QE, known as Maritime Intra Theatre Lift (MITL), the movement of passengers, mail and cargo between land and ships at sea. They will also provide safety back up for the trials aircraft and practice Deployed Search and Rescue (DSAR) operations. When eventually deployed operationally it is planned the QEC will have their own Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) capability. This will comprise a unit of Royal Marines delivered by the Mk3/4s to rescue pilots and sensitive equipment, should an aircraft go down and personnel be missing, detained or captured in hostile environments. This highly classified nature of the F-35 makes it especially important it does not fall into the wrong hands. One of the first newly upgraded Mk 4 aircraft to be delivered has already been trialled with door-mounted heavy machine guns for use in this role. The 845 NAS aircraft embarked on this trip are likely to conduct preparatory work for the JPR role. The long-term plan is that 845 NAS will embark 4 Merlin HC4 helicopters on the operational QEC carrier to support the Special Purpose Task Group (SPTG). This is a Royal Marine company of up to 200 men who will act as a high readiness, rapid reaction force that can be deployed from the carrier short notice. Gibraltar: HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to arrive Gibraltar on 9th February for a 3-day visit. The Rock is a vital staging point and logistical support hub with connections to the Royal Navy going back centuries. QE can expect a big welcome in Gibraltar and will provide an iconic photo opportunity. The visit will also be a helpful reminder to the Spanish they would do better to improve relations with post-Brexit Britain, instead of making repeated futile incursions into the waters of the territory. There are considerable numbers of junior sailors for whom QE is their first ship, and this will be their first overseas run-ashore.

The engineering period marked a midpoint in her sea trials programme, which was designed in two main phases, the first period at sea having tested the power and propulsion systems and putting the 65,000 tonne vessel through her paces. The successful first phase of sea trials demonstrated the platform stability and manoeuvrability. Captain Jerry Kyd, in this role as Admiralty Trials Master for the ACA, said \"She was stable and strong, which is important for aviation operations from an aircraft carrier flight deck. Very quickly we were able to run her at full power and she performed extremely well.\" Following her triumphant arrival in Portsmouth, we've spent almost eleven weeks reviewing the first period of time at sea and preparing the ship's systems for her Mission Systems trials. This period of time has also seen engineering work mature in readiness for her handover to the Royal Navy later this year. The next phase of trials will primarily test the ship's sensors, which include the radar and communications systems; the essential technologies which ultimately transform a ship into a complex warship. During this period, we'll also undertake further propulsion trials and conduct air flow pattern tests, which demonstrate how air across the flight deck will affect aircraft taking off and landing. The ship will again be operated by a combined team of Royal Navy and industry colleagues, working together under the Alliance banner. Captain Kyd said \"It's been a unique experience working so closely with a range of industrial partners.

We are now witnessing a landmark moment in the long history of the Royal Navy. At 280 metres long and with four-acre flight decks, the ships are not only the largest and most powerful warships in UK history but also rank amongst the world's most capable aircraft carriers. And they are going to be with us for the next 50 years. In a world of intensifying global threats, we will all rely on HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, to protect our national and international interests. But while we are all relying on the Royal Navy, the Royal Navy is relying on Thales. That's nothing new. Thales has been supporting the Royal Navy for 100 years. The ever-deepening relationship can be traced right the way back to 1917, when we began equipping the navy's submarines with periscopes. Today, almost every single submarine and surface ship in the fleet uses various combinations of our sonar, radar, communications, electro-optical systems and electronic warfare technology. What was truly revolutionary was the sheer scale of the project, delivered through a unique partnering relationship between Thales, BAE Systems, Babcock and the UK Ministry of Defence, in an enterprise known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.  All hands on deck: As a founding member of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Thales has been deeply involved in the provision of the radar, communications, power and propulsion systems right from the start. Competitive instincts were put aside and everyone worked in the best interests of the project; in the best interests of the Royal Navy and of the United Kingdom. At its peak, the programme directly employed 8,000 people across six sites and a further 3,000 across the supply chain. Working together, members of the Alliance embraced a collective culture of trust, collaboration, innovation and mutual support. Capability through collaboration: Close collaboration and a spirit of teamwork within the Aircraft Carrier Alliance created a solid foundation for equipping the new carriers with world-class capabilities. Thales and BAE Systems, for example, delivered the long-range S1850M radar, which can track up to 1,000 air targets simultaneously, at a range of around 400 kilometres. Another radar system, is capable of detecting objects as small as a tennis ball, travelling at three times the speed of sound more than 25 Km away. A fully integrated communications system provided by Thales is providing everything from on-board WiFi to satellite connectivity, as well as internal ship-wide communications, plus ship-to-ship, ship-to-air and ship-to-shore comms with complete security.", "url": "https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/united-kingdom/news/british-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-begins-50-years-service"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth: Royals to attend aircraft carrier ceremony", "date": "2017-12-07", "content": "The Queen will be guest of honour at the commissioning of the UK's new aircraft carrier - HMS Queen Elizabeth.

HMS Queen Elizabeth can embark up to 900, in addition to their ship's company, in support of their missions and tasks and a flexible mix of aircraft subject to the operational tasking. According to the Royal Navy, the troops were processed from their accommodation, through the ship, collecting kit, including weapons and ammunition in a carefully orchestrated process, in through the massive hangar and onto the flight deck to simulate being launched ashore by helicopter. \"The Royal Navy's amphibious assault capability has to now been provided by assault ships HMS Bulwark and Albion and the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), HMS Ocean. Whilst HMS Queen Elizabeth does not have the surface assault capability with landing craft of the specialist ships, her four-acre flight deck provides plenty of scope from which to project manpower and equipment ashore using the variety of helicopters she will be able to host.\" Having previously served on HMS Ark Royal, the Ship's Amphibious Operations Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Searight Royal Marines says the training today is as relevant as it ever was: \"We are mirroring exactly what we did in our previous carriers and HMS Ocean; our SOPs are almost identical. But there has been a degree of the Marines having to relearn some of the skills that we took for granted before our most recent land campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Marines are an adaptable force; that's our USP as the UK's amphibious forces. So to ask them to spend time at sea is not a surprise or a task too far for any of them. But we've taken some time away from conducting major sea campaigns so this sort of training is extremely valuable.\" In order for the ship to demonstrate an initial capability to operate in the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) role, it should be able to project Royal Marines and their equipment ashore by aviation, prove ship to shore communications, sustain the troops for the period they are ashore and recover them back to the ship on completion say the Royal Navy.", "url": "https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/42-commando-launch-assault-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth/"}, {"title": "Double first as HMS Queen Elizabeth and RFA Tidespring meet up at sea", "date": "2018-02-27", "content": "Aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and new supply ship RFA Tidespring have met up at sea for the first time, as they prepare to conduct a Replenishment at Sea (RAS), refuelling whilst underway at sea, in what will be a first for both. Weighing in at 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth was cautiously approached to her starboard side by her 37,000 tonne mobile fuelling station, in one of the most hazardous evolutions a warship can conduct in peacetime. A full First of Class replenishment was abandoned due to bad weather, but coming together, just metres apart, was an important moment for both ships, according to RFA Tidespring Navigating Officer, Second Officer Paul Stubley. He said: \"This has been a milestone evolution, coming alongside HMS Queen Elizabeth to attempt a first of class RAS trial. This will provide useful data needed for all the vessels in each class. A replenishment between two large vessels bring challenges, particularly with ship interaction and the precariousness of transferring fuel and stores whilst underway.\" The evolution involved a line being shot across to the tanker from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth with both hulls just metres apart. The next stage will be for a double probe to be attached, hauled back across to the carrier and connected for diesel to be pumped into her giant fuel tanks. The man in charge of safety for the evolution at the RAS point on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, Chief Petty Officer Jay Early, says the first successful RAS will be the culmination of years of planning and anticipation. He added: \"Meeting up with RFA Tidespring today is an exciting thing for us, we've been talking about it for a long time now. It's two new classes of ship, with another first for a British ship to have a double probe. It will be a real tick in the box for us to know we can achieve it\", he said. The double probe concept has been adopted from American carriers - it means twice the volume of fuel can be delivered within a shorter amount of time. It was a tense time on both decks as the lines were fired across. CPO Early says there was an air of excitement across the team: \"One of things I always say to our guys is, regardless of this being a trial, it's still real for us; there are lines under tension, the ship is moving, equipment is swinging around, the dangers are very real. A RAS for us is one of the most dangerous evolutions carried out at sea during peacetime. Safety is paramount at all times. 'Slow is pro' is one of my key sayings to make sure our people stay safe\". Chief Bosun's Mate, or 'Buffer', PO Scottie Campbell says a full RAS will be the highlight of his 23 year career. He commented: \"A RAS is what I have been looking forward to since I first joined the ship. The weather impact today was disappointing, but I'm very proud of what we've achieved. And I'm proud for the younger guys in my team, because this is their future. We are trialling new kit, on new ships, taking us into the 21st century. Being the first RAS team onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth really has been the highlight of my time in the Royal Navy\".

We are now witnessing a landmark moment in the long history of the Royal Navy. At 280 metres long and with four-acre flight decks, the ships are not only the largest and most powerful warships in UK history but also rank amongst the world's most capable aircraft carriers. And they are going to be with us for the next 50 years. In a world of intensifying global threats, we will all rely on HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, to protect our national and international interests. But while we are all relying on the Royal Navy, the Royal Navy is relying on Thales. That's nothing new. Thales has been supporting the Royal Navy for 100 years. The ever-deepening relationship can be traced right the way back to 1917, when we began equipping the navy's submarines with periscopes. Today, almost every single submarine and surface ship in the fleet uses various combinations of our sonar, radar, communications, electro-optical systems and electronic warfare technology. What was truly revolutionary was the sheer scale of the project, delivered through a unique partnering relationship between Thales, BAE Systems, Babcock and the UK Ministry of Defence, in an enterprise known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.  All hands on deck: As a founding member of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Thales has been deeply involved in the provision of the radar, communications, power and propulsion systems right from the start. Competitive instincts were put aside and everyone worked in the best interests of the project; in the best interests of the Royal Navy and of the United Kingdom. At its peak, the programme directly employed 8,000 people across six sites and a further 3,000 across the supply chain. Working together, members of the Alliance embraced a collective culture of trust, collaboration, innovation and mutual support. Capability through collaboration: Close collaboration and a spirit of teamwork within the Aircraft Carrier Alliance created a solid foundation for equipping the new carriers with world-class capabilities. Thales and BAE Systems, for example, delivered the long-range S1850M radar, which can track up to 1,000 air targets simultaneously, at a range of around 400 kilometres. Another radar system, is capable of detecting objects as small as a tennis ball, travelling at three times the speed of sound more than 25 Km away. A fully integrated communications system provided by Thales is providing everything from on-board WiFi to satellite connectivity, as well as internal ship-wide communications, plus ship-to-ship, ship-to-air and ship-to-shore comms with complete security.", "url": "https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/united-kingdom/news/british-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-begins-50-years-service"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth: Royals to attend aircraft carrier ceremony", "date": "2017-12-07", "content": "The Queen will be guest of honour at the commissioning of the UK's new aircraft carrier - HMS Queen Elizabeth.

During this voyage, she will conduct Operational Sea Training and head into the Eastern Atlantic to commence what will be the first of many flying trials, beginning with the Merlin helicopter. Since commissioning on 7th December, the ship has been alongside conducting further engineering work and the minor leak on the stern seal that was the cause of such media hysteria before Christmas has been remedied. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance and their contractors are expected to continue final snagging work on the ship for up to 6 months beyond the commissioning date. The ship had been scheduled to depart on the 30th January but sailing had to be delyed until today. Following a routine full electrical failure test, as a computer system came back online it activated the hangar sprinkler system and water pumps in the firemain system. No serious damage was done and the software fault was remedied. With a known defect in the firefighting system, Captain Kydd sensibly decided to postpone sailing. Unfortunately, a video of the sprinkler activation was passed to the media, who did not miss another opportunity to exaggerate further minor problems with QE. Defects like this are normal on complex warships the world over, but issues with this particular ship attract extraordinary attention. SAT (Air): While still in Portsmouth, a Merlin Mk2, 'Dolphin 14' from 820 Naval Air Squadron landed on board for two days in mid-January to conduct Sea Acceptance Trials (Air) which tested that the systems on the flight deck and in the hangar designed to support embarked were working correctly. The aircraft was connected to electrical supplies and the telebrief system which allows non-wireless communication with the ship before take off. Refuelling arrangements were also tested and firefighting and rescue crews took the opportunity to rehearse emergency drills, damage control and fuel spillage procedures with a real aircraft. Taken below the Merlin was lashed down in the mid-section of the hangar with the fire-curtains lowered. This completion of this short trial gives confidence that the ship is ready and safe to operate aircraft at sea. FOST: A specialist team from FOST (Flag Officer Sea Training) has been on board for some time starting to compile the unique Queen Elizabeth class training syllabus for a new class of ship that is very much larger than anything else there's been in the fleet for a long time. For the first 2 weeks, the ship is likely to operate in the Western Approaches as the FOST staff focus on ensuring the ship's company is fully competent in safety and survival procedures. Fire, flood, casualty and evacuation exercises are likely to be the main focus, the warfare elements that usually comprise a large part of a FOST period will be conducted at a later date. Further sea training periods are scheduled for next year and beyond as more aircraft are embarked and the ship becomes more 'warlike', before achieving initial operating capability in 2020. FOCRW: With sea training completed, the focus will be on conducting First of Class Rotary Wing (FOCRW) trials. The Air Test and Evaluation Collaboration (ATEC) is an MoD-QinetiQ partnership based at MoD Boscombe Down which will provide test pilots, two Chinooks and two Merlin Mk2s. The ship and the aircraft are fitted with sensors and instruments to determine the sea states, roll, pitch and wind limits within which it is safe to fy from the Queen Elizabeth class. Data from these repetitive trials will be used to compile the Ship Helicopter Operating Limitations (SHOL) clearances. Every aircraft type has to be tested and certified for each class of ship it may fly from, to ensure the limits of safe operation are understood. (First of class, RFA Tidespring recently conducted SHOL trials with a Merlin). In time, the QEC will be required to conduct trials with other types including Wildcat, Apache and the F-35B Lightning II (in late 2018). It should be assumed that such a stable ship with a huge flight deck will have higher tolerances for operating helicopters in more extreme conditions than the smaller frigates or auxiliaries. The twin-island design of the QEC is also intended to reduce air turbulence across the deck. The Eastern Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay should provide a variety of testing weather conditions for flying and test the ship in higher sea states than have been experienced so far. A full Merlin Squadron (820 NAS) will embark for the first time in mid-2018. CHF: While trials are being conducted with the Merlin MK2s, the ship will also be supported by Comando Helicopter Force Mk3s from 845 NAS. The aircraft will provide logistic support for QE, known as Maritime Intra Theatre Lift (MITL), the movement of passengers, mail and cargo between land and ships at sea. They will also provide safety back up for the trials aircraft and practice Deployed Search and Rescue (DSAR) operations. When eventually deployed operationally it is planned the QEC will have their own Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) capability. This will comprise a unit of Royal Marines delivered by the Mk3/4s to rescue pilots and sensitive equipment, should an aircraft go down and personnel be missing, detained or captured in hostile environments. This highly classified nature of the F-35 makes it especially important it does not fall into the wrong hands. One of the first newly upgraded Mk 4 aircraft to be delivered has already been trialled with door-mounted heavy machine guns for use in this role. The 845 NAS aircraft embarked on this trip are likely to conduct preparatory work for the JPR role. The long-term plan is that 845 NAS will embark 4 Merlin HC4 helicopters on the operational QEC carrier to support the Special Purpose Task Group (SPTG). This is a Royal Marine company of up to 200 men who will act as a high readiness, rapid reaction force that can be deployed from the carrier short notice. Gibraltar: HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to arrive Gibraltar on 9th February for a 3-day visit. The Rock is a vital staging point and logistical support hub with connections to the Royal Navy going back centuries. QE can expect a big welcome in Gibraltar and will provide an iconic photo opportunity.

A full First of Class replenishment was abandoned due to bad weather, but coming together, just metres apart, was an important moment for both ships, according to RFA Tidespring Navigating Officer, Second Officer Paul Stubley.

The man in charge of safety for the evolution at the RAS point on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, Chief Petty Officer Jay Early, says the first successful RAS will be the culmination of years of planning and anticipation. He added: \"Meeting up with RFA Tidespring today is an exciting thing for us, we've been talking about it for a long time now. It's two new classes of ship, with another first for a British ship to have a double probe. It will be a real tick in the box for us to know we can achieve it\", he said. The double probe concept has been adopted from American carriers - it means twice the volume of fuel can be delivered within a shorter amount of time. It was a tense time on both decks as the lines were fired across. CPO Early says there was an air of excitement across the team: \"One of things I always say to our guys is, regardless of this being a trial, it's still real for us; there are lines under tension, the ship is moving, equipment is swinging around, the dangers are very real. A RAS for us is one of the most dangerous evolutions carried out at sea during peacetime. Safety is paramount at all times. 'Slow is pro' is one of my key sayings to make sure our people stay safe\". Chief Bosun's Mate, or 'Buffer', PO Scottie Campbell says a full RAS will be the highlight of his 23 year career. He commented: \"A RAS is what I have been looking forward to since I first joined the ship. The weather impact today was disappointing, but I'm very proud of what we've achieved. And I'm proud for the younger guys in my team, because this is their future. We are trialling new kit, on new ships, taking us into the 21st century. Being the first RAS team onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth really has been the highlight of my time in the Royal Navy\".

The double probe concept has been adopted from American carriers - it means twice the volume of fuel can be delivered within a shorter amount of time. It was a tense time on both decks as the lines were fired across. CPO Early says there was an air of excitement across the team: \"One of things I always say to our guys is, regardless of this being a trial, it's still real for us; there are lines under tension, the ship is moving, equipment is swinging around, the dangers are very real. A RAS for us is one of the most dangerous evolutions carried out at sea during peacetime. Safety is paramount at all times. 'Slow is pro' is one of my key sayings to make sure our people stay safe\". Chief Bosun's Mate, or 'Buffer', PO Scottie Campbell says a full RAS will be the highlight of his 23 year career. He commented: \"A RAS is what I have been looking forward to since I first joined the ship. The weather impact today was disappointing, but I'm very proud of what we've achieved. And I'm proud for the younger guys in my team, because this is their future. We are trialling new kit, on new ships, taking us into the 21st century. Being the first RAS team onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth really has been the highlight of my time in the Royal Navy\".

The two new flattops would \"inevitably be used in a context of allied operations of some kind, if used in a contested environment\", Mark Sedwill told the House of Commons' Defence Committee on May 1. The London press suggested that the U.K. government would be unwilling to risk the ships in a unilateral warfighting operation similar to the naval task force sent to recapture the Falkland Islands from Argentinian occupation in 1982. In addition to that unwillingness, it has long been known that the U.K. would require U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters to bolster its small number of jets on the 70,000-ton carriers, particularly during their early deployments. And with an escort fleet reduced to just 19 frigates and destroyers, the Royal Navy will be reliant on surface combatants provided by the U.S. Navy and other foreign partners to help protect the carriers from technologically advanced adversaries. Lead ship HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) was floated out at Rosyth dockyard in Scotland in 2014, commenced sea trials last June and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on Dec. 7. The future HMS Prince of Wales (R09) was launched at the same yard two weeks later and is now being fitted out. Construction costs for the two ships have totaled \u00a36.2 billion (about $8.4 billion). In August 2017 Queen Elizabeth rendezvoused with the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) carrier strike group during the multinational Exercise Saxon Warrior in the North Sea and northern Atlantic, with some Royal Navy personnel sharpening their aviation-related skills on board the U.S. carrier. The British carrier completed rotary wing trials in February this year, conducting 450 deck landings with Chinook Mk 5 helicopters and 540 landings with Merlin Mk 2 aircraft. Both types flew an average of 10 hours per day in all weather conditions, generating data that will enable technical staff to draw up ship helicopter operating limits. Amphibious warfare trials were also conducted, with a detachment of Royal Marines commandos simulating an air assault from the ship. Queen Elizabeth is now alongside in Portsmouth naval base on England's south coast, covered in tents and scaffolding for a 13-week capability insertion period (CIP) in preparation for an inaugural transatlantic voyage in September. The ship will then conduct a long-awaited first flight trials with F-35B aircraft and is also expected to visit New York City. \"Every month sees a graduated increase in the capability the ship can deliver,\" Rear Adm. Keith Blount, the Royal Navy's Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Aviation, Amphibious Capability and Carriers, said in a press statement last month. \"With over a thousand helicopter deck landings already under our belt, we're developing more expansive clearances for helicopters than we have ever seen before.\" \"Next up are the jets, and the ship is being fitted with all the kit and communication systems required to ensure the aircraft and carrier can work together as a system. This is highly technical and time-consuming stuff and our sailors, airmen and shipyard workers are doing a great job in piecing it all together,\" Blount continued Various fixed-wing landing aids are being installed during the CIP, chief among them the U.S.-designed AN/SPN-41/41A Instrument Carrier Landing System. With an azimuth antenna at the stern of the ship and an elevation antenna on the aft island, this system transmits flight path information to approaching aircraft, which can be viewed in the pilot's head-up display. Defense science company Qinetiq has developed a flight deck lighting array - dubbed the Bedford array - to assist F-35B rolling vertical landings, but this will be fitted initially to the future Prince of Wales as a technology demonstrator. Maintenance is being carried out on the thermal metal spray coating that has been applied to aft sections of Queen Elizabeth's flight deck, designed to protect it from jet blast during F-35B vertical landings, when temperatures could hit 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Workers are fitting the three Phalanx close-in weapon systems that will give the future fleet flagship a last-ditch self-defense capability against inbound missiles. Funnel badges displaying the ship's crest are being bolted to the uptakes, both island superstructures are getting additional cabling, and the junior rates' scullery is being doubled in size and gaining a new conveyor dishwasher system. \"Occasionally the ship will look like it's held together with scaffolding - it isn't and without it that mast, aerial, radar, funnel, anemometer or even paint job won't get done,\" Blount continued in his statement. \"These are exciting times; the ship is on track, as is Prince of Wales. When Queen Elizabeth gets to the States in the autumn, things are going to get noisy, pointy and fast!\" Carrier strike full operational capability for Queen Elizabeth is scheduled for 2020, and the first operational deployment is planned for early 2021. The U.K. has to date received 15 of the 48 F-35B Lighting II aircraft ordered so far - hence the expected need for support from U.S. Marines' F-35Bs - with a total of 138 expected to be acquired over the lifetime of the program.

During this voyage, she will conduct Operational Sea Training and head into the Eastern Atlantic to commence what will be the first of many flying trials, beginning with the Merlin helicopter. Since commissioning on 7th December, the ship has been alongside conducting further engineering work and the minor leak on the stern seal that was the cause of such media hysteria before Christmas has been remedied. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance and their contractors are expected to continue final snagging work on the ship for up to 6 months beyond the commissioning date. The ship had been scheduled to depart on the 30th January but sailing had to be delyed until today. Following a routine full electrical failure test, as a computer system came back online it activated the hangar sprinkler system and water pumps in the firemain system. No serious damage was done and the software fault was remedied. With a known defect in the firefighting system, Captain Kydd sensibly decided to postpone sailing. Unfortunately, a video of the sprinkler activation was passed to the media, who did not miss another opportunity to exaggerate further minor problems with QE. Defects like this are normal on complex warships the world over, but issues with this particular ship attract extraordinary attention. SAT (Air): While still in Portsmouth, a Merlin Mk2, 'Dolphin 14' from 820 Naval Air Squadron landed on board for two days in mid-January to conduct Sea Acceptance Trials (Air) which tested that the systems on the flight deck and in the hangar designed to support embarked were working correctly. The aircraft was connected to electrical supplies and the telebrief system which allows non-wireless communication with the ship before take off. Refuelling arrangements were also tested and firefighting and rescue crews took the opportunity to rehearse emergency drills, damage control and fuel spillage procedures with a real aircraft. Taken below the Merlin was lashed down in the mid-section of the hangar with the fire-curtains lowered. This completion of this short trial gives confidence that the ship is ready and safe to operate aircraft at sea. FOST: A specialist team from FOST (Flag Officer Sea Training) has been on board for some time starting to compile the unique Queen Elizabeth class training syllabus for a new class of ship that is very much larger than anything else there's been in the fleet for a long time. For the first 2 weeks, the ship is likely to operate in the Western Approaches as the FOST staff focus on ensuring the ship's company is fully competent in safety and survival procedures. Fire, flood, casualty and evacuation exercises are likely to be the main focus, the warfare elements that usually comprise a large part of a FOST period will be conducted at a later date. Further sea training periods are scheduled for next year and beyond as more aircraft are embarked and the ship becomes more 'warlike', before achieving initial operating capability in 2020. FOCRW: With sea training completed, the focus will be on conducting First of Class Rotary Wing (FOCRW) trials. The Air Test and Evaluation Collaboration (ATEC) is an MoD-QinetiQ partnership based at MoD Boscombe Down which will provide test pilots, two Chinooks and two Merlin Mk2s. The ship and the aircraft are fitted with sensors and instruments to determine the sea states, roll, pitch and wind limits within which it is safe to fy from the Queen Elizabeth class. Data from these repetitive trials will be used to compile the Ship Helicopter Operating Limitations (SHOL) clearances. Every aircraft type has to be tested and certified for each class of ship it may fly from, to ensure the limits of safe operation are understood. (First of class, RFA Tidespring recently conducted SHOL trials with a Merlin). In time, the QEC will be required to conduct trials with other types including Wildcat, Apache and the F-35B Lightning II (in late 2018). It should be assumed that such a stable ship with a huge flight deck will have higher tolerances for operating helicopters in more extreme conditions than the smaller frigates or auxiliaries. The twin-island design of the QEC is also intended to reduce air turbulence across the deck. The Eastern Atlantic and the Bay of Biscay should provide a variety of testing weather conditions for flying and test the ship in higher sea states than have been experienced so far. A full Merlin Squadron (820 NAS) will embark for the first time in mid-2018. CHF: While trials are being conducted with the Merlin MK2s, the ship will also be supported by Comando Helicopter Force Mk3s from 845 NAS. The aircraft will provide logistic support for QE, known as Maritime Intra Theatre Lift (MITL), the movement of passengers, mail and cargo between land and ships at sea. They will also provide safety back up for the trials aircraft and practice Deployed Search and Rescue (DSAR) operations. When eventually deployed operationally it is planned the QEC will have their own Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) capability. This will comprise a unit of Royal Marines delivered by the Mk3/4s to rescue pilots and sensitive equipment, should an aircraft go down and personnel be missing, detained or captured in hostile environments. This highly classified nature of the F-35 makes it especially important it does not fall into the wrong hands. One of the first newly upgraded Mk 4 aircraft to be delivered has already been trialled with door-mounted heavy machine guns for use in this role. The 845 NAS aircraft embarked on this trip are likely to conduct preparatory work for the JPR role. The long-term plan is that 845 NAS will embark 4 Merlin HC4 helicopters on the operational QEC carrier to support the Special Purpose Task Group (SPTG). This is a Royal Marine company of up to 200 men who will act as a high readiness, rapid reaction force that can be deployed from the carrier short notice. Gibraltar: HMS Queen Elizabeth is expected to arrive Gibraltar on 9th February for a 3-day visit. The Rock is a vital staging point and logistical support hub with connections to the Royal Navy going back centuries. QE can expect a big welcome in Gibraltar and will provide an iconic photo opportunity. The visit will also be a helpful reminder to the Spanish they would do better to improve relations with post-Brexit Britain, instead of making repeated futile incursions into the waters of the territory. There are considerable numbers of junior sailors for whom QE is their first ship, and this will be their first overseas run-ashore. Few sailors have a bad word to say about Gib and it's sure to be memorable for everyone.

The next stage will be for a double probe to be attached, hauled back across to the carrier and connected for diesel to be pumped into her giant fuel tanks. The man in charge of safety for the evolution at the RAS point on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, Chief Petty Officer Jay Early, says the first successful RAS will be the culmination of years of planning and anticipation. He added: \"Meeting up with RFA Tidespring today is an exciting thing for us, we've been talking about it for a long time now. It's two new classes of ship, with another first for a British ship to have a double probe. It will be a real tick in the box for us to know we can achieve it\", he said. The double probe concept has been adopted from American carriers - it means twice the volume of fuel can be delivered within a shorter amount of time. It was a tense time on both decks as the lines were fired across. CPO Early says there was an air of excitement across the team: \"One of things I always say to our guys is, regardless of this being a trial, it's still real for us; there are lines under tension, the ship is moving, equipment is swinging around, the dangers are very real. A RAS for us is one of the most dangerous evolutions carried out at sea during peacetime. Safety is paramount at all times. 'Slow is pro' is one of my key sayings to make sure our people stay safe\". Chief Bosun's Mate, or 'Buffer', PO Scottie Campbell says a full RAS will be the highlight of his 23 year career. He commented: \"A RAS is what I have been looking forward to since I first joined the ship. The weather impact today was disappointing, but I'm very proud of what we've achieved. And I'm proud for the younger guys in my team, because this is their future. We are trialling new kit, on new ships, taking us into the 21st century. Being the first RAS team onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth really has been the highlight of my time in the Royal Navy\". RFA Tidespring is the first of class of the Military Afloat Reach & Sustainability (MARS) Tankers, specifically designed to provide fuel water and stores to the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers.", "url": "https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2018/february/27/180227-double-first-as-hms-queen-elizabeth-and-rfa-tidespring-meet-up-at-sea"}, {"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth returns to Portsmouth after 'successful' helicopter trials", "date": "2018-02-27", "content": "'GOOD morning Gosport, good morning Portsmouth' - these were the words that echoed loudly across Portsmouth Dockyard as the Royal Navy's biggest warship returned home today. The message was piped out from HMS Queen Elizabeth's loud speakers as she sailed through the Portsmouth's historic harbour entrance. It was the third time the 65,000-tonne goliath had made the journey back into her home port after first arriving in August last year. Watching the mighty warship's arrival were mother and daughter Leia and Fiona Curphey, of Cosham. Keen sailor Fiona, 11, snapped a selfie as Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth. She said: 'It's absolutely humongous. It's the biggest ship I've ever seen.' Leia, 39, added: 'It's hard to believe that it can fit into the harbour.' Queen Elizabeth's latest trip out to sea had seen the supercarrier tackling helicopter flight trials off and on her expansive four-acre flight deck. A thousand successful deck landings were carried out in a range of sea and weather conditions during the trials in the Atlantic. A team of 56 aircrew, analysts and engineers from the Air Test and Evaluation Centre (ATEC) at MoD Boscombe Down have been onboard the aircraft carrier for the past month with two Merlin Mk2 and two Chinook Mk 5 test aircraft.

The London press suggested that the U.K. government would be unwilling to risk the ships in a unilateral warfighting operation similar to the naval task force sent to recapture the Falkland Islands from Argentinian occupation in 1982. In addition to that unwillingness, it has long been known that the U.K. would require U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters to bolster its small number of jets on the 70,000-ton carriers, particularly during their early deployments. And with an escort fleet reduced to just 19 frigates and destroyers, the Royal Navy will be reliant on surface combatants provided by the U.S. Navy and other foreign partners to help protect the carriers from technologically advanced adversaries. Lead ship HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) was floated out at Rosyth dockyard in Scotland in 2014, commenced sea trials last June and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on Dec. 7. The future HMS Prince of Wales (R09) was launched at the same yard two weeks later and is now being fitted out. Construction costs for the two ships have totaled \u00a36.2 billion (about $8.4 billion). In August 2017 Queen Elizabeth rendezvoused with the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) carrier strike group during the multinational Exercise Saxon Warrior in the North Sea and northern Atlantic, with some Royal Navy personnel sharpening their aviation-related skills on board the U.S. carrier. The British carrier completed rotary wing trials in February this year, conducting 450 deck landings with Chinook Mk 5 helicopters and 540 landings with Merlin Mk 2 aircraft. Both types flew an average of 10 hours per day in all weather conditions, generating data that will enable technical staff to draw up ship helicopter operating limits. Amphibious warfare trials were also conducted, with a detachment of Royal Marines commandos simulating an air assault from the ship. Queen Elizabeth is now alongside in Portsmouth naval base on England's south coast, covered in tents and scaffolding for a 13-week capability insertion period (CIP) in preparation for an inaugural transatlantic voyage in September. The ship will then conduct a long-awaited first flight trials with F-35B aircraft and is also expected to visit New York City. \"Every month sees a graduated increase in the capability the ship can deliver,\" Rear Adm. Keith Blount, the Royal Navy's Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Aviation, Amphibious Capability and Carriers, said in a press statement last month. \"With over a thousand helicopter deck landings already under our belt, we're developing more expansive clearances for helicopters than we have ever seen before.\" \"Next up are the jets, and the ship is being fitted with all the kit and communication systems required to ensure the aircraft and carrier can work together as a system. This is highly technical and time-consuming stuff and our sailors, airmen and shipyard workers are doing a great job in piecing it all together,\" Blount continued Various fixed-wing landing aids are being installed during the CIP, chief among them the U.S.-designed AN/SPN-41/41A Instrument Carrier Landing System. With an azimuth antenna at the stern of the ship and an elevation antenna on the aft island, this system transmits flight path information to approaching aircraft, which can be viewed in the pilot's head-up display. Defense science company Qinetiq has developed a flight deck lighting array - dubbed the Bedford array - to assist F-35B rolling vertical landings, but this will be fitted initially to the future Prince of Wales as a technology demonstrator. Maintenance is being carried out on the thermal metal spray coating that has been applied to aft sections of Queen Elizabeth's flight deck, designed to protect it from jet blast during F-35B vertical landings, when temperatures could hit 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.

Helicopters, aircrews and support personnel from Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose at Helston have now embarked on the Navy's new aircraft carrier. The huge 65,000-tonne ship was spotted off the coast of Cornwall in June when she was anchored in Mount's Bay. The sailors from Cornwall are all from 820 Naval Air Squadron (NAS), the Navy's oldest and most decorated frontline unit and is made up of about 150 men and women operating the grey Merlin Mark 2 helicopters. They will support the ship as it heads to America to begin four months of sea trials with the new joint-US F35 Lightning Fighters.

Flying a test F-35B from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md., Royal Navy Cmdr. Nathan Gray touched down on HMS Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday to start two months of flight tests aboard the 70,000-ton carrier. Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Andy Edgell landed a second F-35B shortly afterwards. Gray, who has been training with the U.S.-based F-35 Integrated Test Force (ITF) at Pax, said the landing was just like any other test flight in a string of others ashore. \"Coming into land for the first time on Tuesday, the aircraft handled as expected; the interaction between the aircraft and the ship is exactly as expected, as we've simulated thousands and thousands of times before and landed onboard,\" he said. \"There were no surprises.\" While Gray said his day felt routine, for the Royal Navy the first landing of an F-35 on Queen Elizabeth was anything but normal. \"We are enjoying getting back into the big time, and this is one of those big steps forward on that ladder,\" Rear Adm. Keith Blount, the Royal Navy's Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Aviation, Amphibious Capability and Carrier told a group of American defense trade reporters embarked on the carrier on Thursday. \"When you see that jet out there today, having landed on the ship, taking off from the ship, we're taking big steps back into that game again. And it's hugely exciting, and it should be reassuring to those folks back home and indeed on this side of the Atlantic.\" Thursday's landing of the two F-35s is the first time the Royal Navy has operated fixed-wing aviation off a carrier deck since the U.K. flew the last sortie of AV-8B Harriers off the now-decommissioned HMS Ark Royal (R07) in 2011. The introduction of the carrier and sister-ship Prince of Wales (R09) is set to expand the capabilities of the U.K. into a more expeditionary force that could have the same presence effect of a U.S. carrier strike group. \"I think the awakening in the political class that this sends a political message when she sails is important, and that's new to us,\" ship commander Capt. Jerry Kyd said Thursday. While U.K. power projection is the aim in the long term, the short-term goals for testing is to establish the baseline for F-35 ahead of more complex operational testing off the East Coast next year. The work aboard Elizabeth pairs the two F-35s with a four test pilots - a Royal Navy pilot and a Royal Air Force pilot, a U.S. Marine and a civilian test pilot. On Thursday, USNI observed the two fighters with the ITF assigned to the \"Salty Dogs\" of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23 both landing and taking off of Elizabeth's ski-jump bow. U.K. and U.S. pilots have been training at Pax River on a mockup of the hull's ski-jump ramp, which breaks with the straight line of U.S. amphibious assault ships that also operate the F-35B. \"Queen Elizabeth obviously has a the ski-jump, which provides some performance benefits, and obviously the U.K. has long been a fan of that, as is another nation that's a partner in the F-35 program, Italy,\" Marine Maj. Michael Lippert told reporters on Thursday. U.S. Marines have been closely married with the U.K. during the testing period. A Marine F-35B squadron will join the Royal Navy strike group on its first operational deployment in 2021 as part of the air group. \"The U.K. and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long history. We've done joint operations with Harriers, we've had exchange programs for a very long time, and for the past several years the U.K. has had the foresight to have exchange programs with several of their officers and some of their enlisted folks on exchange with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and that has paid huge dividends,\" Lippert said. \"It's wildly apparent that they're wholly prepared for this.\" In addition to the testing of the F-35s aboard Elizabeth, the deployment will help the Royal Navy relearn how to operate carrier strike groups at sea. Following the decision to take Harriers off British ships in 2011, the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force maintained exchange programs with the U.S. to keep at least some U.K. sailors familiar with the process, commanding officer Kyd told reporters on Thursday. \"We've been really lucky that we've cycled a lot of the crew through U.S. carriers in the last five years. Several hundred of my ship's company have been deployed on operations bombing ISIS, and the last four or five years the pilots, the deckhands, chefs and specialists, my officers of the watch, my navigator,\" Kyd said. \"To keep that pilot light alive has been well managed, so it's not like we're starting at ground zero at any stretch of the imagination.\" Kyd was the commander of Ark Royal for the last deployment, and other sailors from that final deployment are now on Elizabeth too. While there are some differences, the basics are still the same. \"In terms of operating the ship, it's quite similar to the pocket aircraft carriers we had, it's just the deck is four times the size,\" he said. \"For me, the similarities are sufficient that it, in fact, feels quite normal out here.\"", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2018/09/28/first-f-35bs-operate-off-hms-queen-elizabeth-u-k-works-toward-native-carrier-strike-group"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "U.K. Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth Set for U.S. Visit, F-35B Trials", "date": "2018-05-09", "content": "Earlier this month, Britain's national security adviser declared that the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers would be unlikely to ever deploy on high-end combat missions without support from friendly forces. The two new flattops would \"inevitably be used in a context of allied operations of some kind, if used in a contested environment\", Mark Sedwill told the House of Commons' Defence Committee on May 1. The London press suggested that the U.K. government would be unwilling to risk the ships in a unilateral warfighting operation similar to the naval task force sent to recapture the Falkland Islands from Argentinian occupation in 1982. In addition to that unwillingness, it has long been known that the U.K. would require U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters to bolster its small number of jets on the 70,000-ton carriers, particularly during their early deployments. And with an escort fleet reduced to just 19 frigates and destroyers, the Royal Navy will be reliant on surface combatants provided by the U.S. Navy and other foreign partners to help protect the carriers from technologically advanced adversaries. Lead ship HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) was floated out at Rosyth dockyard in Scotland in 2014, commenced sea trials last June and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on Dec. 7. The future HMS Prince of Wales (R09) was launched at the same yard two weeks later and is now being fitted out. Construction costs for the two ships have totaled \u00a36.2 billion (about $8.4 billion). In August 2017 Queen Elizabeth rendezvoused with the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) carrier strike group during the multinational Exercise Saxon Warrior in the North Sea and northern Atlantic, with some Royal Navy personnel sharpening their aviation-related skills on board the U.S. carrier. The British carrier completed rotary wing trials in February this year, conducting 450 deck landings with Chinook Mk 5 helicopters and 540 landings with Merlin Mk 2 aircraft. Both types flew an average of 10 hours per day in all weather conditions, generating data that will enable technical staff to draw up ship helicopter operating limits. Amphibious warfare trials were also conducted, with a detachment of Royal Marines commandos simulating an air assault from the ship. Queen Elizabeth is now alongside in Portsmouth naval base on England's south coast, covered in tents and scaffolding for a 13-week capability insertion period (CIP) in preparation for an inaugural transatlantic voyage in September. The ship will then conduct a long-awaited first flight trials with F-35B aircraft and is also expected to visit New York City. \"Every month sees a graduated increase in the capability the ship can deliver,\" Rear Adm. Keith Blount, the Royal Navy's Assistant Chief of Naval Staff for Aviation, Amphibious Capability and Carriers, said in a press statement last month. \"With over a thousand helicopter deck landings already under our belt, we're developing more expansive clearances for helicopters than we have ever seen before.\" \"Next up are the jets, and the ship is being fitted with all the kit and communication systems required to ensure the aircraft and carrier can work together as a system. This is highly technical and time-consuming stuff and our sailors, airmen and shipyard workers are doing a great job in piecing it all together,\" Blount continued Various fixed-wing landing aids are being installed during the CIP, chief among them the U.S.-designed AN/SPN-41/41A Instrument Carrier Landing System. With an azimuth antenna at the stern of the ship and an elevation antenna on the aft island, this system transmits flight path information to approaching aircraft, which can be viewed in the pilot's head-up display. Defense science company Qinetiq has developed a flight deck lighting array - dubbed the Bedford array - to assist F-35B rolling vertical landings, but this will be fitted initially to the future Prince of Wales as a technology demonstrator. Maintenance is being carried out on the thermal metal spray coating that has been applied to aft sections of Queen Elizabeth's flight deck, designed to protect it from jet blast during F-35B vertical landings, when temperatures could hit 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Workers are fitting the three Phalanx close-in weapon systems that will give the future fleet flagship a last-ditch self-defense capability against inbound missiles. Funnel badges displaying the ship's crest are being bolted to the uptakes, both island superstructures are getting additional cabling, and the junior rates' scullery is being doubled in size and gaining a new conveyor dishwasher system. \"Occasionally the ship will look like it's held together with scaffolding - it isn't and without it that mast, aerial, radar, funnel, anemometer or even paint job won't get done,\" Blount continued in his statement. \"These are exciting times; the ship is on track, as is Prince of Wales. When Queen Elizabeth gets to the States in the autumn, things are going to get noisy, pointy and fast!\" Carrier strike full operational capability for Queen Elizabeth is scheduled for 2020, and the first operational deployment is planned for early 2021. The U.K. has to date received 15 of the 48 F-35B Lighting II aircraft ordered so far - hence the expected need for support from U.S. Marines' F-35Bs - with a total of 138 expected to be acquired over the lifetime of the program.

(Some of the aviation aspects are discussed in more detail in our earlier article). Itinerary: Before crossing the Atlantic, the ship will embark more helicopters and conduct a few days of additional rotary wing flying trials in UK waters. She will then head to the eastern seaboard of the US which is likely to take around 10 days, depending on weather and the flying programme. When close to the US, the Merlin Mk4s will fly off Royal Marines to conduct a small demonstration assault landing. This is not a full-scale test of QE in the assault role (HMS Prince of Wales will undertake the main development of amphibious capability) but is a preliminary trial of the ship's ability to embark troops onto helicopters and launch them simultaneously. The Royal Marines will then participate in joint exercises ashore with their US Marine Corps counterparts. QE's is expected at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in early September. She will unload Royal Marine equipment and take on test equipment required for the F-35 flight trials programme. While the crew get some time ashore, the ship is likely to be of a subject of great curiosity to the US military who have generously provided much support for the regeneration of UK carrier strike. Norfolk is home to six of the US Navy's ten supercarriers and QE is a showcase for a radically different approach to aircraft carrier design. The F-35 flight trials off the east coast will consist of two Developmental Testing periods (DT-01 and DT-02) which are scheduled to last around about 3-4 weeks each, with a break in between. The first F-35 landing on QE will probably be in the 3rd week of September. A historic occasion will be the ship's arrival in New York sometime in October, which will attract considerable public attention in the US. QE will come to anchor with small boats used to ferry visitors and personnel to and from the ship. The RN is in negotiations with the New York harbour authorities for a 'high profile anchorage'. Prominent US and British politicians are likely to visit the ship and this will be the first big demonstration of her potential as a floating ambassador for the UK. Before returning home in December, the ship will make a second visit to Norfolk to re-embark equipment and Royal Marines.

Commander Chris Knowles, who took command of 820 NAS last month, said: \"It's a really exciting time for 820 squadron and for me personally to take command of a squadron on the brink of a career-defining deployment, with great people, all of whom are keen, professional and very much looking forward to getting on with their job at sea. \"We've been cycling all crews through a thorough pre-deployment training package to make sure everyone is current and qualified to go. Our force protection role will be key to the ship at sea, as will our SAR capability, we're ready and able to provide whatever support Queen Elizabeth needs.\" Commander Mike Currie, the Merlin Force commander, added: \"The embarkation of 820 NAS, and other members of her air group, represents another significant date in the development of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her capabilities. \"The squadron's focus since the completion of the first deck landing last year has been very much centred around the flying trials with the F-35B.

Michael Lippert told reporters on Thursday. U.S. Marines have been closely married with the U.K. during the testing period. A Marine F-35B squadron will join the Royal Navy strike group on its first operational deployment in 2021 as part of the air group. \"The U.K. and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long history. We've done joint operations with Harriers, we've had exchange programs for a very long time, and for the past several years the U.K. has had the foresight to have exchange programs with several of their officers and some of their enlisted folks on exchange with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and that has paid huge dividends,\" Lippert said. \"It's wildly apparent that they're wholly prepared for this.\" In addition to the testing of the F-35s aboard Elizabeth, the deployment will help the Royal Navy relearn how to operate carrier strike groups at sea. Following the decision to take Harriers off British ships in 2011, the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force maintained exchange programs with the U.S. to keep at least some U.K. sailors familiar with the process, commanding officer Kyd told reporters on Thursday. \"We've been really lucky that we've cycled a lot of the crew through U.S. carriers in the last five years. Several hundred of my ship's company have been deployed on operations bombing ISIS, and the last four or five years the pilots, the deckhands, chefs and specialists, my officers of the watch, my navigator,\" Kyd said. \"To keep that pilot light alive has been well managed, so it's not like we're starting at ground zero at any stretch of the imagination.\" Kyd was the commander of Ark Royal for the last deployment, and other sailors from that final deployment are now on Elizabeth too.

Known as Westlant 18, the primary purpose of the trip is for QE to conduct the first of class flying trials (FOCFT) with the F-35B Lightning II. (Some of the aviation aspects are discussed in more detail in our earlier article). Itinerary: Before crossing the Atlantic, the ship will embark more helicopters and conduct a few days of additional rotary wing flying trials in UK waters. She will then head to the eastern seaboard of the US which is likely to take around 10 days, depending on weather and the flying programme. When close to the US, the Merlin Mk4s will fly off Royal Marines to conduct a small demonstration assault landing. This is not a full-scale test of QE in the assault role (HMS Prince of Wales will undertake the main development of amphibious capability) but is a preliminary trial of the ship's ability to embark troops onto helicopters and launch them simultaneously. The Royal Marines will then participate in joint exercises ashore with their US Marine Corps counterparts. QE's is expected at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in early September. She will unload Royal Marine equipment and take on test equipment required for the F-35 flight trials programme. While the crew get some time ashore, the ship is likely to be of a subject of great curiosity to the US military who have generously provided much support for the regeneration of UK carrier strike. Norfolk is home to six of the US Navy's ten supercarriers and QE is a showcase for a radically different approach to aircraft carrier design. The F-35 flight trials off the east coast will consist of two Developmental Testing periods (DT-01 and DT-02) which are scheduled to last around about 3-4 weeks each, with a break in between. The first F-35 landing on QE will probably be in the 3rd week of September. A historic occasion will be the ship's arrival in New York sometime in October, which will attract considerable public attention in the US. QE will come to anchor with small boats used to ferry visitors and personnel to and from the ship. The RN is in negotiations with the New York harbour authorities for a 'high profile anchorage'. Prominent US and British politicians are likely to visit the ship and this will be the first big demonstration of her potential as a floating ambassador for the UK. Before returning home in December, the ship will make a second visit to Norfolk to re-embark equipment and Royal Marines. QE may spend some time in the Caribbean to test her performance in hot/humid conditions. The RN has also done some contingency planning in case the ship is called on to assist in hurricane relief operations in the region. 700 tonnes of disaster relief stores and equipment are embarked on QE but fortunately weather patterns this year would suggest that hurricanes are likely to be less severe than last year when HMS Ocean was called upon. (RFA Mounts Bay is already in the area and available to assist).

U.K. and U.S. pilots have been training at Pax River on a mockup of the hull's ski-jump ramp, which breaks with the straight line of U.S. amphibious assault ships that also operate the F-35B. \"Queen Elizabeth obviously has a the ski-jump, which provides some performance benefits, and obviously the U.K. has long been a fan of that, as is another nation that's a partner in the F-35 program, Italy,\" Marine Maj. Michael Lippert told reporters on Thursday. U.S. Marines have been closely married with the U.K. during the testing period. A Marine F-35B squadron will join the Royal Navy strike group on its first operational deployment in 2021 as part of the air group. \"The U.K. and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long history. We've done joint operations with Harriers, we've had exchange programs for a very long time, and for the past several years the U.K. has had the foresight to have exchange programs with several of their officers and some of their enlisted folks on exchange with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and that has paid huge dividends,\" Lippert said. \"It's wildly apparent that they're wholly prepared for this.\" In addition to the testing of the F-35s aboard Elizabeth, the deployment will help the Royal Navy relearn how to operate carrier strike groups at sea. Following the decision to take Harriers off British ships in 2011, the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force maintained exchange programs with the U.S. to keep at least some U.K. sailors familiar with the process, commanding officer Kyd told reporters on Thursday. \"We've been really lucky that we've cycled a lot of the crew through U.S. carriers in the last five years. Several hundred of my ship's company have been deployed on operations bombing ISIS, and the last four or five years the pilots, the deckhands, chefs and specialists, my officers of the watch, my navigator,\" Kyd said. \"To keep that pilot light alive has been well managed, so it's not like we're starting at ground zero at any stretch of the imagination.\" Kyd was the commander of Ark Royal for the last deployment, and other sailors from that final deployment are now on Elizabeth too. While there are some differences, the basics are still the same. \"In terms of operating the ship, it's quite similar to the pocket aircraft carriers we had, it's just the deck is four times the size,\" he said. \"For me, the similarities are sufficient that it, in fact, feels quite normal out here.\"", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2018/09/28/first-f-35bs-operate-off-hms-queen-elizabeth-u-k-works-toward-native-carrier-strike-group"}, {"title": "Biggest helicopter in the US Navy lands on HMS Queen Elizabeth", "date": "2018-10-11", "content": "An MH-53E Sea Dragon, the United States Navy's biggest helicopter, visited HMS Queen Elizabeth earlier in the week.

This follows successful developmental trials last year with US Lightning jets, where forces conducted 500 take offs and landings over their 11-week period at sea. These trials are aimed at 'end-to-end' testing of the aircraft and personnel to ensure the aircraft are compatible with the carrier. The tests involve mission planning, arming the aircraft using the ship's Highly Automated Weapon Handling System, flying missions and debriefing on completion. The landings on HMS Queen Elizabeth are part of the 'WESTLANT 19' Carrier Strike Group deployment. Once fully operational, UK Carrier Strike Group will be a formidable force around the world, using a number of platforms to work alongside our allies. During this time, the aircraft carrier will be escorted by Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon, submarine hunter HMS Northumberland, tanker RFA Tideforce and Merlins from 814, 820 and 845 Naval Air Squadrons, Wildcats from 815 squadron and Royal Marines from Lima Company, 42 Commando. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: \"This is another step towards the UK's carrier strike capability becoming fully operational.\" \"The bringing together of the UK Lightnings on the first in class HMS Queen Elizabeth paves the way for the world's most up to date, fully integrated carrier force.\" The Lightning aircraft operates with a cutting-edge design. It is the first jet to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speed, as well as the ability to land vertically. Given its ability to conduct missions both from land and sea, the jets act as a formidable spine to the 'carrier strike' capability. The UK currently owns 18 aircraft, with an additional order placed for 30 jets. First to land onboard, Wing Commander Adam Curd, Royal Air Force, said: \"This is the first time I have landed onboard an aircraft carrier - for it to be HMS Queen Elizabeth, and in an aircraft as amazing as a UK Lightning, is quite something.\" \"This is a proud moment not only for me, but the wider team that has brought us to this milestone for maritime aviation and UK Defence.\" The trials will be led by the joint Royal Navy - Royal Air Force 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron from the Air Warfare Centre. The Squadron will be operating alongside personnel and aircraft from the UK Lightning Force, based out of RAF Marham. Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff for Aviation and Carrier Strike, Rear Admiral Martin Connell, Royal Navy, said: \"Embarking UK Lightning jets in HMS Queen Elizabeth for the very first time is a major milestone for Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aviation and for our development of the 5th generation Carrier Strike Group capability.\" \"Once again, the support from our US Navy and US Marine Corps colleagues in the United States has been incredible and undoubtedly helped bring us to this moment: making maritime aviation history.\" Air Officer Commanding Number 1 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, Royal Air Force, said: \"WESTLANT19 marks an extremely significant milestone on our 10-year journey to establishing our renewed Carrier Strike capability.\" \"Bringing our own Lightnings onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time gives us the opportunity to conduct critical operational testing. With the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force operating so closely together, these are incredibly exciting times for embarked Combat Air.\" The UK will declare Initial Operating Capability for Carrier Strike by the end of 2020. The first operational deployment for HMS Queen Elizabeth 617 Squadron and a squadron of US Marine Corps Lightning jets is due to take place in 2021. Commander of the Strike Group, Commodore Mike Utley, Royal Navy said: \"Getting to this point of embarking UK Lightning jets into our British-built carrier has been a significant joint undertaking by industry and military - both ours, and those from the United States.\" \"We will take the jets from the successful developmental phase we achieved last year through to a more operational footing, so we are confident that the jets, the carrier and our destroyers and frigates will function seamlessly together.\"", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-uk-fighter-jets-land-onboard-hms-queen-elizabeth"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "HMS Queen Elizabeth returns to port early after minor internal leak", "date": "2019-07-10", "content": "HMS Queen Elizabeth was due to return for planned maintenance later this week but came home early as a \"precautionary measure\".

These trials are aimed at 'end-to-end' testing of the aircraft and personnel to ensure the aircraft are compatible with the carrier. The tests involve mission planning, arming the aircraft using the ship's Highly Automated Weapon Handling System, flying missions and debriefing on completion. The landings on HMS Queen Elizabeth are part of the 'WESTLANT 19' Carrier Strike Group deployment.

It is the first jet to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speed, as well as the ability to land vertically. Given its ability to conduct missions both from land and sea, the jets act as a formidable spine to the 'carrier strike' capability. The UK currently owns 18 aircraft, with an additional order placed for 30 jets. First to land onboard, Wing Commander Adam Curd, Royal Air Force, said: \"This is the first time I have landed onboard an aircraft carrier - for it to be HMS Queen Elizabeth, and in an aircraft as amazing as a UK Lightning, is quite something.\" \"This is a proud moment not only for me, but the wider team that has brought us to this milestone for maritime aviation and UK Defence.\" The trials will be led by the joint Royal Navy - Royal Air Force 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron from the Air Warfare Centre.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is indicative of both Great Britain's return to carrier-based fixed-wing flight operations after a decade's absence and the strength of its cross Atlantic partnership with the U.S., said Adm. Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord and U.K. Chief of Naval Staff. Radakin was in Queen Elizabeth's hangar bay addressing the second Atlantic Future Forum, while the ship was moored in the Chesapeake Bay just offshore of Annapolis, Md. \"As she has demonstrated already, we can successfully field a combined U.S., U.K. carrier strike group,\" Radakin said. \"I look forward to this developing further, moving to the point where we are not only talking about interoperability, but we are looking for interchangeability. \" Queen Elizabeth can deploy with up to 36 F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters. The ship is wrapping up a series of exercises off the Atlantic Coast, in coordination with the U.S. military, he said. When Queen Elizabeth embarks on its first deployment in 2021, its airwing will include a mix of Royal Navy F-35B fighters and F-35B fighters from U.S. the \"Wake Island Avengers\" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211. The combined deployment, with U.S. Marine Corps fighters integrated into a U.K. carrier airwing, signifies the degree to which the two forces can operate with each other, Radakin said. The British designed Queen Elizabeth with F-35B operations in mind. Radakin said. The technological advances of the F-35B inspired much of the ship's automation, Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Queen Elizabeth's commanding officer, told members of the media before the forum started. \"We've embraced technology, innovative solutions, management systems that allow us to reduce our manpower burden,\" Moorhouse said. Queen Elizabeth's core crew numbers about 800 officers and enlisted personnel. With an embarked airwing, the crew will about double in size. The highly automated weapons system only requires about 40 crew members to operate, a fraction of the crew performing similar tasks on U.S. aircraft carriers. However, Moorhouse said the smaller crew size had not reduced the ship's readiness or ability to operate with U.S. forces. For much of the autumn, Moorhouse said Queen Elizabeth conducted exercises with the help of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel.

During this time, the aircraft carrier will be escorted by Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon, submarine hunter HMS Northumberland, tanker RFA Tideforce and Merlins from 814, 820 and 845 Naval Air Squadrons, Wildcats from 815 squadron and Royal Marines from Lima Company, 42 Commando. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: \"This is another step towards the UK's carrier strike capability becoming fully operational.\" \"The bringing together of the UK Lightnings on the first in class HMS Queen Elizabeth paves the way for the world's most up to date, fully integrated carrier force.\" The Lightning aircraft operates with a cutting-edge design. It is the first jet to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speed, as well as the ability to land vertically. Given its ability to conduct missions both from land and sea, the jets act as a formidable spine to the 'carrier strike' capability. The UK currently owns 18 aircraft, with an additional order placed for 30 jets. First to land onboard, Wing Commander Adam Curd, Royal Air Force, said: \"This is the first time I have landed onboard an aircraft carrier - for it to be HMS Queen Elizabeth, and in an aircraft as amazing as a UK Lightning, is quite something.\" \"This is a proud moment not only for me, but the wider team that has brought us to this milestone for maritime aviation and UK Defence.\" The trials will be led by the joint Royal Navy - Royal Air Force 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron from the Air Warfare Centre. The Squadron will be operating alongside personnel and aircraft from the UK Lightning Force, based out of RAF Marham. Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff for Aviation and Carrier Strike, Rear Admiral Martin Connell, Royal Navy, said: \"Embarking UK Lightning jets in HMS Queen Elizabeth for the very first time is a major milestone for Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aviation and for our development of the 5th generation Carrier Strike Group capability.\" \"Once again, the support from our US Navy and US Marine Corps colleagues in the United States has been incredible and undoubtedly helped bring us to this moment: making maritime aviation history.\" Air Officer Commanding Number 1 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, Royal Air Force, said: \"WESTLANT19 marks an extremely significant milestone on our 10-year journey to establishing our renewed Carrier Strike capability.\" \"Bringing our own Lightnings onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time gives us the opportunity to conduct critical operational testing. With the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force operating so closely together, these are incredibly exciting times for embarked Combat Air.\" The UK will declare Initial Operating Capability for Carrier Strike by the end of 2020. The first operational deployment for HMS Queen Elizabeth 617 Squadron and a squadron of US Marine Corps Lightning jets is due to take place in 2021. Commander of the Strike Group, Commodore Mike Utley, Royal Navy said: \"Getting to this point of embarking UK Lightning jets into our British-built carrier has been a significant joint undertaking by industry and military - both ours, and those from the United States.\" \"We will take the jets from the successful developmental phase we achieved last year through to a more operational footing, so we are confident that the jets, the carrier and our destroyers and frigates will function seamlessly together.\"", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-uk-fighter-jets-land-onboard-hms-queen-elizabeth"}, {"title": "Royal Navy Intends HMS Queen Elizabeth to be Integrated into U.S. Carrier Operations", "date": "2019-11-21", "content": "The U.K. Royal Navy intends its largest, most advanced warship ever built to be considered interchangeable with U.S. Navy carriers, its top admiral said on Thursday.

Radakin was in Queen Elizabeth's hangar bay addressing the second Atlantic Future Forum, while the ship was moored in the Chesapeake Bay just offshore of Annapolis, Md. \"As she has demonstrated already, we can successfully field a combined U.S., U.K. carrier strike group,\" Radakin said. \"I look forward to this developing further, moving to the point where we are not only talking about interoperability, but we are looking for interchangeability. \" Queen Elizabeth can deploy with up to 36 F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters.

The combined deployment, with U.S. Marine Corps fighters integrated into a U.K. carrier airwing, signifies the degree to which the two forces can operate with each other, Radakin said. The British designed Queen Elizabeth with F-35B operations in mind. Radakin said. The technological advances of the F-35B inspired much of the ship's automation, Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Queen Elizabeth's commanding officer, told members of the media before the forum started. \"We've embraced technology, innovative solutions, management systems that allow us to reduce our manpower burden,\" Moorhouse said.

The highly automated weapons system only requires about 40 crew members to operate, a fraction of the crew performing similar tasks on U.S. aircraft carriers. However, Moorhouse said the smaller crew size had not reduced the ship's readiness or ability to operate with U.S. forces.

The \"Wake Island Avengers\" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 flew to the United Kingdom last week to train aboard Queen Elizabeth. According to a Marine Corps spokesman, 10 F-35Bs flew to the U.K. to partake in the Group Exercise, also known as GroupEx, for several weeks aboard the British aircraft carrier. \"GroupEx will establish selective interoperability to address gaps and mitigate risks within the U.S. and U.K.'s respective individual forces,\" 1st Lt. Zachary Bodner, a spokesman for VMFA-211, told USNI News in a statement. The Wake Island Avengers traveled to Royal Air Force Station Marham in the United Kingdom from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz. ahead of the drills. The flight included one stop at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, S.C. \"Flying that far required an immense amount of skill from the maintainers who prepared the aircraft and the pilots who conducted mission planning, aerial refueling and vertical landings after a nine-hour flight. Realistic training is essential to maintaining our combat readiness,\" Bodner said. The U.S. Marine Corps and the U.K. Navy have for several years planned to operate F-35Bs off of Queen Elizabeth, USNI News previously reported. The first two F-35Bs landed on Queen Elizabeth's deck in September 2018. Last year, the U.K. Navy's top officer said he hoped the British carrier could operate interchangeably with U.S. aircraft carriers. \"As she has demonstrated already, we can successfully field a combined U.S., U.K. carrier strike group,\" Royal Navy Adm. Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, said aboard the carrier in 2019. \"I look forward to this developing further, moving to the point where we are not only talking about interoperability, but we are looking for interchangeability. \" Bodner said the training for Squadron 211 aboard Queen Elizabeth will include a variety of drills meant to help with the aircraft's interoperability. \"During Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211's time in the UK we will conduct a range of training to include; simulated flights, day and night carrier qualification, weapons integration, and expeditionary advanced basing operations,\" Bodner told USNI News. \"The training is designed to validate F-35 digital interoperability with 617 Squadron in preparation of our deployment next year as part of Carrier Strike Group 21,\" he added. \"The development and refinement of our shared war-fighting capabilities further strengthens our special partnership with the United Kingdom and solidifies stability within the geographical combatant command.\" ", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2020/09/09/british-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-underway-ahead-of-training-with-marine-f-35s"}, {"title": "Wake Island Avengers Set Sail Onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth: First F-35B deployment onboard partner nation vessel", "date": "2020-09-23", "content": "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 embarked 10 F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters onboard Her Majesty's Ship Queen Elizabeth yesterday as part of the squadron's multi-month deployment for training to the United Kingdom. \"The Wake Island Avengers\" are proud to represent the United States Marine Corps and United States of America while they serve as part of the UK's Carrier Strike Group. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth will be operating with the largest air group of 5th generation fighters assembled anywhere in the world,\" said Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Commander UK CSG. \"Led by the Royal Navy, and backed by our closest allies, this new Carrier Strike Group puts real muscle back into NATO; and sends a clear signal that the United Kingdom takes its global role seriously\" VMFA-211 joined the UK's 617 Squadron \"The Dambusters\" onboard the 65,000-ton carrier as she sailed for exercises with NATO allies in the North Sea. This month's overarching UK-led Group Exercise will see VMFA-211, 617 Squadron and HMS Queen Elizabeth joined by six Royal Navy destroyers, frigates and auxiliaries, ready to fight in any clime or place. In addition to these forces, the UK CSG will be joined by warships from the Royal Netherlands Navy and US Navy to form the largest UK-led multi-national force in recent years, which will accompany HMS Queen Elizabeth on her global, inaugural deployment in 2021. \"This is the Special Relationship in action.\" said Robert Wood Johnson, U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, \"Our forces train, fight, and win - side by side - to protect our two countries.\" Before the deployment, the CSG will be put through its paces off the north east coast of Scotland as part of Joint Warrior, NATO's largest annual exercise. Joint Warrior will be an opportunity for the CSG to exercise the capabilities of 15 5th generation F-35Bs flown by VMFA-211 and Squadron 617. The F-35B combines next-generation fighter characteristics of radar-evading stealth, sensor fusion, fighter agility and advanced logistical support with the most powerful and comprehensive integrated sensor package of any fighter aircraft in history, providing unprecedented lethality and access to highly contested environments. \"This deployment demonstrates that our forces are more than interoperable-we are integrated,\" said Col. Simon Doran, Senior National Representative to the UK CSG. \"During this special partnership, the US Marine Corps and US Navy will conduct carrier strike group operations, training to maritime power projection, and ultimately supporting shared security. Our alliance is stronger because we can deploy and fight together as truly integrated NATO allies\" This exercise is a historic moment for the United Kingdom and the United States which strengthens the special relationship between the two countries. For the UK, it will be the largest air group to operate from a Royal Navy carrier since HMS Hermes in 1983; as well as the next step leading toward HMS Queen Elizabeth's worldwide deployment this spring. For the United States, it is the first time a squadron of 5th generation aircraft will be deployed aboard a foreign vessel and will prove that the \"Wake Island Avengers\" are ready to conduct operations in support of NATO. The \"Wake Island Avengers\" made history in 2018 when the squadron completed the first F-35B combat deployment, successfully supporting ground operations in Central Command's area of responsibility. \"The Wake Island Avengers are ready in all respects to work with the British sailors and aircrew onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth,\" said Lt. Col. Joseph Freshour, the commanding officer of VMFA-211. \"We are looking forward to deploying alongside our British counterparts.\" VMFA-211 deployed for training to Royal Air Force Station (RAF) Marham in the early evening of 03 September 2020. The pilots flew from Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona to MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina, and then onto RAF Mahram, a distance of 5500 nautical miles. Since then, VMFA-211 has been conducting realistic, relevant training at RAF Marham with \"The Dambusters\". While serving as part of the UK Carrier Strike Group, VMFA-211 will use innovative techniques to combine efforts and resources while collaborating on complex mission sets to maintain our Nations' global maritime military advantage. The Navy-Marine Corps team is humbled and proud to represent the United States and continue the special relationship with the United Kingdom in support of shared security.

Two squadrons of F-35B stealth jets, the RAF's 617 Squadron (The Dambusters) and the U.S. Marines Corps Fighter Attack Squadron 211 (VMFA-21, the Wake Island Avengers), have joined the 65,000-ton carrier as she sails for exercises with allies in the North Sea. With a total of 14 jets and eight Merlin helicopters, it's the largest concentration of fighter jets to operate at sea from a Royal Navy carrier since HMS Hermes in 1983, and the largest air group of fifth generation fighters at sea anywhere in the world. In this month's group exercise, HMS Queen Elizabeth will be joined by seven Royal Navy destroyers, frigates and auxiliaries, plus other supporting units, to form a fully sovereign Carrier Strike Group, ready to fight on the surface and in the air. The Carrier Strike Group will be put through its paces off the north east coast of Scotland as part of Joint Warrior, NATO's largest annual exercise. \"The United Kingdom's maritime renaissance has been unfolding over many years, as we introduced a new generation of ships, submarines and aircraft into service,\" said Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander, U.K. Carrier Strike Group. \"But this marks the first time we have brought them together in a cohesive, potent, fighting force. HMS Queen Elizabeth will be operating with the largest air group of fifth generation fighters assembled anywhere in the world. Led by the Royal Navy, and backed by our closest allies, this new Carrier Strike Group puts real muscle back into NATO and sends a clear signal that the United Kingdom takes its global role seriously.\" Royal Navy Commander Mark Sparrow, 617 Squadron's commanding officer, added: \"This is an incredibly exciting time for 617 Squadron as we begin a new era of partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps building towards next year's operational deployment with HMS Queen Elizabeth. You need to go back more than three decades to find the U.K. operating anything on this scale or complexity and this is a first for fifth-generation carrier capability. The era of big-deck, fast jet carrier operations is back\". Usually based in Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, VMFA-211 arrived in the United Kingdom, just under two weeks ago. Landing at the home of the Lightning Force, RAF Marham, after the trans-Atlantic flight, they worked up with 617 Squadron conducting the RAF led Exercise Point Blank before embarking in the carrier. \"The Wake Island Avengers are ready in all respects to work with the British sailors and aircrew on board HMS Queen Elizabeth,\" said Marine Lt. Col. Joseph Freshour, commanding officer of VMFA-211. \"We are looking forward to deploying alongside our British counterparts over the next few months, and we will work tirelessly as a part of this transatlantic naval force. We are proud to play such an important role in the generation of an allies' carrier strike capability.\" Capt. James Blackmore, the U.K.'s Carrier Air Wing Commander, added: \"We are going to learn a huge amount from operating F-35Bs at sea with the USMC, they have had them longer and we can share ideas and practices. But this is much more than that; this is the trans-Atlantic alliance in action, demonstrating that two close allies can not only fly from each other's carriers, but can fight alongside each other should we need to.

Later this year, crews will work alongside personnel and aircraft from the US Marine Corps to further understand the capability of the F-35B aircraft. 617 Squadron, which was formally stood up as a F-35B squadron in 2018, is known as 'The Dambusters' after the famous raids on German Dams in the Ruhr Valley in 1943 left RAF Marham to join the Royal Navy aircraft carrier on the North Sea. Commander Mark Sparrow, Commanding Officer of 617 Squadron, said personnel had been \"training hard\". \"This is the first time the ship's operational squadron has embarked and worked together,\" he said. Commander Ed Phillips, who is in charge of flying operations on HMS Queen Elizabeth, said 617 Squadron joining the carrier was \"a significant day for HMS Queen Elizabeth on the road to delivering carrier strike operations for the Royal Navy\". \"We are at the heart of a world-leading capability for the UK and will soon have on our decks two squadrons of F-35s - from the UK and US - plus the protection of a strike group made up of destroyers, frigates and support ships,\" he said. The next stage of carrier sea training now follows a successful month of basic sea training for HMS Queen Elizabeth. The F-35Bs and crew on board will be required show the fighter jets can defend the aircraft carrier through short-notice take-offs and combat air patrols, which involve launching from the ship to conduct strike missions against an enemy. It is also a chance for 617 Squadron to get more experience of working with a warship during the day and night in a maritime environment. Afterwards, the Dambusters squadron will undergo tests alongside Merlin helicopters of Culdrose-based 820 Naval Air Squadron. Group Captain James Beck, Station Commander of RAF, the home base of the Lightning Force, says the aim is for \"initial operating capability maritime\" to be declared for the F-35B by the end of 2020. Once fully operational, HMS Queen Elizabeth will become part of a Carrier Strike Group, travelling with aircraft and vessels. The carrier will be given specialist protection from threats on, above and below waters alongside designated fuel replenishment ships. She will return to Portsmouth later this month following carrier sea training.", "url": "https://www.forces.net/news/f-35-dambusters-squadron-joins-hms-queen-elizabeth-first-time"}, {"title": "British Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth Underway Ahead of Training with Marine F-35s", "date": "2020-09-09", "content": "U.K.'s new carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has departed Portsmouth, England for a short cruise ahead of training drills with U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters, the Royal Navy announced on Wednesday.

The Wake Island Avengers traveled to Royal Air Force Station Marham in the United Kingdom from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz. ahead of the drills. The flight included one stop at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, S.C. \"Flying that far required an immense amount of skill from the maintainers who prepared the aircraft and the pilots who conducted mission planning, aerial refueling and vertical landings after a nine-hour flight. Realistic training is essential to maintaining our combat readiness,\" Bodner said. The U.S. Marine Corps and the U.K. Navy have for several years planned to operate F-35Bs off of Queen Elizabeth, USNI News previously reported. The first two F-35Bs landed on Queen Elizabeth's deck in September 2018. Last year, the U.K. Navy's top officer said he hoped the British carrier could operate interchangeably with U.S. aircraft carriers. \"As she has demonstrated already, we can successfully field a combined U.S., U.K. carrier strike group,\" Royal Navy Adm.

Our alliance is stronger because we can deploy and fight together as truly integrated NATO allies\" This exercise is a historic moment for the United Kingdom and the United States which strengthens the special relationship between the two countries. For the UK, it will be the largest air group to operate from a Royal Navy carrier since HMS Hermes in 1983; as well as the next step leading toward HMS Queen Elizabeth's worldwide deployment this spring. For the United States, it is the first time a squadron of 5th generation aircraft will be deployed aboard a foreign vessel and will prove that the \"Wake Island Avengers\" are ready to conduct operations in support of NATO. The \"Wake Island Avengers\" made history in 2018 when the squadron completed the first F-35B combat deployment, successfully supporting ground operations in Central Command's area of responsibility. \"The Wake Island Avengers are ready in all respects to work with the British sailors and aircrew onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth,\" said Lt. Col. Joseph Freshour, the commanding officer of VMFA-211. \"We are looking forward to deploying alongside our British counterparts.\" VMFA-211 deployed for training to Royal Air Force Station (RAF) Marham in the early evening of 03 September 2020. The pilots flew from Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona to MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina, and then onto RAF Mahram, a distance of 5500 nautical miles. Since then, VMFA-211 has been conducting realistic, relevant training at RAF Marham with \"The Dambusters\". While serving as part of the UK Carrier Strike Group, VMFA-211 will use innovative techniques to combine efforts and resources while collaborating on complex mission sets to maintain our Nations' global maritime military advantage.

The \"Wake Island Avengers\" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 flew to the United Kingdom last week to train aboard Queen Elizabeth. According to a Marine Corps spokesman, 10 F-35Bs flew to the U.K. to partake in the Group Exercise, also known as GroupEx, for several weeks aboard the British aircraft carrier. \"GroupEx will establish selective interoperability to address gaps and mitigate risks within the U.S. and U.K.'s respective individual forces,\" 1st Lt. Zachary Bodner, a spokesman for VMFA-211, told USNI News in a statement. The Wake Island Avengers traveled to Royal Air Force Station Marham in the United Kingdom from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz. ahead of the drills. The flight included one stop at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, S.C. \"Flying that far required an immense amount of skill from the maintainers who prepared the aircraft and the pilots who conducted mission planning, aerial refueling and vertical landings after a nine-hour flight. Realistic training is essential to maintaining our combat readiness,\" Bodner said. The U.S. Marine Corps and the U.K. Navy have for several years planned to operate F-35Bs off of Queen Elizabeth, USNI News previously reported. The first two F-35Bs landed on Queen Elizabeth's deck in September 2018. Last year, the U.K. Navy's top officer said he hoped the British carrier could operate interchangeably with U.S. aircraft carriers. \"As she has demonstrated already, we can successfully field a combined U.S., U.K. carrier strike group,\" Royal Navy Adm. Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, said aboard the carrier in 2019. \"I look forward to this developing further, moving to the point where we are not only talking about interoperability, but we are looking for interchangeability. \" Bodner said the training for Squadron 211 aboard Queen Elizabeth will include a variety of drills meant to help with the aircraft's interoperability. \"During Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211's time in the UK we will conduct a range of training to include; simulated flights, day and night carrier qualification, weapons integration, and expeditionary advanced basing operations,\" Bodner told USNI News. \"The training is designed to validate F-35 digital interoperability with 617 Squadron in preparation of our deployment next year as part of Carrier Strike Group 21,\" he added. \"The development and refinement of our shared war-fighting capabilities further strengthens our special partnership with the United Kingdom and solidifies stability within the geographical combatant command.\" ", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2020/09/09/british-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-underway-ahead-of-training-with-marine-f-35s"}, {"title": "Wake Island Avengers Set Sail Onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth: First F-35B deployment onboard partner nation vessel", "date": "2020-09-23", "content": "Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 embarked 10 F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters onboard Her Majesty's Ship Queen Elizabeth yesterday as part of the squadron's multi-month deployment for training to the United Kingdom. \"The Wake Island Avengers\" are proud to represent the United States Marine Corps and United States of America while they serve as part of the UK's Carrier Strike Group. \"HMS Queen Elizabeth will be operating with the largest air group of 5th generation fighters assembled anywhere in the world,\" said Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Commander UK CSG. \"Led by the Royal Navy, and backed by our closest allies, this new Carrier Strike Group puts real muscle back into NATO; and sends a clear signal that the United Kingdom takes its global role seriously\" VMFA-211 joined the UK's 617 Squadron \"The Dambusters\" onboard the 65,000-ton carrier as she sailed for exercises with NATO allies in the North Sea.

In the readout of a call between defense and foreign ministers from Tokyo and London, the two countries discussed the deployment and the U.K. Royal Navy's plans to operate with the Japan Self-Defense Forces during the U.K. Carrier Strike Group 2021 deployment. \"Japan and the U.K. have forged a close defense and security partnership that is being elevated to new heights this year when the U.K. Carrier Strike Group visits the Indo-Pacific,\" U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in a statement about the call, which also included Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. \"We will take security and defense cooperation between Japan and the U.K. to a higher level,\" Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in a statement about the call, which also included defense minister Nobuo Kishi, according to Nikkei Asia. The confirmation of the exercises between the two maritime forces comes as Japan and the U.K. have increased defense cooperation. The two have cooperated in hunting North Korean ships operating illegally and in 2019 entered into a trilateral naval cooperation agreement with the U.S. The drills also come as China has continued to expand maritime operations and taken a more assertive posture in the East and South China Seas. In response to Beijing's military expansion, over the last few years Japan has adjusted its pacifist constitution to allow for more multilateral cooperation. The military has since drawn closer to the U.S., Australia and the U.K. Japan, the U.S. Marines and U.K. all operate F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters.

Both the air and naval elements of the CSG have now met this milestone, which includes qualified pilots and ground crews being held at short notice for carrier-based operations and trained to handle weapons and maintain the equipment. Another marker of success at this stage includes the ability to deploy Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities such as frigates and destroyers, as well as both fixed and rotary wing aircraft including Merlin helicopters to operate alongside the carrier. Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said: \"This is a hugely significant milestone for HMS Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Navy and the whole country. This achievement is a testament to the determination of our service personnel and industry workforce who have delivered this first-rate military capability, a capability held by only a handful of nations. I wish the entire Carrier Strike Group well ahead of their first operational deployment this year.\" Following the success of the NATO Joint Warrior Exercises last autumn, the Carrier Strike Group capability has reached the key IOC milestone for the programme on schedule. The multinational deployment in 2020 focussed on incorporating all elements of the CSG with 13 of the UK's allies including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Turkey, Japan, UAE and the US. Exercise Joint Warrior saw the largest number of aircraft on a British Royal Navy carrier since 1983, as well as the most F-35B jets at sea across the globe.

Joining HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) on its inaugural deployment will be Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, which flies the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, as well as USS The Sullivans (DDG-68), according to statements from both countries. \"I am delighted that the UK now possesses a 21st century Carrier Strike capability, which has been greatly assisted by the unswerving support and cooperation of the United States at all levels over the past decade,\" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in the U.K. statement. \"This deployment embodies the strength of our bilateral ties and reflects the depth and breadth of this vital defence and security partnership.\" \"This deployment underscores the strength of our bilateral ties and demonstrates U.S.-UK interoperability, both of which are key tenets of the U.S. National Defense Strategy,\" reads the U.S. statement. \"The leaders look forward to seeing the culmination of nearly a decade of U.S.-UK carrier cooperation when Carrier Strike Group 2021 sets sail from Portsmouth, UK later this year.\" The Marines from VMFA-211 were tapped to serve alongside the Royal Air Force's 617 Squadron \"The Dambusters\" on this \"Carrier Strike 21\" deployment. The U.S. Marines are helping fill out the air wing until the U.K. stands up more squadrons. The Marines got underway on the carrier in September and participated in a Group Exercise and NATO Joint Warrior Exercises in October, culminating in an initial operating capability declaration for the carrier strike group on Jan. 4. During those exercises, The Sullivans and Dutch frigate HNLMS Evertsen (F805) served in the strike group as carrier escorts. U.S. Navy and U.K. Royal Navy ships have increasingly worked alongside each other and under the same command structure as the U.S. operates more in the North Atlantic. Last year, Spain-based Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Donald Cook (DDG-75), USS Porter (DDG-78) and USS Roosevelt (DDG-80) operated in the Barents Sea in May alongside fast combat support ship USNS Supply (T-AOE-6) and HMS Kent (F-78). In September, HMS Sutherland (F81) led a surface action group that included USS Ross (DDG-71), British Royal Fleet Auxiliary RFA Tidespring (A136) and Royal Norwegian frigate HNoMS Thor Heyerdahl (F314). These Arctic operations were meant to show increasing interoperability between North Atlantic and Arctic navies to push back against Russian naval operations. The upcoming carrier deployment will take the SAG deployment a step further, putting U.K. Royal Navy officers in command of an even larger and more complex international naval formation. The deployment will be the first operational carrier deployment for the U.K. since HMS Illustrious (R06) was decommissioned in 2014, and the first operational employment of fixed-wing jets from a Royal Navy carrier since 2011.", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2021/01/19/u-s-u-k-sign-agreement-on-upcoming-deployment-of-hms-queen-elizabeth-with-american-f-35bs-destroyer"}, {"title": "Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth Will Drill with Japanese in Pacific During Deployment", "date": "2021-02-03", "content": "The Royal Navy's flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth is set to drill with Japanese maritime forces in the Pacific during its maiden deployment this spring, the U.K. Ministry of Defense announced on Wednesday.

The confirmation of the exercises between the two maritime forces comes as Japan and the U.K. have increased defense cooperation. The two have cooperated in hunting North Korean ships operating illegally and in 2019 entered into a trilateral naval cooperation agreement with the U.S. The drills also come as China has continued to expand maritime operations and taken a more assertive posture in the East and South China Seas. In response to Beijing's military expansion, over the last few years Japan has adjusted its pacifist constitution to allow for more multilateral cooperation.

After participating in workups last year aboard U.K. Royal Navy HMS Queen Elizabeth, the Marine Corps F-35B squadron and the Royal Air Force's 617 Squadron \"The Dambusters\" - 10 fighters with the Marines and eight with the Brits - will begin a seven-month deployment in May that will take them across the Indo-Pacific region with what the Marine Corps is calling \"the largest fifth-generation carrier air wing in the world.\" \"We have never seen a ship with 18 F-35s out there that is going to transverse half the world like we're going to do,\" Lt. Col. Andrew D'Ambrogi, the commanding officer of VMFA-211, told USNI News in a recent interview. \"It's a pretty bold statement. It's about power projection.\" While the two squadrons used last year's pre-deployment drills to show the two countries can operate and maintain the F-35B together from the British carrier, the Marines are hoping the deployment will also showcase what a large formation of F-35s is capable of. \"To have the opportunity to go to a ship - any ship, nonetheless a British ship that's designed for F-35 - is going to allow us the space and the mission sets to allow us to kind of really test what an entire F-35 squadron can do,\" D'Ambrogi said. \"So I'm very excited to gather that data and determine if we've got it right or give the feedback on how to make it better.\" In a news release this week detailing the deployment, the U.K. defense ministry emphasized the opportunities the multi-national carrier strike group will have to drill with other nations and the deployment's focus on the Indo-Pacific region. \"The forthcoming deployment will bolster already deep defence partnerships in the region, where the UK is committed to a more enduring regional defence and security presence,\" the release reads. \"Ships from the Carrier Strike Group will participate in Exercise Bersama Lima to mark the 50th anniversary of the Five Powers Defence Agreement between Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\" The deployment also provides a unique chance for the U.S. Marines and sailors to work with their British counterparts aboard an allied country's ship on Queen Elizabeth's maiden deployment. \"I'm most excited about training with the Brits and developing a relationship there and an understanding of how they fight. A lot of the tactics we use are standardized across the F-35 fleet, which is great, and that's going to set us up for a good baseline for success,\" Capt. Craig Turner, an F-35B pilot with VMFA-211, told USNI News. \"You can spend an entire career and not interact with some coalition partners.

Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 5 from Ronald Reagan is operating with CSG 1 from Carl Vinson for the first time during its 2021 deployment and marks the second time operating with UK CSG 21 and JS Ise this year. \"We are picking up right where we left off in 5th Fleet with the Queen Elizabeth team and building on what we started with the JMSDF after first leaving Japan,\" said Rear Adm. Will Pennington, commander, Carrier Strike Group 5/Task Force 70. \"Adding the fantastic Vinson team to this potent force dynamically displays our capabilities across all domains, keeping us ready to respond to a range of maritime challenges.\" The strike groups conducted flight operations and air defense exercise scenarios as well as simulated strikes against maritime targets. The operations brought together F/A-18 Super Hornets from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 aboard Ronald Reagan, along with F-35Bs from both Royal Air Force and U.S. Marines operating from Queen Elizabeth, and F-35Cs from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2 aboard Carl Vinson. \"Interoperability across air platforms, to include the addition of the Air Wing of the Future, is just one way we have integrated operations for enhanced lethality, readiness and maneuverability across our collective forces,\" said Rear Adm. Dan Martin, commander, Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG)/CSG 1. \"This is Carl Vinson strike group's fourth exercise with allies and partners since entering 7th Fleet, and we have continued to improve our ability to conduct prompt and sustained operations at sea with a more mobile, agile and flexible force. Through alliances and partnerships, we have developed the right operational concepts, plans, proficiencies and capabilities to bolster our maritime advantage.\" Vinson and UK CSG conducted joint interoperability flights together in 7th Fleet in August, the first time CSG-21 engaged with the F-35 \"C\" model, assigned to CVW-2. The two F-35B squadrons have been deployed together aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for her inaugural, global deployment, demonstrating the interoperability the F-35 provides. \"The UK Carrier Strike Group offers the largest 5th Generation air wing afloat today and working with our close allies to develop operating procedures and capabilities while concurrently showcasing the agility of land and carrier-based aviation in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates our commitment to the region,\" said Commodore Steve Moorhouse, OBE Royal Navy, Commander UK Carrier Strike Group. The training and events provided commanders the chance to practice capabilities across the maritime domain, as participating forces focused on anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine warfare tactics and procedures. \"In addition to the two carrier strike groups of the U.S. Navy, I feel very honored to be able to train with the Royal Navy's most advanced carrier strike group, which is an extremely valuable experience,\" said Rear Adm. KONNO Yasushige, Commander of JMSDF Escort Flotilla 2. \"Through this training, we enhanced our tactical skills and interoperability with the participating navies. In order to realize a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, the JMSDF will work closely with the naval forces of the U.S., Britain, the Netherlands, and Canada, which share the same objectives, to respond to global challenges and defend maritime order based on the rule of law.\"", "url": "https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/10/multiple-allied-carrier-strike-groups-operate-together-in-pacific/"}, {"title": "UK-Led Carrier Strike Group Completes Exercise Joint Warrior", "date": "2021-10-14", "content": "Aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and her UK-led Carrier Strike Group have completed NATO's largest annual exercise.

It was described by the Royal Navy at the time as the largest and most powerful European-led maritime force in almost 20 years. Two squadrons of F-35Bs embarked on the aircraft carrier for the exercise - the largest concentration of fighter jets to operate at sea from a Royal Navy carrier in almost 40 years. HMS Queen Elizabeth, which costs more than \u00a33bn and weighs 65,000 tonnes, is expected to deploy on operations for the first time in 2021. Her deployment from Portsmouth to form the Carrier Strike Group was delayed last month following cases of coronavirus among her crew. Both Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, will require escorts in the form of Carrier Strike Groups when they deploy on operational duties.

Ahead of a planned European deployment, Queen Elizabeth will step in for some of the stops for Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy said. \"In the coming months, HMS Queen Elizabeth will be at the heart of a powerful task group made up of thousands of sailors, up to ten ships, F-35B Lightning II jets, helicopter squadrons and Royal Marines Commandos which will operate across Europe this autumn,\" reads a statement from the Royal Navy. \"But the aircraft carrier will first deploy to the East Coast of the United States to undertake parts of HMS Prince of Wales' deployment - as her sister ship undergoes repairs.\" Shortly after Prince of Wales left for the East Coast in late August, the carrier's propulsion system was damaged and it limped back to port for repairs, canceling its U.S. stops that would have included F-35B qualifications and playing host for a defense conference in New York. The Royal Navy said a connection in the starboard drive shaft that links the carrier's prime movers to the props failed, resulting in major damage to the propulsion system. \"Royal Navy divers have inspected the starboard shaft of the ship and the adjacent areas. And they have confirmed that there is significant damage to the shaft and the propeller, and some superficial damage to the rudder, but no damage to the rest of the ship,\" Royal Navy Rear Adm. Steve Moorhouse said in a video posted on Twitter last week. \"Our initial assessment has shown that a coupling which joins the final two sections of the shaft has failed. Now this is an extremely unusual fault, and we continue to pursue or repair options. We're working to stabilize the shafts section and the propeller, after which the ship will return to Portsmouth. The ship will then probably need to enter a drydock as this will be the safest and quickest way to affect the repairs.\" The Royal Navy is now preparing to fix Prince of Wales. Queen Elizabeth completed its inaugural deployment to the Western Pacific last year with a mixed air wing of U.K. and U.S. Marines F-35Bs and an international group of escorts to include USS The Sullivans (DDG-68) and Dutch frigate HNLMS Evertsen (F805). The next deployment will focus on Europe. \"Queen Elizabeth will primarily be focused on operations in the Baltic and work closely with forces from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden,\" reads the statement. \"Together, these nations form the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, which is designed to react to crises whenever and wherever they unfold.\"", "url": "https://news.usni.org/2022/09/07/hms-queen-elizabeth-departs-u-k-to-sub-for-damaged-hms-prince-of-wales-in-east-coast-tour"}]}]
