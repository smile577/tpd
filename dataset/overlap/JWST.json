An array of 244,800 miniature trap doors that open and close to let in the light will allow the telescope to observe hundreds of objects simultaneously, say its creators. After launch in 2013, JWST will be studying the formation of the universe's first stars and galaxies. \"The objects are very far away and very faint,\" says Matthew Greenhouse, project scientist for the telescope's science instruments at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, US. To see faint and faraway bodies, scientists have to block out light from brighter, nearer objects. That is already possible on the ground at telescopes such as the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, but the methods used on Earth would not be feasible for a space telescope. Some Earth-based instruments have robot arms that position hundreds of optical fibres so that each fibre catches the light from an individual star or galaxy, and then feeds it to a detector. It would be difficult to develop robots to do the same thing for the JWST, as they would have to operate at just 30\u00b0 above absolute zero. The telescope will operate in the infrared range, so it has to be kept that cold to avoid contaminating the results with its own heat emissions. Open and shut case. So the JWST team modified an older method to control light filtering, in which lasers drill holes in opaque plates to match star fields. Those plates are then manually put over an instrument to block out unwanted light. JWST's micro-shutters, which measure just 100 microns by 200 microns each, would work somewhat like that, with the shutters individually opening and closing to create the equivalent of a new plate. Four arrays of these micro shutters will cover the European Space Agency's Near Infrared Spectrograph instrument. The shutters are flipped open by a magnet, then selected doors are locked open with an electrostatic charge before the magnet moves on. They might each have to open and close 60,000 times over the 10-year lifetime of the telescope. In this NASA video, Murzy Jhabvala, chief engineer of the instrument technology and systems division, opens and closes some of the micro-shutters with a magnet. Frightening gamble. It was not always clear that the micro-shutters would work, as the concept had to be designed from scratch. Last year, JWST officials were still concerned that the technology would not be ready in time for the 2013 launch (see Rush to build threatens Hubble successor). \"The fact that we were developing this in the context of a major mission was the frightening part,\" says Harvey Moseley, who created the shutters at Goddard, \"but the fact that it offers such a huge benefit for the most fundamental science projects of the telescope is what I think made this gamble worth it.\" The development team have managed to catch up, and last month the shutter array passed tests to show that they will stand up to the physical stresses of launch and the deep-space environment. An independent board will hold a review next week to assess the readiness of different components of the telescope, including the shutters. \"They're exactly where they should be at this point in the mission,\" Greenhouse told New Scientist.

It will measure 24m (80ft) long by 12m (40ft) high and incorporate a hexagonal mirror 6.5m (21.3ft) in diameter, almost three times the size of Hubble's. Hubble, launched in 1990, has sent back pictures of our solar system, distant stars, and remote fledgling galaxies formed not long after the Big Bang. But scientists say the JWST will enable them to look deeper into space and even further back at the origins of the Universe. \"Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the Universe,\" said Edward Weiler, director of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. Martin Mohan of Northrop Grumman, the contractor building the telescope, said that the team was making excellent progress. \"There's engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch,\" he said. When ready, the JWST will be launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. It is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. Until then, the 17-year-old Hubble telescope will continue to do its work. Nasa plans to send astronauts on the space shuttle to service it in 2008.

The U.S. space agency made the announcement May 10 during the unveiling of a full-scale model of the JWST on the National Mall here. Billed as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST is slated to launch in mid-2013. By the time it is fully expanded as it is deployed at a gravitationally stable spot some 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, the spacecraft will be about the length of a tennis court. Building, launching and operating the infrared telescope for 10 years is expected to cost $4.5 billion, making it the most expensive science mission NASA has in development. \"We cannot make the James Webb Space Telescope fully serviceable like the Hubble because that would cost so much money that I don't think this country could afford it,\" said Edward Weiler, director of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Greenbelt, Md., facility in charge of the Webb telescope. \"However, what if you have a bad day when you put this thing a million miles out and everything folds out except for an antenna ... it gets stuck? Or a solar panel doesn't fold out completely, and you say, 'gee, I wish we could send an astronaut just to give it a kick'?\" Weiler said NASA Administrator Mike Griffin asked the James Webb team two years ago to examine whether it was worthwhile to design the telescope to accommodate a visit from Orion. According to Weiler, it is. \"We are going to design for the James Webb Space Telescope a little ring that the Crew Exploration Vehicle could dock with so if we had a bad day the astronauts could go out to James Webb and do minimal, gross things,\" he said. \"They couldn't replace instruments, they couldn't change out things, but they could fix things that were obviously wrong.\" Weiler said it is his hope and expectation that an astronaut service call never proves necessary. That point was seconded by Martin Mohan, the JWST program manager at Redondo Beach, Calif.-based Northrop Grumman Space Technology. \"We are spending a great deal of time in testing to make sure that JWST deploys reliably on orbit,\" Mohan said. \"That is one of the core competencies of Northrop Grumman Space Technology. That was, we believe, one of the factors in our selection. That doesn't mean we take it lightly in any stretch of the imagination.\" The decision to add a docking ring to the Webb telescope was news to Griffin. Asked about it May 16, he said: \"A year or two ago I asked people if it wouldn't be smart to at least have some capability to dock Orion with James Webb such that if people wanted to service it, they could do so. It only seems to me to make sense to not preclude that. I didn't tell them to do it. So if they are doing it, they must have studied it and come to the conclusion that it is a worthwhile thing to do.\" Meanwhile, a NASA review board recently determined that all 10 new technologies key to the success of the JWST are mature enough to move into the detailed engineering phase of the program. Among those new technologies are near-infrared detectors, sunshield materials and lightweight cryogenic mirrors. \"The invention is done more than six years ahead of launch,\" Mohan said. \"That's an unprecedented achievement.\" Weiler agreed, saying that Hubble's launch was delayed several years because its enabling technologies were not ready, adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of the project. Mohan said that thanks to the new technologies, Webb's 6.5-meter mirror will weigh only half of what Hubble's mirror weighs yet will provide nine times as much light-collecting power. The Ball Aerospace-designed mirror, which is already in fabrication, consists of 18 separate segments that will be unfolded during deployment and held in place by composite structures developed by Minneapolis-based Alliant Techsystems. Weiler said the JWST has met every budget and technical milestone in the 20 months since NASA restructured the project, delaying its launch two years and adding $1 billion to the life-cycle cost estimate. The project's next major review is slated for March 2008. As expensive as JWST might seem, Weiler said, when all is said and done it will cost roughly half of what NASA has spent on Hubble - about $7 billion to $8 billion adjusted for inflation and measured according to the same accounting methods that govern Webb.

Northrop Grumman Corporation is leading the design and development effort for the space agency's Goddard Space Flight Center. The mirror segment, an engineering development unit, was successfully polished to an accuracy of less than 20 nanometers, or smaller than a millionth of an inch. The process, called cryo-null figuring, ensures that when the mirror reaches cryogenic temperatures, it will change its shape into the exact optical prescription needed for its mission. The polishing and ambient testing took place at Tinsley Laboratories, Inc. in Richmond, Calif. \"This milestone marks the culmination of an intensive six-year manufacturing effort,\" said Scott Willoughby, Webb telescope Program Manager for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems sector. \"To produce these unmatched precision optics, the manufacturing team has worked extremely hard, inventing systems and processes along the way to meet tremendously rigorous specifications.\" \"This is a tremendously important milestone to the JWST project that bodes well for both our future mirror manufacturing schedule and for the potential performance capabilities of the telescope,\" said Lee Feinberg, James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. The development unit, which will be used as a spare, was sent to Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colo. where actuators were added. The mirror assembly is now being verified at cryogenic temperatures in the X-ray and Cryogenic Facility (XRCF) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The development mirror will be closely followed by the \"A1\" flight mirror, the first of the actual mirror segments that will fly on the telescope. The second batch of three flight mirror segments is due to Tinsley next month. \"In addition to the milestone verification test of an engineering development unit, which is an \"A\" segment spare, five flight mirror segments will be tested for the first time in the XRCF this month,\" said Helen J. Cole, Webb Telescope Activities Project Manager at NASA Marshall. When the primary mirror is integrated, it will include 18 flight segments altogether. There are three different shapes of segments that fit together to make up the primary mirror. Of the 18 segments, 6 are \"A\" segments, 6 are \"B\" segments and 6 are \"C\" segments. The XRCF test will be the first cryogenic test to collect data for all three types of primary segments being fabricated. Manufacturing began six years ago, led by Northrop Grumman's principal optical contractor Ball Aerospace. Brush Wellman in Elmore, Ohio, made twenty-one 500-lb. hexagonal mirror blanks from beryllium, an extremely strong, lightweight metal. Axsys Technologies in Cullman, Ala., machined the backside of the beryllium blanks and chemically etched them into an isogrid pattern that reduced mirror mass by 92 percent, from 553 pounds to 46 pounds (250 kg to 21 kg). The front side of the mirror blank was machined to prep the optical surface for high precision grinding, polishing and testing, which is being done by Tinsley. The mirror segments have undergone a series of polishing and cryotesting cycles. Ball incorporates the mirrors into optical assemblies, which are mounted on the telescope structure. The James Webb Space Telescope is the next-generation premier space observatory, exploring deep space phenomena from distant galaxies to nearby planets and stars. The Webb Telescope will give scientists clues about the formation of the universe and the evolution of our own solar system, from the first light after the Big Bang to the formation of star systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth.

Forinstance, complete passive cooling, in which refrigerants aren't used to keeptemperatures down, is new to the field of telescopes and should keep JWST alivefor its mission lifetime of no less than five and a half years, with anoptimistic goal of 10 years, Clampin said. The other infrared observatoriesrelied on cryogens, such as liquid nitrogen or liquid helium as their primarymeans of cooling, Clampin said. \"Theadvantage of that is it gives you a pretty long lifetime for the telescope,\"Clampin told SPACE.com, referring to the no-refrigerant approach forJWST. \"The other approach is to put a telescope in a big fridge and fill itwith coolant but that coolant slowly boils off and you have a limited life.\" Due to itssize, the sun shield will have to be compactly folded, much like a parachute,around the telescope in order to fit into its launch rocket. \"Therehave been a lot of missions that have unfolded large antenna,\" Clampinsaid. \"To our knowledge it's one of the first missions where we areunfolding a really big membrane.\" And so theengineers had to figure out how to fold the coated membranes, which make up the layers of thesun shield, to make sure they didn't get tangled upon opening and so that theunfolding didn't rub off any of the coatings, Clampin said. Once theshield and the rest of the telescope are on their way to final orbit, engineersat Northrop Grumman will issue commands to the Webb Telescope to unfold the sunshield.

Because it has achieved thermal, deployment, and stray-light targets, the sunshield is now ready for manufacturing. The shield will be about the size of a regulation tennis court, says NASA; a regulation tennis court is 23.8 x 11.0 meters in size. One-third-scale membranes have already been fabricated and have undergone inspection at Nexolve (Huntsville, AL). Sunshield manufacturing and test plans were also evaluated and approved as part of the review, which took place Jan. 11 through 14 at Northrop Grumman's space systems manufacturing facility (Redondo Beach, CA). \"This is the first time a sunshield of this size and complexity will fly on a space telescope,\" said Scott Willoughby, JWST program manager for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. In preparation for the design review, 18 separate subassembly design audits were conducted on the sunshield's extremely complex system of latches, tensioners, spreader bars, and telescoping boom assemblies. The goal was to validate these subassemblies at the system level and evaluate points where they interface. A first time for everything. \"There are no textbooks or guidelines on how to design and build a deployable sunshield of this size,\" said Keith Parrish, JWST sunshield manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD). \"Nearly a decade ago, NASA and Northrop Grumman had to start from scratch and literally invent the techniques, materials, and mechanisms needed to do the job. We still have quite the challenge in front of us now that we start into the fabrication and testing phase but it's also a very exciting time.\" Each of the sunshield's five membrane layers is from 0.001 to 0.002 in. thick and is made of Kapton. The layers are separated from each other and held in place by spreader bars and deployable booms. The sunshield will absorb and deflect solar light to keep the telescope and its IR detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures; the aim is to shield the JWST not just from the Sun, but from the Earth and Moon as well.

The mirror assembly is now being verified at cryogenic temperatures in the X-ray and Cryogenic Facility (XRCF) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The development mirror will be closely followed by the \"A1\" flight mirror, the first of the actual mirror segments that will fly on the telescope. The second batch of three flight mirror segments is due to Tinsley next month. \"In addition to the milestone verification test of an engineering development unit, which is an \"A\" segment spare, five flight mirror segments will be tested for the first time in the XRCF this month,\" said Helen J. Cole, Webb Telescope Activities Project Manager at NASA Marshall. When the primary mirror is integrated, it will include 18 flight segments altogether. There are three different shapes of segments that fit together to make up the primary mirror. Of the 18 segments, 6 are \"A\" segments, 6 are \"B\" segments and 6 are \"C\" segments. The XRCF test will be the first cryogenic test to collect data for all three types of primary segments being fabricated. Manufacturing began six years ago, led by Northrop Grumman's principal optical contractor Ball Aerospace. Brush Wellman in Elmore, Ohio, made twenty-one 500-lb. hexagonal mirror blanks from beryllium, an extremely strong, lightweight metal. Axsys Technologies in Cullman, Ala., machined the backside of the beryllium blanks and chemically etched them into an isogrid pattern that reduced mirror mass by 92 percent, from 553 pounds to 46 pounds (250 kg to 21 kg). The front side of the mirror blank was machined to prep the optical surface for high precision grinding, polishing and testing, which is being done by Tinsley. The mirror segments have undergone a series of polishing and cryotesting cycles. Ball incorporates the mirrors into optical assemblies, which are mounted on the telescope structure.", "url": "https://spaceref.com/press-release/james-webb-space-telescopes-first-primary-mirror-segment-meets-flight-specifications-achieves-significant-milestone/"}, {"title": "James Webb Space Telescope sunshield is ready to fabricate", "date": "2010-02-04", "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST's) five-layer sunshield has passed its critical design review, meaning that its design is complete and meets mission requirements.

NASA's James Webb Space Telescope can launch no earlier than September 2015 and will cost at least $6.5 billion, the panel concluded in a report released yesterday. That puts the telescope billed as the muscular successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope at least $1.5 billion over budget and more than a year behind schedule. In a piece of good news, the panel found no fault with JWST's scientific progress, instead hailing its promise to become the world's next great space observatory. \"It has to do with the management and budgetary aspects of the project, not the technical aspects,\" panel chair John Casani, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told reporters yesterday. \"There was just not enough money in the budget to execute the work required.\" Problems at the start. The James Webb Space Telescope, led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., has huge light-collecting power. Its primary mirror is 21 feet wide more than twice as big as Hubble's. While orbiting about 1 million miles from Earth, JWST will scan the universe in infrared light, helping astronomers study the early days of the universe, the formation of alien star systems and much more, NASA officials have said. \"James Webb is a hugely more powerful facility than Hubble,\" said review panel member Garth Illingworth of the University of California Observatories. \"It's 100 times more powerful, at least.\" For its report, the review panel only considered what has gone wrong with the JWST project since 2008, when the telescope passed all of its preliminary design reviews and NASA formally committed to build it. But the project has been underpriced from its inception, the panelists said. JWST was named the top research priority by the 2001 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey, a report put out every 10 years by the U.S. National Research Council. The decadal survey pegged JWST's total cost at around $1 billion. While such a number may never have been achievable decadal surveys have issued some overly rosy budget prognostications through the years ? JWST's costs have undeniably exploded. In its budget request for fiscal year 2011, NASA estimated the telescope would cost $5 billion over its lifetime, from design and development through the end of its operational life. The space agency requested $445 million for JWST just for 2011. The telescope eats up about 40 percent of NASA's astrophysics division budget by itself, according to the review panel. What went wrong? Costs have continued to rise because the budget ? the one the JWST project office gave to NASA when it officially committed to build the telescope in 2008 ? was too low, Casani said. And the problem was never fixed because NASA headquarters didn't realize there was a problem. These issues are indicative of broader problems, the review panel concluded. \"The institutional cost and program analysis capability at the Directorate and Agency level continues to function without the skill and authority required,\" Casani wrote in a letter to NASA Administrator Charles Bolden after the panel completed its review. \"Demand for corrective action was absent, and poor management practices on the JWST Project went unquestioned for too long.\" While the panel said that there was no way to reduce JWST's price tag below $6.5 billion at this point, it issued several recommendations to make the project leaner and more efficient in the future. The panel suggested, for example, that the JWST program be restructured to improve accounting of costs and risks, and to give NASA's associate administrator stronger oversight capabilities. NASA officials said they will take the panel's findings to heart, and that they have already implemented some of the recommendations. \"The report was very helpful in pointing out our flaws, and we intend to fix those,\" said Chris Scolese, NASA associate administrator. \"We welcome the attention and the involvement.\" Scolese added that NASA has already reorganized JWST, elevating it to a program that will report directly to him ? and that JWST team members will do so several times per week. And he said that NASA's Bolden is fully briefed and actively involved. \"The administrator is taking this very seriously,\" Scolese said. Despite JWST's problems, the panel lauded the telescope's tremendous scientific potential, stressing that it will provide huge payoffs once it gets off the ground. \"This is an absolutely outstanding technical and scientific endeavor,\" Casani said. \"This is a tough job, but it's just the kind of job NASA was created for, and just the kind of job NASA should be doing.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/9510-nasa-webb-space-telescope-mired-budget-woes-start.html"}]}, [], {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Chief to Congress: Save the James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2011-07-13", "content": "NASA chief Charlie Bolden went to bat for the agency's imperiled next-generation space telescope Tuesday, telling members of Congress that the instrument has greater potential for discovery than the iconic Hubble Space Telescope.

The review panel, led by John Casani of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said the JWST program would need cash infusions of $250 million in both 2011 and 2012 to be ready to launch by 2015 - a year later than NASA's official launch date at the time. NASA did not receive the proposed cash infusion in 2011 and did not request it for 2012.

The report triggered the NASA replanning exercise, but the agency up to now had been mum about how much the JWST program would ultimately cost. Citing JWST's chronic cost- growth problems, the House Appropriations Committee in July recommended canceling the program in its version of the 2012 NASA spending bill. Rep.

Wolf subsequently put that cost estimate as high as $8.7 billion. The Senate has yet to weigh in with its version of the 2012 NASA spending bill. NASA, meanwhile, is not saying how it plans to funnel the necessary extra funds to the Webb program, which previously was part of the agency's Astrophysics Division funding account.

NASA still envisions launching the telescope aboard a European rocket in October 2018, according to the report. For 2012 through 2016, JWST will need a total of nearly $3.1 billion, or about $1.2 billion more than the White House previously budgeted for the project for that five-year period. For 2012, the report says, JWST will need $527.6 million, or about $154 million more than the White House requested for the project next year. Under the revised plan, JWST spending would peak at $659.1 million in 2014 before declining over the following two years. NASA has already increased JWST's 2011 funding by $44 million \"without significant impact to other science projects,\" the breach report says. NASA science missions slated to launch several years from now, however, will not be so lucky. \"The impacts being assessed in Science would delay some future missions, which are currently planned for launch beyond 2015.\" Paying for JWST also will entail cutting back the agency's Cross-Agency Support budget to its 2010 level, a reduction the report says will require the agency's field centers to layoff approximately 360 on-site support contractors nationwide.

Howard said NASA delivered the 10-page breach report to U.S. lawmakers Oct. 24. In the report, NASA also acknowledged for the first time that building and operating the long-delayed flagship telescope for five years will now cost $8.835 billion, or about $100 million more than the agency conceded in August. NASA still envisions launching the telescope aboard a European rocket in October 2018, according to the report. For 2012 through 2016, JWST will need a total of nearly $3.1 billion, or about $1.2 billion more than the White House previously budgeted for the project for that five-year period. For 2012, the report says, JWST will need $527.6 million, or about $154 million more than the White House requested for the project next year. Under the revised plan, JWST spending would peak at $659.1 million in 2014 before declining over the following two years. NASA has already increased JWST's 2011 funding by $44 million \"without significant impact to other science projects,\" the breach report says. NASA science missions slated to launch several years from now, however, will not be so lucky. \"The impacts being assessed in Science would delay some future missions, which are currently planned for launch beyond 2015.\" Paying for JWST also will entail cutting back the agency's Cross-Agency Support budget to its 2010 level, a reduction the report says will require the agency's field centers to layoff approximately 360 on-site support contractors nationwide. The Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA included a $8 billion cap on JWST development costs as a condition of restoring funds for the telescope that were deleted by the House in its 2012 NASA spending plan.

JWST isn't your average 'scope. Instead of a single, monolithic mirror, it will have 18 hexagonal segments that will fit together, working as a unit to focus infrared light from distant astronomical objects. Each segment is about 1.5 meters across, and will have actuators behind them to control exactly how the submirrors are aimed. On the front, each mirror is coated in a very thin layer of gold, which is an excellent reflector of IR light. The mirrors were made at the Ball Aerospace facilities in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado. Ball threw a celebration to mark the mirrors' completion, and invited a few press folks along. That included me! We went on a tour, and saw one of the mirrors - it was in a \"clean room\" to keep dust and other contaminants out. But we could see it through a door... and here it is: Yes, that's me reflected in one of JWST's flight mirrors! That was pretty cool. Looking a picture of a mirror can be difficult when you're trying to see the mirror itself. Here's another shot that makes it more obvious. The mirrors is tilted up, and the dark band running through it is the reflection of the top of the stand it's mounted in. Their mirror itself is the gold hexagon. I got a good look at it, and it's no small thing for me to say its the cleanest mirror I've ever seen. I've been around a few 'scopes in my time and their mirrors always have some schmutz on them. This had none. The figure of each mirror is incredibly accurate: the bumps in the surface are on average smaller than 25 nanometers. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter... to give you an idea of how small this is, a typical human hair is 400 times thicker than the deformities in the mirror. As one person mentioned to me while we were gawking at the facilities, if a bacterium fell on the surface, it would far and away be the biggest thing on the mirror. So yeah, these things are smooooth. The mirrors need to be this smooth to accurately reflect light. Any nonconformity would scatter light a little bit, messing up the telescope's resolution. I'll add that mirrors like this - the size they are, made of beryllium, figured to this accuracy - have never been accomplished before. And that's only part of it, since of course all 18 mirrors must act as one once JWST is in orbit. We were shown a room with the tanks containing the completed mirrors, laid out on the floor in the same configuration they'll be in the telescope itself: As you can see, there's an inner ring of hexagonal mirror segments and another ring outside those. Each individual mirror will focus light into another mirror, called the secondary, that will be mounted in front of them that'll help you see this). That will in turn reflect the light into a third mirror, which will then send the light from distant stars and galaxies into one of four main cameras. And from there, we'll learn a lot about how the Universe works. To give you an idea of how big this assembly is, I've inset a diagram comparing JWST's mirror size to Hubble's. Hubble's mirror is 2.4 meters across - about 8 feet. JWST's mirror will be over 6 meters across - about 20 feet. It will be able to collect far more light than Hubble, and see fainter objects. I've written quite a bit about JWST recent times. My opinions are conflicted and here, and most recently here, but hopefully clear: I think this is a worthy project to do, but it has been plagued with cost overruns and is way behind schedule. It was originally supposed to launch in 2009 and cost less than a billion dollars; now it will launch no sooner than 2018 and the cost is estimated at $8 billion. This has put a huge amount of strain on NASA and other missions, both economically and politically. That money had to come from somewhere, so other missions have suffered to sustain JWST. I'm hoping that most of that is behind us now. NASA is supporting the telescope, and Congress has given them enough money, hopefully, to complete it. I'll note that Hubble itself had a history very similar to this: over budget, behind schedule, putting huge strains on relationships in the astronomical community. And now, of course, when people think of Hubble it's with admiration - deservedly - for what it's accomplished. That may yet happen with JWST as well. Once it's up and running, we'll move on and see what a magnificent machine it is. But I also hope very much that NASA, Congress, and the astronomical community have learned the lesson of their big observatories. These missions need tighter and more realistic management if they are to be built within reasonable parameters, and not deleteriously affect other important missions. It's something ... we should all reflect on.

Send-off ceremonies held here at Ball Aerospace on Aug. 15 saluted the completion of 18 beryllium primary mirror segments for the James Webb Space Telescope, which is billed as the successor to NASA's venerable Hubble Space Telescope. Ball is also responsible for JWST's secondary and tertiary mirrors, a fine steering mirror assembly and several engineering development units. Ball is the principal subcontractor to manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the JWST optical technology and lightweight mirror system at the heart of the telescope - an astronomical project that is now pegged to cost roughly $8.7 billion and to be lofted in the fall of 2018. Success story. The JWST mirror system includes 18 gold-coated, ultrasmooth, 4.2-foot hexagonal mirror segments that comprise the 21.3-foot primary mirror. When launched, it will be the largest mirror ever flown in space. Down on the floor where the packaged mirrors are ready for shipping to NASA, labels such as \"do not stack...this side up\" and \"critical space flight hardware\" are visible. A folding scheme allows the primary mirror segments to fit atop Europe's Ariane 5 launcher for their eventual unfolding in space. Aligning the mirror segments and adjusting the primary mirror's curvature will occur over approximately two months. It has taken about eight years to complete the fabrication of the mirrors, said Paul Lightsey, a Ball mission systems engineer for the optical system on JWST. \"We actually have a real nice success story,\" Lightsey told SPACE.com. \"We've been able to show how long it took to polish the first mirror, then each successive mirror. By the time we got up to the later mirrors, we were taking half the time than it took for the first mirror.\" Working together as one mirror, those 18 beryllium mirror segments are adjusted by computer-controlled actuators. They adjust each of the mirror segments to correct any errors and are key to giving JWST the power to produce high-quality, sharp images. \"One of the difficulties in making mirrors is to make the curvature exactly what you want,\" Lightsey said. JWST's mirrors can be pushed and pulled a little to get the curvature right, as well as moved up, down and sideways, he said. Lifetime at L2. Allison Barto, JWST program manager at Ball Aerospace, said the beryllium mirrors couldn't be too heavy. \"We had to take out over 90 percent of the material in the back of the mirrors to make them light enough to launch 18 of them into space,\" she said. Since JWST is an infrared telescope, the mirrors and actuators must function at temperatures as low as minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightsey said the JWST project is set to be a five-year mission, but has a goal of 10 years beyond commissioning. Outfitted with a five-layer sunshield, JWST will operate at supercold temperatures at a spot about 930,000 miles from Earth known as Lagrange Point 2, or L2. At L2, the balance of gravitational pull means that the telescope will keep up with the Earth as it goes around the sun. The gravitational forces of the sun and the Earth can nearly hold a spacecraft at this point, so that it takes relatively little rocket thrust to keep the spacecraft in orbit around L2. JWST's to-do list. JWST should help scientists search for the first light after the Big Bang, determine how galaxies evolved and observe the birth of stars and protoplanetary systems, NASA officials have said. But JWST's astronomical to-do list now includes eyeing alien planets, too.. The instrument will also investigate the properties of planetary systems and, perhaps, the origins of life. \"That wasn't part of the original plan ... but this instrument can look at planets orbiting other suns,\" said Blake Bullock in JWST business development at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the huge spacecraft. The telescope has the ability to look for biomarkers, such as water in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another sun, she said. \"It's not going to give you the pale blue dot ... but it could give you a squiggly line that says there might be carbon ... there might be an ocean,\" Bullock said. Geoff Yoder, NASA's JWST program manager, told SPACE.com that the telescope is on track for an October 2018 liftoff. Still to come, however, are key integration tests of the fully assembled and instrumented observatory. Yoder said work has been completed this month on an Apollo-era test chamber at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, modified to test the integrated JWST at cryogenic temperatures - at minus 424 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Back to the beginning of time. Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, noted the size of JWST. \"Hubble is the size of a school bus,\" Mountain said. \"JWST is the size of a tennis court.\" JWST's mirrors are so flat that if you stretch them all out across the United States, \"the largest bump would be no bigger than two inches. That's how smooth these mirrors are,\" Mountain added. NASA's chief scientist, Waleed Abdalati, underscored JWST's future abilities. \"The things that are blurring to Hubble will be in sharp focus.

The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) will allow scientists to study cold and distant objects in greater detail than ever before. MIRI arrived at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. on May 29. It has been undergoing inspection before being integrated into Webb's science instrument payload known as the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM). Assembled at and shipped from the Science and Technology Facilities Council's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom, MIRI was developed by a consortium of 10 European institutions and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and delivered by the European Space Agency. George Rieke, MIRI science team lead at the University of Arizona, Tucson, noted, \"MIRI is the first Webb instrument to be delivered, the result of teamwork in the U.S. and internationally.\" MIRI will observe light with wavelengths in the mid-infrared range of 5 microns to 28 microns, which is a longer wavelength than human eyes can detect. It is the only instrument of the four with this particular ability to observe the physical processes occurring in the cosmos. \"MIRI will enable Webb to distinguish the oldest galaxies from more evolved objects that have undergone several cycles of star birth and death,\" said Matt Greenhouse, ISIM project scientist at Goddard. \"MIRI also will provide a unique window into the birth places of stars which are typically enshrouded by dust that shorter wavelength light cannot penetrate.\" MIRI's sensitive detectors will allow it to observe light, cool stars in very distant galaxies; unveil newly forming stars within our Milky Way; find signatures of the formation of planets around stars other than our own; and take imagery and spectroscopy of planets, comets and the outermost bits of debris in our solar system. MIRI's images will enable scientists to study an object's shape and structure. \"MIRI will help us understand what's out there at the edge of what we can see,\" said Mike Ressler, the instrument's project scientist at JPL. \"The shorter-wavelength instruments will discover the glow of the farthest known objects, but we need MIRI to help identify what they are -- supermassive black holes, newborn galaxies or something we've never seen before.\" The most powerful space telescope ever built, Webb is the successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.

JWST isn't your average 'scope. Instead of a single, monolithic mirror, it will have 18 hexagonal segments that will fit together, working as a unit to focus infrared light from distant astronomical objects. Each segment is about 1.5 meters across, and will have actuators behind them to control exactly how the submirrors are aimed. On the front, each mirror is coated in a very thin layer of gold, which is an excellent reflector of IR light. The mirrors were made at the Ball Aerospace facilities in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado. Ball threw a celebration to mark the mirrors' completion, and invited a few press folks along. That included me! We went on a tour, and saw one of the mirrors - it was in a \"clean room\" to keep dust and other contaminants out.

Looking a picture of a mirror can be difficult when you're trying to see the mirror itself. Here's another shot that makes it more obvious.

The mirrors were made at the Ball Aerospace facilities in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado. Ball threw a celebration to mark the mirrors' completion, and invited a few press folks along. That included me! We went on a tour, and saw one of the mirrors - it was in a \"clean room\" to keep dust and other contaminants out. But we could see it through a door... and here it is: Yes, that's me reflected in one of JWST's flight mirrors! That was pretty cool. Looking a picture of a mirror can be difficult when you're trying to see the mirror itself. Here's another shot that makes it more obvious. The mirrors is tilted up, and the dark band running through it is the reflection of the top of the stand it's mounted in. Their mirror itself is the gold hexagon. I got a good look at it, and it's no small thing for me to say its the cleanest mirror I've ever seen. I've been around a few 'scopes in my time and their mirrors always have some schmutz on them. This had none. The figure of each mirror is incredibly accurate: the bumps in the surface are on average smaller than 25 nanometers. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter... to give you an idea of how small this is, a typical human hair is 400 times thicker than the deformities in the mirror. As one person mentioned to me while we were gawking at the facilities, if a bacterium fell on the surface, it would far and away be the biggest thing on the mirror. So yeah, these things are smooooth. The mirrors need to be this smooth to accurately reflect light. Any nonconformity would scatter light a little bit, messing up the telescope's resolution. I'll add that mirrors like this - the size they are, made of beryllium, figured to this accuracy - have never been accomplished before. And that's only part of it, since of course all 18 mirrors must act as one once JWST is in orbit. We were shown a room with the tanks containing the completed mirrors, laid out on the floor in the same configuration they'll be in the telescope itself: As you can see, there's an inner ring of hexagonal mirror segments and another ring outside those. Each individual mirror will focus light into another mirror, called the secondary, that will be mounted in front of them that'll help you see this). That will in turn reflect the light into a third mirror, which will then send the light from distant stars and galaxies into one of four main cameras. And from there, we'll learn a lot about how the Universe works. To give you an idea of how big this assembly is, I've inset a diagram comparing JWST's mirror size to Hubble's. Hubble's mirror is 2.4 meters across - about 8 feet. JWST's mirror will be over 6 meters across - about 20 feet. It will be able to collect far more light than Hubble, and see fainter objects. I've written quite a bit about JWST recent times. My opinions are conflicted and here, and most recently here, but hopefully clear: I think this is a worthy project to do, but it has been plagued with cost overruns and is way behind schedule. It was originally supposed to launch in 2009 and cost less than a billion dollars; now it will launch no sooner than 2018 and the cost is estimated at $8 billion. This has put a huge amount of strain on NASA and other missions, both economically and politically. That money had to come from somewhere, so other missions have suffered to sustain JWST. I'm hoping that most of that is behind us now. NASA is supporting the telescope, and Congress has given them enough money, hopefully, to complete it. I'll note that Hubble itself had a history very similar to this: over budget, behind schedule, putting huge strains on relationships in the astronomical community. And now, of course, when people think of Hubble it's with admiration - deservedly - for what it's accomplished. That may yet happen with JWST as well. Once it's up and running, we'll move on and see what a magnificent machine it is. But I also hope very much that NASA, Congress, and the astronomical community have learned the lesson of their big observatories. These missions need tighter and more realistic management if they are to be built within reasonable parameters, and not deleteriously affect other important missions. It's something ... we should all reflect on.

Send-off ceremonies held here at Ball Aerospace on Aug. 15 saluted the completion of 18 beryllium primary mirror segments for the James Webb Space Telescope, which is billed as the successor to NASA's venerable Hubble Space Telescope. Ball is also responsible for JWST's secondary and tertiary mirrors, a fine steering mirror assembly and several engineering development units. Ball is the principal subcontractor to manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the JWST optical technology and lightweight mirror system at the heart of the telescope - an astronomical project that is now pegged to cost roughly $8.7 billion and to be lofted in the fall of 2018. Success story. The JWST mirror system includes 18 gold-coated, ultrasmooth, 4.2-foot hexagonal mirror segments that comprise the 21.3-foot primary mirror. When launched, it will be the largest mirror ever flown in space. Down on the floor where the packaged mirrors are ready for shipping to NASA, labels such as \"do not stack...this side up\" and \"critical space flight hardware\" are visible. A folding scheme allows the primary mirror segments to fit atop Europe's Ariane 5 launcher for their eventual unfolding in space. Aligning the mirror segments and adjusting the primary mirror's curvature will occur over approximately two months. It has taken about eight years to complete the fabrication of the mirrors, said Paul Lightsey, a Ball mission systems engineer for the optical system on JWST. \"We actually have a real nice success story,\" Lightsey told SPACE.com. \"We've been able to show how long it took to polish the first mirror, then each successive mirror. By the time we got up to the later mirrors, we were taking half the time than it took for the first mirror.\" Working together as one mirror, those 18 beryllium mirror segments are adjusted by computer-controlled actuators. They adjust each of the mirror segments to correct any errors and are key to giving JWST the power to produce high-quality, sharp images. \"One of the difficulties in making mirrors is to make the curvature exactly what you want,\" Lightsey said. JWST's mirrors can be pushed and pulled a little to get the curvature right, as well as moved up, down and sideways, he said. Lifetime at L2. Allison Barto, JWST program manager at Ball Aerospace, said the beryllium mirrors couldn't be too heavy. \"We had to take out over 90 percent of the material in the back of the mirrors to make them light enough to launch 18 of them into space,\" she said. Since JWST is an infrared telescope, the mirrors and actuators must function at temperatures as low as minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightsey said the JWST project is set to be a five-year mission, but has a goal of 10 years beyond commissioning. Outfitted with a five-layer sunshield, JWST will operate at supercold temperatures at a spot about 930,000 miles from Earth known as Lagrange Point 2, or L2. At L2, the balance of gravitational pull means that the telescope will keep up with the Earth as it goes around the sun. The gravitational forces of the sun and the Earth can nearly hold a spacecraft at this point, so that it takes relatively little rocket thrust to keep the spacecraft in orbit around L2. JWST's to-do list. JWST should help scientists search for the first light after the Big Bang, determine how galaxies evolved and observe the birth of stars and protoplanetary systems, NASA officials have said. But JWST's astronomical to-do list now includes eyeing alien planets, too.. The instrument will also investigate the properties of planetary systems and, perhaps, the origins of life. \"That wasn't part of the original plan ... but this instrument can look at planets orbiting other suns,\" said Blake Bullock in JWST business development at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the huge spacecraft. The telescope has the ability to look for biomarkers, such as water in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another sun, she said. \"It's not going to give you the pale blue dot ... but it could give you a squiggly line that says there might be carbon ... there might be an ocean,\" Bullock said. Geoff Yoder, NASA's JWST program manager, told SPACE.com that the telescope is on track for an October 2018 liftoff. Still to come, however, are key integration tests of the fully assembled and instrumented observatory. Yoder said work has been completed this month on an Apollo-era test chamber at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, modified to test the integrated JWST at cryogenic temperatures - at minus 424 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Back to the beginning of time. Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, noted the size of JWST. \"Hubble is the size of a school bus,\" Mountain said. \"JWST is the size of a tennis court.\" JWST's mirrors are so flat that if you stretch them all out across the United States, \"the largest bump would be no bigger than two inches. That's how smooth these mirrors are,\" Mountain added. NASA's chief scientist, Waleed Abdalati, underscored JWST's future abilities. \"The things that are blurring to Hubble will be in sharp focus. And the things that Hubble doesn't know are out there will be observable, back to the beginning of time as we understand it.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/17202-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-mirrors.html"}, {"title": "James Webb Space Telescope on Time and Budget", "date": "2013-01-11", "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the notoriously over- budget new space observatory slated to launch in 2018 - is on time and still within its new budget, the project's chief said Wednesday. \"Our budget still stands and the schedule remains the same,\" Eric Smith, the space telescope's program director, told astronomers here at a town hall meeting during the 221st meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Smith also outlined the future of the James Webb Space Telescope program in 2013 and discussed its turbulent year in 2012. With an $8.8 billion dollar price tag, JWST is destined to be one of the largest and most expensive projects in NASA history. Set to replace the venerable Hubble Space Telescope once it is launched, JWST will take infrared images of distant galaxies, probing the cosmos for hints and signals left behind from the Big Bang. Of the four science instruments responsible for investigating those mysteries aboard the spacecraft, two were delivered to NASA in 2012. The Mid-Infrared Instrument - the instrument responsible for taking \"Hubble-like\" images of distant galaxies, comets and other heavenly bodies - was sent last year by the European consortium that built it. The Canadian Space Agency has also delivered its instrument: the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph that will also take high-quality images of other bodies in space. NASA is still awaiting two more contributions: the Near-Infrared Camera from Lockheed Martin and the University of Arizona, and the Near- Infrared Spectrograph from the European Space Agency, which is still in its early testing phases. Both instruments measure light on the infrared spectrum. All of the science instruments are set to be integrated by the end of 2013, officials say. The telescope's tennis court-size sunshield is in the early stages of testing as well. The sunshield itself is too large to launch in an unfurled state, creating a unique problem for JWST scientists to solve. Instead of launching the telescope with the sunshield in place, NASA is planning to unroll the shield once the craft is in orbit. At one-third of the way complete, NASA scientists are now starting to practice rolling and unrolling the shield to see how it might unfurl in space after launch. Once all four instruments are finished, researchers will combine them to test JWST as one cohesive unit. While final testing on the ground should begin in 2015, simulation testing using Optimal Trajectories by Implicit Simulation - a space telescope tester that mimics the temperature and environment of a space telescope in Earth's orbit - won't start until 2017, a year before launch. JWST is also going to investigate a few objects a little closer to home. Mike Brown, an astronomer from Caltech, detailed a few of the more promising applications for JWST within the solar system. Planetary scientists have been interested in understanding what composes comets, protoplanets and other mysterious space objects. JWST's sensitive instruments should be able to deliver some information as to what elements created rocky and icy objects in the outer solar system, Brown said at the town hall meeting. NASA officials, meanwhile, are hopeful that the JWST's predecessor - the iconic Hubble Space Telescope - will still be functioning by the time the new observatory launches. This week, agency officials said the 23-year-old Hubble telescope could potentially last through 2018, allowing for some overlap with the JWST mission that would be a boon for astronomers.

Almost immediately after launching into space in 2018, James Webb Space Telescope will begin the slow process of unfolding from its clamshell configuration into the most sensitive infrared instrument of its kind yet built. The telescope will then begin peering deep into the cosmos for signals left over from the Big Bang that created our universe. But JWST's nail-biting deployment won't be the first time the craft unfolds. Before constructing the final components, engineers have been making sure to test and retest mockups in conditions potentially harsher than the telescope - the long-awaited $8.8 billion successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope - will experience. Space-ready drafts of the mirrors, solar shields and electronics-bearing body of the craft have been fabricated by the Northrop Grumman Corporation, NASA's primary contractor in charge of building JWST. Each piece is identical to the final product. The pieces of the giant telescope are exposed to the some of the worst trials engineers can come up with. The mockups must perform not only in ideal circumstances, but also in subpar conditions. \"You don't just test how it's going to work the way it's supposed to work,\" Scott Willoughby, JWST's program manager at Northrop Grumman, said during a Jan. 11 tour of the company's facility here in Redondo Beach. Built in stages. The jet-sized telescope isn't being built all at once, but instead incrementally, allowing for testing of the individual parts. \"You don't built it all and see if it works,\" Willoughby said. The first priority has been high-risk objects such as the mirrors and the instruments. JWST contains 18 hexagonal mirrors in an array, rather than one large mirror. The smaller mirrors allow for more precise construction. The separate pieces also travel more easily into space; although 12 sit on the center mast, two three-mirror panels unfold on each side as the telescope deploys. Made of beryllium, the small mirrors are less apt than one giant one to change their shape in the extreme temperatures of space. The final mirror will be equivalent to a single reflective surface of 21.5 feet, with a collecting area almost five times larger than the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope. Each mirror is covered by a thin coat of gold to enhance its reflectivity - a very thin coat, Willoughby stressed. \"You couldn't take all of that gold and make a wedding ring,\" he said. Although Northrop Grumman is the primary contractor, the mirrors themselves have been subcontracted to Ball Aerospace, which has subcontracted out various elements. \"It takes a village to build a mirror,\" Willoughby said. Construction of all18 segments of the primary mirror was completed last year. JWST's instruments, which are being assembled by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the European and Canadian space agencies, should be ready by the end of this year, officials have said. The largest part of JWST is the five-layered sunshield, which will shield the telescope from temperatures of up to 185 degrees Fahrenheit on the sun side. The primary telescope must remain at temperatures below minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit so that it can register faint infrared emissions from distant sources. Each layer of the tennis-court-size sunshield is filled with over 10,000 seams, which allow it to take a 3D shape rather than remaining flat. The five layers are either 0.001 or 0.002 inches thick and resemble the surface a giant mylar balloon. Three of the five have already been completed, with the last two set to be done by the end of the year. The sunshield blocks heat not only from the sun, but also from the body of the observatory. Almost 10 feet in diameter, the body, known as the bus, houses JWST's instruments and power supply. The electronic equipment emits heat that can inhibit astronomical readings just like the sun. The bus is \"the heart of anything that goes into space,\" Willoughby said. Construction on the bus only recently started, although the space-ready mockup has already undergone a number of tests. The telescope will be pieced together inside a bay of Northrop Grumman's Redondo Beach facility. From there, it will leave Los Angeles on a boat, travel through the Panama Canal, and be launched from French Guiana in South America. 'Seven days of terror'. Almost immediately after it leaves Earth's orbit, the James Webb Space Telescope will begin its deployment process. The outer layer, which protects it from the heat of racing through Earth's atmosphere, will drop off. The wings holding the sunshield will unfold, and the shield will begin to spread to full capacity. The secondary mirror will extend, and the two panels on the primary will emerge. \"We will actually stretch out as we're flying,\" Willoughby said. The entire process will take roughly two weeks and will happen while JWST is speeding toward its final destination, a gravitationally stable spot 900,000 miles from Earth called the sun-Earth Lagrange point 2. Six months after launch, the telescope should be ready to kick off its five- year science mission. \"The Mars rover Curiosity had seven minutes of terror ,\" said JWST scientist Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"We're going to have seven days of terror.\" According to Hammel, the most nerve-racking part of the deployment will be the extension of the smaller secondary mirror. Any problems that may develop with the sunshield or engines will still allow for some limited science to be performed. But \"if we don't have the secondary mirror, we don't have a telescope,\" Hammel said. Despite the intricate nature of the deployment process, Willoughby said he's confident of success, citing the many tests that will prove out each component and procedure, along with Northrop Grumman's track record. \"Northrop Grumman has a 100 percent success rate in deployment,\" he stressed. Although JWST will go through a significant unfolding, it won't hold the record for a Northrop Grumman-built satellite. According to Stuart Moses, who works with science and weather systems for the company, that honor goes to the Tracking and Data Relay System, an array of six satellites launched in 1983, which was recognized for setting a record after operating for 25 years. \"TDRS has more deployments, just in terms of numbers,\" Moses said. Northrop Grumman has helped in the construction of a number of satellites and space telescopes, including NASA's Chandra and Compton Gamma Ray observatories. \"A lot of the deployment technology that we've been using over the decades has been applied to JWST,\" Moses said.

Almost immediately after launching into space in 2018, James Webb Space Telescope will begin the slow process of unfolding from its clamshell configuration into the most sensitive infrared instrument of its kind yet built. The telescope will then begin peering deep into the cosmos for signals left over from the Big Bang that created our universe. But JWST's nail-biting deployment won't be the first time the craft unfolds. Before constructing the final components, engineers have been making sure to test and retest mockups in conditions potentially harsher than the telescope - the long-awaited $8.8 billion successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope - will experience. Space-ready drafts of the mirrors, solar shields and electronics-bearing body of the craft have been fabricated by the Northrop Grumman Corporation, NASA's primary contractor in charge of building JWST. Each piece is identical to the final product. The pieces of the giant telescope are exposed to the some of the worst trials engineers can come up with. The mockups must perform not only in ideal circumstances, but also in subpar conditions. \"You don't just test how it's going to work the way it's supposed to work,\" Scott Willoughby, JWST's program manager at Northrop Grumman, said during a Jan. 11 tour of the company's facility here in Redondo Beach. Built in stages. The jet-sized telescope isn't being built all at once, but instead incrementally, allowing for testing of the individual parts. \"You don't built it all and see if it works,\" Willoughby said. The first priority has been high-risk objects such as the mirrors and the instruments. JWST contains 18 hexagonal mirrors in an array, rather than one large mirror. The smaller mirrors allow for more precise construction. The separate pieces also travel more easily into space; although 12 sit on the center mast, two three-mirror panels unfold on each side as the telescope deploys. Made of beryllium, the small mirrors are less apt than one giant one to change their shape in the extreme temperatures of space. The final mirror will be equivalent to a single reflective surface of 21.5 feet, with a collecting area almost five times larger than the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope. Each mirror is covered by a thin coat of gold to enhance its reflectivity - a very thin coat, Willoughby stressed. \"You couldn't take all of that gold and make a wedding ring,\" he said. Although Northrop Grumman is the primary contractor, the mirrors themselves have been subcontracted to Ball Aerospace, which has subcontracted out various elements. \"It takes a village to build a mirror,\" Willoughby said. Construction of all18 segments of the primary mirror was completed last year. JWST's instruments, which are being assembled by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the European and Canadian space agencies, should be ready by the end of this year, officials have said. The largest part of JWST is the five-layered sunshield, which will shield the telescope from temperatures of up to 185 degrees Fahrenheit on the sun side. The primary telescope must remain at temperatures below minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit so that it can register faint infrared emissions from distant sources. Each layer of the tennis-court-size sunshield is filled with over 10,000 seams, which allow it to take a 3D shape rather than remaining flat. The five layers are either 0.001 or 0.002 inches thick and resemble the surface a giant mylar balloon. Three of the five have already been completed, with the last two set to be done by the end of the year. The sunshield blocks heat not only from the sun, but also from the body of the observatory. Almost 10 feet in diameter, the body, known as the bus, houses JWST's instruments and power supply. The electronic equipment emits heat that can inhibit astronomical readings just like the sun. The bus is \"the heart of anything that goes into space,\" Willoughby said. Construction on the bus only recently started, although the space-ready mockup has already undergone a number of tests. The telescope will be pieced together inside a bay of Northrop Grumman's Redondo Beach facility. From there, it will leave Los Angeles on a boat, travel through the Panama Canal, and be launched from French Guiana in South America. 'Seven days of terror'. Almost immediately after it leaves Earth's orbit, the James Webb Space Telescope will begin its deployment process. The outer layer, which protects it from the heat of racing through Earth's atmosphere, will drop off. The wings holding the sunshield will unfold, and the shield will begin to spread to full capacity. The secondary mirror will extend, and the two panels on the primary will emerge. \"We will actually stretch out as we're flying,\" Willoughby said. The entire process will take roughly two weeks and will happen while JWST is speeding toward its final destination, a gravitationally stable spot 900,000 miles from Earth called the sun-Earth Lagrange point 2. Six months after launch, the telescope should be ready to kick off its five- year science mission. \"The Mars rover Curiosity had seven minutes of terror ,\" said JWST scientist Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"We're going to have seven days of terror.\" According to Hammel, the most nerve-racking part of the deployment will be the extension of the smaller secondary mirror. Any problems that may develop with the sunshield or engines will still allow for some limited science to be performed. But \"if we don't have the secondary mirror, we don't have a telescope,\" Hammel said. Despite the intricate nature of the deployment process, Willoughby said he's confident of success, citing the many tests that will prove out each component and procedure, along with Northrop Grumman's track record. \"Northrop Grumman has a 100 percent success rate in deployment,\" he stressed. Although JWST will go through a significant unfolding, it won't hold the record for a Northrop Grumman-built satellite. According to Stuart Moses, who works with science and weather systems for the company, that honor goes to the Tracking and Data Relay System, an array of six satellites launched in 1983, which was recognized for setting a record after operating for 25 years. \"TDRS has more deployments, just in terms of numbers,\" Moses said. Northrop Grumman has helped in the construction of a number of satellites and space telescopes, including NASA's Chandra and Compton Gamma Ray observatories. \"A lot of the deployment technology that we've been using over the decades has been applied to JWST,\" Moses said.

According to a release from the European Space Agency , which is collaborating with NASA and the Canadian Space Agency on the giant project, new detectors have now been installed in all three instruments. One of those is the ESA's \"NIRSpec\" instrument, a spectrograph featuring two mercury cadmium telluride sensor arrays that are expected to provide unprecedented information about the chemical composition and age of distant stars and galaxies. According to NASA, NIRSpec's detectors will support medium-resolution spectroscopy over a wavelength range of 1-5\u00b5m, and lower-resolution spectroscopy down to wavelength of 600nm. The instrument also employs a MEMS-based microshutter array for aperture control, which has also encountered problems in testing.

The HgCdTe detectors are not the only components being replaced after the recent battery of equipment tests ahead of JWST's much-anticipated launch, now expected to take place in 2018. One of the NIRSpec instrument's key attributes is its ability to analyze light from more than 100 different astronomical objects simultaneously, over a 9-square-arcminute field of view. That will give JWST a unique capability for a space telescope, and to do it requires thousands of microshutters, arranged into four different arrays. The arrays comprise thousands of tiny windows that can be opened and closed individually so that only the light from each particular object of interest is allowed onto the NIRSpec detectors. But after simulations to reproduced the kind of noise and vibration likely to be experienced on the launch pad took place in 2012, several thousand of NIRSpec's microshutters were found to be jammed in the closed position. To replace the faulty microshutters, ESA says that it had to open the instrument's outer cover, something that had to be done under strict cleanliness conditions to avoid contamination. Maurice te Plate, its system integration and test manager for JWST, said: \"In particular, the microshutters are very sensitive to material such as small polyester fibers that can get stuck inside and prevent them from fully closing.

The technique was used during the construction of NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which launched in 1999, and was apparently quite successful because the telescope remains scientifically productive today, said Jon Arenberg, James Webb Space Telescope chief engineer at Northrop Grumman. \"It helps us do a number of things, obviously - how to handle such a large structure, how to attach the mirrors,\" Arenberg told Space.com. \"So this allows us to wring out a 140,000-lb. 63,500 kilograms stand and robot assembly process.\" \"This is an example of practice makes perfect, so we practice, practice, practice so when we get the flight hardware, it goes off as smoothly as possible,\" he added. The pathfinder's design is fairly similar to that of the actual JWST, but there are some differences, Arenberg said. For example, the pathfinder lacks two winglike parts on either side of a backplane that holds a large part of the telescope together. Hardware tests. JWST is the highly anticipated successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. When it's up and running, the infrared-optimized JWST will probe the atmospheres of exoplanets, study the universe's first galaxies and investigate how stars and planets form, among other things, NASA officials say. But the telescope has received criticism for cost and development overruns. Around the turn of the century, JWST was projected to cost up to $3.5 billion and launch no later than 2011, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in 2014. The coming months will be crucial to the success of JWST, as components are starting to be completed and shipped for testing and assembly. One major sign of success came in July, when load testing was finished on the observatory's primary mirror backplane support structure, the device that holds the telescope's mirror segments and science instruments. The backplane support was scheduled to be shipped to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland at the end of 2014 to be placed in its clean room and begin receiving mirrors. \"Completion of the testing and formal delivery of the backplane, to us, is a huge step,\" Arenberg said, adding that other components are getting close to that stage. There have also been some other milestones: Mirrors have already been sent to Goddard, telescope electronics that operate the motors are on their way and the flight sunshield layers are being manufactured, with the second one already built. Moving toward assembly. In the next year or so, the big pieces of the telescope will begin assembly to be ready for system testing, which will take up about two of the four years between now and JWST's planned 2018 launch. Another major step will come when the telescope is mated with its main instrument module as well as the optics, which themselves will need to be tested at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston to ensure the hardware meets design specifications. As each component is finished, it is generally flown to Goddard in a huge military transport plane, the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and is shipped to and from the airport in environmentally controlled containers pulled by a semi-trailer. The last big trip will take JWST to the South American nation of French Guiana, where the launch will take place aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.

Once in space and fully deployed, the 18 primary mirror segments will work together as one large 21.3-foot diameter (6.5-meter) mirror. \"Completing the assembly of the primary mirror is a very significant milestone and the culmination of over a decade of design, manufacturing, testing and now assembly of the primary mirror system,\" said Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager at Goddard. \"There is a huge team across the country who contributed to this achievement.\" While the primary mirror installation may be finished on the tennis court-sized infrared observatory, there still is much work to be done. \"Now that the mirror is complete, we look forward to installing the other optics and conducting tests on all the components to make sure the telescope can withstand a rocket launch,\" said Bill Ochs, James Webb Space Telescope project manager. \"This is a great way to start 2016!\" The mirrors were built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., in Boulder, Colorado. Ball is the principal subcontractor to Northrop Grumman for the optical technology and optical system design. The installation of the mirrors onto the telescope structure is performed by Harris Corporation, a subcontractor to Northrop Grumman. Harris Corporation leads integration and testing for the telescope. \"The Harris team will be installing the aft optics assembly and the secondary mirror in order to finish the actual telescope,\" said Gary Matthews, director of Universe Exploration at Harris Corporation. \"The heart of the telescope, the Integrated Science Instrument Module, will then be integrated into the telescope. After acoustic, vibration, and other tests at Goddard, we will ship the system down to Johnson Space Center in Houston for an intensive cryogenic optical test to ensure everything is working properly.\" The James Webb Space Telescope is the scientific successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. It will be the most powerful space telescope ever built. Webb will study many phases in the history of our universe, including the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth, as well as the evolution of our own solar system. It's targeted to launch from French Guiana aboard an Ariane 5 rocket in 2018. Webb is an international project led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space Agency.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden hosted a news conference to announce the milestone this morning at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, overlooking the 18 large mirrors that will collect infrared light, sheltered behind a tennis-court-size sun shield. JWST is considered the successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. \"Today, we're celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we're about to prove that it works,\" said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result - we're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference. First, it will be the biggest telescope mirror to fly in space. \"You can see this beautiful, gold telescope is seven times the collecting area of the Hubble telescope,\" Mather said. And second, it is designed to collect infrared light, which Hubble is not very sensitive to. Earth's atmosphere glows in the infrared, so such measurements can't be made from the ground. Hubble emits its own heat, which would obscure infrared readings. JWST will run close to absolute zero in temperature and rest at a point in space called the Lagrange Point 2, which is directly behind Earth from the sun's perspective. That way, Earth can shield the telescope from some of the sun's infrared emission, and the sun shield can protect the telescope from both bodies' heat. The telescope's infrared view will pierce through obscuring cosmic dust to reveal the universe's first galaxies and spy on newly forming planetary systems. It also will be sensitive enough to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets that pass in front of their stars, perhaps to search for signs of life, Mather said. The telescope would be able to see a bumblebee a moon's distance away, he added - both in reflected light and in the body heat the bee emitted. Its mirrors are so smooth that if you stretched the array to the size of the U.S., the hills and valleys of irregularity would be only a few inches high, Mather said. In addition to Bolden and Mather, Christopher Scolese, director of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's new associate administrator for science; Eric Smith, the telescope's program director; and Bill Ochs, director of the James Webb mission, attended the news conference. \"Some of you that have followed JWST know that it almost didn't happen, and it's mainly because of the people that are sitting here, able to talk to you today, that we're all here and within two years of launch,\" Bolden said. The telescope was originally scheduled to launch in 2014, at a cost of about $5 billion, but a series of setbacks and budget constraints delayed and nearly canceled the project. Now, though, officials affirmed that the telescope is on track and on budget for an October 2018 launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. (As a result of the delays, JWST's cost is now $8.7 billion, Ochs said.) The project is led by NASA but supported by international partners, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope's testing at Goddard, which has already begun, will ensure that it can withstand the shaking and loud noise of a rocket launch. Then, it will be moved to Texas, where its focus will be tested, and then to California for some final assembly. The testing is particularly high-stakes, because unlike Hubble, which was repaired and refocused in orbit by astronauts, this telescope is not intended to be repaired by humans. \"It's critically important to get it right here on the ground, and that's the purpose for the tests that we're doing here and, most importantly, for the tests when we get it down to Johnson [Space Center] in Chamber A, the big vacuum chamber,\" Bolden said. \"[We need to] make sure it can, in fact, be focused, so that we don't find, as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do,\" Bolden said, referring to the repairs needed to focus Hubble after launch. Each of JWST's mirrors is individually tunable, he said, so they can be adjusted without a corrective lens like the one astronauts put on Hubble. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble [telescope incident] were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added. \"And if you don't get the same answer, you'd better figure out why.\" Researchers will make observations with the telescope for at least 5 years, and will carry enough fuel for 10 years - if they're lucky, JWST will last even longer, Mather and Bolden said. They added that the craft will absolutely be hit by space debris over the course of its lifespan, and that it's designed to function fine with small holes in its mirrors. The full telescope, with a 21.3-foot (6.5 meters) mirror assembly, is too large to launch fully extended, so the telescope will be carefully furled during launch and will have to unfold over the course of two weeks once it's in space, Mather said. After that, the sun shield will be extended carefully, and the telescope will be given time to cool down. Finally, it will be focused, they said. By six months after launch, the telescope will be ready to begin doing science. Mather alluded to the \"7 minutes of terror\" of the Curiosity Mars rover's automated landing in 2012 - a famously complicated maneuver that used a rocket-powered sky crane to lower the vehicle to the Martian surface. \"This is six months of terror,\" he said.

It's taken nearly 20 years, billions of dollars, and fierce political battles to achieve the project's biggest moment to date - the completion of its giant, 22-foot-wide golden mirror - so news outlets on Wednesday were quick to play up the milestone. But some went a bit too far. \"The James Webb Space Telescope Is Complete,\" announced Popular Mechanics. \"World's Largest Space Telescope Is Complete, Expected to Launch in 2018,\" Space.com wrote in a similar box-checking exercise. And the Daily Mail went large with the all-caps declaration: \"World's biggest space telescope the James Webb is READY.\" Who doesn't want to see a huge observatory go into space, take amazing photos of the universe, maybe help unravel the mysteries of dark matter, and perhaps find out if the nearest Earth-like planet has a cozy, life-cradling atmosphere? I certainly do. But the $8.7 billion telescope is not finished, complete, or ready for launch. On the contrary, the most difficult stages of the its assembly and mission have only just begun. Polishing off the world's most expensive mirror. The rush of JWST news came out after NASA held a press conference on November 2. The big update? Engineers just finished building the most difficult of JWST's three main chunks: the primary mirror segment, shown here. The mirror itself is made out of 18 gold-plated panels of beryllium metal that is \"both strong and lightweight,\" according to NASA. Behind the shiny exterior there's also a suite of instruments and electronics that make it all work - and those have finally been installed and tested, too. \"This telescope segment of NASA's most ambitious space observatory stands complete and tall in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cleanroom,\" a narrator said in a dramatic YouTube video. Finishing the mirror is indeed a very big deal, since it's the most complex part of JWST. In fact, NASA said it had to create and perfect 10 new technologies to make it work. Arranged like that, JWST's mirror is much too big to fit into any rocket. But it has a trick: The segments partially fold up, allowing it to fit within the tight space of a fairing on top of a rocket. In space, the segments will unfold and work together as one big mirror, helping focus normally invisible infrared light from the universe toward a suite of electronics. \" S cientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe,\" NASA employee Sarah Loff wrote in a Nov. 2 image feature. She continued: \"Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers ... understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\" JWST is not out of the woods yet, though. Next up: 2 torturous years. Now that the telescope segment is finished, NASA must show that its marvel of engineering can survive launch aboard one of the world's most powerful rockets, then in the harsh environment of space. The space agency has already shaken, chilled, and rattled a lot of JWST's individual components. However, it needs to see if they'll hold up when they're all assembled. So NASA will now subject the entire mirror segment to punishing conditions in labs all over the country in the coming months. \"It - hopefully - is a formality,\" Jason Hylan, the lead engineer for JWST's instruments, told reporter Scott Dance at The Baltimore Sun. Rockets vibrate like crazy as they blast off, so shaking is one key test. Workers in 2015 finished building a house-size table to throttle the telescope, called the Large Vibration Test System, at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - and that's where they're testing the mirror segment right now. The forces will exceed 10 times gravity's pull. Next, JWST will have to survive one of the loudest rooms on Earth. Called the Acoustic Test Chamber, it's 42 feet tall and has 6-foot-wide speaker horns that will blast out 150 decibels of sound for 2 minutes at a time. If the mirror passes those tests, it will fly aboard a giant jet and to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Engineers will reward the spacecraft by sticking it into a giant cryogenic vacuum chamber, suck out all the air, and let it sit there - freezing at blisteringly cold temperatures - for 90 days. This will simulate what it's like for the mirror to sit completely in the dark of its sunshield some 930,000 miles away from Earth. By August 2017, NASA hopes to ship the mirror to Northrop Grumman's facility in Los Angeles, where workers will attach it to the sunshield and bus, finally completing the telescope. But JWST's tour still won't be over: It will have to make its way to South America. ## Cold and alone in deep space. With help from the European Space Agency, NASA will ship the assembled, folded-up telescope to a launch facility near Kourou, French Guiana, which is just north of Brazil. JWST will launch from French Guiana because the Earth's spin there is more than 1,000 mph, thanks to a significant bulge near the equator. The extra speed of Earth's rotation there will help fling JWST into deep space. NASA, ESA, and a company called Arianespace will load JWST on top of a roughly $200 million rocket. Ideally they'll launch it in October 2018. Assuming the launch goes off without a hitch - the Ariane 5's safety record has been flawless over 74 missions since 2003 - JWST will begin a 30-day journey to a point that's four times farther away than the moon is from Earth. While it flies there, it will gently unfurl its sunshield and instruments over the course of two weeks. Here's how that might look, according to a Northrop Grumman animation: Its final destination is a location where the gravitational pulls of Earth, the moon, and the sun cancel out into a very stable Lagrange point, called L2. By hanging out at L2, the telescope will barely move, protecting its shiny and fragile sunshield from being torn to shreds. JWST will also stay far away from the atmospheric gases of Earth, which can slow it down and mess with its orbit. Staying within the L2 point will also ensure the telescope's sensitive mirror is always pointed into the blackness of space, while its reflectors bouncing away warm sunlight. After 4 to 6 months of cooling down, the mirror will be a mind-numbing -388 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing JWST to start its mission of peering at infrared light from the depths of space sometime in early 2019. JWST could see objects that are 10 to 100 times dimmer than what Hubble can make out, and it will do so for about 5 to 10 years. But the telescope could last much longer than that, considering the Hubble telescope has lived on for more than 26 years. But there's a catch here. JWST's distance from Earth - 930,000 miles away - is perhaps the most nerve- wracking part of JWST's mission. If anything goes wrong after launch, people on Earth could only remotely reprogram the spacecraft, assuming they can still talk to it. That's because there is no rocket or spacecraft capable of sending a crewed mission to fix JWST. This is unlike the Hubble telescope, which astronauts serviced a few times from about 500 miles above Earth. This means just one physical problem might turn JWST into a $8.7 billion white elephant. So come October 2018, we'll be wishing NASA the best of luck as JWST makes the trip to this cold and lonely point in deep space, nearly a million miles away from home.

Nearly 20 years after its engineers began construction, Nasa began testing this week on the largest space telescope ever built, a 21ft arrangement of mirrors and instruments that is meant to succeed the Hubble telescope and look through 13bn years of space. Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa's famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope's own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble's, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST's greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \"seven times the collecting area\" of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time - at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars' light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\"redshifted\") it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble's view. The telescope will now be subjected to two years of tests before its planned launch in 2018. Unlike Hubble, it will be sent far from where astronauts could repair it, and Nasa said it will first test the JWST for the \"violent sound and vibration environments\" of a rocket launch, including tests of forces 10 times stronger than gravity and blasts of sound to mimic rocket explosions. Then they will test for the conditions the JWST will face during two weeks of delicate unfurling in space and years in orbit. In February, the scientists will send it to a chamber at the Johnson Space Center that can be lowered to -220C (about -370F), and Bolden said it is designed to survive collisions with space debris and small holes in its mirrors, and that the telescope will need six months in space before it's ready for work. He added that scientists need to \"get it right here on the ground\" to avoid finding, \"as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do\". The JWST was originally meant to launch in 2014, but the project was nearly canceled by Congress in 2011 due to delays and budget problems. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added, alluding to repairs astronauts had to make after launch. Bolden said the telescope will help scientists see stars and planets from the earliest epoch of the universe. \"Nasa has always sought to unravel the mysteries of our universe; to find out where we come from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the universe,\" he said in a later statement. \"We are building the James Webb Space Telescope to answer these age-old questions.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/04/nasa-testing-james-webb-space-telescope-gold"}, {"title": "NASA has completed the $8.7 billion James Webb space telescope", "date": "2016-11-07", "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope has given humanity unprecedented glimpses into the universe, but it will soon be replaced by a far more powerful model.

It's equipped with a 21-foot, gold-coated mirror array that can collect seven times more light than Hubble and scan the infrared spectrum to see through dust. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather says. On top of peering into the deepest, oldest regions of the universe, the telescope has enough power to hunt for habitable exoplanets. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" says Mather.

Now researchers must conduct a series of tests to prove that JWST can survive launch and that its mirrors will focus properly at near-absolute-zero temperatures. The telescope will then be mated to the bus carrying the solar array, sun shield, and communications and data storage components, and the assembly will be transported to French Guiana for an October 2018 launch date. With a primary mirror that is seven times the size of the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror, JWST is expected to be capable of probing the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets and observing the birth of stars and planets. Originally estimated to cost $1.6 billion and set to launch in 2011, JWST came close to being terminated by Congress in 2011 due to cost overruns. Recently, however, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said he is \"very confident\" that the telescope will now remain within its new cost profile, capped at $8 billion, and stay on schedule. The total cost of the project, including five years of operation, is estimated at $8.7 billion. The telescope will carry sufficient fuel to stay in orbit for at least 10 years, and possibly 12, says Bill Ochs, JWST project manager. The telescope, including its four imaging and guidance instruments, will now undergo acoustic and vibrational testing at Goddard, where it was built. It will then be transported to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a cryogenic test, and then to a Northrop Grumman facility in Los Angeles, where the bus is being assembled. A European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket will carry JWST into space. The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments that will unfold and adjust to shape following launch. The mirror is made of beryllium and coated with a total of three ounces of gold, which is ultrasensitive to the IR light that the telescope is built to observe. Each mirror segment is so smooth that if it were scaled to the size of the continental US, the highest mountain peaks would rise just two inches. Unlike Hubble, which has been serviced five times over 26 years, JWST is not designed to be serviced in space. The telescope will be placed in orbit around the Lagrangian 2 (L2) point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth; Hubble is in low Earth orbit. By orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST can stay in constant contact with Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network, and its solar panels can generate energy continuously. To prevent IR emissions that would reduce the quality of imagery, JWST's tennis court-sized sun shield will maintain the telescope's ambient temperature at about 50 K. The telescope is so sensitive that \"if you were a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon, we'd be able to see you both by your reflection of sunlight and by the thermal radiation you emit,\" says Nobel laureate John Mather, the telescope's senior project scientist. Two of JWST's four instruments, a near-IR spectrograph and a mid-IR instrument, were built mainly by ESA. A near-IR camera was built by the University of Arizona, and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in December 2017, will catalog small exoplanets, which could provide targets for JWST to examine for signs of life, such as water vapor. JWST also will be trained on dwarf planets in the solar system. Developers of the telescope's instruments are guaranteed first crack at observing time, along with some \"interdisciplinary scientists who have very important broad generic science programs,\" says Gerard Kriss of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the JWST ground control center. STScI will begin soliciting those proposals in January. Also in the queue will be \"early release observations,\" which, he says, are \"the kind of pictures that are meant to show we have a functional observatory and are meant to be beautiful.\" ", "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.5.1099/full/"}, {"title": "Some Assembly Required: New Space Telescope Will Take Shape After Launch", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "The next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. But before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. For example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \"That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Bego\u00f1a Vila, an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" Now, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. Then, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video. Many of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" The Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden hosted a news conference to announce the milestone this morning at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, overlooking the 18 large mirrors that will collect infrared light, sheltered behind a tennis-court-size sun shield. JWST is considered the successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. \"Today, we're celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we're about to prove that it works,\" said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result - we're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference. First, it will be the biggest telescope mirror to fly in space. \"You can see this beautiful, gold telescope is seven times the collecting area of the Hubble telescope,\" Mather said. And second, it is designed to collect infrared light, which Hubble is not very sensitive to. Earth's atmosphere glows in the infrared, so such measurements can't be made from the ground. Hubble emits its own heat, which would obscure infrared readings. JWST will run close to absolute zero in temperature and rest at a point in space called the Lagrange Point 2, which is directly behind Earth from the sun's perspective. That way, Earth can shield the telescope from some of the sun's infrared emission, and the sun shield can protect the telescope from both bodies' heat. The telescope's infrared view will pierce through obscuring cosmic dust to reveal the universe's first galaxies and spy on newly forming planetary systems. It also will be sensitive enough to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets that pass in front of their stars, perhaps to search for signs of life, Mather said. The telescope would be able to see a bumblebee a moon's distance away, he added - both in reflected light and in the body heat the bee emitted. Its mirrors are so smooth that if you stretched the array to the size of the U.S., the hills and valleys of irregularity would be only a few inches high, Mather said. In addition to Bolden and Mather, Christopher Scolese, director of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's new associate administrator for science; Eric Smith, the telescope's program director; and Bill Ochs, director of the James Webb mission, attended the news conference. \"Some of you that have followed JWST know that it almost didn't happen, and it's mainly because of the people that are sitting here, able to talk to you today, that we're all here and within two years of launch,\" Bolden said. The telescope was originally scheduled to launch in 2014, at a cost of about $5 billion, but a series of setbacks and budget constraints delayed and nearly canceled the project. Now, though, officials affirmed that the telescope is on track and on budget for an October 2018 launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. (As a result of the delays, JWST's cost is now $8.7 billion, Ochs said.) The project is led by NASA but supported by international partners, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope's testing at Goddard, which has already begun, will ensure that it can withstand the shaking and loud noise of a rocket launch. Then, it will be moved to Texas, where its focus will be tested, and then to California for some final assembly. The testing is particularly high-stakes, because unlike Hubble, which was repaired and refocused in orbit by astronauts, this telescope is not intended to be repaired by humans. \"It's critically important to get it right here on the ground, and that's the purpose for the tests that we're doing here and, most importantly, for the tests when we get it down to Johnson [Space Center] in Chamber A, the big vacuum chamber,\" Bolden said. \"[We need to] make sure it can, in fact, be focused, so that we don't find, as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do,\" Bolden said, referring to the repairs needed to focus Hubble after launch. Each of JWST's mirrors is individually tunable, he said, so they can be adjusted without a corrective lens like the one astronauts put on Hubble. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble [telescope incident] were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added. \"And if you don't get the same answer, you'd better figure out why.\" Researchers will make observations with the telescope for at least 5 years, and will carry enough fuel for 10 years - if they're lucky, JWST will last even longer, Mather and Bolden said. They added that the craft will absolutely be hit by space debris over the course of its lifespan, and that it's designed to function fine with small holes in its mirrors. The full telescope, with a 21.3-foot (6.5 meters) mirror assembly, is too large to launch fully extended, so the telescope will be carefully furled during launch and will have to unfold over the course of two weeks once it's in space, Mather said. After that, the sun shield will be extended carefully, and the telescope will be given time to cool down. Finally, it will be focused, they said. By six months after launch, the telescope will be ready to begin doing science. Mather alluded to the \"7 minutes of terror\" of the Curiosity Mars rover's automated landing in 2012 - a famously complicated maneuver that used a rocket-powered sky crane to lower the vehicle to the Martian surface. \"This is six months of terror,\" he said.

It's taken nearly 20 years, billions of dollars, and fierce political battles to achieve the project's biggest moment to date - the completion of its giant, 22-foot-wide golden mirror - so news outlets on Wednesday were quick to play up the milestone. But some went a bit too far. \"The James Webb Space Telescope Is Complete,\" announced Popular Mechanics. \"World's Largest Space Telescope Is Complete, Expected to Launch in 2018,\" Space.com wrote in a similar box-checking exercise. And the Daily Mail went large with the all-caps declaration: \"World's biggest space telescope the James Webb is READY.\" Who doesn't want to see a huge observatory go into space, take amazing photos of the universe, maybe help unravel the mysteries of dark matter, and perhaps find out if the nearest Earth-like planet has a cozy, life-cradling atmosphere? I certainly do. But the $8.7 billion telescope is not finished, complete, or ready for launch. On the contrary, the most difficult stages of the its assembly and mission have only just begun. Polishing off the world's most expensive mirror. The rush of JWST news came out after NASA held a press conference on November 2. The big update? Engineers just finished building the most difficult of JWST's three main chunks: the primary mirror segment, shown here. The mirror itself is made out of 18 gold-plated panels of beryllium metal that is \"both strong and lightweight,\" according to NASA. Behind the shiny exterior there's also a suite of instruments and electronics that make it all work - and those have finally been installed and tested, too. \"This telescope segment of NASA's most ambitious space observatory stands complete and tall in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cleanroom,\" a narrator said in a dramatic YouTube video. Finishing the mirror is indeed a very big deal, since it's the most complex part of JWST. In fact, NASA said it had to create and perfect 10 new technologies to make it work. Arranged like that, JWST's mirror is much too big to fit into any rocket. But it has a trick: The segments partially fold up, allowing it to fit within the tight space of a fairing on top of a rocket. In space, the segments will unfold and work together as one big mirror, helping focus normally invisible infrared light from the universe toward a suite of electronics. \" S cientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe,\" NASA employee Sarah Loff wrote in a Nov. 2 image feature. She continued: \"Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers ... understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\" JWST is not out of the woods yet, though. Next up: 2 torturous years. Now that the telescope segment is finished, NASA must show that its marvel of engineering can survive launch aboard one of the world's most powerful rockets, then in the harsh environment of space. The space agency has already shaken, chilled, and rattled a lot of JWST's individual components. However, it needs to see if they'll hold up when they're all assembled. So NASA will now subject the entire mirror segment to punishing conditions in labs all over the country in the coming months. \"It - hopefully - is a formality,\" Jason Hylan, the lead engineer for JWST's instruments, told reporter Scott Dance at The Baltimore Sun. Rockets vibrate like crazy as they blast off, so shaking is one key test. Workers in 2015 finished building a house-size table to throttle the telescope, called the Large Vibration Test System, at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - and that's where they're testing the mirror segment right now. The forces will exceed 10 times gravity's pull. Next, JWST will have to survive one of the loudest rooms on Earth. Called the Acoustic Test Chamber, it's 42 feet tall and has 6-foot-wide speaker horns that will blast out 150 decibels of sound for 2 minutes at a time. If the mirror passes those tests, it will fly aboard a giant jet and to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Engineers will reward the spacecraft by sticking it into a giant cryogenic vacuum chamber, suck out all the air, and let it sit there - freezing at blisteringly cold temperatures - for 90 days. This will simulate what it's like for the mirror to sit completely in the dark of its sunshield some 930,000 miles away from Earth. By August 2017, NASA hopes to ship the mirror to Northrop Grumman's facility in Los Angeles, where workers will attach it to the sunshield and bus, finally completing the telescope. But JWST's tour still won't be over: It will have to make its way to South America. ## Cold and alone in deep space. With help from the European Space Agency, NASA will ship the assembled, folded-up telescope to a launch facility near Kourou, French Guiana, which is just north of Brazil. JWST will launch from French Guiana because the Earth's spin there is more than 1,000 mph, thanks to a significant bulge near the equator. The extra speed of Earth's rotation there will help fling JWST into deep space. NASA, ESA, and a company called Arianespace will load JWST on top of a roughly $200 million rocket. Ideally they'll launch it in October 2018. Assuming the launch goes off without a hitch - the Ariane 5's safety record has been flawless over 74 missions since 2003 - JWST will begin a 30-day journey to a point that's four times farther away than the moon is from Earth. While it flies there, it will gently unfurl its sunshield and instruments over the course of two weeks. Here's how that might look, according to a Northrop Grumman animation: Its final destination is a location where the gravitational pulls of Earth, the moon, and the sun cancel out into a very stable Lagrange point, called L2. By hanging out at L2, the telescope will barely move, protecting its shiny and fragile sunshield from being torn to shreds. JWST will also stay far away from the atmospheric gases of Earth, which can slow it down and mess with its orbit. Staying within the L2 point will also ensure the telescope's sensitive mirror is always pointed into the blackness of space, while its reflectors bouncing away warm sunlight. After 4 to 6 months of cooling down, the mirror will be a mind-numbing -388 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing JWST to start its mission of peering at infrared light from the depths of space sometime in early 2019. JWST could see objects that are 10 to 100 times dimmer than what Hubble can make out, and it will do so for about 5 to 10 years. But the telescope could last much longer than that, considering the Hubble telescope has lived on for more than 26 years. But there's a catch here. JWST's distance from Earth - 930,000 miles away - is perhaps the most nerve- wracking part of JWST's mission. If anything goes wrong after launch, people on Earth could only remotely reprogram the spacecraft, assuming they can still talk to it. That's because there is no rocket or spacecraft capable of sending a crewed mission to fix JWST. This is unlike the Hubble telescope, which astronauts serviced a few times from about 500 miles above Earth. This means just one physical problem might turn JWST into a $8.7 billion white elephant. So come October 2018, we'll be wishing NASA the best of luck as JWST makes the trip to this cold and lonely point in deep space, nearly a million miles away from home.

Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa's famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope's own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble's, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST's greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \"seven times the collecting area\" of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time - at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars' light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\"redshifted\") it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble's view.

The mirror is made of beryllium and coated with a total of three ounces of gold, which is ultrasensitive to the IR light that the telescope is built to observe. Each mirror segment is so smooth that if it were scaled to the size of the continental US, the highest mountain peaks would rise just two inches. Unlike Hubble, which has been serviced five times over 26 years, JWST is not designed to be serviced in space. The telescope will be placed in orbit around the Lagrangian 2 (L2) point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth; Hubble is in low Earth orbit. By orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST can stay in constant contact with Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network, and its solar panels can generate energy continuously. To prevent IR emissions that would reduce the quality of imagery, JWST's tennis court-sized sun shield will maintain the telescope's ambient temperature at about 50 K. The telescope is so sensitive that \"if you were a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon, we'd be able to see you both by your reflection of sunlight and by the thermal radiation you emit,\" says Nobel laureate John Mather, the telescope's senior project scientist. Two of JWST's four instruments, a near-IR spectrograph and a mid-IR instrument, were built mainly by ESA. A near-IR camera was built by the University of Arizona, and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in December 2017, will catalog small exoplanets, which could provide targets for JWST to examine for signs of life, such as water vapor. JWST also will be trained on dwarf planets in the solar system. Developers of the telescope's instruments are guaranteed first crack at observing time, along with some \"interdisciplinary scientists who have very important broad generic science programs,\" says Gerard Kriss of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the JWST ground control center. STScI will begin soliciting those proposals in January. Also in the queue will be \"early release observations,\" which, he says, are \"the kind of pictures that are meant to show we have a functional observatory and are meant to be beautiful.\" ", "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.5.1099/full/"}, {"title": "Some Assembly Required: New Space Telescope Will Take Shape After Launch", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "The next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. But before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. For example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \"That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Bego\u00f1a Vila, an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" Now, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. Then, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video. Many of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" The Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared.

After conducting both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, engineers have found it to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" But because so much is on the line with NASA's $8.8 Billion groundbreaking Webb telescope mission that will peer back to nearly the dawn of time, engineers are still investigating the \"root cause\" of the \"vibration anomaly\" first detected amidst shake testing on Dec. 3. \"The team is making good progress at identifying the root cause of the vibration anomaly,\" NASA explained in a Dec 23 statement - much to everyone's relief! \"They have successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.\" \"All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the structure continue to show it to be sound.\" Starting late November, technicians began a defined series of environmental tests including vibration and acoustics tests to make sure that the telescopes huge optical structure was fit for blastoff and could safely withstand the powerful shaking encountered during a rocket launch and the especially harsh rigors of the space environment. It would be useless otherwise - unable to carry out unparallelled science. To carry out the vibration and acoustics tests conducted on equipment located in a shirtsleeve environment, the telescope structure was first carefully placed inside a 'clean tent' structure to protect it from dirt and grime and maintain the pristine clean room conditions available inside Goddard's massive clean room - where it has been undergoing assembly for the past year. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is undergoing testing to make sure the spacecraft withstands the harsh conditions of launch, and to find and remedy all possible concerns before it is launched from French Guiana in 2018.\" However, shortly after the vibration testing began technicians soon discovered unexpected \"anomalous readings\" during a shake test of the telescope on Dec. 3, as the agency initially announced in a status update on the JWST website. The anomalous readings were found during one of the vibration tests in progress on the shaker table, via accelerometers attached to the observatories optical structure known as OTIS. \"During the vibration testing on December 3, at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, accelerometers attached to the telescope detected anomalous readings during a particular test,\" the team elaborated. So the team quickly conducted further \"low level vibration\" tests and inspections to more fully understand the nature of the anomaly, as well as scrutinize the accelerometer data for clues. \"Further tests to identify the source of the anomaly are underway. The engineering team investigating the vibe anomaly has made numerous detailed visual inspections of the Webb telescope and has found no visible signs of damage.\" \"They are continuing their analysis of accelerometer data to better determine the source of the anomaly.\" The team is measuring and recording the responses of the structure to the fresh low level vibration tests and will compare these new data to results obtained prior to detection of the anomaly. Work continues over the holidays to ensure Webb is safe and sound and can meet its 2018 launch target. After thoroughly reviewing all the data the team hope to restart the planned vibration and acoustic testing in the new year. \"Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.\" Webb's massive optical structure being tested is known as OTIS or Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science. It includes the fully assembled 18-segment gold coated primary mirror and the science instrument module housing the four science instruments. OTIS is a combination of the OTE (Optical Telescope Assembly) and the ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) together. \"OTIS is essentially the entire optical train of the observatory!\" said John Durning, Webb Telescope Deputy Project Manager, in an earlier exclusive interview with Universe Today at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's the critical photon path for the system.\" The components were fully integrated this past summer at Goddard. The combined OTIS entity of mirrors, science module and backplane truss weighs 8786 lbs (3940 kg) and measures 28'3\" (8.6m) x 8\"5\" (2.6 m) x 7\"10\" (2.4 m). The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Webb is designed to look at the first light of the Universe and will be able to peer back in time to when the first stars and first galaxies were forming. It will also study the history of our universe and the formation of our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets, some of which may be capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden hosted a news conference to announce the milestone this morning at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, overlooking the 18 large mirrors that will collect infrared light, sheltered behind a tennis-court-size sun shield. JWST is considered the successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. \"Today, we're celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we're about to prove that it works,\" said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result - we're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference. First, it will be the biggest telescope mirror to fly in space. \"You can see this beautiful, gold telescope is seven times the collecting area of the Hubble telescope,\" Mather said. And second, it is designed to collect infrared light, which Hubble is not very sensitive to. Earth's atmosphere glows in the infrared, so such measurements can't be made from the ground. Hubble emits its own heat, which would obscure infrared readings. JWST will run close to absolute zero in temperature and rest at a point in space called the Lagrange Point 2, which is directly behind Earth from the sun's perspective. That way, Earth can shield the telescope from some of the sun's infrared emission, and the sun shield can protect the telescope from both bodies' heat. The telescope's infrared view will pierce through obscuring cosmic dust to reveal the universe's first galaxies and spy on newly forming planetary systems. It also will be sensitive enough to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets that pass in front of their stars, perhaps to search for signs of life, Mather said. The telescope would be able to see a bumblebee a moon's distance away, he added - both in reflected light and in the body heat the bee emitted. Its mirrors are so smooth that if you stretched the array to the size of the U.S., the hills and valleys of irregularity would be only a few inches high, Mather said. In addition to Bolden and Mather, Christopher Scolese, director of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's new associate administrator for science; Eric Smith, the telescope's program director; and Bill Ochs, director of the James Webb mission, attended the news conference. \"Some of you that have followed JWST know that it almost didn't happen, and it's mainly because of the people that are sitting here, able to talk to you today, that we're all here and within two years of launch,\" Bolden said. The telescope was originally scheduled to launch in 2014, at a cost of about $5 billion, but a series of setbacks and budget constraints delayed and nearly canceled the project. Now, though, officials affirmed that the telescope is on track and on budget for an October 2018 launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. (As a result of the delays, JWST's cost is now $8.7 billion, Ochs said.) The project is led by NASA but supported by international partners, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope's testing at Goddard, which has already begun, will ensure that it can withstand the shaking and loud noise of a rocket launch. Then, it will be moved to Texas, where its focus will be tested, and then to California for some final assembly. The testing is particularly high-stakes, because unlike Hubble, which was repaired and refocused in orbit by astronauts, this telescope is not intended to be repaired by humans. \"It's critically important to get it right here on the ground, and that's the purpose for the tests that we're doing here and, most importantly, for the tests when we get it down to Johnson [Space Center] in Chamber A, the big vacuum chamber,\" Bolden said. \"[We need to] make sure it can, in fact, be focused, so that we don't find, as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do,\" Bolden said, referring to the repairs needed to focus Hubble after launch. Each of JWST's mirrors is individually tunable, he said, so they can be adjusted without a corrective lens like the one astronauts put on Hubble. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble [telescope incident] were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added. \"And if you don't get the same answer, you'd better figure out why.\" Researchers will make observations with the telescope for at least 5 years, and will carry enough fuel for 10 years - if they're lucky, JWST will last even longer, Mather and Bolden said. They added that the craft will absolutely be hit by space debris over the course of its lifespan, and that it's designed to function fine with small holes in its mirrors. The full telescope, with a 21.3-foot (6.5 meters) mirror assembly, is too large to launch fully extended, so the telescope will be carefully furled during launch and will have to unfold over the course of two weeks once it's in space, Mather said. After that, the sun shield will be extended carefully, and the telescope will be given time to cool down. Finally, it will be focused, they said. By six months after launch, the telescope will be ready to begin doing science. Mather alluded to the \"7 minutes of terror\" of the Curiosity Mars rover's automated landing in 2012 - a famously complicated maneuver that used a rocket-powered sky crane to lower the vehicle to the Martian surface. \"This is six months of terror,\" he said.

It's taken nearly 20 years, billions of dollars, and fierce political battles to achieve the project's biggest moment to date - the completion of its giant, 22-foot-wide golden mirror - so news outlets on Wednesday were quick to play up the milestone. But some went a bit too far. \"The James Webb Space Telescope Is Complete,\" announced Popular Mechanics. \"World's Largest Space Telescope Is Complete, Expected to Launch in 2018,\" Space.com wrote in a similar box-checking exercise. And the Daily Mail went large with the all-caps declaration: \"World's biggest space telescope the James Webb is READY.\" Who doesn't want to see a huge observatory go into space, take amazing photos of the universe, maybe help unravel the mysteries of dark matter, and perhaps find out if the nearest Earth-like planet has a cozy, life-cradling atmosphere? I certainly do. But the $8.7 billion telescope is not finished, complete, or ready for launch. On the contrary, the most difficult stages of the its assembly and mission have only just begun. Polishing off the world's most expensive mirror. The rush of JWST news came out after NASA held a press conference on November 2. The big update? Engineers just finished building the most difficult of JWST's three main chunks: the primary mirror segment, shown here. The mirror itself is made out of 18 gold-plated panels of beryllium metal that is \"both strong and lightweight,\" according to NASA. Behind the shiny exterior there's also a suite of instruments and electronics that make it all work - and those have finally been installed and tested, too. \"This telescope segment of NASA's most ambitious space observatory stands complete and tall in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cleanroom,\" a narrator said in a dramatic YouTube video. Finishing the mirror is indeed a very big deal, since it's the most complex part of JWST. In fact, NASA said it had to create and perfect 10 new technologies to make it work. Arranged like that, JWST's mirror is much too big to fit into any rocket. But it has a trick: The segments partially fold up, allowing it to fit within the tight space of a fairing on top of a rocket. In space, the segments will unfold and work together as one big mirror, helping focus normally invisible infrared light from the universe toward a suite of electronics. \" S cientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe,\" NASA employee Sarah Loff wrote in a Nov. 2 image feature. She continued: \"Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers ... understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\" JWST is not out of the woods yet, though. Next up: 2 torturous years. Now that the telescope segment is finished, NASA must show that its marvel of engineering can survive launch aboard one of the world's most powerful rockets, then in the harsh environment of space. The space agency has already shaken, chilled, and rattled a lot of JWST's individual components. However, it needs to see if they'll hold up when they're all assembled. So NASA will now subject the entire mirror segment to punishing conditions in labs all over the country in the coming months. \"It - hopefully - is a formality,\" Jason Hylan, the lead engineer for JWST's instruments, told reporter Scott Dance at The Baltimore Sun. Rockets vibrate like crazy as they blast off, so shaking is one key test. Workers in 2015 finished building a house-size table to throttle the telescope, called the Large Vibration Test System, at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - and that's where they're testing the mirror segment right now. The forces will exceed 10 times gravity's pull. Next, JWST will have to survive one of the loudest rooms on Earth. Called the Acoustic Test Chamber, it's 42 feet tall and has 6-foot-wide speaker horns that will blast out 150 decibels of sound for 2 minutes at a time. If the mirror passes those tests, it will fly aboard a giant jet and to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Engineers will reward the spacecraft by sticking it into a giant cryogenic vacuum chamber, suck out all the air, and let it sit there - freezing at blisteringly cold temperatures - for 90 days. This will simulate what it's like for the mirror to sit completely in the dark of its sunshield some 930,000 miles away from Earth. By August 2017, NASA hopes to ship the mirror to Northrop Grumman's facility in Los Angeles, where workers will attach it to the sunshield and bus, finally completing the telescope. But JWST's tour still won't be over: It will have to make its way to South America. ## Cold and alone in deep space. With help from the European Space Agency, NASA will ship the assembled, folded-up telescope to a launch facility near Kourou, French Guiana, which is just north of Brazil. JWST will launch from French Guiana because the Earth's spin there is more than 1,000 mph, thanks to a significant bulge near the equator. The extra speed of Earth's rotation there will help fling JWST into deep space. NASA, ESA, and a company called Arianespace will load JWST on top of a roughly $200 million rocket. Ideally they'll launch it in October 2018. Assuming the launch goes off without a hitch - the Ariane 5's safety record has been flawless over 74 missions since 2003 - JWST will begin a 30-day journey to a point that's four times farther away than the moon is from Earth. While it flies there, it will gently unfurl its sunshield and instruments over the course of two weeks. Here's how that might look, according to a Northrop Grumman animation: Its final destination is a location where the gravitational pulls of Earth, the moon, and the sun cancel out into a very stable Lagrange point, called L2. By hanging out at L2, the telescope will barely move, protecting its shiny and fragile sunshield from being torn to shreds. JWST will also stay far away from the atmospheric gases of Earth, which can slow it down and mess with its orbit. Staying within the L2 point will also ensure the telescope's sensitive mirror is always pointed into the blackness of space, while its reflectors bouncing away warm sunlight. After 4 to 6 months of cooling down, the mirror will be a mind-numbing -388 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing JWST to start its mission of peering at infrared light from the depths of space sometime in early 2019. JWST could see objects that are 10 to 100 times dimmer than what Hubble can make out, and it will do so for about 5 to 10 years. But the telescope could last much longer than that, considering the Hubble telescope has lived on for more than 26 years. But there's a catch here. JWST's distance from Earth - 930,000 miles away - is perhaps the most nerve- wracking part of JWST's mission. If anything goes wrong after launch, people on Earth could only remotely reprogram the spacecraft, assuming they can still talk to it. That's because there is no rocket or spacecraft capable of sending a crewed mission to fix JWST. This is unlike the Hubble telescope, which astronauts serviced a few times from about 500 miles above Earth. This means just one physical problem might turn JWST into a $8.7 billion white elephant. So come October 2018, we'll be wishing NASA the best of luck as JWST makes the trip to this cold and lonely point in deep space, nearly a million miles away from home.

Nearly 20 years after its engineers began construction, Nasa began testing this week on the largest space telescope ever built, a 21ft arrangement of mirrors and instruments that is meant to succeed the Hubble telescope and look through 13bn years of space. Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa's famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope's own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble's, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST's greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \"seven times the collecting area\" of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time - at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars' light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\"redshifted\") it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble's view. The telescope will now be subjected to two years of tests before its planned launch in 2018. Unlike Hubble, it will be sent far from where astronauts could repair it, and Nasa said it will first test the JWST for the \"violent sound and vibration environments\" of a rocket launch, including tests of forces 10 times stronger than gravity and blasts of sound to mimic rocket explosions. Then they will test for the conditions the JWST will face during two weeks of delicate unfurling in space and years in orbit. In February, the scientists will send it to a chamber at the Johnson Space Center that can be lowered to -220C (about -370F), and Bolden said it is designed to survive collisions with space debris and small holes in its mirrors, and that the telescope will need six months in space before it's ready for work. He added that scientists need to \"get it right here on the ground\" to avoid finding, \"as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do\". The JWST was originally meant to launch in 2014, but the project was nearly canceled by Congress in 2011 due to delays and budget problems. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added, alluding to repairs astronauts had to make after launch. Bolden said the telescope will help scientists see stars and planets from the earliest epoch of the universe. \"Nasa has always sought to unravel the mysteries of our universe; to find out where we come from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the universe,\" he said in a later statement. \"We are building the James Webb Space Telescope to answer these age-old questions.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/04/nasa-testing-james-webb-space-telescope-gold"}, {"title": "NASA has completed the $8.7 billion James Webb space telescope", "date": "2016-11-07", "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope has given humanity unprecedented glimpses into the universe, but it will soon be replaced by a far more powerful model.

On top of peering into the deepest, oldest regions of the universe, the telescope has enough power to hunt for habitable exoplanets. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" says Mather. Thanks to its relatively large, extremely smooth mirror -- which would have defects just a few inches high if stretched to the size of the United States -- it has enough power to detect a bumblebee on the moon. To detect infrared light, the JWST will be cooled to around -220 degrees Celcius. To achieve that temperature, it's insulated from the sun by five membrane layers, each no thicker than a human hair. Those membranes were finished just last week, marking an end to construction of the telescope. The team will now start a rigorous battery of tests to avoid problems the Hubble had, since the JWST will be nearly a million miles from Earth). First, scientists will rattle the device and blast it with 150 decibels of noise to simulate launch conditions on the giant Ariane 5 rocket. Then, it'll undergo cryogenic testing to confirm it can survive the extreme temperatures of space. Lastly, it'll undergo final performance tests to ensure there are no Hubble-like optical defects. The entire James Webb mission, slated for October, 2018, will keep astronomers on edge for a full month. It'll be launched by the ESA's Ariane 5 rocket, considered the world's most reliable vehicle. It'll then make a 30-day, one-million-mile trip to the second Lagrange point, and will deploy its antenna, sunshield, secondary mirror, and primary mirror wings en route.

Recently, however, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said he is \"very confident\" that the telescope will now remain within its new cost profile, capped at $8 billion, and stay on schedule. The total cost of the project, including five years of operation, is estimated at $8.7 billion.

A European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket will carry JWST into space. The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments that will unfold and adjust to shape following launch. The mirror is made of beryllium and coated with a total of three ounces of gold, which is ultrasensitive to the IR light that the telescope is built to observe. Each mirror segment is so smooth that if it were scaled to the size of the continental US, the highest mountain peaks would rise just two inches. Unlike Hubble, which has been serviced five times over 26 years, JWST is not designed to be serviced in space. The telescope will be placed in orbit around the Lagrangian 2 (L2) point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth; Hubble is in low Earth orbit. By orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST can stay in constant contact with Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network, and its solar panels can generate energy continuously. To prevent IR emissions that would reduce the quality of imagery, JWST's tennis court-sized sun shield will maintain the telescope's ambient temperature at about 50 K. The telescope is so sensitive that \"if you were a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon, we'd be able to see you both by your reflection of sunlight and by the thermal radiation you emit,\" says Nobel laureate John Mather, the telescope's senior project scientist. Two of JWST's four instruments, a near-IR spectrograph and a mid-IR instrument, were built mainly by ESA. A near-IR camera was built by the University of Arizona, and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in December 2017, will catalog small exoplanets, which could provide targets for JWST to examine for signs of life, such as water vapor. JWST also will be trained on dwarf planets in the solar system. Developers of the telescope's instruments are guaranteed first crack at observing time, along with some \"interdisciplinary scientists who have very important broad generic science programs,\" says Gerard Kriss of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the JWST ground control center. STScI will begin soliciting those proposals in January. Also in the queue will be \"early release observations,\" which, he says, are \"the kind of pictures that are meant to show we have a functional observatory and are meant to be beautiful.\" ", "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.5.1099/full/"}, {"title": "Some Assembly Required: New Space Telescope Will Take Shape After Launch", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "The next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. But before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. For example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \"That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Bego\u00f1a Vila, an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" Now, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. Then, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video. Many of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" The Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared.

After conducting both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, engineers have found it to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" But because so much is on the line with NASA's $8.8 Billion groundbreaking Webb telescope mission that will peer back to nearly the dawn of time, engineers are still investigating the \"root cause\" of the \"vibration anomaly\" first detected amidst shake testing on Dec. 3. \"The team is making good progress at identifying the root cause of the vibration anomaly,\" NASA explained in a Dec 23 statement - much to everyone's relief! \"They have successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.\" \"All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the structure continue to show it to be sound.\" Starting late November, technicians began a defined series of environmental tests including vibration and acoustics tests to make sure that the telescopes huge optical structure was fit for blastoff and could safely withstand the powerful shaking encountered during a rocket launch and the especially harsh rigors of the space environment. It would be useless otherwise - unable to carry out unparallelled science. To carry out the vibration and acoustics tests conducted on equipment located in a shirtsleeve environment, the telescope structure was first carefully placed inside a 'clean tent' structure to protect it from dirt and grime and maintain the pristine clean room conditions available inside Goddard's massive clean room - where it has been undergoing assembly for the past year. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is undergoing testing to make sure the spacecraft withstands the harsh conditions of launch, and to find and remedy all possible concerns before it is launched from French Guiana in 2018.\" However, shortly after the vibration testing began technicians soon discovered unexpected \"anomalous readings\" during a shake test of the telescope on Dec. 3, as the agency initially announced in a status update on the JWST website. The anomalous readings were found during one of the vibration tests in progress on the shaker table, via accelerometers attached to the observatories optical structure known as OTIS. \"During the vibration testing on December 3, at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, accelerometers attached to the telescope detected anomalous readings during a particular test,\" the team elaborated. So the team quickly conducted further \"low level vibration\" tests and inspections to more fully understand the nature of the anomaly, as well as scrutinize the accelerometer data for clues. \"Further tests to identify the source of the anomaly are underway. The engineering team investigating the vibe anomaly has made numerous detailed visual inspections of the Webb telescope and has found no visible signs of damage.\" \"They are continuing their analysis of accelerometer data to better determine the source of the anomaly.\" The team is measuring and recording the responses of the structure to the fresh low level vibration tests and will compare these new data to results obtained prior to detection of the anomaly. Work continues over the holidays to ensure Webb is safe and sound and can meet its 2018 launch target. After thoroughly reviewing all the data the team hope to restart the planned vibration and acoustic testing in the new year. \"Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.\" Webb's massive optical structure being tested is known as OTIS or Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science. It includes the fully assembled 18-segment gold coated primary mirror and the science instrument module housing the four science instruments. OTIS is a combination of the OTE (Optical Telescope Assembly) and the ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) together. \"OTIS is essentially the entire optical train of the observatory!\" said John Durning, Webb Telescope Deputy Project Manager, in an earlier exclusive interview with Universe Today at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's the critical photon path for the system.\" The components were fully integrated this past summer at Goddard. The combined OTIS entity of mirrors, science module and backplane truss weighs 8786 lbs (3940 kg) and measures 28'3\" (8.6m) x 8\"5\" (2.6 m) x 7\"10\" (2.4 m). The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Webb is designed to look at the first light of the Universe and will be able to peer back in time to when the first stars and first galaxies were forming. It will also study the history of our universe and the formation of our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets, some of which may be capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth.

The vibration tests are conducted by the team on a shaker table at Goddard to ensure Webb's worthiness and that it will survive the rough and rumbling ride experienced during the thunderous rocket launch to the heavens slated for late 2018. \"Testing on the ground is critical to proving a spacecraft is safe to launch,\" said Lee Feinberg, an engineer and James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at Goddard, in a statement. \"The Webb telescope is the most dynamically complicated article of space hardware that we've ever tested.\" The 18-segment gold coated primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is raised into vertical alignment in the largest clean room at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2016. The secondary mirror mount booms are folded down into stowed for launch configuration. Testing of the gargantuan Webb Telescope had ground to a halt after a brief scare in early December when technicians initially detected \"anomalous readings\" that raised potential concerns about the observatories structural integrity partway through a preplanned series of vibration tests. \"On December 3, 2016, vibration testing automatically shut down early due to some sensor readings that exceeded predicted levels,\" officials said. There after, engineers and technicians carried out a new batch of intensive inspections of the observatory's structure during December. Shortly before Christmas, NASA announced on Dec. 23 that JWST was deemed \"sound\" and apparently unscathed after engineers conducted both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Officials said the telescope was found to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" As it turned out the culprit of the sensor anomaly was the many \"tie-down ... restraint mechanisms \" that hold the telescope in place. \"After a thorough investigation, the James Webb Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard determined that the cause was extremely small motions of the numerous tie-downs or \"launch restraint mechanisms\" that keep one of the telescope's mirror wings folded-up for launch,\" NASA officials explained in a statement. Furthermore engineers revealingly discovered that \"the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment.\" NASA reported today (Jan. 25) that the testing resumed last week at the point where it had been paused. Furthermore the testing was completed along the first of three axis. \"In-depth analysis of the test sensor data and detailed computer simulations confirmed that the input vibration was strong enough and the resonance of the telescope high enough at specific vibration frequencies to generate these tiny motions. Now that we understand how it happened, we have implemented changes to the test profile to prevent it from happening again,\" explained Feinberg. \"We have learned valuable lessons that will be applied to the final pre-launch tests of Webb at the observatory level once it is fully assembled in 2018. Fortunately, by learning these lessons early, we've been able to add diagnostic tests that let us show how the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment in a way that can give us confidence that the launch itself will be fully successful.\" The next step is to resume and complete shaking the telescope in the other two axis, or \"two directions to show that it can withstand vibrations in all three dimensions.\" \"This was a great team effort between the NASA Goddard team, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK, Ball Aerospace, the European Space Agency, and Arianespace,\" Feinberg said. \"We can now proceed with the rest of the planned tests of the telescope and instruments.\" NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

But Webb and its 18 segment \"golden\" primary mirror have to be carefully folded up to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane V booster. \"Due to its immense size, Webb has to be folded-up for launch and then unfolded in space. Prior generations of telescopes relied on rigid, non-moving structures for their stability. Because our mirror is larger than the rocket fairing we needed structures folded for launch and moved once we're out of Earth's atmosphere. Webb is the first time we're building for both stability and mobility.\" Feinberg said. \"This means that JWST testing is very unique, complex, and challenging.\" The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden hosted a news conference to announce the milestone this morning at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, overlooking the 18 large mirrors that will collect infrared light, sheltered behind a tennis-court-size sun shield. JWST is considered the successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. \"Today, we're celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we're about to prove that it works,\" said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result - we're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference. First, it will be the biggest telescope mirror to fly in space. \"You can see this beautiful, gold telescope is seven times the collecting area of the Hubble telescope,\" Mather said. And second, it is designed to collect infrared light, which Hubble is not very sensitive to. Earth's atmosphere glows in the infrared, so such measurements can't be made from the ground. Hubble emits its own heat, which would obscure infrared readings. JWST will run close to absolute zero in temperature and rest at a point in space called the Lagrange Point 2, which is directly behind Earth from the sun's perspective. That way, Earth can shield the telescope from some of the sun's infrared emission, and the sun shield can protect the telescope from both bodies' heat. The telescope's infrared view will pierce through obscuring cosmic dust to reveal the universe's first galaxies and spy on newly forming planetary systems. It also will be sensitive enough to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets that pass in front of their stars, perhaps to search for signs of life, Mather said. The telescope would be able to see a bumblebee a moon's distance away, he added - both in reflected light and in the body heat the bee emitted. Its mirrors are so smooth that if you stretched the array to the size of the U.S., the hills and valleys of irregularity would be only a few inches high, Mather said. In addition to Bolden and Mather, Christopher Scolese, director of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's new associate administrator for science; Eric Smith, the telescope's program director; and Bill Ochs, director of the James Webb mission, attended the news conference. \"Some of you that have followed JWST know that it almost didn't happen, and it's mainly because of the people that are sitting here, able to talk to you today, that we're all here and within two years of launch,\" Bolden said. The telescope was originally scheduled to launch in 2014, at a cost of about $5 billion, but a series of setbacks and budget constraints delayed and nearly canceled the project. Now, though, officials affirmed that the telescope is on track and on budget for an October 2018 launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. (As a result of the delays, JWST's cost is now $8.7 billion, Ochs said.) The project is led by NASA but supported by international partners, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope's testing at Goddard, which has already begun, will ensure that it can withstand the shaking and loud noise of a rocket launch. Then, it will be moved to Texas, where its focus will be tested, and then to California for some final assembly. The testing is particularly high-stakes, because unlike Hubble, which was repaired and refocused in orbit by astronauts, this telescope is not intended to be repaired by humans. \"It's critically important to get it right here on the ground, and that's the purpose for the tests that we're doing here and, most importantly, for the tests when we get it down to Johnson [Space Center] in Chamber A, the big vacuum chamber,\" Bolden said. \"[We need to] make sure it can, in fact, be focused, so that we don't find, as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do,\" Bolden said, referring to the repairs needed to focus Hubble after launch. Each of JWST's mirrors is individually tunable, he said, so they can be adjusted without a corrective lens like the one astronauts put on Hubble. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble [telescope incident] were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added. \"And if you don't get the same answer, you'd better figure out why.\" Researchers will make observations with the telescope for at least 5 years, and will carry enough fuel for 10 years - if they're lucky, JWST will last even longer, Mather and Bolden said. They added that the craft will absolutely be hit by space debris over the course of its lifespan, and that it's designed to function fine with small holes in its mirrors. The full telescope, with a 21.3-foot (6.5 meters) mirror assembly, is too large to launch fully extended, so the telescope will be carefully furled during launch and will have to unfold over the course of two weeks once it's in space, Mather said. After that, the sun shield will be extended carefully, and the telescope will be given time to cool down. Finally, it will be focused, they said. By six months after launch, the telescope will be ready to begin doing science. Mather alluded to the \"7 minutes of terror\" of the Curiosity Mars rover's automated landing in 2012 - a famously complicated maneuver that used a rocket-powered sky crane to lower the vehicle to the Martian surface. \"This is six months of terror,\" he said.

It's taken nearly 20 years, billions of dollars, and fierce political battles to achieve the project's biggest moment to date - the completion of its giant, 22-foot-wide golden mirror - so news outlets on Wednesday were quick to play up the milestone. But some went a bit too far. \"The James Webb Space Telescope Is Complete,\" announced Popular Mechanics. \"World's Largest Space Telescope Is Complete, Expected to Launch in 2018,\" Space.com wrote in a similar box-checking exercise. And the Daily Mail went large with the all-caps declaration: \"World's biggest space telescope the James Webb is READY.\" Who doesn't want to see a huge observatory go into space, take amazing photos of the universe, maybe help unravel the mysteries of dark matter, and perhaps find out if the nearest Earth-like planet has a cozy, life-cradling atmosphere? I certainly do. But the $8.7 billion telescope is not finished, complete, or ready for launch. On the contrary, the most difficult stages of the its assembly and mission have only just begun. Polishing off the world's most expensive mirror. The rush of JWST news came out after NASA held a press conference on November 2. The big update? Engineers just finished building the most difficult of JWST's three main chunks: the primary mirror segment, shown here. The mirror itself is made out of 18 gold-plated panels of beryllium metal that is \"both strong and lightweight,\" according to NASA. Behind the shiny exterior there's also a suite of instruments and electronics that make it all work - and those have finally been installed and tested, too. \"This telescope segment of NASA's most ambitious space observatory stands complete and tall in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cleanroom,\" a narrator said in a dramatic YouTube video. Finishing the mirror is indeed a very big deal, since it's the most complex part of JWST. In fact, NASA said it had to create and perfect 10 new technologies to make it work. Arranged like that, JWST's mirror is much too big to fit into any rocket. But it has a trick: The segments partially fold up, allowing it to fit within the tight space of a fairing on top of a rocket. In space, the segments will unfold and work together as one big mirror, helping focus normally invisible infrared light from the universe toward a suite of electronics. \" S cientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe,\" NASA employee Sarah Loff wrote in a Nov. 2 image feature. She continued: \"Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers ... understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\" JWST is not out of the woods yet, though. Next up: 2 torturous years. Now that the telescope segment is finished, NASA must show that its marvel of engineering can survive launch aboard one of the world's most powerful rockets, then in the harsh environment of space. The space agency has already shaken, chilled, and rattled a lot of JWST's individual components. However, it needs to see if they'll hold up when they're all assembled. So NASA will now subject the entire mirror segment to punishing conditions in labs all over the country in the coming months. \"It - hopefully - is a formality,\" Jason Hylan, the lead engineer for JWST's instruments, told reporter Scott Dance at The Baltimore Sun. Rockets vibrate like crazy as they blast off, so shaking is one key test. Workers in 2015 finished building a house-size table to throttle the telescope, called the Large Vibration Test System, at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - and that's where they're testing the mirror segment right now. The forces will exceed 10 times gravity's pull. Next, JWST will have to survive one of the loudest rooms on Earth. Called the Acoustic Test Chamber, it's 42 feet tall and has 6-foot-wide speaker horns that will blast out 150 decibels of sound for 2 minutes at a time. If the mirror passes those tests, it will fly aboard a giant jet and to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Engineers will reward the spacecraft by sticking it into a giant cryogenic vacuum chamber, suck out all the air, and let it sit there - freezing at blisteringly cold temperatures - for 90 days. This will simulate what it's like for the mirror to sit completely in the dark of its sunshield some 930,000 miles away from Earth. By August 2017, NASA hopes to ship the mirror to Northrop Grumman's facility in Los Angeles, where workers will attach it to the sunshield and bus, finally completing the telescope. But JWST's tour still won't be over: It will have to make its way to South America. ## Cold and alone in deep space. With help from the European Space Agency, NASA will ship the assembled, folded-up telescope to a launch facility near Kourou, French Guiana, which is just north of Brazil. JWST will launch from French Guiana because the Earth's spin there is more than 1,000 mph, thanks to a significant bulge near the equator. The extra speed of Earth's rotation there will help fling JWST into deep space. NASA, ESA, and a company called Arianespace will load JWST on top of a roughly $200 million rocket. Ideally they'll launch it in October 2018. Assuming the launch goes off without a hitch - the Ariane 5's safety record has been flawless over 74 missions since 2003 - JWST will begin a 30-day journey to a point that's four times farther away than the moon is from Earth. While it flies there, it will gently unfurl its sunshield and instruments over the course of two weeks. Here's how that might look, according to a Northrop Grumman animation: Its final destination is a location where the gravitational pulls of Earth, the moon, and the sun cancel out into a very stable Lagrange point, called L2. By hanging out at L2, the telescope will barely move, protecting its shiny and fragile sunshield from being torn to shreds. JWST will also stay far away from the atmospheric gases of Earth, which can slow it down and mess with its orbit. Staying within the L2 point will also ensure the telescope's sensitive mirror is always pointed into the blackness of space, while its reflectors bouncing away warm sunlight. After 4 to 6 months of cooling down, the mirror will be a mind-numbing -388 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing JWST to start its mission of peering at infrared light from the depths of space sometime in early 2019. JWST could see objects that are 10 to 100 times dimmer than what Hubble can make out, and it will do so for about 5 to 10 years. But the telescope could last much longer than that, considering the Hubble telescope has lived on for more than 26 years. But there's a catch here. JWST's distance from Earth - 930,000 miles away - is perhaps the most nerve- wracking part of JWST's mission. If anything goes wrong after launch, people on Earth could only remotely reprogram the spacecraft, assuming they can still talk to it. That's because there is no rocket or spacecraft capable of sending a crewed mission to fix JWST. This is unlike the Hubble telescope, which astronauts serviced a few times from about 500 miles above Earth. This means just one physical problem might turn JWST into a $8.7 billion white elephant. So come October 2018, we'll be wishing NASA the best of luck as JWST makes the trip to this cold and lonely point in deep space, nearly a million miles away from home.

Nearly 20 years after its engineers began construction, Nasa began testing this week on the largest space telescope ever built, a 21ft arrangement of mirrors and instruments that is meant to succeed the Hubble telescope and look through 13bn years of space. Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa's famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope's own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble's, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST's greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \"seven times the collecting area\" of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time - at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars' light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\"redshifted\") it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble's view. The telescope will now be subjected to two years of tests before its planned launch in 2018. Unlike Hubble, it will be sent far from where astronauts could repair it, and Nasa said it will first test the JWST for the \"violent sound and vibration environments\" of a rocket launch, including tests of forces 10 times stronger than gravity and blasts of sound to mimic rocket explosions. Then they will test for the conditions the JWST will face during two weeks of delicate unfurling in space and years in orbit. In February, the scientists will send it to a chamber at the Johnson Space Center that can be lowered to -220C (about -370F), and Bolden said it is designed to survive collisions with space debris and small holes in its mirrors, and that the telescope will need six months in space before it's ready for work. He added that scientists need to \"get it right here on the ground\" to avoid finding, \"as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do\". The JWST was originally meant to launch in 2014, but the project was nearly canceled by Congress in 2011 due to delays and budget problems. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added, alluding to repairs astronauts had to make after launch. Bolden said the telescope will help scientists see stars and planets from the earliest epoch of the universe. \"Nasa has always sought to unravel the mysteries of our universe; to find out where we come from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the universe,\" he said in a later statement. \"We are building the James Webb Space Telescope to answer these age-old questions.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/04/nasa-testing-james-webb-space-telescope-gold"}, {"title": "NASA has completed the $8.7 billion James Webb space telescope", "date": "2016-11-07", "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope has given humanity unprecedented glimpses into the universe, but it will soon be replaced by a far more powerful model. NASA administrator Charles Bolden unveiled the completed $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope , which will be able to see the universe as it was 13 billion years ago. It's equipped with a 21-foot, gold-coated mirror array that can collect seven times more light than Hubble and scan the infrared spectrum to see through dust. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather says. On top of peering into the deepest, oldest regions of the universe, the telescope has enough power to hunt for habitable exoplanets. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" says Mather. Thanks to its relatively large, extremely smooth mirror -- which would have defects just a few inches high if stretched to the size of the United States -- it has enough power to detect a bumblebee on the moon. To detect infrared light, the JWST will be cooled to around -220 degrees Celcius. To achieve that temperature, it's insulated from the sun by five membrane layers, each no thicker than a human hair. Those membranes were finished just last week, marking an end to construction of the telescope. The team will now start a rigorous battery of tests to avoid problems the Hubble had, since the JWST will be nearly a million miles from Earth). First, scientists will rattle the device and blast it with 150 decibels of noise to simulate launch conditions on the giant Ariane 5 rocket. Then, it'll undergo cryogenic testing to confirm it can survive the extreme temperatures of space. Lastly, it'll undergo final performance tests to ensure there are no Hubble-like optical defects. The entire James Webb mission, slated for October, 2018, will keep astronomers on edge for a full month. It'll be launched by the ESA's Ariane 5 rocket, considered the world's most reliable vehicle. It'll then make a 30-day, one-million-mile trip to the second Lagrange point, and will deploy its antenna, sunshield, secondary mirror, and primary mirror wings en route. The first images, likely of a relatively bright star or star field, will be the final proof that everything went to plan. Considering everything that could go wrong and the dollars at stake, the scientists behind it probably won't exhale until they see those early pictures.

Now researchers must conduct a series of tests to prove that JWST can survive launch and that its mirrors will focus properly at near-absolute-zero temperatures. The telescope will then be mated to the bus carrying the solar array, sun shield, and communications and data storage components, and the assembly will be transported to French Guiana for an October 2018 launch date. With a primary mirror that is seven times the size of the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror, JWST is expected to be capable of probing the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets and observing the birth of stars and planets. Originally estimated to cost $1.6 billion and set to launch in 2011, JWST came close to being terminated by Congress in 2011 due to cost overruns. Recently, however, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said he is \"very confident\" that the telescope will now remain within its new cost profile, capped at $8 billion, and stay on schedule. The total cost of the project, including five years of operation, is estimated at $8.7 billion. The telescope will carry sufficient fuel to stay in orbit for at least 10 years, and possibly 12, says Bill Ochs, JWST project manager. The telescope, including its four imaging and guidance instruments, will now undergo acoustic and vibrational testing at Goddard, where it was built. It will then be transported to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a cryogenic test, and then to a Northrop Grumman facility in Los Angeles, where the bus is being assembled. A European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket will carry JWST into space. The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments that will unfold and adjust to shape following launch. The mirror is made of beryllium and coated with a total of three ounces of gold, which is ultrasensitive to the IR light that the telescope is built to observe. Each mirror segment is so smooth that if it were scaled to the size of the continental US, the highest mountain peaks would rise just two inches. Unlike Hubble, which has been serviced five times over 26 years, JWST is not designed to be serviced in space. The telescope will be placed in orbit around the Lagrangian 2 (L2) point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth; Hubble is in low Earth orbit. By orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST can stay in constant contact with Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network, and its solar panels can generate energy continuously. To prevent IR emissions that would reduce the quality of imagery, JWST's tennis court-sized sun shield will maintain the telescope's ambient temperature at about 50 K. The telescope is so sensitive that \"if you were a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon, we'd be able to see you both by your reflection of sunlight and by the thermal radiation you emit,\" says Nobel laureate John Mather, the telescope's senior project scientist. Two of JWST's four instruments, a near-IR spectrograph and a mid-IR instrument, were built mainly by ESA. A near-IR camera was built by the University of Arizona, and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in December 2017, will catalog small exoplanets, which could provide targets for JWST to examine for signs of life, such as water vapor. JWST also will be trained on dwarf planets in the solar system. Developers of the telescope's instruments are guaranteed first crack at observing time, along with some \"interdisciplinary scientists who have very important broad generic science programs,\" says Gerard Kriss of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the JWST ground control center. STScI will begin soliciting those proposals in January. Also in the queue will be \"early release observations,\" which, he says, are \"the kind of pictures that are meant to show we have a functional observatory and are meant to be beautiful.\" ", "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.5.1099/full/"}, {"title": "Some Assembly Required: New Space Telescope Will Take Shape After Launch", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "The next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. But before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. For example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \"That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Bego\u00f1a Vila, an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" Now, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. Then, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video. Many of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" The Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared.

After conducting both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, engineers have found it to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" But because so much is on the line with NASA's $8.8 Billion groundbreaking Webb telescope mission that will peer back to nearly the dawn of time, engineers are still investigating the \"root cause\" of the \"vibration anomaly\" first detected amidst shake testing on Dec. 3. \"The team is making good progress at identifying the root cause of the vibration anomaly,\" NASA explained in a Dec 23 statement - much to everyone's relief! \"They have successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.\" \"All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the structure continue to show it to be sound.\" Starting late November, technicians began a defined series of environmental tests including vibration and acoustics tests to make sure that the telescopes huge optical structure was fit for blastoff and could safely withstand the powerful shaking encountered during a rocket launch and the especially harsh rigors of the space environment. It would be useless otherwise - unable to carry out unparallelled science. To carry out the vibration and acoustics tests conducted on equipment located in a shirtsleeve environment, the telescope structure was first carefully placed inside a 'clean tent' structure to protect it from dirt and grime and maintain the pristine clean room conditions available inside Goddard's massive clean room - where it has been undergoing assembly for the past year. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is undergoing testing to make sure the spacecraft withstands the harsh conditions of launch, and to find and remedy all possible concerns before it is launched from French Guiana in 2018.\" However, shortly after the vibration testing began technicians soon discovered unexpected \"anomalous readings\" during a shake test of the telescope on Dec. 3, as the agency initially announced in a status update on the JWST website. The anomalous readings were found during one of the vibration tests in progress on the shaker table, via accelerometers attached to the observatories optical structure known as OTIS. \"During the vibration testing on December 3, at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, accelerometers attached to the telescope detected anomalous readings during a particular test,\" the team elaborated. So the team quickly conducted further \"low level vibration\" tests and inspections to more fully understand the nature of the anomaly, as well as scrutinize the accelerometer data for clues. \"Further tests to identify the source of the anomaly are underway. The engineering team investigating the vibe anomaly has made numerous detailed visual inspections of the Webb telescope and has found no visible signs of damage.\" \"They are continuing their analysis of accelerometer data to better determine the source of the anomaly.\" The team is measuring and recording the responses of the structure to the fresh low level vibration tests and will compare these new data to results obtained prior to detection of the anomaly. Work continues over the holidays to ensure Webb is safe and sound and can meet its 2018 launch target. After thoroughly reviewing all the data the team hope to restart the planned vibration and acoustic testing in the new year. \"Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.\" Webb's massive optical structure being tested is known as OTIS or Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science. It includes the fully assembled 18-segment gold coated primary mirror and the science instrument module housing the four science instruments. OTIS is a combination of the OTE (Optical Telescope Assembly) and the ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) together. \"OTIS is essentially the entire optical train of the observatory!\" said John Durning, Webb Telescope Deputy Project Manager, in an earlier exclusive interview with Universe Today at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's the critical photon path for the system.\" The components were fully integrated this past summer at Goddard. The combined OTIS entity of mirrors, science module and backplane truss weighs 8786 lbs (3940 kg) and measures 28'3\" (8.6m) x 8\"5\" (2.6 m) x 7\"10\" (2.4 m). The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Webb is designed to look at the first light of the Universe and will be able to peer back in time to when the first stars and first galaxies were forming. It will also study the history of our universe and the formation of our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets, some of which may be capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth.

The vibration tests are conducted by the team on a shaker table at Goddard to ensure Webb's worthiness and that it will survive the rough and rumbling ride experienced during the thunderous rocket launch to the heavens slated for late 2018. \"Testing on the ground is critical to proving a spacecraft is safe to launch,\" said Lee Feinberg, an engineer and James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at Goddard, in a statement. \"The Webb telescope is the most dynamically complicated article of space hardware that we've ever tested.\" The 18-segment gold coated primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is raised into vertical alignment in the largest clean room at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2016. The secondary mirror mount booms are folded down into stowed for launch configuration. Testing of the gargantuan Webb Telescope had ground to a halt after a brief scare in early December when technicians initially detected \"anomalous readings\" that raised potential concerns about the observatories structural integrity partway through a preplanned series of vibration tests. \"On December 3, 2016, vibration testing automatically shut down early due to some sensor readings that exceeded predicted levels,\" officials said. There after, engineers and technicians carried out a new batch of intensive inspections of the observatory's structure during December. Shortly before Christmas, NASA announced on Dec. 23 that JWST was deemed \"sound\" and apparently unscathed after engineers conducted both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Officials said the telescope was found to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" As it turned out the culprit of the sensor anomaly was the many \"tie-down ... restraint mechanisms \" that hold the telescope in place. \"After a thorough investigation, the James Webb Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard determined that the cause was extremely small motions of the numerous tie-downs or \"launch restraint mechanisms\" that keep one of the telescope's mirror wings folded-up for launch,\" NASA officials explained in a statement. Furthermore engineers revealingly discovered that \"the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment.\" NASA reported today (Jan. 25) that the testing resumed last week at the point where it had been paused. Furthermore the testing was completed along the first of three axis. \"In-depth analysis of the test sensor data and detailed computer simulations confirmed that the input vibration was strong enough and the resonance of the telescope high enough at specific vibration frequencies to generate these tiny motions. Now that we understand how it happened, we have implemented changes to the test profile to prevent it from happening again,\" explained Feinberg. \"We have learned valuable lessons that will be applied to the final pre-launch tests of Webb at the observatory level once it is fully assembled in 2018. Fortunately, by learning these lessons early, we've been able to add diagnostic tests that let us show how the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment in a way that can give us confidence that the launch itself will be fully successful.\" The next step is to resume and complete shaking the telescope in the other two axis, or \"two directions to show that it can withstand vibrations in all three dimensions.\" \"This was a great team effort between the NASA Goddard team, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK, Ball Aerospace, the European Space Agency, and Arianespace,\" Feinberg said. \"We can now proceed with the rest of the planned tests of the telescope and instruments.\" NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

But Webb and its 18 segment \"golden\" primary mirror have to be carefully folded up to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane V booster. \"Due to its immense size, Webb has to be folded-up for launch and then unfolded in space. Prior generations of telescopes relied on rigid, non-moving structures for their stability. Because our mirror is larger than the rocket fairing we needed structures folded for launch and moved once we're out of Earth's atmosphere. Webb is the first time we're building for both stability and mobility.\" Feinberg said. \"This means that JWST testing is very unique, complex, and challenging.\" The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber.

Viewed as the Hubble Space Telescope's scientific successor, JWST, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency, will observe in the infrared and use spectroscopy to identify the chemical contents of exoplanets' atmospheres. Spectroscopy separates light into individual wavelengths. Every chemical has its own unique wavelength signature, so the technique is capable of identifying individual atmospheric components. This means JWST will be able to search the atmospheres of all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets - assuming all have atmospheres - for chemicals produced by biological processes, known as chemical biomarkers. Two such chemicals are ozone and methane. On Earth, ozone forms mostly through interaction between oxygen produced by plant life during photosynthesis and sunlight. Atmospheric ozone also protects life on Earth from harmful solar radiation. Finding methane could be a first step toward locating a biological source of the oxygen that goes into the formation of ozone. \"If these planets have atmospheres, the James Webb Space Telescope will be the key to unlocking their secrets. In the meantime, NASA's missions like Spitzer, Hubble, and Kepler are following up on these planets,\" said NASA Exoplanet Program scientist Doug Hudgins. Being Earth-sized is not the only factor that makes the TRAPPIST-1 planets perfect targets for JWST. At 40 light-years away, the system is relatively nearby. Three of them orbit in their star's habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on their surfaces. With the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1 star being so small and dim, signals from the planets will be large enough and strong enough for scientists to isolate their individual atmospheric components. A planet's ability to support life depends not just on its atmosphere containing chemicals such as oxygen, ozone, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water, but also on the proportions of these chemicals within the atmosphere. JWST's infrared capability will identify the contents of the TRAPPIST-1 planets' atmospheres while its spectroscopy will determine the proportions of these biosignatures. Observations will especially focus on the three planets in the star's habitable zone, TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g. With the right atmospheric composition, one or more could have an environment capable of supporting liquid water. Because the seven planets are so close to one another, scientists will be able to study all of them with JWST and compare them with one another in terms of composition and processes. \"This is the first and only system to have seven Earth-sized planets, where three are in the habitable zone of the star,\" noted Hannah Wakeford, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"It is also the first system bright enough, and small enough to make it possible for us to look at each of these planets' atmospheres. With all seven planets Earth-sized, we can look at the different characteristics that make each of them unique and determine critical connections between a planet's conditions and origins,\" she added. The most powerful space telescope ever built, JWST is scheduled to launch in October 2018, so the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system is ideal timing, and scientists are eager to aim the telescope at these seven worlds. Currently, JWST, which has a 6.5-meter (\u223c21 feet) primary mirror, is at Goddard undergoing testing by engineers and scientists. In addition to teasing out the atmospheres of exoplanets, the telescope will also observe the universe's earliest galaxies and use its infrared capability to look into dusty clouds to view the formation of stars and planetary systems.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden hosted a news conference to announce the milestone this morning at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, overlooking the 18 large mirrors that will collect infrared light, sheltered behind a tennis-court-size sun shield. JWST is considered the successor to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope. \"Today, we're celebrating the fact that our telescope is finished, and we're about to prove that it works,\" said John Mather, an astrophysicist and senior project scientist for the telescope. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result - we're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope will be much more powerful than even Hubble for two main reasons, Mather said at the conference. First, it will be the biggest telescope mirror to fly in space. \"You can see this beautiful, gold telescope is seven times the collecting area of the Hubble telescope,\" Mather said. And second, it is designed to collect infrared light, which Hubble is not very sensitive to. Earth's atmosphere glows in the infrared, so such measurements can't be made from the ground. Hubble emits its own heat, which would obscure infrared readings. JWST will run close to absolute zero in temperature and rest at a point in space called the Lagrange Point 2, which is directly behind Earth from the sun's perspective. That way, Earth can shield the telescope from some of the sun's infrared emission, and the sun shield can protect the telescope from both bodies' heat. The telescope's infrared view will pierce through obscuring cosmic dust to reveal the universe's first galaxies and spy on newly forming planetary systems. It also will be sensitive enough to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets that pass in front of their stars, perhaps to search for signs of life, Mather said. The telescope would be able to see a bumblebee a moon's distance away, he added - both in reflected light and in the body heat the bee emitted. Its mirrors are so smooth that if you stretched the array to the size of the U.S., the hills and valleys of irregularity would be only a few inches high, Mather said. In addition to Bolden and Mather, Christopher Scolese, director of the Goddard Space Flight Center; Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's new associate administrator for science; Eric Smith, the telescope's program director; and Bill Ochs, director of the James Webb mission, attended the news conference. \"Some of you that have followed JWST know that it almost didn't happen, and it's mainly because of the people that are sitting here, able to talk to you today, that we're all here and within two years of launch,\" Bolden said. The telescope was originally scheduled to launch in 2014, at a cost of about $5 billion, but a series of setbacks and budget constraints delayed and nearly canceled the project. Now, though, officials affirmed that the telescope is on track and on budget for an October 2018 launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. (As a result of the delays, JWST's cost is now $8.7 billion, Ochs said.) The project is led by NASA but supported by international partners, including the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. The telescope's testing at Goddard, which has already begun, will ensure that it can withstand the shaking and loud noise of a rocket launch. Then, it will be moved to Texas, where its focus will be tested, and then to California for some final assembly. The testing is particularly high-stakes, because unlike Hubble, which was repaired and refocused in orbit by astronauts, this telescope is not intended to be repaired by humans. \"It's critically important to get it right here on the ground, and that's the purpose for the tests that we're doing here and, most importantly, for the tests when we get it down to Johnson [Space Center] in Chamber A, the big vacuum chamber,\" Bolden said. \"[We need to] make sure it can, in fact, be focused, so that we don't find, as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do,\" Bolden said, referring to the repairs needed to focus Hubble after launch. Each of JWST's mirrors is individually tunable, he said, so they can be adjusted without a corrective lens like the one astronauts put on Hubble. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble [telescope incident] were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added. \"And if you don't get the same answer, you'd better figure out why.\" Researchers will make observations with the telescope for at least 5 years, and will carry enough fuel for 10 years - if they're lucky, JWST will last even longer, Mather and Bolden said. They added that the craft will absolutely be hit by space debris over the course of its lifespan, and that it's designed to function fine with small holes in its mirrors. The full telescope, with a 21.3-foot (6.5 meters) mirror assembly, is too large to launch fully extended, so the telescope will be carefully furled during launch and will have to unfold over the course of two weeks once it's in space, Mather said. After that, the sun shield will be extended carefully, and the telescope will be given time to cool down. Finally, it will be focused, they said. By six months after launch, the telescope will be ready to begin doing science. Mather alluded to the \"7 minutes of terror\" of the Curiosity Mars rover's automated landing in 2012 - a famously complicated maneuver that used a rocket-powered sky crane to lower the vehicle to the Martian surface. \"This is six months of terror,\" he said.

And the Daily Mail went large with the all-caps declaration: \"World's biggest space telescope the James Webb is READY.\" Who doesn't want to see a huge observatory go into space, take amazing photos of the universe, maybe help unravel the mysteries of dark matter, and perhaps find out if the nearest Earth-like planet has a cozy, life-cradling atmosphere? I certainly do. But the $8.7 billion telescope is not finished, complete, or ready for launch. On the contrary, the most difficult stages of the its assembly and mission have only just begun. Polishing off the world's most expensive mirror. The rush of JWST news came out after NASA held a press conference on November 2. The big update? Engineers just finished building the most difficult of JWST's three main chunks: the primary mirror segment, shown here. The mirror itself is made out of 18 gold-plated panels of beryllium metal that is \"both strong and lightweight,\" according to NASA. Behind the shiny exterior there's also a suite of instruments and electronics that make it all work - and those have finally been installed and tested, too. \"This telescope segment of NASA's most ambitious space observatory stands complete and tall in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center cleanroom,\" a narrator said in a dramatic YouTube video. Finishing the mirror is indeed a very big deal, since it's the most complex part of JWST. In fact, NASA said it had to create and perfect 10 new technologies to make it work. Arranged like that, JWST's mirror is much too big to fit into any rocket. But it has a trick: The segments partially fold up, allowing it to fit within the tight space of a fairing on top of a rocket. In space, the segments will unfold and work together as one big mirror, helping focus normally invisible infrared light from the universe toward a suite of electronics. \" S cientists will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe,\" NASA employee Sarah Loff wrote in a Nov. 2 image feature. She continued: \"Unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers ... understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years. Webb will see behind cosmic dust clouds to see where stars and planetary systems are being born. It will also help reveal information about atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, and perhaps even find signs of the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.\" JWST is not out of the woods yet, though. Next up: 2 torturous years. Now that the telescope segment is finished, NASA must show that its marvel of engineering can survive launch aboard one of the world's most powerful rockets, then in the harsh environment of space. The space agency has already shaken, chilled, and rattled a lot of JWST's individual components. However, it needs to see if they'll hold up when they're all assembled. So NASA will now subject the entire mirror segment to punishing conditions in labs all over the country in the coming months. \"It - hopefully - is a formality,\" Jason Hylan, the lead engineer for JWST's instruments, told reporter Scott Dance at The Baltimore Sun. Rockets vibrate like crazy as they blast off, so shaking is one key test. Workers in 2015 finished building a house-size table to throttle the telescope, called the Large Vibration Test System, at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland - and that's where they're testing the mirror segment right now. The forces will exceed 10 times gravity's pull. Next, JWST will have to survive one of the loudest rooms on Earth. Called the Acoustic Test Chamber, it's 42 feet tall and has 6-foot-wide speaker horns that will blast out 150 decibels of sound for 2 minutes at a time. If the mirror passes those tests, it will fly aboard a giant jet and to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Engineers will reward the spacecraft by sticking it into a giant cryogenic vacuum chamber, suck out all the air, and let it sit there - freezing at blisteringly cold temperatures - for 90 days. This will simulate what it's like for the mirror to sit completely in the dark of its sunshield some 930,000 miles away from Earth. By August 2017, NASA hopes to ship the mirror to Northrop Grumman's facility in Los Angeles, where workers will attach it to the sunshield and bus, finally completing the telescope. But JWST's tour still won't be over: It will have to make its way to South America. ## Cold and alone in deep space. With help from the European Space Agency, NASA will ship the assembled, folded-up telescope to a launch facility near Kourou, French Guiana, which is just north of Brazil. JWST will launch from French Guiana because the Earth's spin there is more than 1,000 mph, thanks to a significant bulge near the equator. The extra speed of Earth's rotation there will help fling JWST into deep space. NASA, ESA, and a company called Arianespace will load JWST on top of a roughly $200 million rocket. Ideally they'll launch it in October 2018. Assuming the launch goes off without a hitch - the Ariane 5's safety record has been flawless over 74 missions since 2003 - JWST will begin a 30-day journey to a point that's four times farther away than the moon is from Earth. While it flies there, it will gently unfurl its sunshield and instruments over the course of two weeks. Here's how that might look, according to a Northrop Grumman animation: Its final destination is a location where the gravitational pulls of Earth, the moon, and the sun cancel out into a very stable Lagrange point, called L2. By hanging out at L2, the telescope will barely move, protecting its shiny and fragile sunshield from being torn to shreds. JWST will also stay far away from the atmospheric gases of Earth, which can slow it down and mess with its orbit. Staying within the L2 point will also ensure the telescope's sensitive mirror is always pointed into the blackness of space, while its reflectors bouncing away warm sunlight. After 4 to 6 months of cooling down, the mirror will be a mind-numbing -388 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing JWST to start its mission of peering at infrared light from the depths of space sometime in early 2019. JWST could see objects that are 10 to 100 times dimmer than what Hubble can make out, and it will do so for about 5 to 10 years. But the telescope could last much longer than that, considering the Hubble telescope has lived on for more than 26 years. But there's a catch here. JWST's distance from Earth - 930,000 miles away - is perhaps the most nerve- wracking part of JWST's mission. If anything goes wrong after launch, people on Earth could only remotely reprogram the spacecraft, assuming they can still talk to it. That's because there is no rocket or spacecraft capable of sending a crewed mission to fix JWST. This is unlike the Hubble telescope, which astronauts serviced a few times from about 500 miles above Earth. This means just one physical problem might turn JWST into a $8.7 billion white elephant. So come October 2018, we'll be wishing NASA the best of luck as JWST makes the trip to this cold and lonely point in deep space, nearly a million miles away from home.

Nearly 20 years after its engineers began construction, Nasa began testing this week on the largest space telescope ever built, a 21ft arrangement of mirrors and instruments that is meant to succeed the Hubble telescope and look through 13bn years of space. Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We're opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\" The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa's famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope's own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble's, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST's greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \"seven times the collecting area\" of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time - at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars' light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\"redshifted\") it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble's view. The telescope will now be subjected to two years of tests before its planned launch in 2018. Unlike Hubble, it will be sent far from where astronauts could repair it, and Nasa said it will first test the JWST for the \"violent sound and vibration environments\" of a rocket launch, including tests of forces 10 times stronger than gravity and blasts of sound to mimic rocket explosions. Then they will test for the conditions the JWST will face during two weeks of delicate unfurling in space and years in orbit. In February, the scientists will send it to a chamber at the Johnson Space Center that can be lowered to -220C (about -370F), and Bolden said it is designed to survive collisions with space debris and small holes in its mirrors, and that the telescope will need six months in space before it's ready for work. He added that scientists need to \"get it right here on the ground\" to avoid finding, \"as we did with Hubble, that we don't have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do\". The JWST was originally meant to launch in 2014, but the project was nearly canceled by Congress in 2011 due to delays and budget problems. \"Our lessons learned from the Hubble were, if you really care about something, you've got to measure it at least twice,\" Mather added, alluding to repairs astronauts had to make after launch. Bolden said the telescope will help scientists see stars and planets from the earliest epoch of the universe. \"Nasa has always sought to unravel the mysteries of our universe; to find out where we come from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the universe,\" he said in a later statement. \"We are building the James Webb Space Telescope to answer these age-old questions.\" ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/04/nasa-testing-james-webb-space-telescope-gold"}, {"title": "NASA has completed the $8.7 billion James Webb space telescope", "date": "2016-11-07", "content": "The Hubble Space Telescope has given humanity unprecedented glimpses into the universe, but it will soon be replaced by a far more powerful model. NASA administrator Charles Bolden unveiled the completed $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope , which will be able to see the universe as it was 13 billion years ago. It's equipped with a 21-foot, gold-coated mirror array that can collect seven times more light than Hubble and scan the infrared spectrum to see through dust. \"We've done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\" project scientist John Mather says. On top of peering into the deepest, oldest regions of the universe, the telescope has enough power to hunt for habitable exoplanets. \"We'd like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\" says Mather. Thanks to its relatively large, extremely smooth mirror -- which would have defects just a few inches high if stretched to the size of the United States -- it has enough power to detect a bumblebee on the moon. To detect infrared light, the JWST will be cooled to around -220 degrees Celcius. To achieve that temperature, it's insulated from the sun by five membrane layers, each no thicker than a human hair. Those membranes were finished just last week, marking an end to construction of the telescope. The team will now start a rigorous battery of tests to avoid problems the Hubble had, since the JWST will be nearly a million miles from Earth). First, scientists will rattle the device and blast it with 150 decibels of noise to simulate launch conditions on the giant Ariane 5 rocket. Then, it'll undergo cryogenic testing to confirm it can survive the extreme temperatures of space. Lastly, it'll undergo final performance tests to ensure there are no Hubble-like optical defects. The entire James Webb mission, slated for October, 2018, will keep astronomers on edge for a full month. It'll be launched by the ESA's Ariane 5 rocket, considered the world's most reliable vehicle. It'll then make a 30-day, one-million-mile trip to the second Lagrange point, and will deploy its antenna, sunshield, secondary mirror, and primary mirror wings en route. The first images, likely of a relatively bright star or star field, will be the final proof that everything went to plan. Considering everything that could go wrong and the dollars at stake, the scientists behind it probably won't exhale until they see those early pictures.

Now researchers must conduct a series of tests to prove that JWST can survive launch and that its mirrors will focus properly at near-absolute-zero temperatures. The telescope will then be mated to the bus carrying the solar array, sun shield, and communications and data storage components, and the assembly will be transported to French Guiana for an October 2018 launch date. With a primary mirror that is seven times the size of the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror, JWST is expected to be capable of probing the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets and observing the birth of stars and planets. Originally estimated to cost $1.6 billion and set to launch in 2011, JWST came close to being terminated by Congress in 2011 due to cost overruns. Recently, however, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said he is \"very confident\" that the telescope will now remain within its new cost profile, capped at $8 billion, and stay on schedule. The total cost of the project, including five years of operation, is estimated at $8.7 billion. The telescope will carry sufficient fuel to stay in orbit for at least 10 years, and possibly 12, says Bill Ochs, JWST project manager. The telescope, including its four imaging and guidance instruments, will now undergo acoustic and vibrational testing at Goddard, where it was built. It will then be transported to Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a cryogenic test, and then to a Northrop Grumman facility in Los Angeles, where the bus is being assembled. A European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket will carry JWST into space. The primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal segments that will unfold and adjust to shape following launch. The mirror is made of beryllium and coated with a total of three ounces of gold, which is ultrasensitive to the IR light that the telescope is built to observe. Each mirror segment is so smooth that if it were scaled to the size of the continental US, the highest mountain peaks would rise just two inches. Unlike Hubble, which has been serviced five times over 26 years, JWST is not designed to be serviced in space. The telescope will be placed in orbit around the Lagrangian 2 (L2) point, which is about 1.5 million km from Earth; Hubble is in low Earth orbit. By orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST can stay in constant contact with Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network, and its solar panels can generate energy continuously. To prevent IR emissions that would reduce the quality of imagery, JWST's tennis court-sized sun shield will maintain the telescope's ambient temperature at about 50 K. The telescope is so sensitive that \"if you were a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon, we'd be able to see you both by your reflection of sunlight and by the thermal radiation you emit,\" says Nobel laureate John Mather, the telescope's senior project scientist. Two of JWST's four instruments, a near-IR spectrograph and a mid-IR instrument, were built mainly by ESA. A near-IR camera was built by the University of Arizona, and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in December 2017, will catalog small exoplanets, which could provide targets for JWST to examine for signs of life, such as water vapor. JWST also will be trained on dwarf planets in the solar system. Developers of the telescope's instruments are guaranteed first crack at observing time, along with some \"interdisciplinary scientists who have very important broad generic science programs,\" says Gerard Kriss of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the JWST ground control center. STScI will begin soliciting those proposals in January. Also in the queue will be \"early release observations,\" which, he says, are \"the kind of pictures that are meant to show we have a functional observatory and are meant to be beautiful.\" ", "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.5.1099/full/"}, {"title": "Some Assembly Required: New Space Telescope Will Take Shape After Launch", "date": "2016-11-28", "content": "The next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. But before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. For example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. But to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold - very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \"That's like a big umbrella - beach umbrella - so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Bego\u00f1a Vila, an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" Now, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space - about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. Then, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video. Many of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" The Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared.

After conducting both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, engineers have found it to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" But because so much is on the line with NASA's $8.8 Billion groundbreaking Webb telescope mission that will peer back to nearly the dawn of time, engineers are still investigating the \"root cause\" of the \"vibration anomaly\" first detected amidst shake testing on Dec. 3. \"The team is making good progress at identifying the root cause of the vibration anomaly,\" NASA explained in a Dec 23 statement - much to everyone's relief! \"They have successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.\" \"All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the structure continue to show it to be sound.\" Starting late November, technicians began a defined series of environmental tests including vibration and acoustics tests to make sure that the telescopes huge optical structure was fit for blastoff and could safely withstand the powerful shaking encountered during a rocket launch and the especially harsh rigors of the space environment. It would be useless otherwise - unable to carry out unparallelled science. To carry out the vibration and acoustics tests conducted on equipment located in a shirtsleeve environment, the telescope structure was first carefully placed inside a 'clean tent' structure to protect it from dirt and grime and maintain the pristine clean room conditions available inside Goddard's massive clean room - where it has been undergoing assembly for the past year. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is undergoing testing to make sure the spacecraft withstands the harsh conditions of launch, and to find and remedy all possible concerns before it is launched from French Guiana in 2018.\" However, shortly after the vibration testing began technicians soon discovered unexpected \"anomalous readings\" during a shake test of the telescope on Dec. 3, as the agency initially announced in a status update on the JWST website. The anomalous readings were found during one of the vibration tests in progress on the shaker table, via accelerometers attached to the observatories optical structure known as OTIS. \"During the vibration testing on December 3, at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, accelerometers attached to the telescope detected anomalous readings during a particular test,\" the team elaborated. So the team quickly conducted further \"low level vibration\" tests and inspections to more fully understand the nature of the anomaly, as well as scrutinize the accelerometer data for clues. \"Further tests to identify the source of the anomaly are underway. The engineering team investigating the vibe anomaly has made numerous detailed visual inspections of the Webb telescope and has found no visible signs of damage.\" \"They are continuing their analysis of accelerometer data to better determine the source of the anomaly.\" The team is measuring and recording the responses of the structure to the fresh low level vibration tests and will compare these new data to results obtained prior to detection of the anomaly. Work continues over the holidays to ensure Webb is safe and sound and can meet its 2018 launch target. After thoroughly reviewing all the data the team hope to restart the planned vibration and acoustic testing in the new year. \"Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.\" Webb's massive optical structure being tested is known as OTIS or Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science. It includes the fully assembled 18-segment gold coated primary mirror and the science instrument module housing the four science instruments. OTIS is a combination of the OTE (Optical Telescope Assembly) and the ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) together. \"OTIS is essentially the entire optical train of the observatory!\" said John Durning, Webb Telescope Deputy Project Manager, in an earlier exclusive interview with Universe Today at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's the critical photon path for the system.\" The components were fully integrated this past summer at Goddard. The combined OTIS entity of mirrors, science module and backplane truss weighs 8786 lbs (3940 kg) and measures 28'3\" (8.6m) x 8\"5\" (2.6 m) x 7\"10\" (2.4 m). The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Webb is designed to look at the first light of the Universe and will be able to peer back in time to when the first stars and first galaxies were forming. It will also study the history of our universe and the formation of our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets, some of which may be capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth.

The vibration tests are conducted by the team on a shaker table at Goddard to ensure Webb's worthiness and that it will survive the rough and rumbling ride experienced during the thunderous rocket launch to the heavens slated for late 2018. \"Testing on the ground is critical to proving a spacecraft is safe to launch,\" said Lee Feinberg, an engineer and James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at Goddard, in a statement. \"The Webb telescope is the most dynamically complicated article of space hardware that we've ever tested.\" The 18-segment gold coated primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is raised into vertical alignment in the largest clean room at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2016. The secondary mirror mount booms are folded down into stowed for launch configuration. Testing of the gargantuan Webb Telescope had ground to a halt after a brief scare in early December when technicians initially detected \"anomalous readings\" that raised potential concerns about the observatories structural integrity partway through a preplanned series of vibration tests. \"On December 3, 2016, vibration testing automatically shut down early due to some sensor readings that exceeded predicted levels,\" officials said. There after, engineers and technicians carried out a new batch of intensive inspections of the observatory's structure during December. Shortly before Christmas, NASA announced on Dec. 23 that JWST was deemed \"sound\" and apparently unscathed after engineers conducted both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Officials said the telescope was found to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" As it turned out the culprit of the sensor anomaly was the many \"tie-down ... restraint mechanisms \" that hold the telescope in place. \"After a thorough investigation, the James Webb Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard determined that the cause was extremely small motions of the numerous tie-downs or \"launch restraint mechanisms\" that keep one of the telescope's mirror wings folded-up for launch,\" NASA officials explained in a statement. Furthermore engineers revealingly discovered that \"the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment.\" NASA reported today (Jan. 25) that the testing resumed last week at the point where it had been paused. Furthermore the testing was completed along the first of three axis. \"In-depth analysis of the test sensor data and detailed computer simulations confirmed that the input vibration was strong enough and the resonance of the telescope high enough at specific vibration frequencies to generate these tiny motions. Now that we understand how it happened, we have implemented changes to the test profile to prevent it from happening again,\" explained Feinberg. \"We have learned valuable lessons that will be applied to the final pre-launch tests of Webb at the observatory level once it is fully assembled in 2018. Fortunately, by learning these lessons early, we've been able to add diagnostic tests that let us show how the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment in a way that can give us confidence that the launch itself will be fully successful.\" The next step is to resume and complete shaking the telescope in the other two axis, or \"two directions to show that it can withstand vibrations in all three dimensions.\" \"This was a great team effort between the NASA Goddard team, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK, Ball Aerospace, the European Space Agency, and Arianespace,\" Feinberg said. \"We can now proceed with the rest of the planned tests of the telescope and instruments.\" NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

But Webb and its 18 segment \"golden\" primary mirror have to be carefully folded up to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane V booster. \"Due to its immense size, Webb has to be folded-up for launch and then unfolded in space. Prior generations of telescopes relied on rigid, non-moving structures for their stability. Because our mirror is larger than the rocket fairing we needed structures folded for launch and moved once we're out of Earth's atmosphere. Webb is the first time we're building for both stability and mobility.\" Feinberg said. \"This means that JWST testing is very unique, complex, and challenging.\" The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber.

Viewed as the Hubble Space Telescope's scientific successor, JWST, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency, will observe in the infrared and use spectroscopy to identify the chemical contents of exoplanets' atmospheres. Spectroscopy separates light into individual wavelengths. Every chemical has its own unique wavelength signature, so the technique is capable of identifying individual atmospheric components. This means JWST will be able to search the atmospheres of all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets - assuming all have atmospheres - for chemicals produced by biological processes, known as chemical biomarkers. Two such chemicals are ozone and methane. On Earth, ozone forms mostly through interaction between oxygen produced by plant life during photosynthesis and sunlight. Atmospheric ozone also protects life on Earth from harmful solar radiation. Finding methane could be a first step toward locating a biological source of the oxygen that goes into the formation of ozone. \"If these planets have atmospheres, the James Webb Space Telescope will be the key to unlocking their secrets. In the meantime, NASA's missions like Spitzer, Hubble, and Kepler are following up on these planets,\" said NASA Exoplanet Program scientist Doug Hudgins. Being Earth-sized is not the only factor that makes the TRAPPIST-1 planets perfect targets for JWST. At 40 light-years away, the system is relatively nearby. Three of them orbit in their star's habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on their surfaces. With the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1 star being so small and dim, signals from the planets will be large enough and strong enough for scientists to isolate their individual atmospheric components. A planet's ability to support life depends not just on its atmosphere containing chemicals such as oxygen, ozone, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water, but also on the proportions of these chemicals within the atmosphere. JWST's infrared capability will identify the contents of the TRAPPIST-1 planets' atmospheres while its spectroscopy will determine the proportions of these biosignatures. Observations will especially focus on the three planets in the star's habitable zone, TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g. With the right atmospheric composition, one or more could have an environment capable of supporting liquid water. Because the seven planets are so close to one another, scientists will be able to study all of them with JWST and compare them with one another in terms of composition and processes. \"This is the first and only system to have seven Earth-sized planets, where three are in the habitable zone of the star,\" noted Hannah Wakeford, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"It is also the first system bright enough, and small enough to make it possible for us to look at each of these planets' atmospheres. With all seven planets Earth-sized, we can look at the different characteristics that make each of them unique and determine critical connections between a planet's conditions and origins,\" she added. The most powerful space telescope ever built, JWST is scheduled to launch in October 2018, so the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system is ideal timing, and scientists are eager to aim the telescope at these seven worlds. Currently, JWST, which has a 6.5-meter (\u223c21 feet) primary mirror, is at Goddard undergoing testing by engineers and scientists. In addition to teasing out the atmospheres of exoplanets, the telescope will also observe the universe's earliest galaxies and use its infrared capability to look into dusty clouds to view the formation of stars and planetary systems.

After it launches in late 2018, it will return groundbreaking images of distant planets, ancient galaxies and more. Space.com talked with astrophysicist Amber Straughn at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland about the testing process and the new telescope's potential. \"This is the largest and most complex telescope that NASA has ever built,\" Straughn told Space.com. \"We will look back in time over 13 and a half billion years to see some of the first galaxies that were born, we will be able to peer through dust clouds to see the sights of star formation within our own Milky Way Galaxy. We're really set to, I think, revolutionize astronomy again with this telescope.\" The James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in late 2018, is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built - and now it's time to make sure it'd survive the trip to space. The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it will have about seven times the light-collecting area - while Hubble's the size of a school bus, the JWST stands about 3.5 stories tall, Straughn said. To get its 18 large mirrors into position, it will fold up like \"space origami\" on a European Ariane 5 rocket. Once in space, it would navigate to a point called Lagrange Point 2, a spot about four times farther than the moon from Earth in a direction opposite the sun, giving it a clear view of deep space. To make sure it'd survive the flight, Goddard personnel are running the telescope through intensive testing re-creating every hostile element of its trip. \"We've just finished some really critical testing of the telescope,\" Straughn said. \" The launch of a telescope is one of the most violent events that a telescope endures, so we shake the telescope to make sure it will endure the stresses of launch. We blast sound at it so it will endure the pressures that it experiences during launch.\" Engineers also test each component in cold chambers, to reflect the chill of outer space. Once the environmental tests are complete, the JWST will be shipped to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas for optical testing in a vacuum and the cold, and then it will head to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in California for its final assembly and testing, NASA officials said in a statement. Because of its extreme sensitivity, researchers anticipate collecting infrared light from some of the very first galaxies, and peering in on the atmospheres of far-away exoplanets, as well. In particular, many are excited about the newly discovered TRAPPIST-1 system, an ultracool red dwarf star with seven Earth-size planets in tight orbits. \"We had this remarkable discovery just a few weeks ago of the TRAPPIST-1 planet system, and with Webb we want to go one step further,\" Straughn said. \"Webb will be perfect for studying this planet system.\" \"With Webb, what we'll do is we'll watch the starlight as it filters through the planets atmospheres, if they have atmospheres ... and we'll be able to determine the chemical components of those atmospheres; things like water vapor and carbon dioxide and methane, things that would signal habitability,\" she said.

After conducting both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, engineers have found it to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" But because so much is on the line with NASA's $8.8 Billion groundbreaking Webb telescope mission that will peer back to nearly the dawn of time, engineers are still investigating the \"root cause\" of the \"vibration anomaly\" first detected amidst shake testing on Dec. 3. \"The team is making good progress at identifying the root cause of the vibration anomaly,\" NASA explained in a Dec 23 statement - much to everyone's relief! \"They have successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.\" \"All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the structure continue to show it to be sound.\" Starting late November, technicians began a defined series of environmental tests including vibration and acoustics tests to make sure that the telescopes huge optical structure was fit for blastoff and could safely withstand the powerful shaking encountered during a rocket launch and the especially harsh rigors of the space environment. It would be useless otherwise - unable to carry out unparallelled science. To carry out the vibration and acoustics tests conducted on equipment located in a shirtsleeve environment, the telescope structure was first carefully placed inside a 'clean tent' structure to protect it from dirt and grime and maintain the pristine clean room conditions available inside Goddard's massive clean room - where it has been undergoing assembly for the past year. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is undergoing testing to make sure the spacecraft withstands the harsh conditions of launch, and to find and remedy all possible concerns before it is launched from French Guiana in 2018.\" However, shortly after the vibration testing began technicians soon discovered unexpected \"anomalous readings\" during a shake test of the telescope on Dec. 3, as the agency initially announced in a status update on the JWST website. The anomalous readings were found during one of the vibration tests in progress on the shaker table, via accelerometers attached to the observatories optical structure known as OTIS. \"During the vibration testing on December 3, at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, accelerometers attached to the telescope detected anomalous readings during a particular test,\" the team elaborated. So the team quickly conducted further \"low level vibration\" tests and inspections to more fully understand the nature of the anomaly, as well as scrutinize the accelerometer data for clues. \"Further tests to identify the source of the anomaly are underway. The engineering team investigating the vibe anomaly has made numerous detailed visual inspections of the Webb telescope and has found no visible signs of damage.\" \"They are continuing their analysis of accelerometer data to better determine the source of the anomaly.\" The team is measuring and recording the responses of the structure to the fresh low level vibration tests and will compare these new data to results obtained prior to detection of the anomaly. Work continues over the holidays to ensure Webb is safe and sound and can meet its 2018 launch target. After thoroughly reviewing all the data the team hope to restart the planned vibration and acoustic testing in the new year. \"Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.\" Webb's massive optical structure being tested is known as OTIS or Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science. It includes the fully assembled 18-segment gold coated primary mirror and the science instrument module housing the four science instruments. OTIS is a combination of the OTE (Optical Telescope Assembly) and the ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) together. \"OTIS is essentially the entire optical train of the observatory!\" said John Durning, Webb Telescope Deputy Project Manager, in an earlier exclusive interview with Universe Today at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"It's the critical photon path for the system.\" The components were fully integrated this past summer at Goddard. The combined OTIS entity of mirrors, science module and backplane truss weighs 8786 lbs (3940 kg) and measures 28'3\" (8.6m) x 8\"5\" (2.6 m) x 7\"10\" (2.4 m). The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

The vibration tests are conducted by the team on a shaker table at Goddard to ensure Webb's worthiness and that it will survive the rough and rumbling ride experienced during the thunderous rocket launch to the heavens slated for late 2018. \"Testing on the ground is critical to proving a spacecraft is safe to launch,\" said Lee Feinberg, an engineer and James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at Goddard, in a statement. \"The Webb telescope is the most dynamically complicated article of space hardware that we've ever tested.\" The 18-segment gold coated primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is raised into vertical alignment in the largest clean room at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2016. The secondary mirror mount booms are folded down into stowed for launch configuration. Testing of the gargantuan Webb Telescope had ground to a halt after a brief scare in early December when technicians initially detected \"anomalous readings\" that raised potential concerns about the observatories structural integrity partway through a preplanned series of vibration tests. \"On December 3, 2016, vibration testing automatically shut down early due to some sensor readings that exceeded predicted levels,\" officials said. There after, engineers and technicians carried out a new batch of intensive inspections of the observatory's structure during December. Shortly before Christmas, NASA announced on Dec. 23 that JWST was deemed \"sound\" and apparently unscathed after engineers conducted both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Officials said the telescope was found to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" As it turned out the culprit of the sensor anomaly was the many \"tie-down ... restraint mechanisms \" that hold the telescope in place. \"After a thorough investigation, the James Webb Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard determined that the cause was extremely small motions of the numerous tie-downs or \"launch restraint mechanisms\" that keep one of the telescope's mirror wings folded-up for launch,\" NASA officials explained in a statement. Furthermore engineers revealingly discovered that \"the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment.\" NASA reported today (Jan. 25) that the testing resumed last week at the point where it had been paused. Furthermore the testing was completed along the first of three axis. \"In-depth analysis of the test sensor data and detailed computer simulations confirmed that the input vibration was strong enough and the resonance of the telescope high enough at specific vibration frequencies to generate these tiny motions. Now that we understand how it happened, we have implemented changes to the test profile to prevent it from happening again,\" explained Feinberg. \"We have learned valuable lessons that will be applied to the final pre-launch tests of Webb at the observatory level once it is fully assembled in 2018. Fortunately, by learning these lessons early, we've been able to add diagnostic tests that let us show how the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment in a way that can give us confidence that the launch itself will be fully successful.\" The next step is to resume and complete shaking the telescope in the other two axis, or \"two directions to show that it can withstand vibrations in all three dimensions.\" \"This was a great team effort between the NASA Goddard team, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK, Ball Aerospace, the European Space Agency, and Arianespace,\" Feinberg said. \"We can now proceed with the rest of the planned tests of the telescope and instruments.\" NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

But Webb and its 18 segment \"golden\" primary mirror have to be carefully folded up to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane V booster. \"Due to its immense size, Webb has to be folded-up for launch and then unfolded in space. Prior generations of telescopes relied on rigid, non-moving structures for their stability. Because our mirror is larger than the rocket fairing we needed structures folded for launch and moved once we're out of Earth's atmosphere. Webb is the first time we're building for both stability and mobility.\" Feinberg said. \"This means that JWST testing is very unique, complex, and challenging.\" The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber.

The images the observatory beams back will be processed and shared with the world from offices just down the hall and up the street. As anticipation builds ahead of the Webb telescope's October 2018 launch, Baltimore scientists are readying the facilities, equipment, software and personnel that will serve as its eyes and brain on Earth. Researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the edge of the Johns Hopkins University campus will guide the process of deciding where to point the telescope and what to study, as they now do for the Hubble Space Telescope. Institute engineers will hold the reins, radioing instructions to the telescope 1 million miles away and downloading hundreds of gigabits of data every day. \"Two minutes after launch, it'll be the nerve center,\" said Joel Green, a project scientist in the institute's office of public outreach. For the institute, operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the responsibility is heavy but familiar. From 1999 to 2006, it ran both Hubble's scientific endeavors and its operations. In 2006, the control room moved down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. With less than a year and a half to go before Webb's honeycomb-shaped mirror and tennis court-sized sun shield are folded up, loaded onto a rocket and hurled into space, preparations are accelerating. The telescope's mirror and instruments, constructed at Goddard over the past few years, will head soon to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston for the next phase of testing. A collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the telescope is to be launched from French Guiana aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket. In Baltimore, some of the last equipment and software needed for the launch arrived on the second floor of the institute's San Martin Drive headquarters in January. Scientists are busy testing them and learning how they will use them in the big moments to come. \"We're conducting rehearsals as though it was launch day,\" said Rusty Whitman, flight operations system engineering manager. \"We will do that over and over again just like rehearsals for a play. Everyone has a part to play, and everyone has to know their lines.\" Webb is the next-generation telescope that has been in planning since Hubble's earliest days in space more than 25 years ago. Where Hubble, launched in 1990, dramatically transformed understanding of the universe and its history, Webb is designed to see at far greater distances, and with greater sensitivity and clarity. Scientists are hopeful Hubble will remain operational well into Webb's mission, so that when the new telescope discovers objects of interest, Hubble can follow along. Working together, with their complementary designs and strengths, the two telescopes are expected to again rewrite astronomy books. Astronomers around the world already are brainstorming the research they will be able to pursue - watching the formation of young galaxies, probing around black holes, searching for and exploring Earthlike planets. They are sharing their ideas with scientists at the Baltimore institute, which will coordinate the telescope's order of observations. The start of that exploration is still about two years away. Once Webb leaves Earth, it is scheduled to take six months to unfold, reach its orbit, boot up and get aligned for operation. But given the complexity of the launch and the mission, crunch time is already arriving for the institute's crew. About 150 people in Baltimore are expected to staff the launch. One hundred will remain based in the flight operations center and adjoining control rooms 24 hours a day, seven days a week during Webb's six-month commissioning, Whitman said. That requires training a lot of people. The institute employs about 700, spread across its headquarters, its offices at Hopkins' Physics and Astronomy Building across San Martin Drive and at the Stieff Silver Building and the Rotunda in Hampden. \"We cross-train a lot of people,\" Whitman said. \"We have at least one backup, if not more, for each role.\" If anyone leaves their job, the scientists will have to get someone new up to speed quickly. But most are so dedicated to the long-awaited mission and eager to see it through, Whitman said, that \"turnover is not usually a big problem.\" Testing is already underway to ensure there is no difficulty communicating with the Deep Space Network, NASA's set of 230-foot-tall antennas in California, Spain and Australia. The network will be in constant communication with Webb during its commissioning. It will eventually cut that contact down to two four-hour exchanges each day. The institute is also readying for the masses of data Webb will send back, with plans to store the information in basement servers while exploring other big data solutions, Green said. It performed a similar function for Hubble from 1999 to 2006. This time around, Webb will transmit hundreds of times more data. Eric Smith, program director for NASA, said the space agency decided years ago to locate the primary mission operations center at the Baltimore institute for reasons of efficiency. \"The idea was to have the end-to-end missions operations within one organization ... to streamline things and reduce costs,\" he wrote in an email. The institute's past leaders have downplayed the importance of hosting the control center. When it was shifted south to Goddard in 2006, Bruce Margon, then the institute's associate director for science, told The Baltimore Sun the move was of \"essentially no significance.\" Given the speed and ease of electronic communication, there is less of a case for combining Webb's scientific and operational headquarters than there was with Hubble, said Robert Williams, the institute's director from 1993 to 1998. But it is still easier when in-person meetings are required, he said. \"We spend an awful lot of time on the parkway between here and Goddard,\" Williams said. Other scientists said it will be valuable to have the engineers guiding the telescope and the astronomers using it in the same place. After all, for the engineers, Whitman said, \"their whole reason to be here is to support the science.\" And there is also symbolic meaning. \"It feels like the heartbeat of JWST will be in the building,\" Summers said.

The vibration tests are conducted by the team on a shaker table at Goddard to ensure Webb's worthiness and that it will survive the rough and rumbling ride experienced during the thunderous rocket launch to the heavens slated for late 2018. \"Testing on the ground is critical to proving a spacecraft is safe to launch,\" said Lee Feinberg, an engineer and James Webb Space Telescope Optical Telescope Element Manager at Goddard, in a statement. \"The Webb telescope is the most dynamically complicated article of space hardware that we've ever tested.\" The 18-segment gold coated primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is raised into vertical alignment in the largest clean room at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2016. The secondary mirror mount booms are folded down into stowed for launch configuration. Testing of the gargantuan Webb Telescope had ground to a halt after a brief scare in early December when technicians initially detected \"anomalous readings\" that raised potential concerns about the observatories structural integrity partway through a preplanned series of vibration tests. \"On December 3, 2016, vibration testing automatically shut down early due to some sensor readings that exceeded predicted levels,\" officials said. There after, engineers and technicians carried out a new batch of intensive inspections of the observatory's structure during December. Shortly before Christmas, NASA announced on Dec. 23 that JWST was deemed \"sound\" and apparently unscathed after engineers conducted both \"visual and ultrasonic examinations\" at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Officials said the telescope was found to be safe at this point with \"no visible signs of damage.\" As it turned out the culprit of the sensor anomaly was the many \"tie-down ... restraint mechanisms \" that hold the telescope in place. \"After a thorough investigation, the James Webb Space Telescope team at NASA Goddard determined that the cause was extremely small motions of the numerous tie-downs or \"launch restraint mechanisms\" that keep one of the telescope's mirror wings folded-up for launch,\" NASA officials explained in a statement. Furthermore engineers revealingly discovered that \"the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment.\" NASA reported today (Jan. 25) that the testing resumed last week at the point where it had been paused. Furthermore the testing was completed along the first of three axis. \"In-depth analysis of the test sensor data and detailed computer simulations confirmed that the input vibration was strong enough and the resonance of the telescope high enough at specific vibration frequencies to generate these tiny motions. Now that we understand how it happened, we have implemented changes to the test profile to prevent it from happening again,\" explained Feinberg. \"We have learned valuable lessons that will be applied to the final pre-launch tests of Webb at the observatory level once it is fully assembled in 2018. Fortunately, by learning these lessons early, we've been able to add diagnostic tests that let us show how the ground vibration test itself is more severe than the launch vibration environment in a way that can give us confidence that the launch itself will be fully successful.\" The next step is to resume and complete shaking the telescope in the other two axis, or \"two directions to show that it can withstand vibrations in all three dimensions.\" \"This was a great team effort between the NASA Goddard team, Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK, Ball Aerospace, the European Space Agency, and Arianespace,\" Feinberg said. \"We can now proceed with the rest of the planned tests of the telescope and instruments.\" NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful space telescope ever built and is the scientific successor to the phenomenally successful Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mammoth 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror has enough light gathering capability to scan back over 13.5 billion years and see the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The Webb telescope will launch on an ESA Ariane V booster from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana in 2018. But Webb and its 18 segment \"golden\" primary mirror have to be carefully folded up to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane V booster. \"Due to its immense size, Webb has to be folded-up for launch and then unfolded in space. Prior generations of telescopes relied on rigid, non-moving structures for their stability. Because our mirror is larger than the rocket fairing we needed structures folded for launch and moved once we're out of Earth's atmosphere. Webb is the first time we're building for both stability and mobility.\" Feinberg said. \"This means that JWST testing is very unique, complex, and challenging.\" The environmental testing is being done at Goddard before shipping the huge structure to NASA's Johnson Space Center in February 2017 for further ultra low temperature testing in the cryovac thermal vacuum chamber. The 6.5 meter diameter 'golden' primary mirror is comprised of 18 hexagonal segments - looking honeycomb-like in appearance. And it's just mesmerizing to gaze at - as I had the opportunity to do on a few occasions at Goddard this past year - standing vertically in November and seated horizontally in May. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped primary mirror segments measures just over 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) across and weighs approximately 88 pounds (40 kilograms). They are made of beryllium, gold coated and about the size of a coffee table. The Webb Telescope is a joint international collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Webb is designed to look at the first light of the Universe and will be able to peer back in time to when the first stars and first galaxies were forming. It will also study the history of our universe and the formation of our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets, some of which may be capable of supporting life on planets similar to Earth.

Viewed as the Hubble Space Telescope's scientific successor, JWST, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency, will observe in the infrared and use spectroscopy to identify the chemical contents of exoplanets' atmospheres. Spectroscopy separates light into individual wavelengths. Every chemical has its own unique wavelength signature, so the technique is capable of identifying individual atmospheric components. This means JWST will be able to search the atmospheres of all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets - assuming all have atmospheres - for chemicals produced by biological processes, known as chemical biomarkers. Two such chemicals are ozone and methane. On Earth, ozone forms mostly through interaction between oxygen produced by plant life during photosynthesis and sunlight. Atmospheric ozone also protects life on Earth from harmful solar radiation. Finding methane could be a first step toward locating a biological source of the oxygen that goes into the formation of ozone. \"If these planets have atmospheres, the James Webb Space Telescope will be the key to unlocking their secrets. In the meantime, NASA's missions like Spitzer, Hubble, and Kepler are following up on these planets,\" said NASA Exoplanet Program scientist Doug Hudgins. Being Earth-sized is not the only factor that makes the TRAPPIST-1 planets perfect targets for JWST. At 40 light-years away, the system is relatively nearby. Three of them orbit in their star's habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water to exist on their surfaces. With the red dwarf TRAPPIST-1 star being so small and dim, signals from the planets will be large enough and strong enough for scientists to isolate their individual atmospheric components. A planet's ability to support life depends not just on its atmosphere containing chemicals such as oxygen, ozone, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water, but also on the proportions of these chemicals within the atmosphere. JWST's infrared capability will identify the contents of the TRAPPIST-1 planets' atmospheres while its spectroscopy will determine the proportions of these biosignatures. Observations will especially focus on the three planets in the star's habitable zone, TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g. With the right atmospheric composition, one or more could have an environment capable of supporting liquid water. Because the seven planets are so close to one another, scientists will be able to study all of them with JWST and compare them with one another in terms of composition and processes. \"This is the first and only system to have seven Earth-sized planets, where three are in the habitable zone of the star,\" noted Hannah Wakeford, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"It is also the first system bright enough, and small enough to make it possible for us to look at each of these planets' atmospheres. With all seven planets Earth-sized, we can look at the different characteristics that make each of them unique and determine critical connections between a planet's conditions and origins,\" she added.

Currently, JWST, which has a 6.5-meter (\u223c21 feet) primary mirror, is at Goddard undergoing testing by engineers and scientists. In addition to teasing out the atmospheres of exoplanets, the telescope will also observe the universe's earliest galaxies and use its infrared capability to look into dusty clouds to view the formation of stars and planetary systems.

After it launches in late 2018, it will return groundbreaking images of distant planets, ancient galaxies and more. Space.com talked with astrophysicist Amber Straughn at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland about the testing process and the new telescope's potential. \"This is the largest and most complex telescope that NASA has ever built,\" Straughn told Space.com. \"We will look back in time over 13 and a half billion years to see some of the first galaxies that were born, we will be able to peer through dust clouds to see the sights of star formation within our own Milky Way Galaxy. We're really set to, I think, revolutionize astronomy again with this telescope.\" The James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in late 2018, is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built - and now it's time to make sure it'd survive the trip to space. The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it will have about seven times the light-collecting area - while Hubble's the size of a school bus, the JWST stands about 3.5 stories tall, Straughn said. To get its 18 large mirrors into position, it will fold up like \"space origami\" on a European Ariane 5 rocket. Once in space, it would navigate to a point called Lagrange Point 2, a spot about four times farther than the moon from Earth in a direction opposite the sun, giving it a clear view of deep space. To make sure it'd survive the flight, Goddard personnel are running the telescope through intensive testing re-creating every hostile element of its trip. \"We've just finished some really critical testing of the telescope,\" Straughn said. \" The launch of a telescope is one of the most violent events that a telescope endures, so we shake the telescope to make sure it will endure the stresses of launch. We blast sound at it so it will endure the pressures that it experiences during launch.\" Engineers also test each component in cold chambers, to reflect the chill of outer space. Once the environmental tests are complete, the JWST will be shipped to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas for optical testing in a vacuum and the cold, and then it will head to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in California for its final assembly and testing, NASA officials said in a statement. Because of its extreme sensitivity, researchers anticipate collecting infrared light from some of the very first galaxies, and peering in on the atmospheres of far-away exoplanets, as well. In particular, many are excited about the newly discovered TRAPPIST-1 system, an ultracool red dwarf star with seven Earth-size planets in tight orbits. \"We had this remarkable discovery just a few weeks ago of the TRAPPIST-1 planet system, and with Webb we want to go one step further,\" Straughn said. \"Webb will be perfect for studying this planet system.\" \"With Webb, what we'll do is we'll watch the starlight as it filters through the planets atmospheres, if they have atmospheres ... and we'll be able to determine the chemical components of those atmospheres; things like water vapor and carbon dioxide and methane, things that would signal habitability,\" she said.

The telescope - which is a joint project among NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency - is set to launch in 2018. Webb recently finished testing at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where engineers made sure its components could withstand the violent vibrations and harsh conditions of launch and spaceflight. The telescope will spend almost 100 days in Johnson Space Center's Chamber A, an enormous vacuum chamber that was upgraded in 2013 after serving as the test bed for the Apollo modules destined for the moon. This final cryogenic test will confirm that the telescope's entire optical system can function in a region 1 million miles from Earth, NASA officials said in a statement. Then, the telescope will continue its journey to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, in California, the project's primary contractor, for final assembly and testing. There, it will also integrate its spacecraft bus, which will house and protect the telescope during launch, and its sunshield, which will protect it from the sun's and Earth's infrared radiation as it probes distant star systems and galaxies. The sunshield will unfurl to the size of a tennis court once the telescope reaches its destination and unfolds to its full size. Webb is the more powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and when it launches in 2018, it will be the world's largest space telescope. Each of its mirrors is individually tunable from afar, so any errors in focus will not necessitate a trip to space to install a physical corrective lens, like Hubble needed.

The images the observatory beams back will be processed and shared with the world from offices just down the hall and up the street. As anticipation builds ahead of the Webb telescope's October 2018 launch, Baltimore scientists are readying the facilities, equipment, software and personnel that will serve as its eyes and brain on Earth. Researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the edge of the Johns Hopkins University campus will guide the process of deciding where to point the telescope and what to study, as they now do for the Hubble Space Telescope. Institute engineers will hold the reins, radioing instructions to the telescope 1 million miles away and downloading hundreds of gigabits of data every day. \"Two minutes after launch, it'll be the nerve center,\" said Joel Green, a project scientist in the institute's office of public outreach. For the institute, operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the responsibility is heavy but familiar. From 1999 to 2006, it ran both Hubble's scientific endeavors and its operations. In 2006, the control room moved down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. With less than a year and a half to go before Webb's honeycomb-shaped mirror and tennis court-sized sun shield are folded up, loaded onto a rocket and hurled into space, preparations are accelerating. The telescope's mirror and instruments, constructed at Goddard over the past few years, will head soon to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston for the next phase of testing. A collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the telescope is to be launched from French Guiana aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket. In Baltimore, some of the last equipment and software needed for the launch arrived on the second floor of the institute's San Martin Drive headquarters in January. Scientists are busy testing them and learning how they will use them in the big moments to come. \"We're conducting rehearsals as though it was launch day,\" said Rusty Whitman, flight operations system engineering manager. \"We will do that over and over again just like rehearsals for a play. Everyone has a part to play, and everyone has to know their lines.\" Webb is the next-generation telescope that has been in planning since Hubble's earliest days in space more than 25 years ago. Where Hubble, launched in 1990, dramatically transformed understanding of the universe and its history, Webb is designed to see at far greater distances, and with greater sensitivity and clarity. Scientists are hopeful Hubble will remain operational well into Webb's mission, so that when the new telescope discovers objects of interest, Hubble can follow along. Working together, with their complementary designs and strengths, the two telescopes are expected to again rewrite astronomy books. Astronomers around the world already are brainstorming the research they will be able to pursue - watching the formation of young galaxies, probing around black holes, searching for and exploring Earthlike planets. They are sharing their ideas with scientists at the Baltimore institute, which will coordinate the telescope's order of observations. The start of that exploration is still about two years away. Once Webb leaves Earth, it is scheduled to take six months to unfold, reach its orbit, boot up and get aligned for operation. But given the complexity of the launch and the mission, crunch time is already arriving for the institute's crew. About 150 people in Baltimore are expected to staff the launch. One hundred will remain based in the flight operations center and adjoining control rooms 24 hours a day, seven days a week during Webb's six-month commissioning, Whitman said. That requires training a lot of people. The institute employs about 700, spread across its headquarters, its offices at Hopkins' Physics and Astronomy Building across San Martin Drive and at the Stieff Silver Building and the Rotunda in Hampden. \"We cross-train a lot of people,\" Whitman said. \"We have at least one backup, if not more, for each role.\" If anyone leaves their job, the scientists will have to get someone new up to speed quickly. But most are so dedicated to the long-awaited mission and eager to see it through, Whitman said, that \"turnover is not usually a big problem.\" Testing is already underway to ensure there is no difficulty communicating with the Deep Space Network, NASA's set of 230-foot-tall antennas in California, Spain and Australia. The network will be in constant communication with Webb during its commissioning. It will eventually cut that contact down to two four-hour exchanges each day. The institute is also readying for the masses of data Webb will send back, with plans to store the information in basement servers while exploring other big data solutions, Green said. It performed a similar function for Hubble from 1999 to 2006. This time around, Webb will transmit hundreds of times more data. Eric Smith, program director for NASA, said the space agency decided years ago to locate the primary mission operations center at the Baltimore institute for reasons of efficiency. \"The idea was to have the end-to-end missions operations within one organization ... to streamline things and reduce costs,\" he wrote in an email.

Observing time on Webb is scheduled in a series of cycles. Cycle 1 will encompass about 8,700 hours, or nearly a year. For their dedicated work on the project, the Guaranteed Time Observers were awarded 10 percent of the total JWST observing time in the prime mission. To maximize the overall JWST scientific return, the GTO projects will be scheduled earlier in the mission, and are expected to be completed within the first two years of telescope operations.

The initial observations cover the gamut of the JWST's scientific targets, from studies aimed at unraveling the secrets of galaxy formation, to gaining a better understanding of our home solar system via an in-depth study of select planets, moons, and asteroids. The newly announced list of targets were selected under NASA's Guaranteed Time Observations program, which allows scientists involved in the design and construction of the telescope's four main instruments to select some of the initial targets. Ten percent of the JWST's prime mission observing time has been devoted to GTO selections, all of which are likely to be completed in the first two years of the telescope's operational life. Close to home, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Saturn's atmosphere, Uranus ' seasonal tilt and Neptune's south polar vortex are just a few of the heavenly features set to fall under the powerful gaze of the JWST. Active geological phenomenon on the Saturnian moons Europa and Enceladus are also guaranteed to be studied and characterized. Comets and asteroids, the smaller inhabitants of the heliosphere, will also be analyzed by the cutting-edge observatory, in part for the insights that they can give up relating to the formative period of our solar system, but also in an effort to avoid a potentially devastating collision with Earth. Jupiter as captured by the Hubble Space Telescope NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Space Telescope Science Institute The JWST will also be observing the characteristics of distant exoplanets. These studies will be undertaken using a variety of methods, including an observation of planets as they transit across the face of their parent star, from the perspective of the Earth. Transit studies will allow the instruments mounted aboard the JWST to determine whether an exoplanet boasts an atmosphere, and if so, to gain insights regarding its composition. The existence and nature of an exoplanet's atmosphere is a deal-breaker regarding whether or not an alien world is capable of sustaining life. It is therefore unsurprising that the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is considered one of the most favorable prospects in the hunt for E.T., makes multiple celebrity appearances in the GTO target list. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g - the three Earth-sized planets that orbit in the habitable zone of the red dwarf at the heart of the system - are all set to be observed, with astronomers hoping to make the first confirmed detection and characterization of an atmosphere around a potentially habitable planet. The first observations of the next-generation telescope will investigate many facets of stellar physics and evolution. This will be achieved, in part, by observing protostars, and the protostellar disks from which stars like our Sun are known to have formed. The observatory will also shed light on how some of the universe's most massive stars came to form, as well as informing how stellar bodies are born at the extreme edge of our galaxy, where there is a far lower density of gas. Artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 system NASA/JPL-Caltech On an even grander scale, the GTO targets will task the JWST with observing numerous neighbouring and far flung galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such study will seek to understand the complex interactions between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, and four of its spheroidal galaxy companions. These are just a few examples of over 2,100 that make up the initial GTO observations.

Space.com talked with astrophysicist Amber Straughn at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland about the testing process and the new telescope's potential. \"This is the largest and most complex telescope that NASA has ever built,\" Straughn told Space.com. \"We will look back in time over 13 and a half billion years to see some of the first galaxies that were born, we will be able to peer through dust clouds to see the sights of star formation within our own Milky Way Galaxy. We're really set to, I think, revolutionize astronomy again with this telescope.\" The James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in late 2018, is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built - and now it's time to make sure it'd survive the trip to space. The JWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it will have about seven times the light-collecting area - while Hubble's the size of a school bus, the JWST stands about 3.5 stories tall, Straughn said. To get its 18 large mirrors into position, it will fold up like \"space origami\" on a European Ariane 5 rocket. Once in space, it would navigate to a point called Lagrange Point 2, a spot about four times farther than the moon from Earth in a direction opposite the sun, giving it a clear view of deep space. To make sure it'd survive the flight, Goddard personnel are running the telescope through intensive testing re-creating every hostile element of its trip. \"We've just finished some really critical testing of the telescope,\" Straughn said. \" The launch of a telescope is one of the most violent events that a telescope endures, so we shake the telescope to make sure it will endure the stresses of launch. We blast sound at it so it will endure the pressures that it experiences during launch.\" Engineers also test each component in cold chambers, to reflect the chill of outer space. Once the environmental tests are complete, the JWST will be shipped to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas for optical testing in a vacuum and the cold, and then it will head to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in California for its final assembly and testing, NASA officials said in a statement. Because of its extreme sensitivity, researchers anticipate collecting infrared light from some of the very first galaxies, and peering in on the atmospheres of far-away exoplanets, as well. In particular, many are excited about the newly discovered TRAPPIST-1 system, an ultracool red dwarf star with seven Earth-size planets in tight orbits. \"We had this remarkable discovery just a few weeks ago of the TRAPPIST-1 planet system, and with Webb we want to go one step further,\" Straughn said. \"Webb will be perfect for studying this planet system.\" \"With Webb, what we'll do is we'll watch the starlight as it filters through the planets atmospheres, if they have atmospheres ... and we'll be able to determine the chemical components of those atmospheres; things like water vapor and carbon dioxide and methane, things that would signal habitability,\" she said.

The telescope - which is a joint project among NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency - is set to launch in 2018. Webb recently finished testing at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where engineers made sure its components could withstand the violent vibrations and harsh conditions of launch and spaceflight. The telescope will spend almost 100 days in Johnson Space Center's Chamber A, an enormous vacuum chamber that was upgraded in 2013 after serving as the test bed for the Apollo modules destined for the moon. This final cryogenic test will confirm that the telescope's entire optical system can function in a region 1 million miles from Earth, NASA officials said in a statement. Then, the telescope will continue its journey to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, in California, the project's primary contractor, for final assembly and testing. There, it will also integrate its spacecraft bus, which will house and protect the telescope during launch, and its sunshield, which will protect it from the sun's and Earth's infrared radiation as it probes distant star systems and galaxies. The sunshield will unfurl to the size of a tennis court once the telescope reaches its destination and unfolds to its full size. Webb is the more powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and when it launches in 2018, it will be the world's largest space telescope.

The images the observatory beams back will be processed and shared with the world from offices just down the hall and up the street. As anticipation builds ahead of the Webb telescope's October 2018 launch, Baltimore scientists are readying the facilities, equipment, software and personnel that will serve as its eyes and brain on Earth. Researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the edge of the Johns Hopkins University campus will guide the process of deciding where to point the telescope and what to study, as they now do for the Hubble Space Telescope. Institute engineers will hold the reins, radioing instructions to the telescope 1 million miles away and downloading hundreds of gigabits of data every day. \"Two minutes after launch, it'll be the nerve center,\" said Joel Green, a project scientist in the institute's office of public outreach. For the institute, operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the responsibility is heavy but familiar. From 1999 to 2006, it ran both Hubble's scientific endeavors and its operations. In 2006, the control room moved down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. With less than a year and a half to go before Webb's honeycomb-shaped mirror and tennis court-sized sun shield are folded up, loaded onto a rocket and hurled into space, preparations are accelerating. The telescope's mirror and instruments, constructed at Goddard over the past few years, will head soon to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston for the next phase of testing. A collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the telescope is to be launched from French Guiana aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket. In Baltimore, some of the last equipment and software needed for the launch arrived on the second floor of the institute's San Martin Drive headquarters in January. Scientists are busy testing them and learning how they will use them in the big moments to come. \"We're conducting rehearsals as though it was launch day,\" said Rusty Whitman, flight operations system engineering manager. \"We will do that over and over again just like rehearsals for a play. Everyone has a part to play, and everyone has to know their lines.\" Webb is the next-generation telescope that has been in planning since Hubble's earliest days in space more than 25 years ago. Where Hubble, launched in 1990, dramatically transformed understanding of the universe and its history, Webb is designed to see at far greater distances, and with greater sensitivity and clarity. Scientists are hopeful Hubble will remain operational well into Webb's mission, so that when the new telescope discovers objects of interest, Hubble can follow along. Working together, with their complementary designs and strengths, the two telescopes are expected to again rewrite astronomy books. Astronomers around the world already are brainstorming the research they will be able to pursue - watching the formation of young galaxies, probing around black holes, searching for and exploring Earthlike planets. They are sharing their ideas with scientists at the Baltimore institute, which will coordinate the telescope's order of observations. The start of that exploration is still about two years away. Once Webb leaves Earth, it is scheduled to take six months to unfold, reach its orbit, boot up and get aligned for operation. But given the complexity of the launch and the mission, crunch time is already arriving for the institute's crew. About 150 people in Baltimore are expected to staff the launch. One hundred will remain based in the flight operations center and adjoining control rooms 24 hours a day, seven days a week during Webb's six-month commissioning, Whitman said. That requires training a lot of people. The institute employs about 700, spread across its headquarters, its offices at Hopkins' Physics and Astronomy Building across San Martin Drive and at the Stieff Silver Building and the Rotunda in Hampden. \"We cross-train a lot of people,\" Whitman said. \"We have at least one backup, if not more, for each role.\" If anyone leaves their job, the scientists will have to get someone new up to speed quickly. But most are so dedicated to the long-awaited mission and eager to see it through, Whitman said, that \"turnover is not usually a big problem.\" Testing is already underway to ensure there is no difficulty communicating with the Deep Space Network, NASA's set of 230-foot-tall antennas in California, Spain and Australia. The network will be in constant communication with Webb during its commissioning. It will eventually cut that contact down to two four-hour exchanges each day. The institute is also readying for the masses of data Webb will send back, with plans to store the information in basement servers while exploring other big data solutions, Green said. It performed a similar function for Hubble from 1999 to 2006. This time around, Webb will transmit hundreds of times more data. Eric Smith, program director for NASA, said the space agency decided years ago to locate the primary mission operations center at the Baltimore institute for reasons of efficiency. \"The idea was to have the end-to-end missions operations within one organization ... to streamline things and reduce costs,\" he wrote in an email. The institute's past leaders have downplayed the importance of hosting the control center. When it was shifted south to Goddard in 2006, Bruce Margon, then the institute's associate director for science, told The Baltimore Sun the move was of \"essentially no significance.\" Given the speed and ease of electronic communication, there is less of a case for combining Webb's scientific and operational headquarters than there was with Hubble, said Robert Williams, the institute's director from 1993 to 1998. But it is still easier when in-person meetings are required, he said. \"We spend an awful lot of time on the parkway between here and Goddard,\" Williams said. Other scientists said it will be valuable to have the engineers guiding the telescope and the astronomers using it in the same place. After all, for the engineers, Whitman said, \"their whole reason to be here is to support the science.\" And there is also symbolic meaning. \"It feels like the heartbeat of JWST will be in the building,\" Summers said.

These specific observations are part of a program of Guaranteed Time Observations, which provides dedicated time to the scientists that helped design and build the telescope's four instruments. \"From the very first galaxies after the Big Bang, to searching for chemical fingerprints of life on Enceladus, Europa, and exoplanets like TRAPPIST-1e, Webb will be looking at some incredible things in our universe,\" said Eric Smith, James Webb Space Telescope Director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"With over 2100 initial observations planned, there is no limit to what we might discover with this incredible telescope.\" The broad spectrum of initial GTO observations will address all of the science areas Webb is designed to explore, from first light and the assembly of galaxies to the birth of stars and planets. Targets will range from the solar system's outer planets and icy Kuiper Belt to exoplanets to distant galaxies in the young universe. \"The definition of observations to be conducted by the Webb Guaranteed Time Observers is a major milestone along the timeline for producing revolutionary science with this incredibly powerful observatory. These observations by the teams of people who designed and built the Webb instruments will yield not only amazing science, but will be crucial in putting the observatory through its paces and understanding its many capabilities,\" said Dr. Ken Sembach, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which will lead science and mission operations for Webb. \"I am very pleased that we're at this point since it is now possible for the broader science community to begin selecting targets and designing observations for the Early Release Science program and the Cycle 1 call for proposals, which will be issued this fall,\" he added. Observing time on Webb is scheduled in a series of cycles. Cycle 1 will encompass about 8,700 hours, or nearly a year. For their dedicated work on the project, the Guaranteed Time Observers were awarded 10 percent of the total JWST observing time in the prime mission. To maximize the overall JWST scientific return, the GTO projects will be scheduled earlier in the mission, and are expected to be completed within the first two years of telescope operations. The observations announced today will help the broader scientific community plan their proposals for observations to be made during Cycle 1. A call for proposals for regular Cycle 1 observations will be issued later this year. Webb is designed to complement and extend the scientific capabilities of other NASA missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be the most powerful space telescope ever built. Webb is an international project led by NASA with its partners, ESA and CSA. The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore will conduct Webb science operations.

The initial observations cover the gamut of the JWST's scientific targets, from studies aimed at unraveling the secrets of galaxy formation, to gaining a better understanding of our home solar system via an in-depth study of select planets, moons, and asteroids. The newly announced list of targets were selected under NASA's Guaranteed Time Observations program, which allows scientists involved in the design and construction of the telescope's four main instruments to select some of the initial targets. Ten percent of the JWST's prime mission observing time has been devoted to GTO selections, all of which are likely to be completed in the first two years of the telescope's operational life. Close to home, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Saturn's atmosphere, Uranus ' seasonal tilt and Neptune's south polar vortex are just a few of the heavenly features set to fall under the powerful gaze of the JWST. Active geological phenomenon on the Saturnian moons Europa and Enceladus are also guaranteed to be studied and characterized. Comets and asteroids, the smaller inhabitants of the heliosphere, will also be analyzed by the cutting-edge observatory, in part for the insights that they can give up relating to the formative period of our solar system, but also in an effort to avoid a potentially devastating collision with Earth. Jupiter as captured by the Hubble Space Telescope NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Space Telescope Science Institute The JWST will also be observing the characteristics of distant exoplanets. These studies will be undertaken using a variety of methods, including an observation of planets as they transit across the face of their parent star, from the perspective of the Earth. Transit studies will allow the instruments mounted aboard the JWST to determine whether an exoplanet boasts an atmosphere, and if so, to gain insights regarding its composition. The existence and nature of an exoplanet's atmosphere is a deal-breaker regarding whether or not an alien world is capable of sustaining life. It is therefore unsurprising that the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is considered one of the most favorable prospects in the hunt for E.T., makes multiple celebrity appearances in the GTO target list. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g - the three Earth-sized planets that orbit in the habitable zone of the red dwarf at the heart of the system - are all set to be observed, with astronomers hoping to make the first confirmed detection and characterization of an atmosphere around a potentially habitable planet. The first observations of the next-generation telescope will investigate many facets of stellar physics and evolution. This will be achieved, in part, by observing protostars, and the protostellar disks from which stars like our Sun are known to have formed. The observatory will also shed light on how some of the universe's most massive stars came to form, as well as informing how stellar bodies are born at the extreme edge of our galaxy, where there is a far lower density of gas. Artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 system NASA/JPL-Caltech On an even grander scale, the GTO targets will task the JWST with observing numerous neighbouring and far flung galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such study will seek to understand the complex interactions between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, and four of its spheroidal galaxy companions. These are just a few examples of over 2,100 that make up the initial GTO observations. These first targets will play a vital role in helping scientists understand the advanced capabilities of the JWST. \"From the very first galaxies after the Big Bang, to searching for chemical fingerprints of life on Enceladus, Europa, and exoplanets like TRAPPIST-1e, Webb will be looking at some incredible things in our universe,\" said Eric Smith, James Webb Space Telescope Director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"With over 2,100 initial observations planned, there is no limit to what we might discover with this incredible telescope.\" ", "url": "https://newatlas.com/james-webb-space-telescope-first-targets/50080/"}, {"title": "Webb telescope to spend summer chilling in Houston", "date": "2017-07-13", "content": "While Houston, Texas, may be sweltering in 95-degree Fahrenheit (35 \u00b0C) heat this week, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will soon be chilling in a vibration-insolation \"hammock\", hanging from the ceiling of Chamber A - an enormous thermal vacuum testing facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center. The \"Hammock\" - six support rods attached to the platform on which the JWST is sitting - will isolate the telescope from vibrations that Chamber A could produce once testing begins, as well as isolate it from any disturbances that might occur outside of the chamber. \"Remember that the system is designed to work in space, where the disturbances are highly controlled and only come from the spacecraft,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"On Earth, we have to deal with all the ground-based disturbances, such as the pumps and motors, and even traffic driving by.\" The JWST was suspended in the chamber just a few inches above the rails on the chamber floor that were used to roll it into place. Once the telescope was suspended, engineers gave it a \"push test\", where they nudged it enough just to move it a few millimeters to make sure the suspension system was working properly. Chamber A is famous for its role in testing Apollo Moon mission hardware and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. The chamber had to undergo major upgrades in the last several years in order to test the JWST. The vault-like 40-foot (about 12-meter) diameter, 40-ton door of Chamber A was sealed shut on July 10, 2017, beginning about 100 days of cryogenic testing for the telescope. It will take about 10 days to remove the air inside the chamber, and about one month to lower the temperature of the JWST and its science instruments to the levels required for testing. \"There are many thermal sensors that monitor temperatures of the telescope and the support equipment,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"Specialized camera systems track the physical position of the hardware inside the chamber, monitoring how Webb moves as it gets colder.\" In space, the telescope must be kept extremely cold in order to detect infrared light from very faint, distant objects. To protect the telescope from external sources of heat and light, such as the Sun, Earth, and Moon, as well as heat generated by JWST's science instruments, a five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court acts like a parasol that provides shade. The sunshield separates the observatory into a warm, sun-facing side (reaching temperatures close to 185 \u00b0F / 85 \u00b0C) and a cold side (400 \u00b0F / 204.4 \u00b0C below zero). The sunshield also prevents sunlight from interfering with the telescope's sensitive instruments. The JWST is the scientific successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.

The initial observations cover the gamut of the JWST's scientific targets, from studies aimed at unraveling the secrets of galaxy formation, to gaining a better understanding of our home solar system via an in-depth study of select planets, moons, and asteroids. The newly announced list of targets were selected under NASA's Guaranteed Time Observations program, which allows scientists involved in the design and construction of the telescope's four main instruments to select some of the initial targets. Ten percent of the JWST's prime mission observing time has been devoted to GTO selections, all of which are likely to be completed in the first two years of the telescope's operational life. Close to home, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Saturn's atmosphere, Uranus ' seasonal tilt and Neptune's south polar vortex are just a few of the heavenly features set to fall under the powerful gaze of the JWST. Active geological phenomenon on the Saturnian moons Europa and Enceladus are also guaranteed to be studied and characterized.

These studies will be undertaken using a variety of methods, including an observation of planets as they transit across the face of their parent star, from the perspective of the Earth. Transit studies will allow the instruments mounted aboard the JWST to determine whether an exoplanet boasts an atmosphere, and if so, to gain insights regarding its composition. The existence and nature of an exoplanet's atmosphere is a deal-breaker regarding whether or not an alien world is capable of sustaining life. It is therefore unsurprising that the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is considered one of the most favorable prospects in the hunt for E.T., makes multiple celebrity appearances in the GTO target list. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g - the three Earth-sized planets that orbit in the habitable zone of the red dwarf at the heart of the system - are all set to be observed, with astronomers hoping to make the first confirmed detection and characterization of an atmosphere around a potentially habitable planet. The first observations of the next-generation telescope will investigate many facets of stellar physics and evolution. This will be achieved, in part, by observing protostars, and the protostellar disks from which stars like our Sun are known to have formed. The observatory will also shed light on how some of the universe's most massive stars came to form, as well as informing how stellar bodies are born at the extreme edge of our galaxy, where there is a far lower density of gas. Artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 system NASA/JPL-Caltech On an even grander scale, the GTO targets will task the JWST with observing numerous neighbouring and far flung galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such study will seek to understand the complex interactions between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, and four of its spheroidal galaxy companions. These are just a few examples of over 2,100 that make up the initial GTO observations.

The \"Hammock\" - six support rods attached to the platform on which the JWST is sitting - will isolate the telescope from vibrations that Chamber A could produce once testing begins, as well as isolate it from any disturbances that might occur outside of the chamber. \"Remember that the system is designed to work in space, where the disturbances are highly controlled and only come from the spacecraft,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"On Earth, we have to deal with all the ground-based disturbances, such as the pumps and motors, and even traffic driving by.\" The JWST was suspended in the chamber just a few inches above the rails on the chamber floor that were used to roll it into place. Once the telescope was suspended, engineers gave it a \"push test\", where they nudged it enough just to move it a few millimeters to make sure the suspension system was working properly. Chamber A is famous for its role in testing Apollo Moon mission hardware and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. The chamber had to undergo major upgrades in the last several years in order to test the JWST. The vault-like 40-foot (about 12-meter) diameter, 40-ton door of Chamber A was sealed shut on July 10, 2017, beginning about 100 days of cryogenic testing for the telescope. It will take about 10 days to remove the air inside the chamber, and about one month to lower the temperature of the JWST and its science instruments to the levels required for testing. \"There are many thermal sensors that monitor temperatures of the telescope and the support equipment,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"Specialized camera systems track the physical position of the hardware inside the chamber, monitoring how Webb moves as it gets colder.\" In space, the telescope must be kept extremely cold in order to detect infrared light from very faint, distant objects. To protect the telescope from external sources of heat and light, such as the Sun, Earth, and Moon, as well as heat generated by JWST's science instruments, a five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court acts like a parasol that provides shade. The sunshield separates the observatory into a warm, sun-facing side (reaching temperatures close to 185 \u00b0F / 85 \u00b0C) and a cold side (400 \u00b0F / 204.4 \u00b0C below zero). The sunshield also prevents sunlight from interfering with the telescope's sensitive instruments. The JWST is the scientific successor to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.

After an assessment of remaining testing and integration work, NASA announced that it is pushing the targeted launch date for James Webb back from October 2018 to sometime between March and June 2019. The space agency says the telescope launch is not being delayed due to any technical or hardware flaws, but because the spacecraft to carry the telescope-which consists of a spacecraft bus and sunshield-is taking longer to integrate than expected. These two major components are being assembled at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, where technicians have run into delays. \"Webb's spacecraft and sunshield are larger and more complex than most spacecraft,\" said Eric Smith, program director for James Webb. \"The combination of some integration activities taking longer than initially planned, such as the installation of more than 100 sunshield membrane release devices, factoring in lessons learned from earlier testing, like longer time spans for vibration testing, has meant the integration and testing process is just taking longer. Considering the investment NASA has made, and the good performance to date, we want to proceed very systematically through these tests to be ready for a Spring 2019 launch.\" The telescope itself, made up of 18 gold-plated beryllium mirror segments, is currently undergoing cryogenic testing in the massive Chamber A at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. The telescope was tested in space-like conditions, with temperatures dipping below minus 250 degrees Celcius, but now technicians are slowly raising the temperature in preparation to remove the telescope from Chamber A next month. It will then travel to Northrop Grumman's facilities in Redondo Beach for integration with the spacecraft bus and sunshield. The shiny gold telescope's primary mirror stretches 6.5 meters in diameter, giving it over five times the collecting area of Hubble. James Webb should be able to detect objects up to 16 times fainter than Hubble, and its ability to collect infrared light will allow astronomers to peer back in space and time further than ever before. The scope is also going to be used to study exoplanets outside our solar system as well as the watery moons that orbit Jupiter and Saturn.

The megatelescope arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston yesterday, where it will undergo one last cryogenic test to make sure it can function in the intense cold of deep space. The telescope - which is a joint project among NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency - is set to launch in 2018. Webb recently finished testing at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where engineers made sure its components could withstand the violent vibrations and harsh conditions of launch and spaceflight. The telescope will spend almost 100 days in Johnson Space Center's Chamber A, an enormous vacuum chamber that was upgraded in 2013 after serving as the test bed for the Apollo modules destined for the moon. This final cryogenic test will confirm that the telescope's entire optical system can function in a region 1 million miles from Earth, NASA officials said in a statement. Then, the telescope will continue its journey to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, in California, the project's primary contractor, for final assembly and testing. There, it will also integrate its spacecraft bus, which will house and protect the telescope during launch, and its sunshield, which will protect it from the sun's and Earth's infrared radiation as it probes distant star systems and galaxies. The sunshield will unfurl to the size of a tennis court once the telescope reaches its destination and unfolds to its full size. Webb is the more powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and when it launches in 2018, it will be the world's largest space telescope.

The images the observatory beams back will be processed and shared with the world from offices just down the hall and up the street. As anticipation builds ahead of the Webb telescope's October 2018 launch, Baltimore scientists are readying the facilities, equipment, software and personnel that will serve as its eyes and brain on Earth. Researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the edge of the Johns Hopkins University campus will guide the process of deciding where to point the telescope and what to study, as they now do for the Hubble Space Telescope. Institute engineers will hold the reins, radioing instructions to the telescope 1 million miles away and downloading hundreds of gigabits of data every day. \"Two minutes after launch, it'll be the nerve center,\" said Joel Green, a project scientist in the institute's office of public outreach. For the institute, operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the responsibility is heavy but familiar. From 1999 to 2006, it ran both Hubble's scientific endeavors and its operations. In 2006, the control room moved down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. With less than a year and a half to go before Webb's honeycomb-shaped mirror and tennis court-sized sun shield are folded up, loaded onto a rocket and hurled into space, preparations are accelerating. The telescope's mirror and instruments, constructed at Goddard over the past few years, will head soon to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston for the next phase of testing. A collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the telescope is to be launched from French Guiana aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket. In Baltimore, some of the last equipment and software needed for the launch arrived on the second floor of the institute's San Martin Drive headquarters in January. Scientists are busy testing them and learning how they will use them in the big moments to come. \"We're conducting rehearsals as though it was launch day,\" said Rusty Whitman, flight operations system engineering manager. \"We will do that over and over again just like rehearsals for a play. Everyone has a part to play, and everyone has to know their lines.\" Webb is the next-generation telescope that has been in planning since Hubble's earliest days in space more than 25 years ago. Where Hubble, launched in 1990, dramatically transformed understanding of the universe and its history, Webb is designed to see at far greater distances, and with greater sensitivity and clarity. Scientists are hopeful Hubble will remain operational well into Webb's mission, so that when the new telescope discovers objects of interest, Hubble can follow along. Working together, with their complementary designs and strengths, the two telescopes are expected to again rewrite astronomy books. Astronomers around the world already are brainstorming the research they will be able to pursue - watching the formation of young galaxies, probing around black holes, searching for and exploring Earthlike planets. They are sharing their ideas with scientists at the Baltimore institute, which will coordinate the telescope's order of observations. The start of that exploration is still about two years away. Once Webb leaves Earth, it is scheduled to take six months to unfold, reach its orbit, boot up and get aligned for operation. But given the complexity of the launch and the mission, crunch time is already arriving for the institute's crew. About 150 people in Baltimore are expected to staff the launch. One hundred will remain based in the flight operations center and adjoining control rooms 24 hours a day, seven days a week during Webb's six-month commissioning, Whitman said. That requires training a lot of people. The institute employs about 700, spread across its headquarters, its offices at Hopkins' Physics and Astronomy Building across San Martin Drive and at the Stieff Silver Building and the Rotunda in Hampden. \"We cross-train a lot of people,\" Whitman said. \"We have at least one backup, if not more, for each role.\" If anyone leaves their job, the scientists will have to get someone new up to speed quickly. But most are so dedicated to the long-awaited mission and eager to see it through, Whitman said, that \"turnover is not usually a big problem.\" Testing is already underway to ensure there is no difficulty communicating with the Deep Space Network, NASA's set of 230-foot-tall antennas in California, Spain and Australia. The network will be in constant communication with Webb during its commissioning. It will eventually cut that contact down to two four-hour exchanges each day. The institute is also readying for the masses of data Webb will send back, with plans to store the information in basement servers while exploring other big data solutions, Green said. It performed a similar function for Hubble from 1999 to 2006. This time around, Webb will transmit hundreds of times more data. Eric Smith, program director for NASA, said the space agency decided years ago to locate the primary mission operations center at the Baltimore institute for reasons of efficiency. \"The idea was to have the end-to-end missions operations within one organization ... to streamline things and reduce costs,\" he wrote in an email. The institute's past leaders have downplayed the importance of hosting the control center. When it was shifted south to Goddard in 2006, Bruce Margon, then the institute's associate director for science, told The Baltimore Sun the move was of \"essentially no significance.\" Given the speed and ease of electronic communication, there is less of a case for combining Webb's scientific and operational headquarters than there was with Hubble, said Robert Williams, the institute's director from 1993 to 1998. But it is still easier when in-person meetings are required, he said. \"We spend an awful lot of time on the parkway between here and Goddard,\" Williams said. Other scientists said it will be valuable to have the engineers guiding the telescope and the astronomers using it in the same place. After all, for the engineers, Whitman said, \"their whole reason to be here is to support the science.\" And there is also symbolic meaning. \"It feels like the heartbeat of JWST will be in the building,\" Summers said.

Targets will range from the solar system's outer planets and icy Kuiper Belt to exoplanets to distant galaxies in the young universe. \"The definition of observations to be conducted by the Webb Guaranteed Time Observers is a major milestone along the timeline for producing revolutionary science with this incredibly powerful observatory. These observations by the teams of people who designed and built the Webb instruments will yield not only amazing science, but will be crucial in putting the observatory through its paces and understanding its many capabilities,\" said Dr. Ken Sembach, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which will lead science and mission operations for Webb. \"I am very pleased that we're at this point since it is now possible for the broader science community to begin selecting targets and designing observations for the Early Release Science program and the Cycle 1 call for proposals, which will be issued this fall,\" he added. Observing time on Webb is scheduled in a series of cycles. Cycle 1 will encompass about 8,700 hours, or nearly a year. For their dedicated work on the project, the Guaranteed Time Observers were awarded 10 percent of the total JWST observing time in the prime mission. To maximize the overall JWST scientific return, the GTO projects will be scheduled earlier in the mission, and are expected to be completed within the first two years of telescope operations. The observations announced today will help the broader scientific community plan their proposals for observations to be made during Cycle 1. A call for proposals for regular Cycle 1 observations will be issued later this year.

The initial observations cover the gamut of the JWST's scientific targets, from studies aimed at unraveling the secrets of galaxy formation, to gaining a better understanding of our home solar system via an in-depth study of select planets, moons, and asteroids. The newly announced list of targets were selected under NASA's Guaranteed Time Observations program, which allows scientists involved in the design and construction of the telescope's four main instruments to select some of the initial targets. Ten percent of the JWST's prime mission observing time has been devoted to GTO selections, all of which are likely to be completed in the first two years of the telescope's operational life. Close to home, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, Saturn's atmosphere, Uranus ' seasonal tilt and Neptune's south polar vortex are just a few of the heavenly features set to fall under the powerful gaze of the JWST. Active geological phenomenon on the Saturnian moons Europa and Enceladus are also guaranteed to be studied and characterized. Comets and asteroids, the smaller inhabitants of the heliosphere, will also be analyzed by the cutting-edge observatory, in part for the insights that they can give up relating to the formative period of our solar system, but also in an effort to avoid a potentially devastating collision with Earth. Jupiter as captured by the Hubble Space Telescope NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Space Telescope Science Institute The JWST will also be observing the characteristics of distant exoplanets. These studies will be undertaken using a variety of methods, including an observation of planets as they transit across the face of their parent star, from the perspective of the Earth. Transit studies will allow the instruments mounted aboard the JWST to determine whether an exoplanet boasts an atmosphere, and if so, to gain insights regarding its composition. The existence and nature of an exoplanet's atmosphere is a deal-breaker regarding whether or not an alien world is capable of sustaining life. It is therefore unsurprising that the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is considered one of the most favorable prospects in the hunt for E.T., makes multiple celebrity appearances in the GTO target list. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g - the three Earth-sized planets that orbit in the habitable zone of the red dwarf at the heart of the system - are all set to be observed, with astronomers hoping to make the first confirmed detection and characterization of an atmosphere around a potentially habitable planet. The first observations of the next-generation telescope will investigate many facets of stellar physics and evolution. This will be achieved, in part, by observing protostars, and the protostellar disks from which stars like our Sun are known to have formed. The observatory will also shed light on how some of the universe's most massive stars came to form, as well as informing how stellar bodies are born at the extreme edge of our galaxy, where there is a far lower density of gas. Artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 system NASA/JPL-Caltech On an even grander scale, the GTO targets will task the JWST with observing numerous neighbouring and far flung galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such study will seek to understand the complex interactions between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, and four of its spheroidal galaxy companions. These are just a few examples of over 2,100 that make up the initial GTO observations. These first targets will play a vital role in helping scientists understand the advanced capabilities of the JWST. \"From the very first galaxies after the Big Bang, to searching for chemical fingerprints of life on Enceladus, Europa, and exoplanets like TRAPPIST-1e, Webb will be looking at some incredible things in our universe,\" said Eric Smith, James Webb Space Telescope Director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"With over 2,100 initial observations planned, there is no limit to what we might discover with this incredible telescope.\" ", "url": "https://newatlas.com/james-webb-space-telescope-first-targets/50080/"}, {"title": "Webb telescope to spend summer chilling in Houston", "date": "2017-07-13", "content": "While Houston, Texas, may be sweltering in 95-degree Fahrenheit (35 \u00b0C) heat this week, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will soon be chilling in a vibration-insolation \"hammock\", hanging from the ceiling of Chamber A - an enormous thermal vacuum testing facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center. The \"Hammock\" - six support rods attached to the platform on which the JWST is sitting - will isolate the telescope from vibrations that Chamber A could produce once testing begins, as well as isolate it from any disturbances that might occur outside of the chamber. \"Remember that the system is designed to work in space, where the disturbances are highly controlled and only come from the spacecraft,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"On Earth, we have to deal with all the ground-based disturbances, such as the pumps and motors, and even traffic driving by.\" The JWST was suspended in the chamber just a few inches above the rails on the chamber floor that were used to roll it into place.

Chamber A is famous for its role in testing Apollo Moon mission hardware and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. The chamber had to undergo major upgrades in the last several years in order to test the JWST. The vault-like 40-foot (about 12-meter) diameter, 40-ton door of Chamber A was sealed shut on July 10, 2017, beginning about 100 days of cryogenic testing for the telescope. It will take about 10 days to remove the air inside the chamber, and about one month to lower the temperature of the JWST and its science instruments to the levels required for testing. \"There are many thermal sensors that monitor temperatures of the telescope and the support equipment,\" said Gary Matthews, an integration and testing engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is testing the Webb telescope while it is at Johnson. \"Specialized camera systems track the physical position of the hardware inside the chamber, monitoring how Webb moves as it gets colder.\" In space, the telescope must be kept extremely cold in order to detect infrared light from very faint, distant objects. To protect the telescope from external sources of heat and light, such as the Sun, Earth, and Moon, as well as heat generated by JWST's science instruments, a five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court acts like a parasol that provides shade. The sunshield separates the observatory into a warm, sun-facing side (reaching temperatures close to 185 \u00b0F / 85 \u00b0C) and a cold side (400 \u00b0F / 204.4 \u00b0C below zero).

The space agency says the telescope launch is not being delayed due to any technical or hardware flaws, but because the spacecraft to carry the telescope-which consists of a spacecraft bus and sunshield-is taking longer to integrate than expected. These two major components are being assembled at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, where technicians have run into delays. \"Webb's spacecraft and sunshield are larger and more complex than most spacecraft,\" said Eric Smith, program director for James Webb. \"The combination of some integration activities taking longer than initially planned, such as the installation of more than 100 sunshield membrane release devices, factoring in lessons learned from earlier testing, like longer time spans for vibration testing, has meant the integration and testing process is just taking longer.

This closing round of cryo-testing - taking nearly 100 days to complete - saw the observatory's optical telescope and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) subjected to temperatures nearing -387 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees Celsius / 40 kelvins) to ensure the operation of the JWST's instruments in space-like conditions. NO REPEAT OF HUBBLE. A key tenet of the frigid test regime was the validation of the alignment of the telescope's 18 primary mirror segments. The mirrors, which had been assembled by engineers from Harris Space and Intelligence Systems, were previously tested under cryogenic conditions at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Designed to act like a single reflective surface, the test at Johnson was the first time the telescope's optics and instruments were tested together. \"The Harris team integrated Webb's 18 mirror segments at Goddard and designed, built, and helped operate the advanced ground support and optical test equipment at Johnson,\" stated Rob Mitrevski, vice president and general manager of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance at Harris, in a release issued by NASA. \"They were a key, enabling part of the successful Webb telescope testing team.\" Ensuring the mirrors were properly aligned prior to launch is critical to the mission. With its location at a gravitationally stable orbit nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, mounting any sort of repair mission as had been done to correct the flawed primary mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope would not be practical (and impossible now that NASA's fleet of shuttle orbiters are collecting dust in museums and tourist destinations). Unlike Hubble, however, Webb has the ability to reshape each of its 18 mirror elements once in space. Each mirror is outfitted with small motors - also known as actuators - that are capable of adjusting each segment in very small amounts. \"They can move in steps that are a fraction of a wavelength of light, or about 1/10,000th the diameter of a human hair,\" stated Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for the Webb telescope at Goddard, in a release issued by the agency. Nevertheless, engineers needed to know that the actuators would actually function as anticipated once subjected to conditions simulating the cold vacuum of space. MOTHER NATURE COULDN'T DERAIL TESTING. Prior to beginning the test program in earnest, the chamber in which the JWST was installed had to have its atmosphere removed. Engineers began evacuating the air from Johnson's Chamber A on July 20, 2017 - a process that took approximately seven days - so that it could be chilled to space-like conditions. The chill-down phase lowered the temperature of the chamber from ambient (room-temperature) levels to 40 kelvins over the following 30 days. However, near the end of the chill-down, Category 4 Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast. Though the storm weakened to a tropical storm, it lingered over inland Texas, leaving some areas drenched in more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rainfall. Many of the personnel involved in testing Webb remained at Johnson throughout the storm to ensure the telescope's testing was not interrupted. Following 30 days at \"cryo-stable\" conditions, personnel began raising temperatures in the chamber before re-pressurizing it and opening the door. \"With an integrated team from all corners of the country, we were able to create deep space in our chamber and confirm that Webb can perform flawlessly as it observes the coldest corners of the universe,\" noted Jonathan Homan, project manager for Webb's cryogenic testing at Johnson, in a release from the agency. STILL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE LAUNCH. Though Webb's launch is scheduled for the first half of 2019, there is still much to be done to get the observatory ready for liftoff. The combined optical elements and science instruments will next travel to Northrup Grumman Aerospace Systems in California where it will be integrated with the sunshield and spacecraft bus. Once fully integrated, the telescope will undergo further tests to simulate the rigors of launch, before being shipped to Kourou, French Guiana, where it will launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket. While those steps still lay ahead, the testing at Johnson was seen as a critical path forward. \"After 15 years of planning, chamber refurbishment, hundreds of hours of risk-reduction testing, the dedication of more than 100 individuals through more than 90 days of testing, and surviving Hurricane Harvey, the OTIS cryogenic test has been an outstanding success,\" said Bill Ochs, project manager for the James Webb Space Telescope at Goddard, in a NASA release. \"The completion of the test is one of the most significant steps in the march to launching Webb.\" If everything continues to go as NASA hopes, the JWST is scheduled to launch in 2019 atop an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. However, the JWST has been repeatedly delayed and, as noted in a 2006 article appearing in Nature, the next generation telescope was estimated to cost somewhere around $4 billion. The telescope has become known for its cost overruns and program mismanagement with Congress eyeing to scrap the project. However, in November of 2011, it was decided to complete the project - but to cap off its expenses at $8 billion. Space.com has noted that, as of this writing, the project is estimated at approaching a cost of some $9 billion.

The space agency says the telescope launch is not being delayed due to any technical or hardware flaws, but because the spacecraft to carry the telescope-which consists of a spacecraft bus and sunshield-is taking longer to integrate than expected. These two major components are being assembled at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, where technicians have run into delays. \"Webb's spacecraft and sunshield are larger and more complex than most spacecraft,\" said Eric Smith, program director for James Webb. \"The combination of some integration activities taking longer than initially planned, such as the installation of more than 100 sunshield membrane release devices, factoring in lessons learned from earlier testing, like longer time spans for vibration testing, has meant the integration and testing process is just taking longer.

This closing round of cryo-testing - taking nearly 100 days to complete - saw the observatory's optical telescope and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) subjected to temperatures nearing -387 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees Celsius / 40 kelvins) to ensure the operation of the JWST's instruments in space-like conditions. NO REPEAT OF HUBBLE. A key tenet of the frigid test regime was the validation of the alignment of the telescope's 18 primary mirror segments. The mirrors, which had been assembled by engineers from Harris Space and Intelligence Systems, were previously tested under cryogenic conditions at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Designed to act like a single reflective surface, the test at Johnson was the first time the telescope's optics and instruments were tested together. \"The Harris team integrated Webb's 18 mirror segments at Goddard and designed, built, and helped operate the advanced ground support and optical test equipment at Johnson,\" stated Rob Mitrevski, vice president and general manager of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance at Harris, in a release issued by NASA. \"They were a key, enabling part of the successful Webb telescope testing team.\" Ensuring the mirrors were properly aligned prior to launch is critical to the mission. With its location at a gravitationally stable orbit nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, mounting any sort of repair mission as had been done to correct the flawed primary mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope would not be practical (and impossible now that NASA's fleet of shuttle orbiters are collecting dust in museums and tourist destinations). Unlike Hubble, however, Webb has the ability to reshape each of its 18 mirror elements once in space. Each mirror is outfitted with small motors - also known as actuators - that are capable of adjusting each segment in very small amounts. \"They can move in steps that are a fraction of a wavelength of light, or about 1/10,000th the diameter of a human hair,\" stated Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for the Webb telescope at Goddard, in a release issued by the agency. Nevertheless, engineers needed to know that the actuators would actually function as anticipated once subjected to conditions simulating the cold vacuum of space. MOTHER NATURE COULDN'T DERAIL TESTING. Prior to beginning the test program in earnest, the chamber in which the JWST was installed had to have its atmosphere removed. Engineers began evacuating the air from Johnson's Chamber A on July 20, 2017 - a process that took approximately seven days - so that it could be chilled to space-like conditions. The chill-down phase lowered the temperature of the chamber from ambient (room-temperature) levels to 40 kelvins over the following 30 days. However, near the end of the chill-down, Category 4 Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast. Though the storm weakened to a tropical storm, it lingered over inland Texas, leaving some areas drenched in more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rainfall. Many of the personnel involved in testing Webb remained at Johnson throughout the storm to ensure the telescope's testing was not interrupted. Following 30 days at \"cryo-stable\" conditions, personnel began raising temperatures in the chamber before re-pressurizing it and opening the door. \"With an integrated team from all corners of the country, we were able to create deep space in our chamber and confirm that Webb can perform flawlessly as it observes the coldest corners of the universe,\" noted Jonathan Homan, project manager for Webb's cryogenic testing at Johnson, in a release from the agency. STILL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE LAUNCH. Though Webb's launch is scheduled for the first half of 2019, there is still much to be done to get the observatory ready for liftoff. The combined optical elements and science instruments will next travel to Northrup Grumman Aerospace Systems in California where it will be integrated with the sunshield and spacecraft bus.

A town hall session about the mission spent only a little time on the assembly and testing of the spacecraft, focusing much more on planning for the initial rounds of observations it will perform. \"We're in the phase of the program where there will be many new challenges, different kinds of challenges than we've had before,\" Eric Smith, the JWST director at NASA Headquarters, said at that town hall. \"The team that has been working together so well, so when problems arise, I'm really confident that the team will solve them.\" A year later, at the 231st Meeting of the AAS outside Washington, the mood wasn't nearly as celebratory. While project officials promoted the progress they had made in the last year, including recently completing a thermal vacuum test of the telescope and instruments at the Johnson Space Center, they couldn't avoid the fact that JWST's launch had slipped from October 2018 to sometime between March and June 2019. At a December hearing by the House Science Committee's space subcommittee, Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, said the delay was not because of a specific technical problem with the spacecraft but simply testing delays at prime contractor Northrop Grumman that exhausted the program's margin. \"The sunshield and spacecraft bus experienced delays during their integration and testing at Northrop Grumman,\" he said. \"Following a schedule assessment of the remaining activities, the Webb launch date was changed from October 2018 to between March and June 2019.\" In an Jan. 9 interview during the AAS meeting, Scott Willoughby, vice president and program manager for JWST at Northrop Grumman, said the company had recently successfully tested the deployment of the sunshield, made of five layers of Kapton material the size of a tennis court, that will keep the telescope cold in space. The overall test, including repackaging of the sunshield, took longer than anticipated. \"The actual harder part is not deploying it, in terms of time, but folding it back together,\" he said. \"Deploying took a couple weeks, but folding it takes nearly two months.\" That was one of the reasons, he said, NASA decided to push back JWST's launch. Another problem was with thrusters on the spacecraft bus. \"We had to resolve an issue with the thrusters in terms of how the valves close,\" he said. Northrop decided to refurbish all of the valves in question, and is in preparing to reinstall the thrusters on the bus and test them again. Those issues, he said, led to a mutual decision by NASA and Northrop to delay the launch. \"It was really the team coming together and saying we've now done most- not all - of the first-of-a-kind type of operations,\" he said. There was also a decision, he said, to back off trying to do some activities in parallel. \"When we looked at all of that, we said that, for the work we have in front of us, we need more time,\" he said. Much more of the work in the coming months will be similar to what's been done before, such as additional deployments of the sunshield after various tests to the spacecraft. That will help save some time, but won't drastically accelerate the schedule. \"There will be a little bit of a learning curve, but it won't be two months down to two weeks\" for refolding the sunshield, he said. The sunshield and bus will soon begin a series of acoustic, vibration and thermal vacuum tests. During that time, the telescope and instrument section of JWST, known as the Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science, or OTIS, will arrive at Northrop's facility in Southern California from Houston. Willoughby said OTIS will be installed on the spacecraft bus in August or September, after another series of deployment tests. The observatory, at long last a single spacecraft, will undergo yet another set of environmental and deployment tests at Northrop before it's loaded onto a ship for transport to French Guiana. That will likely take place in early 2019, he said, or about three months before the spacecraft's launch on an Ariane 5. NASA has not yet provided a more specific launch window for JWST than March to June of 2019. Zurbuchen said in his congressional testimony in December that NASA expected to provide an updated launch date in January or February, after an independent review of the mission's plans. \"At this moment in time, with the information that I have, I believe it's achievable,\" he said of the March- to-June window. Willoughby emphasized the overall progress Northrop has made on JWST, despite the schedule slip. \"A year ago, it was about deploying the sunshield. That was the biggest newness,\" he said. \"That was really big.\" Lost in that test were other milestones. He said another major milestone last year was commanding the spacecraft bus for the first time from the mission operations center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"We're going to have to command it from a million miles away, so we should be able to do it from 2,500. But still, it's a big deal to do flight commanding, and that was a fantastic success.\" \"By the end of 2018, we'll have an observatory,\" Willoughby said, referring to the completion of JWST's assembly. Astronomers who have been waiting for years, through many previous delays and cost overruns, can probably handle a delay of another six months or so for a telescope that still promises to revolutionize their field.

Northrop decided to refurbish all of the valves in question, and is in preparing to reinstall the thrusters on the bus and test them again. Those issues, he said, led to a mutual decision by NASA and Northrop to delay the launch. \"It was really the team coming together and saying we've now done most- not all - of the first-of-a-kind type of operations,\" he said. There was also a decision, he said, to back off trying to do some activities in parallel. \"When we looked at all of that, we said that, for the work we have in front of us, we need more time,\" he said. Much more of the work in the coming months will be similar to what's been done before, such as additional deployments of the sunshield after various tests to the spacecraft. That will help save some time, but won't drastically accelerate the schedule. \"There will be a little bit of a learning curve, but it won't be two months down to two weeks\" for refolding the sunshield, he said. The sunshield and bus will soon begin a series of acoustic, vibration and thermal vacuum tests. During that time, the telescope and instrument section of JWST, known as the Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science, or OTIS, will arrive at Northrop's facility in Southern California from Houston. Willoughby said OTIS will be installed on the spacecraft bus in August or September, after another series of deployment tests. The observatory, at long last a single spacecraft, will undergo yet another set of environmental and deployment tests at Northrop before it's loaded onto a ship for transport to French Guiana. That will likely take place in early 2019, he said, or about three months before the spacecraft's launch on an Ariane 5. NASA has not yet provided a more specific launch window for JWST than March to June of 2019. Zurbuchen said in his congressional testimony in December that NASA expected to provide an updated launch date in January or February, after an independent review of the mission's plans. \"At this moment in time, with the information that I have, I believe it's achievable,\" he said of the March- to-June window. Willoughby emphasized the overall progress Northrop has made on JWST, despite the schedule slip. \"A year ago, it was about deploying the sunshield. That was the biggest newness,\" he said. \"That was really big.\" Lost in that test were other milestones. He said another major milestone last year was commanding the spacecraft bus for the first time from the mission operations center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"We're going to have to command it from a million miles away, so we should be able to do it from 2,500. But still, it's a big deal to do flight commanding, and that was a fantastic success.\" \"By the end of 2018, we'll have an observatory,\" Willoughby said, referring to the completion of JWST's assembly. Astronomers who have been waiting for years, through many previous delays and cost overruns, can probably handle a delay of another six months or so for a telescope that still promises to revolutionize their field.

This closing round of cryo-testing - taking nearly 100 days to complete - saw the observatory's optical telescope and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) subjected to temperatures nearing -387 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees Celsius / 40 kelvins) to ensure the operation of the JWST's instruments in space-like conditions. NO REPEAT OF HUBBLE. A key tenet of the frigid test regime was the validation of the alignment of the telescope's 18 primary mirror segments. The mirrors, which had been assembled by engineers from Harris Space and Intelligence Systems, were previously tested under cryogenic conditions at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Designed to act like a single reflective surface, the test at Johnson was the first time the telescope's optics and instruments were tested together. \"The Harris team integrated Webb's 18 mirror segments at Goddard and designed, built, and helped operate the advanced ground support and optical test equipment at Johnson,\" stated Rob Mitrevski, vice president and general manager of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance at Harris, in a release issued by NASA. \"They were a key, enabling part of the successful Webb telescope testing team.\" Ensuring the mirrors were properly aligned prior to launch is critical to the mission. With its location at a gravitationally stable orbit nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, mounting any sort of repair mission as had been done to correct the flawed primary mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope would not be practical (and impossible now that NASA's fleet of shuttle orbiters are collecting dust in museums and tourist destinations). Unlike Hubble, however, Webb has the ability to reshape each of its 18 mirror elements once in space. Each mirror is outfitted with small motors - also known as actuators - that are capable of adjusting each segment in very small amounts. \"They can move in steps that are a fraction of a wavelength of light, or about 1/10,000th the diameter of a human hair,\" stated Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for the Webb telescope at Goddard, in a release issued by the agency. Nevertheless, engineers needed to know that the actuators would actually function as anticipated once subjected to conditions simulating the cold vacuum of space. MOTHER NATURE COULDN'T DERAIL TESTING. Prior to beginning the test program in earnest, the chamber in which the JWST was installed had to have its atmosphere removed. Engineers began evacuating the air from Johnson's Chamber A on July 20, 2017 - a process that took approximately seven days - so that it could be chilled to space-like conditions. The chill-down phase lowered the temperature of the chamber from ambient (room-temperature) levels to 40 kelvins over the following 30 days. However, near the end of the chill-down, Category 4 Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast. Though the storm weakened to a tropical storm, it lingered over inland Texas, leaving some areas drenched in more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rainfall. Many of the personnel involved in testing Webb remained at Johnson throughout the storm to ensure the telescope's testing was not interrupted. Following 30 days at \"cryo-stable\" conditions, personnel began raising temperatures in the chamber before re-pressurizing it and opening the door. \"With an integrated team from all corners of the country, we were able to create deep space in our chamber and confirm that Webb can perform flawlessly as it observes the coldest corners of the universe,\" noted Jonathan Homan, project manager for Webb's cryogenic testing at Johnson, in a release from the agency. STILL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE LAUNCH. Though Webb's launch is scheduled for the first half of 2019, there is still much to be done to get the observatory ready for liftoff. The combined optical elements and science instruments will next travel to Northrup Grumman Aerospace Systems in California where it will be integrated with the sunshield and spacecraft bus. Once fully integrated, the telescope will undergo further tests to simulate the rigors of launch, before being shipped to Kourou, French Guiana, where it will launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket. While those steps still lay ahead, the testing at Johnson was seen as a critical path forward. \"After 15 years of planning, chamber refurbishment, hundreds of hours of risk-reduction testing, the dedication of more than 100 individuals through more than 90 days of testing, and surviving Hurricane Harvey, the OTIS cryogenic test has been an outstanding success,\" said Bill Ochs, project manager for the James Webb Space Telescope at Goddard, in a NASA release. \"The completion of the test is one of the most significant steps in the march to launching Webb.\" If everything continues to go as NASA hopes, the JWST is scheduled to launch in 2019 atop an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. However, the JWST has been repeatedly delayed and, as noted in a 2006 article appearing in Nature, the next generation telescope was estimated to cost somewhere around $4 billion. The telescope has become known for its cost overruns and program mismanagement with Congress eyeing to scrap the project. However, in November of 2011, it was decided to complete the project - but to cap off its expenses at $8 billion. Space.com has noted that, as of this writing, the project is estimated at approaching a cost of some $9 billion.

Another problem was with thrusters on the spacecraft bus. \"We had to resolve an issue with the thrusters in terms of how the valves close,\" he said. Northrop decided to refurbish all of the valves in question, and is in preparing to reinstall the thrusters on the bus and test them again. Those issues, he said, led to a mutual decision by NASA and Northrop to delay the launch. \"It was really the team coming together and saying we've now done most- not all - of the first-of-a-kind type of operations,\" he said. There was also a decision, he said, to back off trying to do some activities in parallel. \"When we looked at all of that, we said that, for the work we have in front of us, we need more time,\" he said. Much more of the work in the coming months will be similar to what's been done before, such as additional deployments of the sunshield after various tests to the spacecraft. That will help save some time, but won't drastically accelerate the schedule. \"There will be a little bit of a learning curve, but it won't be two months down to two weeks\" for refolding the sunshield, he said. The sunshield and bus will soon begin a series of acoustic, vibration and thermal vacuum tests. During that time, the telescope and instrument section of JWST, known as the Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science, or OTIS, will arrive at Northrop's facility in Southern California from Houston. Willoughby said OTIS will be installed on the spacecraft bus in August or September, after another series of deployment tests. The observatory, at long last a single spacecraft, will undergo yet another set of environmental and deployment tests at Northrop before it's loaded onto a ship for transport to French Guiana. That will likely take place in early 2019, he said, or about three months before the spacecraft's launch on an Ariane 5. NASA has not yet provided a more specific launch window for JWST than March to June of 2019. Zurbuchen said in his congressional testimony in December that NASA expected to provide an updated launch date in January or February, after an independent review of the mission's plans. \"At this moment in time, with the information that I have, I believe it's achievable,\" he said of the March- to-June window. Willoughby emphasized the overall progress Northrop has made on JWST, despite the schedule slip. \"A year ago, it was about deploying the sunshield. That was the biggest newness,\" he said. \"That was really big.\" Lost in that test were other milestones. He said another major milestone last year was commanding the spacecraft bus for the first time from the mission operations center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"We're going to have to command it from a million miles away, so we should be able to do it from 2,500. But still, it's a big deal to do flight commanding, and that was a fantastic success.\" \"By the end of 2018, we'll have an observatory,\" Willoughby said, referring to the completion of JWST's assembly. Astronomers who have been waiting for years, through many previous delays and cost overruns, can probably handle a delay of another six months or so for a telescope that still promises to revolutionize their field.

The space agency has set a new launch date for the JWST of March 30, 2021. NASA had set a launch date of October 2018 all the way back in 2011. But as the date nears, blast-off has been pushed back multiple times; first to 2019, then to 2020 in March of this year, and now to early 2021. JWST has been hampered by delays and cost overruns even going back further than 2011, to shortly after the project was formally approved in 2008. NASA science head Thomas Zurbuchen told reporters on a conference call Wednesday that the JWST \"will be the agency's next great space observatory ... development should move forward because of its potential and the spectacular science it will return.\" The JWST, which is being built primarily by Northrop Grumman, is NASA's great hope for carrying on the legacy of the Hubble Space Telescope and answering some of the biggest questions in science, including whether we're alone in the universe. The Webb observatory is significantly larger and more powerful than Hubble, with more than six times the light-collecting surface area of its predecessor's primary mirror. The new launch date comes in response to a report from the JWST Independent Review Board , which recommends that the mission should continue, but also emphasizes the importance of getting it right. \"The complexity and risk cannot be overstated and overestimated,\" Thomas Young, chair of the IRB, told reporters. Young explained that what now amounts to 29 months of delays can be attributed to a combination of human error, problems embedded in hardware, lack of experience, excessive optimism and the complex systems involved. In particular, Young highlighted three instances of human error, such as using the wrong solvent to clean valves. He said that the errors could have been easily avoided with some basic fixes. \"All simple fixes that were not implemented resulted in a one-and-a-half year delay at a cost of over 600 million dollars,\" he said. Another persistent problem for the JWST has been the telescope's large, complicated sunshield, a type that's never been used before on a space telescope. The entire telescope, including the thin, tennis court-sized shield, have to be unfolded like Origami once in space, and engineers have discovered problems that could lead to the shield snagging or tearing in the process.

Later this summer, the optical telescope and integrated science instrument module will be combined with the Telescope's spacecraft element; together they will officially become the Webb observatory. \"This is a major milestone,\" Eric Smith, director of the James Webb Space Telescope program at NASA, said in the statement. \"The Webb observatory, which is the work of thousands of scientists and engineers across the globe, will be carefully tested to ensure it is ready to launch and enable scientists to seek the first luminous objects in the universe and search for signs of habitable planets.\" Both halves of Webb recently completed cryogenic testing in a thermal vacuum chamber housed at Johnson Space Center. The test was designed to make sure that the space telescope is able to function properly in the cold, airless environment of space. OTIS traveled to California in a specially designed shipping container called the Space Telescope Transporter for Air, Road and Sea, which was loaded onto a U.S. military C-5 Charlie aircraft at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base outside Houston.

By last year, the launch date had been pushed back to June 2019. In February, a report from the US Government Accountability Office suggested that the telescope's launch seemed likely to be delayed and to exceed its budget. There were problems with its sunshield and thrusters, and little extra time built into the schedule to fix them - even with teams of contractors working 24 hours a day.

The space agency has set a new launch date for the JWST of March 30, 2021. NASA had set a launch date of October 2018 all the way back in 2011. But as the date nears, blast-off has been pushed back multiple times; first to 2019, then to 2020 in March of this year, and now to early 2021. JWST has been hampered by delays and cost overruns even going back further than 2011, to shortly after the project was formally approved in 2008. NASA science head Thomas Zurbuchen told reporters on a conference call Wednesday that the JWST \"will be the agency's next great space observatory ... development should move forward because of its potential and the spectacular science it will return.\" The JWST, which is being built primarily by Northrop Grumman, is NASA's great hope for carrying on the legacy of the Hubble Space Telescope and answering some of the biggest questions in science, including whether we're alone in the universe. The Webb observatory is significantly larger and more powerful than Hubble, with more than six times the light-collecting surface area of its predecessor's primary mirror. The new launch date comes in response to a report from the JWST Independent Review Board , which recommends that the mission should continue, but also emphasizes the importance of getting it right. \"The complexity and risk cannot be overstated and overestimated,\" Thomas Young, chair of the IRB, told reporters. Young explained that what now amounts to 29 months of delays can be attributed to a combination of human error, problems embedded in hardware, lack of experience, excessive optimism and the complex systems involved. In particular, Young highlighted three instances of human error, such as using the wrong solvent to clean valves. He said that the errors could have been easily avoided with some basic fixes. \"All simple fixes that were not implemented resulted in a one-and-a-half year delay at a cost of over 600 million dollars,\" he said. Another persistent problem for the JWST has been the telescope's large, complicated sunshield, a type that's never been used before on a space telescope.

The new launch date for the world's \"next great astronomy observatory\" has been scheduled for March 30, 2021, after budget overruns and test issues has resulted in a string of unforeseen delays. Nasa cited misplaced optimism as the underlying problem here - for an observatory of this scale, the slightest oversight can lead to untold issues. An independent review board set up by Nasa to ensure oversight concluded that there are \"no small\" problems on a beast of this size. \"The complexity and highly integrated nature of the observatory\" mean that \"a very small human error or test anomaly can impact the schedule by months and the cost by tens of millions of dollars,\" the board wrote. Not all problems on a telescope of this size are small, however: tears in the tennis-court sized sunshield, at the hands of contractor Northrop Grumman, were one of the reasons launch was delayed earlier this year, Nasa announced back in March, when launch was rescheduled for May 2020 after an initial due date of October 2018 was abandoned. Since the beginning of the project in 1996, after multiple delays and expanded scope, its budget has exploded from $0.5 billion to $9.6 billion.

The new launch date in theory buys time for implementing all of the review board's recommendations, which includes new reporting and auditing structures and other forms of risk mitigation. Webb underwent a major redesign during 2005, and has a host of setbacks after testing began in 2016. The Webb telescope - named after James E. Webb, administrator of Nasa from 1961 to 1968, who played an integral role in the Apollo missions - is being developed by Nasa, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. It will offer unprecedented resolution and hopes to observe some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, like the formation of the first galaxies, stars, planets, exoplanets and novas. Webb has a giant honeycomb structure, as in the photo above, of 18 gold-plated hexagonal mirrors made of beryllium, which together have a diameter of 6.5 meters, far bigger than Hubble's 2.4. The telescope will be stationed near the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrangian point, and a huge sunshield of silicon and aluminium- coated Kapton will keep Webb's mirrors below -220\u00b0C. Unlike Hubble, which observes light in ranges near ultraviolet, visible, and infrared, Webb will observe light ranging from visible orange and red to mid- infrared. This means it can observe \" high redshift objects \" too old and too distant for earlier instruments to capture. As if the challenges of scale weren't enough for the Webb team to counter, the observatory will be so far away from Earth that it is un-serviceable by manned or robotic missions: once it unfurls, there's no going back. \"From detecting light from the first stars and galaxies in the distant universe to probing the atmospheres in nearby exoplanets for possible signs of habitability,\" wrote Nasa's Thomas Zurbuchen, Webb's outstanding science will underpin much of astrophysics going forward - let's just hope it gets there eventually.

This means it can observe \" high redshift objects \" too old and too distant for earlier instruments to capture.

The space agency has set a new launch date for the JWST of March 30, 2021. NASA had set a launch date of October 2018 all the way back in 2011. But as the date nears, blast-off has been pushed back multiple times; first to 2019, then to 2020 in March of this year, and now to early 2021. JWST has been hampered by delays and cost overruns even going back further than 2011, to shortly after the project was formally approved in 2008. NASA science head Thomas Zurbuchen told reporters on a conference call Wednesday that the JWST \"will be the agency's next great space observatory ... development should move forward because of its potential and the spectacular science it will return.\" The JWST, which is being built primarily by Northrop Grumman, is NASA's great hope for carrying on the legacy of the Hubble Space Telescope and answering some of the biggest questions in science, including whether we're alone in the universe. The Webb observatory is significantly larger and more powerful than Hubble, with more than six times the light-collecting surface area of its predecessor's primary mirror. The new launch date comes in response to a report from the JWST Independent Review Board , which recommends that the mission should continue, but also emphasizes the importance of getting it right. \"The complexity and risk cannot be overstated and overestimated,\" Thomas Young, chair of the IRB, told reporters. Young explained that what now amounts to 29 months of delays can be attributed to a combination of human error, problems embedded in hardware, lack of experience, excessive optimism and the complex systems involved. In particular, Young highlighted three instances of human error, such as using the wrong solvent to clean valves. He said that the errors could have been easily avoided with some basic fixes. \"All simple fixes that were not implemented resulted in a one-and-a-half year delay at a cost of over 600 million dollars,\" he said. Another persistent problem for the JWST has been the telescope's large, complicated sunshield, a type that's never been used before on a space telescope. The entire telescope, including the thin, tennis court-sized shield, have to be unfolded like Origami once in space, and engineers have discovered problems that could lead to the shield snagging or tearing in the process. The IRB report included over two dozen recommendations, many of which Zurbuchen says NASA has already begun implementing. \"We have to get this right on the ground before we go to space,\" he said. \"Webb is worth the wait.\" ", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/science/launch-of-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-pushed-back-yet-again/"}, {"title": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope's launch is delayed again, because of course it is", "date": "2018-06-27", "content": "Another day, another delay for one of the most complicated space telescope projects ever undertaken. NASA announced on Wednesday that the James Webb Space Telescope, a complicated mission designed to transform American astrophysics and astronomy as we understand it, is now expected to launch on March 30, 2021, about one year later than expected under a timetable announced in March. Oh, and because of the delays, the telescope, which is designed to reveal more about the early universe, galaxy formation, and even alien planets than ever before, just got more expensive. Instead of costing $8.8 billion, the JWST is now expected to cost $9.66 billion. \"We're certainly annoyed that we have to wait,\" John Mather, JWST's senior project scientist, said during a press call, adding that it's most important that the problems with the telescope are being fixed and it's moving forward. The trouble behind the delay and cost overruns come from a range of sources: human error, embedded problems that weren't fixed earlier in the process, and a too-optimistic attitude when it came to the progress of the telescope, according to an independent review of the JWST program. All that said, it's already been a long wait for JWST to get off the ground. The mission was re-planned in 2011 after it became clear that the telescope wouldn't be ready for launch in just a few years. The launch year was then set for 2018. All seemed to be going according to plan, but when the telescope reached its testing phase, things changed, resulting in these delays and cost overruns. Congress now has to approve the new cost cap for the mission, and NASA, at least, appears to be fully committed to the program. \"Webb is vital to the next generation of research beyond NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. It's going to do amazing things - things we've never been able to do before - as we peer into other galaxies and see light from the very dawn of time,\" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Despite major challenges, the board and NASA unanimously agree that Webb will achieve mission success with the implementation of the board's recommendations, many of which already are underway.\" Once in space, the telescope is expected to investigate the atmospheres of alien planets to figure out what they're made of. It should also be able to interpret exactly what some of the first galaxies could have looked like. In order to do this work, the telescope will have to be about 1 million miles from Earth and use a tennis court-sized sunshield to keep it cold while in space. First, it needs to get there.

Yes, again. The James Webb Space Telescope has faced a multitude of delays and budget overruns over the last two decades, and its new intended launch date is 30 March, 2021. Its previous launch date, which NASA announced in March, was May 2020. Since the project began in 1996, its scope has widened and its budget has ballooned from $0.5 billion to $9.6 billion. Because of the budget overrun, Congress will have to re-approve the increase in spending if it is to eventually launch, said NASA associate administrator Stephen Jurczyk in a 27 June press conference. These changes are in response to a report from an independent review board established by NASA to assess JWST's progress. \"There are no small JWST integration and test problems,\" read the report. With a project this complex, every problem becomes a big one. \"A very small human error or test anomaly can impact the schedule by months and the cost by tens of millions of dollars,\" the report says. Excessive optimism. It highlighted a series of problems both small and large, including \"excessive optimism\" in the previous timelines for building and testing the telescope, which have led to repeated delays and cost overruns. The March 2021 launch date assumes that all of the review board's recommendations will be implemented, preventing further problems or solving them before they impact the schedule, said Tom Young, the chair of the review board. Any further problems may push the launch date even further. JWST is NASA's planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. Its mirror is much bigger than Hubble's, which will allow it able to peer deeper into the early universe and capture data on the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The space telescope is planned to be primarily an exoplanet hunter. It is expected to find thousands of worlds beyond our solar system, and its improved sensitivity will allow us to see the atmospheres of some of those planets and even search for signs of life on other worlds.

However, the observatory could last another decade or two, if we're really lucky. The JWST is now slated for a March 2021 launch, and it seems to be pretty on schedule. And there is definitely room in the skies for both telescopes. Webb's mirror is 6.5 metres in diameter compared to Hubble's 2.4-metre mirror. In addition, the Webb telescope will be observing the skies in slightly different and longer wavelengths, from the visible to the mid-infrared. Hubble's capabilities range from ultraviolet to near-infrared - so Webb will be able to peer across longer distances to see objects at high redshifts, such as early-Universe galaxies, that are invisible to Hubble. Webb will also need to be kept at a very cold operating temperature in order to observe mid-infrared wavelengths, since thermal infrared radiation can interfere with the signal - that's what the complex five-layer sunshield is for. The next step for the Webb team will be to fully deploy this sunshield. This is the part that had technical problems in 2017 - several tears were discovered in the silicon- and aluminium-coated polyimide sheets, attributed to \"workmanship error\". The sunshield has since been tested individually, as have all the other components. Now the aim is to see if they work as intended on the fully assembled telescope, with a full battery of deployment and environmental tests. \"This is an exciting time to now see all Webb's parts finally joined together into a single observatory for the very first time,\" said Webb program director Gregory Robinson of NASA HQ. \"The engineering team has accomplished a huge step forward and soon we will be able to see incredible new views of our amazing universe.\" ", "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/the-james-webb-space-telescope-has-been-fully-assembled"}, {"title": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope Passes Vital Sun Shield Test", "date": "2019-10-29", "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has reached a major milestone with a successful test of the spacecraft's sun shield.

In this year's installment, the GAO finds that the padding in the project's schedule is in perilously short supply, and that the launch could slip to July 2021.

That is not in the cards right now. That's not because they did anything wrong. It's not anyone's fault or mismanagement.\" Zurbuchen made these comments at a virtual meeting of the National Academies' Space Studies Board. He said the telescope was already cutting it close on its schedule before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the agency and that the virus had led to additional lost work time. \"This team has stayed on its toes and pushed this telescope forward at the maximum speed possible,\" he said. \"But we've lost time. Instead of two shifts fully staffed, we could not do that for all the reasons that we talk about. Not everybody was available. There were positive cases here and there. And so, perhaps, we had only one shift.\" NASA and the telescope's prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, are evaluating the schedule going forward. This will include an estimate of when operations can completely return to normal-Zurbuchen said telescope preparation and testing activities are nearing full staffing again-and set a new date for a launch. This schedule review should conclude in July. \"I'm very optimistic about this thing getting off the launch pad in 2021,\" Zurbuchen said. \"Of course, there is still a lot of mountain to climb.\" Yet another launch delay has long been suspected, but this is the first time a senior NASA official has confirmed it. A government report published in January found that there was only a 12 percent chance that the large space telescope will launch in March 2021. It is due to lift off on board an Ariane 5 rocket from the European Space Agency's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The Webb telescope, NASA's follow-on instrument to the wildly successful Hubble Space Telescope, was originally due to launch about a decade ago, with a development cost of $1 billion. Since then, technical problems and delays have bedeviled the complex telescope. The January report also said the current estimate for Webb's development cost, $9.7 billion, may be too low. Building Webb has been difficult because its 6.5-meter mirror needs to unfurl itself once it reaches an orbit about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This is an exceedingly complex process, and there are more than 300 single points of failure aboard the observatory. NASA has had a difficult time testing them all on Earth in conditions that mimic the temperatures, pressure, and microgravity of deep space.

The much-delayed $9.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope won't launch in March 2021 as previously planned, NASA officials confirmed yesterday. Webb \"absolutely will not launch in March,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a presentation yesterday during the 2020 joint spring meeting of the Space Studies Board and Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board, both of which are part of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. \"That is not in the cards right now.\" Progress on the Webb telescope was proceeding nicely until the coronavirus pandemic hit early this year, Zurbuchen said. Many NASA centers switched to mandatory telework to combat the virus' spread, significantly slowing the development of numerous missions, including Webb. \"We've lost time,\" Zurbuchen said. \"Not everyone was available; we had positive cases here and there.\" NASA has not yet come up with a new target date for Webb's launch; that will likely be decided during a schedule assessment next month, Zurbuchen said. But he's confident the liftoff will occur sometime next year. \"I'm very optimistic of this thing getting off the launch pad in '21,\" Zurbuchen said. The delay is not exactly shocking. A report from the Government Accountability Office published in January of this year suggested that Webb had just a 12% chance of being ready for a March 2021 launch, even without the coronavirus pandemic. And the mission has suffered numerous delays and cost overruns over the years. Since 2009, for example, the observatory's targeted launch date has been pushed back by almost seven years, and its price tag has nearly doubled. But the science Webb will do once aloft will make all the trouble and effort worthwhile, NASA officials have stressed. The new observatory, billed as the successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, will allow astronomers to study the universe's first stars and galaxies and hunt for signs of life in the atmospheres of nearby alien planets, among other tasks. Webb is optimized to view the cosmos in infrared light. The observatory will launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana, then make its way out to the sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2, a gravitationally stable point in space about 930,000 miles from Earth.

The massive length of the mirror will allow the telescope to pick up more light from objects it sees once it's up in Space. The more light the mirror can collect, the more the telescope can see. As per NASA, this is the largest mirror it's ever built. However, with that accolade comes a price: as it's so big, it can't fit into the Ariane 5 rocket that it's due to launch in from French Guiana next year. Hence the NASA team has had to create the origami folding style. This latest test saw the mirror fully deployed for the first time ever, in the same way it'll be in Space. The test was carried out in the cleanroom of Northrup Grumman Space Systems in California. During the test, before the telescope sees liftoff next year, the telescope was placed in a simulated zero-gravity space so that the NASA team could ensure it would be able to unfurl properly once in Space.

That is not in the cards right now. That's not because they did anything wrong. It's not anyone's fault or mismanagement.\" Zurbuchen made these comments at a virtual meeting of the National Academies' Space Studies Board. He said the telescope was already cutting it close on its schedule before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the agency and that the virus had led to additional lost work time. \"This team has stayed on its toes and pushed this telescope forward at the maximum speed possible,\" he said. \"But we've lost time. Instead of two shifts fully staffed, we could not do that for all the reasons that we talk about. Not everybody was available. There were positive cases here and there. And so, perhaps, we had only one shift.\" NASA and the telescope's prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, are evaluating the schedule going forward. This will include an estimate of when operations can completely return to normal-Zurbuchen said telescope preparation and testing activities are nearing full staffing again-and set a new date for a launch. This schedule review should conclude in July. \"I'm very optimistic about this thing getting off the launch pad in 2021,\" Zurbuchen said. \"Of course, there is still a lot of mountain to climb.\" Yet another launch delay has long been suspected, but this is the first time a senior NASA official has confirmed it. A government report published in January found that there was only a 12 percent chance that the large space telescope will launch in March 2021. It is due to lift off on board an Ariane 5 rocket from the European Space Agency's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The Webb telescope, NASA's follow-on instrument to the wildly successful Hubble Space Telescope, was originally due to launch about a decade ago, with a development cost of $1 billion. Since then, technical problems and delays have bedeviled the complex telescope. The January report also said the current estimate for Webb's development cost, $9.7 billion, may be too low. Building Webb has been difficult because its 6.5-meter mirror needs to unfurl itself once it reaches an orbit about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This is an exceedingly complex process, and there are more than 300 single points of failure aboard the observatory. NASA has had a difficult time testing them all on Earth in conditions that mimic the temperatures, pressure, and microgravity of deep space.

But he's confident the liftoff will occur sometime next year. \"I'm very optimistic of this thing getting off the launch pad in '21,\" Zurbuchen said. The delay is not exactly shocking. A report from the Government Accountability Office published in January of this year suggested that Webb had just a 12% chance of being ready for a March 2021 launch, even without the coronavirus pandemic. And the mission has suffered numerous delays and cost overruns over the years. Since 2009, for example, the observatory's targeted launch date has been pushed back by almost seven years, and its price tag has nearly doubled. But the science Webb will do once aloft will make all the trouble and effort worthwhile, NASA officials have stressed. The new observatory, billed as the successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, will allow astronomers to study the universe's first stars and galaxies and hunt for signs of life in the atmospheres of nearby alien planets, among other tasks. Webb is optimized to view the cosmos in infrared light.

This new delay will not come with a budget increase, said NASA Science Mission Directorate associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen in a 16 July press conference. Instead, it will be paid for by additional funds that were allocated to the mission in the last delay. Of the seven-month delay, the coronavirus pandemic is to blame for at least three months of scheduling slip, said JWST program director Gregory Robinson during the press conference. \"The team is practicing covid-19 workplace protocols like social distancing, which will impact how quickly tasks can be finished in the clean room,\" he said.

Not wanting a repeat of Hubble's famous failure three decades ago - the telescope launched with blurred vision that had to be fixed with subsequent Shuttle missions - the tests have been longer and more involved than ever. The JWST has to work perfectly once it is in orbit as NASA doesn't have the capabilities to fix it once it's up there anymore. In fact, it never would have done. The Shuttle was a 'mere' orbital vehicle and the JWST is destined for a solar orbital position at the L2 point 1.5 million km away, roughly four times further out than the Moon. That means it can use its sun shield to block heat and light from the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon all in one go as they are all in the same approximate line. And, unlike Hubble which ducked in and out of the Earth's shadow every 90 minutes, Webb will have an uninterrupted view of the cosmos for 24/7 operation. Webb is an orbiting infrared observatory that boasts longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity over Hubble. These longer wavelengths effectively enable Webb to look much closer towards the beginning of time and to hunt for the as yet unobserved formation of the first galaxies following the Big Bang. It also allows it to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today and, of course, will greatly improve our ability to seek out and gather information regarding exoplanets. Cameras and instruments. Webb's primary mirror is a massive 6.5 metres across, a huge leap up from Hubble's 2.4 metre surface, all of which contributes massively to the new telescope being billed as 100x more powerful than Hubble. New lightweight optics have been used to construct it, with each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped components that will unfold at the L2 point to produce the final mirror weighing only 20kg, one tenth the mass of Hubble's mirror per unit area. In fact, if you scaled up Hubble's mirror to Webb's dimensions, it would be too heavy to make it into orbit. Webb's primary imager is the Near Infrared Camera, which will cover the infrared wavelength range 0.6 to 5 microns, and is based around ten mercury-cadmium-telluride detector arrays, which NASA says are roughly analogous to CCDs. It is equipped with chronographs which effectively let Webb hold a 'hand' up to block out the light from a bright object so they can see things close to it. This is joined by the Near InfraRed Spectrograph which will enable Webb to analyse the spectrum of an object and extrapolate its physical properties, including temperature, mass, and chemical composition. A Mid-Infrared Instrument features both a camera and a spectrograph operating in the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns. The expectation is that MIRI's camera will provide exactly the sort of wide-field, broadband imaging astrophotography that made Hubble's reputation. And finally the major instrument package is rounded out by the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, which will allow Webb to point precisely, as well as investigate 'first light' detection and much to do with exoplanets in the wavelength range of 0.8 to 5.0 microns. ## The journey begins Given Webb's complexity, it's no surprise to find out that it's late making it to the launchpad. Its original launch date was planned for October 2018, but that has slipped repeatedly since, with NASA citing the over-all size and complexity of Webb as the main issue, as well as wanting to take extra care over its sunshield and getting to the root cause of some strange readings during vibration testing back at the tail end of 2017. Shipping prep will be completed by the end of September after which the 6200kg instrument will begin its journey by sea through the Panama Canal and on to its launch location in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeastern coast of South America. There will then follow another round of checks to makes sure it survived the journey unscathed - all in all launch processing will take around two months - before it is finally loaded on to a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket for the most dangerous part of the journey, the 26-minute ride into orbit. Quite when that launch date will be is still hanging in the balance. Halloween, October 31, has been mooted in the past, but recent rumblings peg that back to November or even December thanks to a range of issues, including Covid. From there, all being well, it will take another month to fly to its eventual orbital position at L2, slowly unfolding as it goes. As the sunshield is deployed and it begins to cool down to its operating temperature of 50K, so the instruments will all slowly be brought online with the first observations scheduled for around six months after launch. Deploying and unfurling along the way requires in the region of 50 major deployments and 178 major release mechanisms to all work perfectly, which is around the time you begin to be grateful that NASA has spent as long as it has in testing Webb. After decades of planning it looks like we are finally getting there, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the mission despite the best efforts of what NASA details as \"thousands of scientists, engineers, and other professionals from more than 14 countries and 29 states, in nine different time zones.\" In fact, at the moment there is probably only one sure thing about it, and that is its name is Webb not the JWST.

The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST or Webb, has been in the works for decades. During a news conference held on Tuesday, project officials confirmed that the observatory is ready to launch. However, within hours, NASA and its partners on the project announced that the long-delayed launch would be postponed by yet one more day, to Saturday. That decision was due to high-altitude winds at the Guiana Space Center launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, according to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rives, a vice president at the European launch provider Arianespace, which is responsible for launching the observatory. The company will conduct another weather check on Wednesday in hopes of confirming the new launch date. Scientists have been anticipating JWST's revolutionary view on the cosmos for years. When JWST can get past its weather woes, its launch will begin a nerve-wracking deployment during a one-month journey covering 1 million miles. \"It really is a level of complexity that's over and above,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during the news conference. \"The testing that has occured is what gives us the calm, that's why we're sleeping.\" Zurbuchen said that he's confident in the team's decision to proceed to the launch pad. \"Rigorous testing has given us the ability to sit here and basically know, 'Hey, we've done the work that it takes for us to get to launch.'\" Work on JWST, which also includes the European and Canadian space agencies, began in 1996 targeting a 2007 launch; 14 years later, the observatory finally got the all-clear for blast-off during a launch readiness review held on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during the news conference. \"This is an extraordinary mission,\" Nelson said. \"It's a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.\" Nelson acknowledged the telescope's rocky path. \"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there've been some speed bumps, there've been some setbacks along the way,\" he said. But the agency remains committed to the scientific potential that JWST offers with its sharp infrared vision. \"It's as though we have always been living with blinders,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the news conference. \"Webb is going to take the blinders off and show us the formation of the universe.\" The observatory is set to blast off on Saturday no earlier than 7:20 a.m. EST. Live NASA coverage will begin at 6 a.m. EST here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or you can watch it directly at NASA TV. JWST will ride an Ariane 5 rocket operated by Arianespace, which could not offer a detailed weather forecast but said the only issue the team was monitoring was high-altitude winds. If the launch attempt on Saturday is called off, opportunities continue through the end of the year. Despite the magnitude of the launch, Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, echoed Zurbuchen's assertion that the team can sleep through the night without worries. \"My stress is generally low and that's the case now, and it actually gets less as we get to the pad,\" he said. \"Then it increases exponentially with the rocket - and I'm looking forward to that.\" For the mission team, the stress isn't necessarily going to disappear after blast-off. Launch is only the first step, one that begins a monthlong process of unfolding the intricate telescope as it treks out to a point called L2 on the opposite side of Earth as the sun. The delicate deployment procedure includes more than 300 steps that must work perfectly for the telescope to eventually begin operations. \"There's many different ways of looking at complexity, but one way to look at it is through single-point failures that need to work,\" Zurbuchen said. \"If you look at that metric, landing on Mars has roughly a third of the single- point failures than deploying the telescope fully.\" However, where a Mars landing is fully programmed in advance, unfolds in just a few minutes and must be executed without interference from Earth, most of JWST's deployment is a dynamic process that mission personnel can adjust as needed. \"The whole deployment process is very much human-controlled,\" Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said during the news conference. \"With the exception of the first couple of deployments right after spacecraft separation, all of our deployments are human controlled. We do them one at a time and make sure things are working correctly.\" And the observatory, NASA personnel emphasized, is worth the angst. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an Apollo moment for all of NASA, for the entire world, but especially for our science programs worldwide,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It's the stuff of dreams.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-weather-delay-christmas-launch"}, {"title": "Ariane 5 launches NASA's James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2021-12-25", "content": "A space telescope that will peer deeper into the universe than any other is on its way to its destination beyond the moon after a long- anticipated launch Dec. 25. An Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. Eastern. The James Webb Space Telescope separated from the rocket's upper stage 27 minutes after launch. Controllers confirmed that, minutes later, the 6,160-kilogram spacecraft deployed its solar array, the first in a long series of deployments for JWST. The solar array was one of the most critical ones, allowing the spacecraft to generate power. \"What we know now is that the injection was really perfect,\" said St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl, chief executive of Arianespace, of the launch of JWST in a postlaunch news briefing. Full details of the performance of the rocket would come after a review later, he said, but noted that the performance of the rocket would maximize the life of JWST by reducing the amount of propellant it will have to use to correct its trajectory. The launch, though, is just the beginning of a long deployment and commissioning process for the telescope, with many key steps still ahead. \"Generally speaking, the launch is of the order of 80% of the risk in a mission. I would say that, by our analysis, by various ways of assessing that, here it may be 20% or the risk, perhaps 30%,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the postlaunch briefing. \"We have retired quite some risk, but what is ahead remains is risk that we're going to take down step by step.\" The next key event will be 12.5 hours after liftoff, when the spacecraft performs a course correction maneuver called MCC-1a. That maneuver, and a second smaller one called MCC-1b two days after liftoff, will send the spacecraft to the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, arriving there 29 days after launch. Over the next two weeks, JWST will conduct a series of deployments to unfold into its final form. In the first week, controllers will direct the deployment of the spacecraft's sunshield, a structure made of five layers of Kapton material the area of a tennis court that will keep the telescope and its instruments cold enough to conduct infrared observations. In this second week, the telescope's mirrors, including its 18-segment primary mirror 6.5 meters across, will lock into place. That schedule is subject to change, project officials cautioned in the weeks leading up to the launch, depending on the progress of the deployments and any issues that come up. JWST has 344 single-point failures, 80% of which are in deployment systems, but those officials said they have various options to address any problems that come up during deployment. Once deployed, scientists and engineers will spend months commissioning the telescope, including aligning its optics, and then its four instruments, a process that will take about six months to complete. \"As the project manager, I won't breathe a sigh of relief until we declare we're operational 180 days after launch,\" Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a briefing in November. At that point, astronomers will finally be able to capitalize on the $10 billion spacecraft, which until now was primarily known for years of development delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns that affected other NASA science programs and, at times, threatened the flagship astronomy mission with cancellation. The four instruments on JWST, including contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, will study objects ranging from bodies in our own solar system to the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang. Other key science goals include studies of stellar and galactic evolution and characterization of exoplanets, including those potentially like the Earth. \"What are we going to do with this great telescope?

The $10 billion observatory unfurled its huge sunshield on Friday, carefully unfolding the five-layer structure by sequentially deploying two booms. \"Shine bright like a diamond. With the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or 'arm,' Webb's sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space,\" mission team members said via Webb's Twitter account Friday night. The sunshield is one of the most crucial and complicated features of Webb, which launched on Dec. 25 to seek out faint heat signals from the early universe. Detecting such signals requires that Webb keep its instruments and optics extremely cold, and the sunshield will help it do just that by reflecting and radiating away solar energy. The shiny silver shield measures 69.5 feet long by 46.5 feet wide when fully deployed - far too large to fit inside the protective payload fairing of any currently operational rocket. So it was designed to launch in a highly compact configuration and then unfold once Webb got to space. That deployment is an elaborate, multistep process with many different potential failure points that could sink the entire mission. \"Webb's sunshield assembly includes 140 release mechanisms, approximately 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors, bearings, springs, gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1,312 feet 400 m ,\" Webb spacecraft systems engineer Krystal Puga, who works at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the mission, said in a video about Webb's deployments that NASA posted in October. Sunshield deployment began on Tuesday when Webb lowered the two pallets that hold the five-layer structure. Additional steps followed over the next few days. On Thursday, for example, the observatory released the cover that had protected the sunshield during its time on Earth and launch to space. That cover complicated Friday's activities a bit: The Webb team delayed boom deployment by a few hours to make sure that the cover had fully rolled up as planned, and as needed. \"Switches that should have indicated that the cover rolled up did not trigger when they were supposed to,\" Patrick Lynch, deputy chief of the communications office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wrote in a blog post Friday. \"However, secondary and tertiary sources offered confirmation that it had,\" Lynch added. \"Temperature data seemed to show that the sunshield cover unrolled to block sunlight from a sensor, and gyroscope sensors indicated motion consistent with the sunshield cover release devices being activated.\" Webb team members initiated deployment of the port mid-boom at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday, Lynch wrote, and the activity wrapped up at 4:49 p.m. EST. Extension of the starboard mid-boom began at 6:31 p.m. EST and was done by around 10:13 p.m. EST, Lynch wrote in another blog post. Unfurling the sunshield is a huge milestone, so Webb team members are likely breathing big sighs of relief after Friday's success. But the sunshield work isn't done yet; its five thin Kapton layers must still be brought up to the proper tension, which the mission team aims to do over the weekend. After that's done, the focus will shift to deploying Webb's secondary mirror and its 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror. Those tasks are expected to be complete by Jan. 7 at the earliest, but deployment timelines are flexible, so don't be shocked if that target isn't met. Locking the mirrors into their proper place will bring Webb's complex main deployment phase to an end. The next major milestone to follow will be an engine burn, scheduled for 29 days after launch, that will insert Webb into orbit around its final destination: the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2, a gravitationally stable spot 930,000 miles from our planet. Webb team members will still have a lot of work to do after the observatory arrives at L2. They'll have to precisely align the 18 segments of Webb's primary mirror so the pieces work together as a single light-collecting surface, for example, and check out and calibrate the telescope's four scientific instruments. Regular science operations are expected to start six months after launch, in the summer of 2022. For at least five years after that, Webb will study some of the universe's first stars and galaxies, hunt for intriguing compounds in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets and make a variety of other potentially transformative cosmic observations.

Webb is Nasa's successor to the ageing Hubble space telescope. Work on it began way back in 1996. Back then, it was called the Next Generation space telescope. It was forecast to cost $500m and was set for launch in 2007. Webb is the world's most complex space science observatory. It consists of a 6.5-metre mirror and a tennis-court-sized sunshield, all of which will be folded into the nose-cone of a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket for launch later this year. Ensuring that it will unfold correctly once in space has generated a huge number of technical challenges, and this has led to many delays and a budget that has ballooned to about $10bn. Now, with the successful completion of the final set of tests, there is nothing left to do but launch the telescope and see if it all works as planned. Once launched, Webb will take about a month to fly to its final orbit about 1.5m km away from Earth. ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/03/spacewatch-james-webb-space-telescope-ready-launch"}, {"title": "NASA's James Space Webb Telescope finally approaches launch", "date": "2021-09-06", "content": "Last week, the James Webb Space Telescope finally completed the last stage of its comprehensive testing program at Northrop Grumman's facilities in Florida. Not wanting a repeat of Hubble's famous failure three decades ago - the telescope launched with blurred vision that had to be fixed with subsequent Shuttle missions - the tests have been longer and more involved than ever. The JWST has to work perfectly once it is in orbit as NASA doesn't have the capabilities to fix it once it's up there anymore. In fact, it never would have done. The Shuttle was a 'mere' orbital vehicle and the JWST is destined for a solar orbital position at the L2 point 1.5 million km away, roughly four times further out than the Moon. That means it can use its sun shield to block heat and light from the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon all in one go as they are all in the same approximate line. And, unlike Hubble which ducked in and out of the Earth's shadow every 90 minutes, Webb will have an uninterrupted view of the cosmos for 24/7 operation. Webb is an orbiting infrared observatory that boasts longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity over Hubble. These longer wavelengths effectively enable Webb to look much closer towards the beginning of time and to hunt for the as yet unobserved formation of the first galaxies following the Big Bang. It also allows it to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today and, of course, will greatly improve our ability to seek out and gather information regarding exoplanets. Cameras and instruments. Webb's primary mirror is a massive 6.5 metres across, a huge leap up from Hubble's 2.4 metre surface, all of which contributes massively to the new telescope being billed as 100x more powerful than Hubble. New lightweight optics have been used to construct it, with each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped components that will unfold at the L2 point to produce the final mirror weighing only 20kg, one tenth the mass of Hubble's mirror per unit area. In fact, if you scaled up Hubble's mirror to Webb's dimensions, it would be too heavy to make it into orbit. Webb's primary imager is the Near Infrared Camera, which will cover the infrared wavelength range 0.6 to 5 microns, and is based around ten mercury-cadmium-telluride detector arrays, which NASA says are roughly analogous to CCDs. It is equipped with chronographs which effectively let Webb hold a 'hand' up to block out the light from a bright object so they can see things close to it. This is joined by the Near InfraRed Spectrograph which will enable Webb to analyse the spectrum of an object and extrapolate its physical properties, including temperature, mass, and chemical composition. A Mid-Infrared Instrument features both a camera and a spectrograph operating in the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns. The expectation is that MIRI's camera will provide exactly the sort of wide-field, broadband imaging astrophotography that made Hubble's reputation. And finally the major instrument package is rounded out by the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, which will allow Webb to point precisely, as well as investigate 'first light' detection and much to do with exoplanets in the wavelength range of 0.8 to 5.0 microns. ## The journey begins Given Webb's complexity, it's no surprise to find out that it's late making it to the launchpad. Its original launch date was planned for October 2018, but that has slipped repeatedly since, with NASA citing the over-all size and complexity of Webb as the main issue, as well as wanting to take extra care over its sunshield and getting to the root cause of some strange readings during vibration testing back at the tail end of 2017. Shipping prep will be completed by the end of September after which the 6200kg instrument will begin its journey by sea through the Panama Canal and on to its launch location in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeastern coast of South America. There will then follow another round of checks to makes sure it survived the journey unscathed - all in all launch processing will take around two months - before it is finally loaded on to a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket for the most dangerous part of the journey, the 26-minute ride into orbit. Quite when that launch date will be is still hanging in the balance. Halloween, October 31, has been mooted in the past, but recent rumblings peg that back to November or even December thanks to a range of issues, including Covid. From there, all being well, it will take another month to fly to its eventual orbital position at L2, slowly unfolding as it goes. As the sunshield is deployed and it begins to cool down to its operating temperature of 50K, so the instruments will all slowly be brought online with the first observations scheduled for around six months after launch. Deploying and unfurling along the way requires in the region of 50 major deployments and 178 major release mechanisms to all work perfectly, which is around the time you begin to be grateful that NASA has spent as long as it has in testing Webb. After decades of planning it looks like we are finally getting there, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the mission despite the best efforts of what NASA details as \"thousands of scientists, engineers, and other professionals from more than 14 countries and 29 states, in nine different time zones.\" In fact, at the moment there is probably only one sure thing about it, and that is its name is Webb not the JWST. Once you start writing about it, like its predecessor before it, it somehow develops a personality all of its own.

The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST or Webb, has been in the works for decades. During a news conference held on Tuesday, project officials confirmed that the observatory is ready to launch. However, within hours, NASA and its partners on the project announced that the long-delayed launch would be postponed by yet one more day, to Saturday. That decision was due to high-altitude winds at the Guiana Space Center launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, according to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rives, a vice president at the European launch provider Arianespace, which is responsible for launching the observatory. The company will conduct another weather check on Wednesday in hopes of confirming the new launch date. Scientists have been anticipating JWST's revolutionary view on the cosmos for years. When JWST can get past its weather woes, its launch will begin a nerve-wracking deployment during a one-month journey covering 1 million miles. \"It really is a level of complexity that's over and above,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during the news conference. \"The testing that has occured is what gives us the calm, that's why we're sleeping.\" Zurbuchen said that he's confident in the team's decision to proceed to the launch pad. \"Rigorous testing has given us the ability to sit here and basically know, 'Hey, we've done the work that it takes for us to get to launch.'\" Work on JWST, which also includes the European and Canadian space agencies, began in 1996 targeting a 2007 launch; 14 years later, the observatory finally got the all-clear for blast-off during a launch readiness review held on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during the news conference. \"This is an extraordinary mission,\" Nelson said. \"It's a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.\" Nelson acknowledged the telescope's rocky path. \"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there've been some speed bumps, there've been some setbacks along the way,\" he said. But the agency remains committed to the scientific potential that JWST offers with its sharp infrared vision. \"It's as though we have always been living with blinders,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the news conference. \"Webb is going to take the blinders off and show us the formation of the universe.\" The observatory is set to blast off on Saturday no earlier than 7:20 a.m. EST. Live NASA coverage will begin at 6 a.m. EST here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or you can watch it directly at NASA TV. JWST will ride an Ariane 5 rocket operated by Arianespace, which could not offer a detailed weather forecast but said the only issue the team was monitoring was high-altitude winds. If the launch attempt on Saturday is called off, opportunities continue through the end of the year. Despite the magnitude of the launch, Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, echoed Zurbuchen's assertion that the team can sleep through the night without worries. \"My stress is generally low and that's the case now, and it actually gets less as we get to the pad,\" he said. \"Then it increases exponentially with the rocket - and I'm looking forward to that.\" For the mission team, the stress isn't necessarily going to disappear after blast-off. Launch is only the first step, one that begins a monthlong process of unfolding the intricate telescope as it treks out to a point called L2 on the opposite side of Earth as the sun. The delicate deployment procedure includes more than 300 steps that must work perfectly for the telescope to eventually begin operations. \"There's many different ways of looking at complexity, but one way to look at it is through single-point failures that need to work,\" Zurbuchen said. \"If you look at that metric, landing on Mars has roughly a third of the single- point failures than deploying the telescope fully.\" However, where a Mars landing is fully programmed in advance, unfolds in just a few minutes and must be executed without interference from Earth, most of JWST's deployment is a dynamic process that mission personnel can adjust as needed. \"The whole deployment process is very much human-controlled,\" Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said during the news conference. \"With the exception of the first couple of deployments right after spacecraft separation, all of our deployments are human controlled. We do them one at a time and make sure things are working correctly.\" And the observatory, NASA personnel emphasized, is worth the angst. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an Apollo moment for all of NASA, for the entire world, but especially for our science programs worldwide,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It's the stuff of dreams.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-weather-delay-christmas-launch"}, {"title": "Ariane 5 launches NASA's James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2021-12-25", "content": "A space telescope that will peer deeper into the universe than any other is on its way to its destination beyond the moon after a long- anticipated launch Dec. 25. An Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. Eastern. The James Webb Space Telescope separated from the rocket's upper stage 27 minutes after launch. Controllers confirmed that, minutes later, the 6,160-kilogram spacecraft deployed its solar array, the first in a long series of deployments for JWST. The solar array was one of the most critical ones, allowing the spacecraft to generate power. \"What we know now is that the injection was really perfect,\" said St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl, chief executive of Arianespace, of the launch of JWST in a postlaunch news briefing. Full details of the performance of the rocket would come after a review later, he said, but noted that the performance of the rocket would maximize the life of JWST by reducing the amount of propellant it will have to use to correct its trajectory. The launch, though, is just the beginning of a long deployment and commissioning process for the telescope, with many key steps still ahead. \"Generally speaking, the launch is of the order of 80% of the risk in a mission. I would say that, by our analysis, by various ways of assessing that, here it may be 20% or the risk, perhaps 30%,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the postlaunch briefing. \"We have retired quite some risk, but what is ahead remains is risk that we're going to take down step by step.\" The next key event will be 12.5 hours after liftoff, when the spacecraft performs a course correction maneuver called MCC-1a. That maneuver, and a second smaller one called MCC-1b two days after liftoff, will send the spacecraft to the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, arriving there 29 days after launch. Over the next two weeks, JWST will conduct a series of deployments to unfold into its final form. In the first week, controllers will direct the deployment of the spacecraft's sunshield, a structure made of five layers of Kapton material the area of a tennis court that will keep the telescope and its instruments cold enough to conduct infrared observations. In this second week, the telescope's mirrors, including its 18-segment primary mirror 6.5 meters across, will lock into place. That schedule is subject to change, project officials cautioned in the weeks leading up to the launch, depending on the progress of the deployments and any issues that come up. JWST has 344 single-point failures, 80% of which are in deployment systems, but those officials said they have various options to address any problems that come up during deployment. Once deployed, scientists and engineers will spend months commissioning the telescope, including aligning its optics, and then its four instruments, a process that will take about six months to complete. \"As the project manager, I won't breathe a sigh of relief until we declare we're operational 180 days after launch,\" Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a briefing in November. At that point, astronomers will finally be able to capitalize on the $10 billion spacecraft, which until now was primarily known for years of development delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns that affected other NASA science programs and, at times, threatened the flagship astronomy mission with cancellation. The four instruments on JWST, including contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, will study objects ranging from bodies in our own solar system to the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang. Other key science goals include studies of stellar and galactic evolution and characterization of exoplanets, including those potentially like the Earth. \"What are we going to do with this great telescope?

The JWST blasted off from French Guiana at 12:20 GMT on 25 December on top of an Ariane 5 rocket, folded into a compact cuboid. Around 27 minutes later, it separated from the rocket and deployed its solar array, which powers its propulsion and communication systems, as well as scientific instruments. Its next big manoeuvres were two course-correction burns, firing rocket thrusters to nudge the JWST towards its correct orbit around the sun, at a gravitationally stable location called L2 about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. ##### Advertisement The two burns used less fuel than anticipated thanks to the accuracy of the Ariane 5 rocket, which means the JWST will have enough propellant to last \"significantly\" longer than its expected 10-year operation time, according to NASA engineers. Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST will be too far away to service, so any leftover fuel is a bonus. On 3 January, JWST operators began the spacecraft's most critical manoeuvre - the unfolding and tensioning of its sunshield, which protects the telescope's sensitive instruments from the sun's powerful radiation. The shield is made up of five layers of a lightweight thermal material called Kapton and is as wide as a tennis court. Deploying it is a multistep process involving more than 140 release mechanisms. If these don't execute correctly, the entire mission could be in danger, but NASA engineers are confident of success after numerous rehearsals on the ground. \"I don't expect any drama,\" said JWST project manager Bill Ochs during a press conference on 3 January. \"The best thing for operations is 'boring'. And that's what we anticipate over the next three days - to be boring.\" As this article was published, the first three layers had been deployed and tightened and the rest of the sunshield is expected to be tensioned today. However, the sequence could take longer depending on the data that the JWST's engineers receive on the ground. As well as planned manoeuvres, NASA engineers have had to adapt to changing conditions aboard JWST, like fine-tuning its power systems and accounting for higher than expected temperatures inside the sunshield's motors due to incident sunlight. \"We've had a week to see how the observatory actually behaves in space. It's not uncommon to learn certain characteristics of your spacecraft once you're in flight,\" said Mike Menzel at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Once the sunshield is in place, the next big task is the deployment of the telescope's mirrors. First a secondary reflector will be extended out in front of the primary mirrors on 7 January, and then the 6.5-metre-wide primary mirrors will be unfolded on 8 and 9 January. After the mirrors are fully deployed, the JWST will continue on to L2 by the end of January, if all goes according to plan. The telescope will then fine- tune its instruments and systems for an extra five months before being ready to image the primordial universe.

The $10bn telescope was finished years late at a cost far higher than planned, but was finally launched on Christmas Day and is already more than halfway towards its destination approximately one million miles from Earth. This initial deployment phase sparked anxiety in the teams of engineers that designed it as it had 344 single points of failure when it left the Earth and no way to correct any physical problems should anything go wrong. The most complicated and critical task, unrolling and stretching out its tennis-court- sized sunshield, was completed last week. This included pins that had to release, latches to lock into place and a host of other mechanisms that needed to perform as planned. With the full deployment of its 6.4 metre, gold-coated primary mirror over the weekend, Nasa has confirmed that the satellite is now ready to begin preparing for its main mission. The satellite is a joint effort with Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. It is designed to explore every phase of cosmic history - from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe. \"Today, Nasa achieved another engineering milestone decades in the making. While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,\" said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an unprecedented mission that is on the precipice of seeing the light from the first galaxies and discovering the mysteries of our universe. Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life's passion into this mission.\" The two wings of Webb's primary mirror had been folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket prior to launch. After more than a week of other critical spacecraft deployments, the Webb team began remotely unfolding the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, the largest ever launched into space. This was a multi-day process, with the first side deployed on 7 January and the second the day after. JWST will now begin moving its 18 primary mirror segments to align the telescope optics. The ground team will command 126 actuators on the backsides of the segments to flex each mirror - an alignment that will take months to complete. Then the team will calibrate the science instruments prior to delivering Webb's first images this summer. Soon, JWST will also undergo a third mid-course correction burn - one of three planned to place the telescope precisely in orbit around the second Lagrange point, commonly known as L2, nearly 1 million miles from Earth. This is Webb's final orbital position, where its sunshield will protect it from light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon that could interfere with observations of infrared light.

Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 6.5 metres in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble telescope. The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Christmas Day. Those segments must now be detached from fasteners that held them in place for the launch and then moved forward by about a centimetre from their original configuration - a 10-day process - before they can be aligned to form a single, unbroken, light-collecting surface. The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, said. Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment \"is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair\", Feinberg said. \"All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,\" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at -240C in the vacuum of space, he added. The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary mirror into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system. If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said. The $9bn telescope, described by Nasa as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100m years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8bn years ago. The telescope is an international collaboration led by Nasa in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.

Here's what happens next", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "Since its launch on Christmas day, astronomers have eagerly followed the complex deployment and unfurling of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the largest to ever take to the skies. Right around the time this article is published, it's expected Webb will have reached a place called the Earth-Sun \"second Lagrange point\", or \"L2\". This is a point in space about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth where the gravity from both the Sun and Earth help to keep an orbiting satellite balanced in motion. Now the astronomical community - including my team of Swinburne University astronomers - is preparing for a new epoch of major discoveries. 30 years and US$10 billion. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Conversation looking forward to the launch of Webb, and reminiscing about the amazing early days of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, Webb's planned launch date was in 2018. And when the project was originally conceived in the 1990s, the goal was to launch before 2010. Why did it take nearly 30 years, and more than US$10 billion, to get Webb off the ground? First, it's the largest telescope ever put into space, with a gold-coated mirror 6.5m in diameter. With size comes complexity, as the entire structure needed to be folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Ariane rocket. Second, there were two major engineering marvels to accomplish with Webb. For a large telescope to produce the sharpest images possible, the mirror's surface needs to be aligned along a curve with extreme precision. For Webb this means unfolding and positioning the 18 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, plus a secondary mirror, to a precision of 25 billionths of a metre. Also, Webb will be observing infrared light, so it must be kept incredibly cold to maximise its sensitivity. This means it must be kept far away from Earth, which is a source of heat and light. It must also be completely protected from the Sun - achieved by a 20m multilayered reflective sunshield. All of Webb's major spacecraft deployments, including the unfurling of the primary mirror and sunshield, were completed on January 8. The entire process involved more than 300 single points of failure. The remaining tiny motions will take place over the next few months. The main mission. Webb's primary mission will be to witness the birth of the first stars and galaxies in the early Universe. As the light from these very faint galaxies travels across the vast gulf of space, and 13.8 billion years of time, it gets stretched by the overall expansion of the Universe in a process we call \" cosmological redshift \". This stretching means what started out as extremely energetic ultraviolet radiation from young, hot and massive stars will be received by Webb as infrared light. This is why its mirrors are coated in gold: compared with silver or aluminium, gold is a better reflector of infrared light and red light. Webb will see much farther into the infrared than Hubble could. It's also up to a million times more sensitive than ground-based telescopes, where the light from distant galaxies is drowned out by the infrared emission of Earth's own hot atmosphere. Because of these previous technological limitations, the first billion years of cosmic history has barely been explored. We don't know when or how the first stars formed. This is a complex question as stars produce heavy elements when they die. These elements pollute the interstellar gas in galaxies and change how this gas behaves and collapses to form later generations of stars. All current star formation we can observe, such as in the Milky Way, is from enriched interstellar gas. We haven't yet seen how stars form in pristine gas, which is without any heavy elements - as such a state hasn't existed for more than 13 billion years. But we think formation from pristine gas likely had a large effect on the properties of the first stellar populations. A deep space observatory. In addition to studying the early Universe, Webb will be a NASA \" Great Observatory \" and will support a diversity of other projects. It will allow scientists to peer into regions obscured by dust, such as the centres of galaxies where supermassive black holes lurk, or regions of intense star formation in our galaxy and others. Webb will also be sensitive to the coldest objects, including very low mass stars, and planets orbiting other stars within the Milky Way. One big improvement on Hubble is that Webb will be well-equipped for spectroscopy, dissecting light into its component wavelengths. This will let us measure the cosmic redshift of galaxies precisely, and figure out what elements they're made of. Closer to home, Webb will help us find molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon dioxide within the solar system, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It will be able to see these in the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars, which is particularly exciting for the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomers await with anticipation for the first data to be collected in the next few months. While the most dramatic and risky mechanical motions have been completed, the telescope continues to move, and the mirror segments are making tiny nanometre-sized motions to bring it into a focus. This will take many weeks as the telescope cools to its operating temperature. For myself, perhaps the most exciting aspect to look forward to is the completely unknown. With Webb, we'll be observing a previously murky cosmic era, when physical conditions were very different to those in the modern Universe. The history of astronomy suggests we can expect paradigm-shifting discoveries.

Webb is Nasa's successor to the ageing Hubble space telescope. Work on it began way back in 1996. Back then, it was called the Next Generation space telescope. It was forecast to cost $500m and was set for launch in 2007. Webb is the world's most complex space science observatory. It consists of a 6.5-metre mirror and a tennis-court-sized sunshield, all of which will be folded into the nose-cone of a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket for launch later this year. Ensuring that it will unfold correctly once in space has generated a huge number of technical challenges, and this has led to many delays and a budget that has ballooned to about $10bn. Now, with the successful completion of the final set of tests, there is nothing left to do but launch the telescope and see if it all works as planned. Once launched, Webb will take about a month to fly to its final orbit about 1.5m km away from Earth. ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/03/spacewatch-james-webb-space-telescope-ready-launch"}, {"title": "NASA's James Space Webb Telescope finally approaches launch", "date": "2021-09-06", "content": "Last week, the James Webb Space Telescope finally completed the last stage of its comprehensive testing program at Northrop Grumman's facilities in Florida. Not wanting a repeat of Hubble's famous failure three decades ago - the telescope launched with blurred vision that had to be fixed with subsequent Shuttle missions - the tests have been longer and more involved than ever. The JWST has to work perfectly once it is in orbit as NASA doesn't have the capabilities to fix it once it's up there anymore. In fact, it never would have done. The Shuttle was a 'mere' orbital vehicle and the JWST is destined for a solar orbital position at the L2 point 1.5 million km away, roughly four times further out than the Moon. That means it can use its sun shield to block heat and light from the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon all in one go as they are all in the same approximate line. And, unlike Hubble which ducked in and out of the Earth's shadow every 90 minutes, Webb will have an uninterrupted view of the cosmos for 24/7 operation. Webb is an orbiting infrared observatory that boasts longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity over Hubble. These longer wavelengths effectively enable Webb to look much closer towards the beginning of time and to hunt for the as yet unobserved formation of the first galaxies following the Big Bang. It also allows it to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today and, of course, will greatly improve our ability to seek out and gather information regarding exoplanets. Cameras and instruments. Webb's primary mirror is a massive 6.5 metres across, a huge leap up from Hubble's 2.4 metre surface, all of which contributes massively to the new telescope being billed as 100x more powerful than Hubble. New lightweight optics have been used to construct it, with each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped components that will unfold at the L2 point to produce the final mirror weighing only 20kg, one tenth the mass of Hubble's mirror per unit area. In fact, if you scaled up Hubble's mirror to Webb's dimensions, it would be too heavy to make it into orbit. Webb's primary imager is the Near Infrared Camera, which will cover the infrared wavelength range 0.6 to 5 microns, and is based around ten mercury-cadmium-telluride detector arrays, which NASA says are roughly analogous to CCDs. It is equipped with chronographs which effectively let Webb hold a 'hand' up to block out the light from a bright object so they can see things close to it. This is joined by the Near InfraRed Spectrograph which will enable Webb to analyse the spectrum of an object and extrapolate its physical properties, including temperature, mass, and chemical composition. A Mid-Infrared Instrument features both a camera and a spectrograph operating in the wavelength range of 5 to 28 microns. The expectation is that MIRI's camera will provide exactly the sort of wide-field, broadband imaging astrophotography that made Hubble's reputation. And finally the major instrument package is rounded out by the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, which will allow Webb to point precisely, as well as investigate 'first light' detection and much to do with exoplanets in the wavelength range of 0.8 to 5.0 microns. ## The journey begins Given Webb's complexity, it's no surprise to find out that it's late making it to the launchpad. Its original launch date was planned for October 2018, but that has slipped repeatedly since, with NASA citing the over-all size and complexity of Webb as the main issue, as well as wanting to take extra care over its sunshield and getting to the root cause of some strange readings during vibration testing back at the tail end of 2017. Shipping prep will be completed by the end of September after which the 6200kg instrument will begin its journey by sea through the Panama Canal and on to its launch location in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeastern coast of South America. There will then follow another round of checks to makes sure it survived the journey unscathed - all in all launch processing will take around two months - before it is finally loaded on to a European Space Agency Ariane 5 rocket for the most dangerous part of the journey, the 26-minute ride into orbit. Quite when that launch date will be is still hanging in the balance. Halloween, October 31, has been mooted in the past, but recent rumblings peg that back to November or even December thanks to a range of issues, including Covid. From there, all being well, it will take another month to fly to its eventual orbital position at L2, slowly unfolding as it goes. As the sunshield is deployed and it begins to cool down to its operating temperature of 50K, so the instruments will all slowly be brought online with the first observations scheduled for around six months after launch. Deploying and unfurling along the way requires in the region of 50 major deployments and 178 major release mechanisms to all work perfectly, which is around the time you begin to be grateful that NASA has spent as long as it has in testing Webb. After decades of planning it looks like we are finally getting there, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the mission despite the best efforts of what NASA details as \"thousands of scientists, engineers, and other professionals from more than 14 countries and 29 states, in nine different time zones.\" In fact, at the moment there is probably only one sure thing about it, and that is its name is Webb not the JWST. Once you start writing about it, like its predecessor before it, it somehow develops a personality all of its own.

The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST or Webb, has been in the works for decades. During a news conference held on Tuesday, project officials confirmed that the observatory is ready to launch. However, within hours, NASA and its partners on the project announced that the long-delayed launch would be postponed by yet one more day, to Saturday. That decision was due to high-altitude winds at the Guiana Space Center launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, according to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rives, a vice president at the European launch provider Arianespace, which is responsible for launching the observatory. The company will conduct another weather check on Wednesday in hopes of confirming the new launch date. Scientists have been anticipating JWST's revolutionary view on the cosmos for years. When JWST can get past its weather woes, its launch will begin a nerve-wracking deployment during a one-month journey covering 1 million miles. \"It really is a level of complexity that's over and above,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during the news conference. \"The testing that has occured is what gives us the calm, that's why we're sleeping.\" Zurbuchen said that he's confident in the team's decision to proceed to the launch pad. \"Rigorous testing has given us the ability to sit here and basically know, 'Hey, we've done the work that it takes for us to get to launch.'\" Work on JWST, which also includes the European and Canadian space agencies, began in 1996 targeting a 2007 launch; 14 years later, the observatory finally got the all-clear for blast-off during a launch readiness review held on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during the news conference. \"This is an extraordinary mission,\" Nelson said. \"It's a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.\" Nelson acknowledged the telescope's rocky path. \"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there've been some speed bumps, there've been some setbacks along the way,\" he said. But the agency remains committed to the scientific potential that JWST offers with its sharp infrared vision. \"It's as though we have always been living with blinders,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the news conference. \"Webb is going to take the blinders off and show us the formation of the universe.\" The observatory is set to blast off on Saturday no earlier than 7:20 a.m. EST. Live NASA coverage will begin at 6 a.m. EST here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or you can watch it directly at NASA TV. JWST will ride an Ariane 5 rocket operated by Arianespace, which could not offer a detailed weather forecast but said the only issue the team was monitoring was high-altitude winds. If the launch attempt on Saturday is called off, opportunities continue through the end of the year. Despite the magnitude of the launch, Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, echoed Zurbuchen's assertion that the team can sleep through the night without worries. \"My stress is generally low and that's the case now, and it actually gets less as we get to the pad,\" he said. \"Then it increases exponentially with the rocket - and I'm looking forward to that.\" For the mission team, the stress isn't necessarily going to disappear after blast-off. Launch is only the first step, one that begins a monthlong process of unfolding the intricate telescope as it treks out to a point called L2 on the opposite side of Earth as the sun. The delicate deployment procedure includes more than 300 steps that must work perfectly for the telescope to eventually begin operations. \"There's many different ways of looking at complexity, but one way to look at it is through single-point failures that need to work,\" Zurbuchen said. \"If you look at that metric, landing on Mars has roughly a third of the single- point failures than deploying the telescope fully.\" However, where a Mars landing is fully programmed in advance, unfolds in just a few minutes and must be executed without interference from Earth, most of JWST's deployment is a dynamic process that mission personnel can adjust as needed. \"The whole deployment process is very much human-controlled,\" Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said during the news conference. \"With the exception of the first couple of deployments right after spacecraft separation, all of our deployments are human controlled. We do them one at a time and make sure things are working correctly.\" And the observatory, NASA personnel emphasized, is worth the angst. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an Apollo moment for all of NASA, for the entire world, but especially for our science programs worldwide,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It's the stuff of dreams.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-weather-delay-christmas-launch"}, {"title": "Ariane 5 launches NASA's James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2021-12-25", "content": "A space telescope that will peer deeper into the universe than any other is on its way to its destination beyond the moon after a long- anticipated launch Dec. 25. An Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. Eastern. The James Webb Space Telescope separated from the rocket's upper stage 27 minutes after launch. Controllers confirmed that, minutes later, the 6,160-kilogram spacecraft deployed its solar array, the first in a long series of deployments for JWST. The solar array was one of the most critical ones, allowing the spacecraft to generate power. \"What we know now is that the injection was really perfect,\" said St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl, chief executive of Arianespace, of the launch of JWST in a postlaunch news briefing. Full details of the performance of the rocket would come after a review later, he said, but noted that the performance of the rocket would maximize the life of JWST by reducing the amount of propellant it will have to use to correct its trajectory. The launch, though, is just the beginning of a long deployment and commissioning process for the telescope, with many key steps still ahead. \"Generally speaking, the launch is of the order of 80% of the risk in a mission. I would say that, by our analysis, by various ways of assessing that, here it may be 20% or the risk, perhaps 30%,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the postlaunch briefing. \"We have retired quite some risk, but what is ahead remains is risk that we're going to take down step by step.\" The next key event will be 12.5 hours after liftoff, when the spacecraft performs a course correction maneuver called MCC-1a. That maneuver, and a second smaller one called MCC-1b two days after liftoff, will send the spacecraft to the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, arriving there 29 days after launch. Over the next two weeks, JWST will conduct a series of deployments to unfold into its final form. In the first week, controllers will direct the deployment of the spacecraft's sunshield, a structure made of five layers of Kapton material the area of a tennis court that will keep the telescope and its instruments cold enough to conduct infrared observations. In this second week, the telescope's mirrors, including its 18-segment primary mirror 6.5 meters across, will lock into place. That schedule is subject to change, project officials cautioned in the weeks leading up to the launch, depending on the progress of the deployments and any issues that come up. JWST has 344 single-point failures, 80% of which are in deployment systems, but those officials said they have various options to address any problems that come up during deployment. Once deployed, scientists and engineers will spend months commissioning the telescope, including aligning its optics, and then its four instruments, a process that will take about six months to complete. \"As the project manager, I won't breathe a sigh of relief until we declare we're operational 180 days after launch,\" Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a briefing in November. At that point, astronomers will finally be able to capitalize on the $10 billion spacecraft, which until now was primarily known for years of development delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns that affected other NASA science programs and, at times, threatened the flagship astronomy mission with cancellation. The four instruments on JWST, including contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, will study objects ranging from bodies in our own solar system to the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang. Other key science goals include studies of stellar and galactic evolution and characterization of exoplanets, including those potentially like the Earth. \"What are we going to do with this great telescope? We're going to look at everything there is in the universe that we can see,\" said John Mather, JWST senior project scientist at NASA Goddard who won the Nobel Prize in physics for studies of the cosmic microwave background. Astronomers and others are optimistic that JWST will be able to, at long last, fulfill the lofty expectations set for it. \"This is a once-in-a-generation event,\" said Pam Melroy, NASA deputy administrator, at a Dec. 21 press briefing. \"This is a high-risk and a very high-payoff program. We've done everything we can think of to make Webb successful, and now we just need to go do it.\" \"This space telescope has been decades in the making and, as with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there have been some speed bumps, there have been setbacks along the way,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at that briefing. \"This is the kind of a mission that only NASA and our partners can carry out. It's going to give us a better understanding of our universe and our place in it.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/ariane-5-launches-nasas-james-webb-space-telescope/"}, {"title": "James Webb Space Telescope unfurls massive sunshield in major deployment milestone", "date": "2021-12-31", "content": "One of the James Webb Space Telescope's most nail-biting deployment steps is safely in the books. The $10 billion observatory unfurled its huge sunshield on Friday, carefully unfolding the five-layer structure by sequentially deploying two booms. \"Shine bright like a diamond. With the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or 'arm,' Webb's sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space,\" mission team members said via Webb's Twitter account Friday night. The sunshield is one of the most crucial and complicated features of Webb, which launched on Dec. 25 to seek out faint heat signals from the early universe. Detecting such signals requires that Webb keep its instruments and optics extremely cold, and the sunshield will help it do just that by reflecting and radiating away solar energy. The shiny silver shield measures 69.5 feet long by 46.5 feet wide when fully deployed - far too large to fit inside the protective payload fairing of any currently operational rocket. So it was designed to launch in a highly compact configuration and then unfold once Webb got to space. That deployment is an elaborate, multistep process with many different potential failure points that could sink the entire mission. \"Webb's sunshield assembly includes 140 release mechanisms, approximately 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors, bearings, springs, gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1,312 feet 400 m ,\" Webb spacecraft systems engineer Krystal Puga, who works at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the mission, said in a video about Webb's deployments that NASA posted in October. Sunshield deployment began on Tuesday when Webb lowered the two pallets that hold the five-layer structure. Additional steps followed over the next few days. On Thursday, for example, the observatory released the cover that had protected the sunshield during its time on Earth and launch to space. That cover complicated Friday's activities a bit: The Webb team delayed boom deployment by a few hours to make sure that the cover had fully rolled up as planned, and as needed. \"Switches that should have indicated that the cover rolled up did not trigger when they were supposed to,\" Patrick Lynch, deputy chief of the communications office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wrote in a blog post Friday. \"However, secondary and tertiary sources offered confirmation that it had,\" Lynch added. \"Temperature data seemed to show that the sunshield cover unrolled to block sunlight from a sensor, and gyroscope sensors indicated motion consistent with the sunshield cover release devices being activated.\" Webb team members initiated deployment of the port mid-boom at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday, Lynch wrote, and the activity wrapped up at 4:49 p.m. EST. Extension of the starboard mid-boom began at 6:31 p.m. EST and was done by around 10:13 p.m. EST, Lynch wrote in another blog post. Unfurling the sunshield is a huge milestone, so Webb team members are likely breathing big sighs of relief after Friday's success. But the sunshield work isn't done yet; its five thin Kapton layers must still be brought up to the proper tension, which the mission team aims to do over the weekend. After that's done, the focus will shift to deploying Webb's secondary mirror and its 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror. Those tasks are expected to be complete by Jan. 7 at the earliest, but deployment timelines are flexible, so don't be shocked if that target isn't met. Locking the mirrors into their proper place will bring Webb's complex main deployment phase to an end. The next major milestone to follow will be an engine burn, scheduled for 29 days after launch, that will insert Webb into orbit around its final destination: the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2, a gravitationally stable spot 930,000 miles from our planet. Webb team members will still have a lot of work to do after the observatory arrives at L2. They'll have to precisely align the 18 segments of Webb's primary mirror so the pieces work together as a single light-collecting surface, for example, and check out and calibrate the telescope's four scientific instruments. Regular science operations are expected to start six months after launch, in the summer of 2022. For at least five years after that, Webb will study some of the universe's first stars and galaxies, hunt for intriguing compounds in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets and make a variety of other potentially transformative cosmic observations.

The JWST blasted off from French Guiana at 12:20 GMT on 25 December on top of an Ariane 5 rocket, folded into a compact cuboid. Around 27 minutes later, it separated from the rocket and deployed its solar array, which powers its propulsion and communication systems, as well as scientific instruments. Its next big manoeuvres were two course-correction burns, firing rocket thrusters to nudge the JWST towards its correct orbit around the sun, at a gravitationally stable location called L2 about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. ##### Advertisement The two burns used less fuel than anticipated thanks to the accuracy of the Ariane 5 rocket, which means the JWST will have enough propellant to last \"significantly\" longer than its expected 10-year operation time, according to NASA engineers. Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST will be too far away to service, so any leftover fuel is a bonus. On 3 January, JWST operators began the spacecraft's most critical manoeuvre - the unfolding and tensioning of its sunshield, which protects the telescope's sensitive instruments from the sun's powerful radiation. The shield is made up of five layers of a lightweight thermal material called Kapton and is as wide as a tennis court. Deploying it is a multistep process involving more than 140 release mechanisms. If these don't execute correctly, the entire mission could be in danger, but NASA engineers are confident of success after numerous rehearsals on the ground. \"I don't expect any drama,\" said JWST project manager Bill Ochs during a press conference on 3 January. \"The best thing for operations is 'boring'. And that's what we anticipate over the next three days - to be boring.\" As this article was published, the first three layers had been deployed and tightened and the rest of the sunshield is expected to be tensioned today. However, the sequence could take longer depending on the data that the JWST's engineers receive on the ground. As well as planned manoeuvres, NASA engineers have had to adapt to changing conditions aboard JWST, like fine-tuning its power systems and accounting for higher than expected temperatures inside the sunshield's motors due to incident sunlight. \"We've had a week to see how the observatory actually behaves in space. It's not uncommon to learn certain characteristics of your spacecraft once you're in flight,\" said Mike Menzel at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Once the sunshield is in place, the next big task is the deployment of the telescope's mirrors. First a secondary reflector will be extended out in front of the primary mirrors on 7 January, and then the 6.5-metre-wide primary mirrors will be unfolded on 8 and 9 January. After the mirrors are fully deployed, the JWST will continue on to L2 by the end of January, if all goes according to plan.

The $10bn telescope was finished years late at a cost far higher than planned, but was finally launched on Christmas Day and is already more than halfway towards its destination approximately one million miles from Earth. This initial deployment phase sparked anxiety in the teams of engineers that designed it as it had 344 single points of failure when it left the Earth and no way to correct any physical problems should anything go wrong. The most complicated and critical task, unrolling and stretching out its tennis-court- sized sunshield, was completed last week. This included pins that had to release, latches to lock into place and a host of other mechanisms that needed to perform as planned. With the full deployment of its 6.4 metre, gold-coated primary mirror over the weekend, Nasa has confirmed that the satellite is now ready to begin preparing for its main mission. The satellite is a joint effort with Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. It is designed to explore every phase of cosmic history - from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe. \"Today, Nasa achieved another engineering milestone decades in the making. While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,\" said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an unprecedented mission that is on the precipice of seeing the light from the first galaxies and discovering the mysteries of our universe. Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life's passion into this mission.\" The two wings of Webb's primary mirror had been folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket prior to launch. After more than a week of other critical spacecraft deployments, the Webb team began remotely unfolding the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, the largest ever launched into space. This was a multi-day process, with the first side deployed on 7 January and the second the day after. JWST will now begin moving its 18 primary mirror segments to align the telescope optics. The ground team will command 126 actuators on the backsides of the segments to flex each mirror - an alignment that will take months to complete. Then the team will calibrate the science instruments prior to delivering Webb's first images this summer. Soon, JWST will also undergo a third mid-course correction burn - one of three planned to place the telescope precisely in orbit around the second Lagrange point, commonly known as L2, nearly 1 million miles from Earth. This is Webb's final orbital position, where its sunshield will protect it from light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon that could interfere with observations of infrared light.

Mission control engineers at Nasa's Goddard space flight centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, began by sending their initial commands to tiny motors called actuators that slowly position and fine-tune the telescope's principal mirror. Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 6.5 metres in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble telescope. The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Christmas Day. Those segments must now be detached from fasteners that held them in place for the launch and then moved forward by about a centimetre from their original configuration - a 10-day process - before they can be aligned to form a single, unbroken, light-collecting surface. The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, said. Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment \"is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair\", Feinberg said. \"All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,\" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at -240C in the vacuum of space, he added. The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary mirror into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system. If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said. The $9bn telescope, described by Nasa as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100m years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8bn years ago. The telescope is an international collaboration led by Nasa in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.

Here's what happens next", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "Since its launch on Christmas day, astronomers have eagerly followed the complex deployment and unfurling of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the largest to ever take to the skies. Right around the time this article is published, it's expected Webb will have reached a place called the Earth-Sun \"second Lagrange point\", or \"L2\". This is a point in space about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth where the gravity from both the Sun and Earth help to keep an orbiting satellite balanced in motion. Now the astronomical community - including my team of Swinburne University astronomers - is preparing for a new epoch of major discoveries. 30 years and US$10 billion. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Conversation looking forward to the launch of Webb, and reminiscing about the amazing early days of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, Webb's planned launch date was in 2018. And when the project was originally conceived in the 1990s, the goal was to launch before 2010. Why did it take nearly 30 years, and more than US$10 billion, to get Webb off the ground? First, it's the largest telescope ever put into space, with a gold-coated mirror 6.5m in diameter. With size comes complexity, as the entire structure needed to be folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Ariane rocket. Second, there were two major engineering marvels to accomplish with Webb. For a large telescope to produce the sharpest images possible, the mirror's surface needs to be aligned along a curve with extreme precision. For Webb this means unfolding and positioning the 18 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, plus a secondary mirror, to a precision of 25 billionths of a metre. Also, Webb will be observing infrared light, so it must be kept incredibly cold to maximise its sensitivity. This means it must be kept far away from Earth, which is a source of heat and light. It must also be completely protected from the Sun - achieved by a 20m multilayered reflective sunshield. All of Webb's major spacecraft deployments, including the unfurling of the primary mirror and sunshield, were completed on January 8. The entire process involved more than 300 single points of failure. The remaining tiny motions will take place over the next few months. The main mission. Webb's primary mission will be to witness the birth of the first stars and galaxies in the early Universe. As the light from these very faint galaxies travels across the vast gulf of space, and 13.8 billion years of time, it gets stretched by the overall expansion of the Universe in a process we call \" cosmological redshift \". This stretching means what started out as extremely energetic ultraviolet radiation from young, hot and massive stars will be received by Webb as infrared light. This is why its mirrors are coated in gold: compared with silver or aluminium, gold is a better reflector of infrared light and red light. Webb will see much farther into the infrared than Hubble could. It's also up to a million times more sensitive than ground-based telescopes, where the light from distant galaxies is drowned out by the infrared emission of Earth's own hot atmosphere. Because of these previous technological limitations, the first billion years of cosmic history has barely been explored. We don't know when or how the first stars formed. This is a complex question as stars produce heavy elements when they die. These elements pollute the interstellar gas in galaxies and change how this gas behaves and collapses to form later generations of stars. All current star formation we can observe, such as in the Milky Way, is from enriched interstellar gas. We haven't yet seen how stars form in pristine gas, which is without any heavy elements - as such a state hasn't existed for more than 13 billion years. But we think formation from pristine gas likely had a large effect on the properties of the first stellar populations. A deep space observatory. In addition to studying the early Universe, Webb will be a NASA \" Great Observatory \" and will support a diversity of other projects. It will allow scientists to peer into regions obscured by dust, such as the centres of galaxies where supermassive black holes lurk, or regions of intense star formation in our galaxy and others. Webb will also be sensitive to the coldest objects, including very low mass stars, and planets orbiting other stars within the Milky Way. One big improvement on Hubble is that Webb will be well-equipped for spectroscopy, dissecting light into its component wavelengths. This will let us measure the cosmic redshift of galaxies precisely, and figure out what elements they're made of. Closer to home, Webb will help us find molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon dioxide within the solar system, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It will be able to see these in the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars, which is particularly exciting for the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomers await with anticipation for the first data to be collected in the next few months. While the most dramatic and risky mechanical motions have been completed, the telescope continues to move, and the mirror segments are making tiny nanometre-sized motions to bring it into a focus. This will take many weeks as the telescope cools to its operating temperature. For myself, perhaps the most exciting aspect to look forward to is the completely unknown. With Webb, we'll be observing a previously murky cosmic era, when physical conditions were very different to those in the modern Universe. The history of astronomy suggests we can expect paradigm-shifting discoveries.

That star, called HD 84406, is located 241 light-years from Earth and part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The images will not be used for science, but will help the ground teams align the 18 golden segments of Webb's 21-foot-wide main mirror. The images will be taken by Webb's Near Infrared Camera, which first has to cool down to its operational temperature of minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit. \"At the beginning, we will have 18 individual blurry images,\" Mark McCaughrean, a scientist at the JWST Science Working Group and senior advisor at the European Space Agency, who is familiar with the process, told Space.com. \"At the end, we will have one nice sharp image.\" NIRCam will keep staring at HD 84406 while Webb's optics experts move the mirror segments in nanometer-scale steps to create a perfectly smooth surface. This work is expected to last until late April. Only after that will the individual science instruments start fully training their eyes on objects in the near and distant universe. The first proper images are expected to be revealed to the public in late June or early July. McCaughrean said that none of the other three instruments could take over NIRCam's job in helping to align the mirror. The telescope's success depends on NIRCam and it simply isn't allowed to fail. \"If NIRCam failed, we wouldn't be able to align the mirror,\" said McCaughrean. \"That's why it's essentially two cameras in one. There is full redundancy. If one fails, we still have the other.\" Of the remaining three instruments, the Mid-Infrared Instrument has already been partially turned on during the telescope's month-long cruise to its destination. In case of the other two - the Near Infrared Spectrograph and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph - the control teams have now turned off the heaters that kept them warm during the cruise phase. These heaters allowed the instruments to gradually release the air trapped inside them and prevent water condensation and ice build-up. It will take weeks for the instruments to reach their operational temperatures. For MIRI, this temperature is only 10 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which the motion of atoms stops. The spectrographs can operate at slightly warmer temperatures of minus 393 degrees F. These extremely low temperatures are key for Webb to be able to perform its scientific tasks. The telescope was designed to image the oldest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe in the first hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. But because of the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these galaxies is only visible in infrared wavelengths. Since infrared light is essentially heat, the dim signal wouldn't be noticeable if the telescope itself radiated any warmth. While the cameras, like NIRCam and MIRI, will produce stunning images of stars and galaxies, the spectrographs will provide detailed information about the chemical composition of those distant objects, McCaughrean explained. The James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its destination, the Lagrangian Point 2, on Jan. 24. L2 is a point on the sun-Earth axis located at a distance of 930,000 miles from Earth away from the sun. The gravitational interplay of the two bodies creates stable conditions at L2, which makes it a popular spot for astronomy missions. A spacecraft in this spot orbits the sun in sync with Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope launched on Dec. 25 after a decade of delays. The $10 billion mission, dreamed up by astronomers in the early 1990s, pushed the limits of what's technically possible. Once its mirrors are aligned and instruments calibrated, Webb is expected to revolutionize many areas of astronomy. In addition to the first stars and galaxies, Webb will contribute to the study of exoplanets, star formation, dark matter and even the solar system and its asteroids.

The team recently completed the third of seven planned steps to align the 18 hexagonal segments of Webb's mirror, marking nearly the halfway point in a complex, weeks-long process. The second and third stages were respectively called segment alignment and image stacking, representing larger movements of the main mirror. Subsequent stages will make more minute adjustments to take an image of a distant star and gradually bring it to a single, precise point, NASA said in a statement(opens in new tab) Friday (Feb. 25). \"We still have work to do, but we are increasingly pleased with the results we're seeing,\" Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the same statement. \"Years of planning and testing are paying dividends, and the team could not be more excited to see what the next few weeks and months bring.\" During the segment alignment stage, Webb engineers refined an initial image of a star rendered 18 times. Engineers made minor adjustments to the main mirror and changed the alignment of Webb's secondary mirror. These repositionings were key to \"overlapping the light from all the mirrors so that they can work in unison,\" Webb officials said in the update. Then the third stage, image stacking, saw the focused dots reflected by each mirror stacked on top of one another. Photons of light from the individual segments were each rendered to the same location of a sensor on the telescope's near-infrared mirror (NIRCam). \"The team activated sets of six mirrors at a time and commanded them to repoint their light to overlap, until all dots of starlight overlapped with each other,\" Webb officials said of image stacking. Next will come the fourth phase of mirror alignment, called coarse phasing. That phase is already underway. NIRCam will be used to receive the light spectra (or wavelengths) from 20 pairings of the mirror segments. The process, Webb officials said, will allow engineers to correct small differences in heights between mirror segments. \"This will make the single dot of starlight progressively sharper and more focused in the coming weeks,\" NASA officials said, noting that the segments will gradually align to achieve an accuracy smaller than a single wavelength of light.

The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST or Webb, has been in the works for decades. During a news conference held on Tuesday, project officials confirmed that the observatory is ready to launch. However, within hours, NASA and its partners on the project announced that the long-delayed launch would be postponed by yet one more day, to Saturday. That decision was due to high-altitude winds at the Guiana Space Center launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, according to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rives, a vice president at the European launch provider Arianespace, which is responsible for launching the observatory. The company will conduct another weather check on Wednesday in hopes of confirming the new launch date. Scientists have been anticipating JWST's revolutionary view on the cosmos for years. When JWST can get past its weather woes, its launch will begin a nerve-wracking deployment during a one-month journey covering 1 million miles. \"It really is a level of complexity that's over and above,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during the news conference. \"The testing that has occured is what gives us the calm, that's why we're sleeping.\" Zurbuchen said that he's confident in the team's decision to proceed to the launch pad. \"Rigorous testing has given us the ability to sit here and basically know, 'Hey, we've done the work that it takes for us to get to launch.'\" Work on JWST, which also includes the European and Canadian space agencies, began in 1996 targeting a 2007 launch; 14 years later, the observatory finally got the all-clear for blast-off during a launch readiness review held on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during the news conference. \"This is an extraordinary mission,\" Nelson said. \"It's a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.\" Nelson acknowledged the telescope's rocky path. \"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there've been some speed bumps, there've been some setbacks along the way,\" he said. But the agency remains committed to the scientific potential that JWST offers with its sharp infrared vision. \"It's as though we have always been living with blinders,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the news conference. \"Webb is going to take the blinders off and show us the formation of the universe.\" The observatory is set to blast off on Saturday no earlier than 7:20 a.m. EST. Live NASA coverage will begin at 6 a.m. EST here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or you can watch it directly at NASA TV. JWST will ride an Ariane 5 rocket operated by Arianespace, which could not offer a detailed weather forecast but said the only issue the team was monitoring was high-altitude winds. If the launch attempt on Saturday is called off, opportunities continue through the end of the year. Despite the magnitude of the launch, Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, echoed Zurbuchen's assertion that the team can sleep through the night without worries. \"My stress is generally low and that's the case now, and it actually gets less as we get to the pad,\" he said. \"Then it increases exponentially with the rocket - and I'm looking forward to that.\" For the mission team, the stress isn't necessarily going to disappear after blast-off. Launch is only the first step, one that begins a monthlong process of unfolding the intricate telescope as it treks out to a point called L2 on the opposite side of Earth as the sun. The delicate deployment procedure includes more than 300 steps that must work perfectly for the telescope to eventually begin operations. \"There's many different ways of looking at complexity, but one way to look at it is through single-point failures that need to work,\" Zurbuchen said. \"If you look at that metric, landing on Mars has roughly a third of the single- point failures than deploying the telescope fully.\" However, where a Mars landing is fully programmed in advance, unfolds in just a few minutes and must be executed without interference from Earth, most of JWST's deployment is a dynamic process that mission personnel can adjust as needed. \"The whole deployment process is very much human-controlled,\" Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said during the news conference. \"With the exception of the first couple of deployments right after spacecraft separation, all of our deployments are human controlled. We do them one at a time and make sure things are working correctly.\" And the observatory, NASA personnel emphasized, is worth the angst. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an Apollo moment for all of NASA, for the entire world, but especially for our science programs worldwide,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It's the stuff of dreams.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-weather-delay-christmas-launch"}, {"title": "Ariane 5 launches NASA's James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2021-12-25", "content": "A space telescope that will peer deeper into the universe than any other is on its way to its destination beyond the moon after a long- anticipated launch Dec. 25. An Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. Eastern. The James Webb Space Telescope separated from the rocket's upper stage 27 minutes after launch. Controllers confirmed that, minutes later, the 6,160-kilogram spacecraft deployed its solar array, the first in a long series of deployments for JWST. The solar array was one of the most critical ones, allowing the spacecraft to generate power. \"What we know now is that the injection was really perfect,\" said St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl, chief executive of Arianespace, of the launch of JWST in a postlaunch news briefing. Full details of the performance of the rocket would come after a review later, he said, but noted that the performance of the rocket would maximize the life of JWST by reducing the amount of propellant it will have to use to correct its trajectory. The launch, though, is just the beginning of a long deployment and commissioning process for the telescope, with many key steps still ahead. \"Generally speaking, the launch is of the order of 80% of the risk in a mission. I would say that, by our analysis, by various ways of assessing that, here it may be 20% or the risk, perhaps 30%,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the postlaunch briefing. \"We have retired quite some risk, but what is ahead remains is risk that we're going to take down step by step.\" The next key event will be 12.5 hours after liftoff, when the spacecraft performs a course correction maneuver called MCC-1a. That maneuver, and a second smaller one called MCC-1b two days after liftoff, will send the spacecraft to the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, arriving there 29 days after launch. Over the next two weeks, JWST will conduct a series of deployments to unfold into its final form. In the first week, controllers will direct the deployment of the spacecraft's sunshield, a structure made of five layers of Kapton material the area of a tennis court that will keep the telescope and its instruments cold enough to conduct infrared observations. In this second week, the telescope's mirrors, including its 18-segment primary mirror 6.5 meters across, will lock into place. That schedule is subject to change, project officials cautioned in the weeks leading up to the launch, depending on the progress of the deployments and any issues that come up. JWST has 344 single-point failures, 80% of which are in deployment systems, but those officials said they have various options to address any problems that come up during deployment. Once deployed, scientists and engineers will spend months commissioning the telescope, including aligning its optics, and then its four instruments, a process that will take about six months to complete. \"As the project manager, I won't breathe a sigh of relief until we declare we're operational 180 days after launch,\" Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a briefing in November. At that point, astronomers will finally be able to capitalize on the $10 billion spacecraft, which until now was primarily known for years of development delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns that affected other NASA science programs and, at times, threatened the flagship astronomy mission with cancellation. The four instruments on JWST, including contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, will study objects ranging from bodies in our own solar system to the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang. Other key science goals include studies of stellar and galactic evolution and characterization of exoplanets, including those potentially like the Earth. \"What are we going to do with this great telescope? We're going to look at everything there is in the universe that we can see,\" said John Mather, JWST senior project scientist at NASA Goddard who won the Nobel Prize in physics for studies of the cosmic microwave background. Astronomers and others are optimistic that JWST will be able to, at long last, fulfill the lofty expectations set for it. \"This is a once-in-a-generation event,\" said Pam Melroy, NASA deputy administrator, at a Dec. 21 press briefing. \"This is a high-risk and a very high-payoff program. We've done everything we can think of to make Webb successful, and now we just need to go do it.\" \"This space telescope has been decades in the making and, as with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there have been some speed bumps, there have been setbacks along the way,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at that briefing. \"This is the kind of a mission that only NASA and our partners can carry out.

The $10 billion observatory unfurled its huge sunshield on Friday, carefully unfolding the five-layer structure by sequentially deploying two booms. \"Shine bright like a diamond. With the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or 'arm,' Webb's sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space,\" mission team members said via Webb's Twitter account Friday night. The sunshield is one of the most crucial and complicated features of Webb, which launched on Dec. 25 to seek out faint heat signals from the early universe. Detecting such signals requires that Webb keep its instruments and optics extremely cold, and the sunshield will help it do just that by reflecting and radiating away solar energy. The shiny silver shield measures 69.5 feet long by 46.5 feet wide when fully deployed - far too large to fit inside the protective payload fairing of any currently operational rocket. So it was designed to launch in a highly compact configuration and then unfold once Webb got to space. That deployment is an elaborate, multistep process with many different potential failure points that could sink the entire mission. \"Webb's sunshield assembly includes 140 release mechanisms, approximately 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors, bearings, springs, gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1,312 feet 400 m ,\" Webb spacecraft systems engineer Krystal Puga, who works at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the mission, said in a video about Webb's deployments that NASA posted in October. Sunshield deployment began on Tuesday when Webb lowered the two pallets that hold the five-layer structure. Additional steps followed over the next few days. On Thursday, for example, the observatory released the cover that had protected the sunshield during its time on Earth and launch to space. That cover complicated Friday's activities a bit: The Webb team delayed boom deployment by a few hours to make sure that the cover had fully rolled up as planned, and as needed. \"Switches that should have indicated that the cover rolled up did not trigger when they were supposed to,\" Patrick Lynch, deputy chief of the communications office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wrote in a blog post Friday. \"However, secondary and tertiary sources offered confirmation that it had,\" Lynch added. \"Temperature data seemed to show that the sunshield cover unrolled to block sunlight from a sensor, and gyroscope sensors indicated motion consistent with the sunshield cover release devices being activated.\" Webb team members initiated deployment of the port mid-boom at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday, Lynch wrote, and the activity wrapped up at 4:49 p.m. EST. Extension of the starboard mid-boom began at 6:31 p.m. EST and was done by around 10:13 p.m. EST, Lynch wrote in another blog post. Unfurling the sunshield is a huge milestone, so Webb team members are likely breathing big sighs of relief after Friday's success. But the sunshield work isn't done yet; its five thin Kapton layers must still be brought up to the proper tension, which the mission team aims to do over the weekend. After that's done, the focus will shift to deploying Webb's secondary mirror and its 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror. Those tasks are expected to be complete by Jan. 7 at the earliest, but deployment timelines are flexible, so don't be shocked if that target isn't met. Locking the mirrors into their proper place will bring Webb's complex main deployment phase to an end. The next major milestone to follow will be an engine burn, scheduled for 29 days after launch, that will insert Webb into orbit around its final destination: the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2, a gravitationally stable spot 930,000 miles from our planet. Webb team members will still have a lot of work to do after the observatory arrives at L2. They'll have to precisely align the 18 segments of Webb's primary mirror so the pieces work together as a single light-collecting surface, for example, and check out and calibrate the telescope's four scientific instruments. Regular science operations are expected to start six months after launch, in the summer of 2022. For at least five years after that, Webb will study some of the universe's first stars and galaxies, hunt for intriguing compounds in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets and make a variety of other potentially transformative cosmic observations.

Around 27 minutes later, it separated from the rocket and deployed its solar array, which powers its propulsion and communication systems, as well as scientific instruments. Its next big manoeuvres were two course-correction burns, firing rocket thrusters to nudge the JWST towards its correct orbit around the sun, at a gravitationally stable location called L2 about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. ##### Advertisement The two burns used less fuel than anticipated thanks to the accuracy of the Ariane 5 rocket, which means the JWST will have enough propellant to last \"significantly\" longer than its expected 10-year operation time, according to NASA engineers. Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, the JWST will be too far away to service, so any leftover fuel is a bonus. On 3 January, JWST operators began the spacecraft's most critical manoeuvre - the unfolding and tensioning of its sunshield, which protects the telescope's sensitive instruments from the sun's powerful radiation. The shield is made up of five layers of a lightweight thermal material called Kapton and is as wide as a tennis court. Deploying it is a multistep process involving more than 140 release mechanisms. If these don't execute correctly, the entire mission could be in danger, but NASA engineers are confident of success after numerous rehearsals on the ground. \"I don't expect any drama,\" said JWST project manager Bill Ochs during a press conference on 3 January. \"The best thing for operations is 'boring'. And that's what we anticipate over the next three days - to be boring.\" As this article was published, the first three layers had been deployed and tightened and the rest of the sunshield is expected to be tensioned today. However, the sequence could take longer depending on the data that the JWST's engineers receive on the ground. As well as planned manoeuvres, NASA engineers have had to adapt to changing conditions aboard JWST, like fine-tuning its power systems and accounting for higher than expected temperatures inside the sunshield's motors due to incident sunlight. \"We've had a week to see how the observatory actually behaves in space. It's not uncommon to learn certain characteristics of your spacecraft once you're in flight,\" said Mike Menzel at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Once the sunshield is in place, the next big task is the deployment of the telescope's mirrors. First a secondary reflector will be extended out in front of the primary mirrors on 7 January, and then the 6.5-metre-wide primary mirrors will be unfolded on 8 and 9 January. After the mirrors are fully deployed, the JWST will continue on to L2 by the end of January, if all goes according to plan. The telescope will then fine- tune its instruments and systems for an extra five months before being ready to image the primordial universe.

The $10bn telescope was finished years late at a cost far higher than planned, but was finally launched on Christmas Day and is already more than halfway towards its destination approximately one million miles from Earth. This initial deployment phase sparked anxiety in the teams of engineers that designed it as it had 344 single points of failure when it left the Earth and no way to correct any physical problems should anything go wrong. The most complicated and critical task, unrolling and stretching out its tennis-court- sized sunshield, was completed last week. This included pins that had to release, latches to lock into place and a host of other mechanisms that needed to perform as planned. With the full deployment of its 6.4 metre, gold-coated primary mirror over the weekend, Nasa has confirmed that the satellite is now ready to begin preparing for its main mission. The satellite is a joint effort with Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. It is designed to explore every phase of cosmic history - from within our solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe. \"Today, Nasa achieved another engineering milestone decades in the making. While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,\" said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an unprecedented mission that is on the precipice of seeing the light from the first galaxies and discovering the mysteries of our universe. Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life's passion into this mission.\" The two wings of Webb's primary mirror had been folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket prior to launch. After more than a week of other critical spacecraft deployments, the Webb team began remotely unfolding the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, the largest ever launched into space. This was a multi-day process, with the first side deployed on 7 January and the second the day after. JWST will now begin moving its 18 primary mirror segments to align the telescope optics. The ground team will command 126 actuators on the backsides of the segments to flex each mirror - an alignment that will take months to complete. Then the team will calibrate the science instruments prior to delivering Webb's first images this summer. Soon, JWST will also undergo a third mid-course correction burn - one of three planned to place the telescope precisely in orbit around the second Lagrange point, commonly known as L2, nearly 1 million miles from Earth. This is Webb's final orbital position, where its sunshield will protect it from light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon that could interfere with observations of infrared light.

Mission control engineers at Nasa's Goddard space flight centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, began by sending their initial commands to tiny motors called actuators that slowly position and fine-tune the telescope's principal mirror. Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 6.5 metres in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble telescope. The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Christmas Day. Those segments must now be detached from fasteners that held them in place for the launch and then moved forward by about a centimetre from their original configuration - a 10-day process - before they can be aligned to form a single, unbroken, light-collecting surface. The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, said. Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment \"is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair\", Feinberg said. \"All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,\" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at -240C in the vacuum of space, he added. The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary mirror into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system. If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said. The $9bn telescope, described by Nasa as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100m years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8bn years ago. The telescope is an international collaboration led by Nasa in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.

Here's what happens next", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "Since its launch on Christmas day, astronomers have eagerly followed the complex deployment and unfurling of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the largest to ever take to the skies. Right around the time this article is published, it's expected Webb will have reached a place called the Earth-Sun \"second Lagrange point\", or \"L2\". This is a point in space about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth where the gravity from both the Sun and Earth help to keep an orbiting satellite balanced in motion. Now the astronomical community - including my team of Swinburne University astronomers - is preparing for a new epoch of major discoveries. 30 years and US$10 billion. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Conversation looking forward to the launch of Webb, and reminiscing about the amazing early days of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, Webb's planned launch date was in 2018. And when the project was originally conceived in the 1990s, the goal was to launch before 2010. Why did it take nearly 30 years, and more than US$10 billion, to get Webb off the ground? First, it's the largest telescope ever put into space, with a gold-coated mirror 6.5m in diameter. With size comes complexity, as the entire structure needed to be folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Ariane rocket. Second, there were two major engineering marvels to accomplish with Webb. For a large telescope to produce the sharpest images possible, the mirror's surface needs to be aligned along a curve with extreme precision. For Webb this means unfolding and positioning the 18 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, plus a secondary mirror, to a precision of 25 billionths of a metre. Also, Webb will be observing infrared light, so it must be kept incredibly cold to maximise its sensitivity. This means it must be kept far away from Earth, which is a source of heat and light. It must also be completely protected from the Sun - achieved by a 20m multilayered reflective sunshield. All of Webb's major spacecraft deployments, including the unfurling of the primary mirror and sunshield, were completed on January 8. The entire process involved more than 300 single points of failure. The remaining tiny motions will take place over the next few months. The main mission. Webb's primary mission will be to witness the birth of the first stars and galaxies in the early Universe. As the light from these very faint galaxies travels across the vast gulf of space, and 13.8 billion years of time, it gets stretched by the overall expansion of the Universe in a process we call \" cosmological redshift \". This stretching means what started out as extremely energetic ultraviolet radiation from young, hot and massive stars will be received by Webb as infrared light. This is why its mirrors are coated in gold: compared with silver or aluminium, gold is a better reflector of infrared light and red light. Webb will see much farther into the infrared than Hubble could. It's also up to a million times more sensitive than ground-based telescopes, where the light from distant galaxies is drowned out by the infrared emission of Earth's own hot atmosphere. Because of these previous technological limitations, the first billion years of cosmic history has barely been explored. We don't know when or how the first stars formed. This is a complex question as stars produce heavy elements when they die. These elements pollute the interstellar gas in galaxies and change how this gas behaves and collapses to form later generations of stars. All current star formation we can observe, such as in the Milky Way, is from enriched interstellar gas. We haven't yet seen how stars form in pristine gas, which is without any heavy elements - as such a state hasn't existed for more than 13 billion years. But we think formation from pristine gas likely had a large effect on the properties of the first stellar populations. A deep space observatory. In addition to studying the early Universe, Webb will be a NASA \" Great Observatory \" and will support a diversity of other projects. It will allow scientists to peer into regions obscured by dust, such as the centres of galaxies where supermassive black holes lurk, or regions of intense star formation in our galaxy and others. Webb will also be sensitive to the coldest objects, including very low mass stars, and planets orbiting other stars within the Milky Way. One big improvement on Hubble is that Webb will be well-equipped for spectroscopy, dissecting light into its component wavelengths. This will let us measure the cosmic redshift of galaxies precisely, and figure out what elements they're made of. Closer to home, Webb will help us find molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon dioxide within the solar system, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It will be able to see these in the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars, which is particularly exciting for the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomers await with anticipation for the first data to be collected in the next few months. While the most dramatic and risky mechanical motions have been completed, the telescope continues to move, and the mirror segments are making tiny nanometre-sized motions to bring it into a focus. This will take many weeks as the telescope cools to its operating temperature. For myself, perhaps the most exciting aspect to look forward to is the completely unknown. With Webb, we'll be observing a previously murky cosmic era, when physical conditions were very different to those in the modern Universe. The history of astronomy suggests we can expect paradigm-shifting discoveries.

That star, called HD 84406, is located 241 light-years from Earth and part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The images will not be used for science, but will help the ground teams align the 18 golden segments of Webb's 21-foot-wide main mirror. The images will be taken by Webb's Near Infrared Camera, which first has to cool down to its operational temperature of minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit. \"At the beginning, we will have 18 individual blurry images,\" Mark McCaughrean, a scientist at the JWST Science Working Group and senior advisor at the European Space Agency, who is familiar with the process, told Space.com. \"At the end, we will have one nice sharp image.\" NIRCam will keep staring at HD 84406 while Webb's optics experts move the mirror segments in nanometer-scale steps to create a perfectly smooth surface. This work is expected to last until late April. Only after that will the individual science instruments start fully training their eyes on objects in the near and distant universe. The first proper images are expected to be revealed to the public in late June or early July. McCaughrean said that none of the other three instruments could take over NIRCam's job in helping to align the mirror. The telescope's success depends on NIRCam and it simply isn't allowed to fail. \"If NIRCam failed, we wouldn't be able to align the mirror,\" said McCaughrean. \"That's why it's essentially two cameras in one. There is full redundancy. If one fails, we still have the other.\" Of the remaining three instruments, the Mid-Infrared Instrument has already been partially turned on during the telescope's month-long cruise to its destination. In case of the other two - the Near Infrared Spectrograph and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph - the control teams have now turned off the heaters that kept them warm during the cruise phase. These heaters allowed the instruments to gradually release the air trapped inside them and prevent water condensation and ice build-up. It will take weeks for the instruments to reach their operational temperatures. For MIRI, this temperature is only 10 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which the motion of atoms stops. The spectrographs can operate at slightly warmer temperatures of minus 393 degrees F. These extremely low temperatures are key for Webb to be able to perform its scientific tasks. The telescope was designed to image the oldest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe in the first hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. But because of the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these galaxies is only visible in infrared wavelengths. Since infrared light is essentially heat, the dim signal wouldn't be noticeable if the telescope itself radiated any warmth. While the cameras, like NIRCam and MIRI, will produce stunning images of stars and galaxies, the spectrographs will provide detailed information about the chemical composition of those distant objects, McCaughrean explained. The James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its destination, the Lagrangian Point 2, on Jan. 24. L2 is a point on the sun-Earth axis located at a distance of 930,000 miles from Earth away from the sun. The gravitational interplay of the two bodies creates stable conditions at L2, which makes it a popular spot for astronomy missions. A spacecraft in this spot orbits the sun in sync with Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope launched on Dec. 25 after a decade of delays. The $10 billion mission, dreamed up by astronomers in the early 1990s, pushed the limits of what's technically possible. Once its mirrors are aligned and instruments calibrated, Webb is expected to revolutionize many areas of astronomy. In addition to the first stars and galaxies, Webb will contribute to the study of exoplanets, star formation, dark matter and even the solar system and its asteroids.

The team recently completed the third of seven planned steps to align the 18 hexagonal segments of Webb's mirror, marking nearly the halfway point in a complex, weeks-long process. The second and third stages were respectively called segment alignment and image stacking, representing larger movements of the main mirror. Subsequent stages will make more minute adjustments to take an image of a distant star and gradually bring it to a single, precise point, NASA said in a statement(opens in new tab) Friday (Feb. 25). \"We still have work to do, but we are increasingly pleased with the results we're seeing,\" Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the same statement. \"Years of planning and testing are paying dividends, and the team could not be more excited to see what the next few weeks and months bring.\" During the segment alignment stage, Webb engineers refined an initial image of a star rendered 18 times. Engineers made minor adjustments to the main mirror and changed the alignment of Webb's secondary mirror. These repositionings were key to \"overlapping the light from all the mirrors so that they can work in unison,\" Webb officials said in the update. Then the third stage, image stacking, saw the focused dots reflected by each mirror stacked on top of one another. Photons of light from the individual segments were each rendered to the same location of a sensor on the telescope's near-infrared mirror (NIRCam). \"The team activated sets of six mirrors at a time and commanded them to repoint their light to overlap, until all dots of starlight overlapped with each other,\" Webb officials said of image stacking. Next will come the fourth phase of mirror alignment, called coarse phasing. That phase is already underway. NIRCam will be used to receive the light spectra (or wavelengths) from 20 pairings of the mirror segments. The process, Webb officials said, will allow engineers to correct small differences in heights between mirror segments. \"This will make the single dot of starlight progressively sharper and more focused in the coming weeks,\" NASA officials said, noting that the segments will gradually align to achieve an accuracy smaller than a single wavelength of light.

The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST or Webb, has been in the works for decades. During a news conference held on Tuesday, project officials confirmed that the observatory is ready to launch. However, within hours, NASA and its partners on the project announced that the long-delayed launch would be postponed by yet one more day, to Saturday. That decision was due to high-altitude winds at the Guiana Space Center launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, according to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rives, a vice president at the European launch provider Arianespace, which is responsible for launching the observatory. The company will conduct another weather check on Wednesday in hopes of confirming the new launch date. Scientists have been anticipating JWST's revolutionary view on the cosmos for years. When JWST can get past its weather woes, its launch will begin a nerve-wracking deployment during a one-month journey covering 1 million miles. \"It really is a level of complexity that's over and above,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said during the news conference. \"The testing that has occured is what gives us the calm, that's why we're sleeping.\" Zurbuchen said that he's confident in the team's decision to proceed to the launch pad. \"Rigorous testing has given us the ability to sit here and basically know, 'Hey, we've done the work that it takes for us to get to launch.'\" Work on JWST, which also includes the European and Canadian space agencies, began in 1996 targeting a 2007 launch; 14 years later, the observatory finally got the all-clear for blast-off during a launch readiness review held on Tuesday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during the news conference. \"This is an extraordinary mission,\" Nelson said. \"It's a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We've always known that this project would be a risky endeavor, but of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.\" Nelson acknowledged the telescope's rocky path. \"As with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there've been some speed bumps, there've been some setbacks along the way,\" he said. But the agency remains committed to the scientific potential that JWST offers with its sharp infrared vision. \"It's as though we have always been living with blinders,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said during the news conference. \"Webb is going to take the blinders off and show us the formation of the universe.\" The observatory is set to blast off on Saturday no earlier than 7:20 a.m. EST. Live NASA coverage will begin at 6 a.m. EST here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or you can watch it directly at NASA TV. JWST will ride an Ariane 5 rocket operated by Arianespace, which could not offer a detailed weather forecast but said the only issue the team was monitoring was high-altitude winds. If the launch attempt on Saturday is called off, opportunities continue through the end of the year. Despite the magnitude of the launch, Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, echoed Zurbuchen's assertion that the team can sleep through the night without worries. \"My stress is generally low and that's the case now, and it actually gets less as we get to the pad,\" he said. \"Then it increases exponentially with the rocket - and I'm looking forward to that.\" For the mission team, the stress isn't necessarily going to disappear after blast-off. Launch is only the first step, one that begins a monthlong process of unfolding the intricate telescope as it treks out to a point called L2 on the opposite side of Earth as the sun. The delicate deployment procedure includes more than 300 steps that must work perfectly for the telescope to eventually begin operations. \"There's many different ways of looking at complexity, but one way to look at it is through single-point failures that need to work,\" Zurbuchen said. \"If you look at that metric, landing on Mars has roughly a third of the single- point failures than deploying the telescope fully.\" However, where a Mars landing is fully programmed in advance, unfolds in just a few minutes and must be executed without interference from Earth, most of JWST's deployment is a dynamic process that mission personnel can adjust as needed. \"The whole deployment process is very much human-controlled,\" Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said during the news conference. \"With the exception of the first couple of deployments right after spacecraft separation, all of our deployments are human controlled. We do them one at a time and make sure things are working correctly.\" And the observatory, NASA personnel emphasized, is worth the angst. \"The James Webb Space Telescope is an Apollo moment for all of NASA, for the entire world, but especially for our science programs worldwide,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It's the stuff of dreams.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-weather-delay-christmas-launch"}, {"title": "Ariane 5 launches NASA's James Webb Space Telescope", "date": "2021-12-25", "content": "A space telescope that will peer deeper into the universe than any other is on its way to its destination beyond the moon after a long- anticipated launch Dec. 25. An Ariane 5 lifted off from the European spaceport at Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. Eastern. The James Webb Space Telescope separated from the rocket's upper stage 27 minutes after launch. Controllers confirmed that, minutes later, the 6,160-kilogram spacecraft deployed its solar array, the first in a long series of deployments for JWST. The solar array was one of the most critical ones, allowing the spacecraft to generate power. \"What we know now is that the injection was really perfect,\" said St\u00e9phane Isra\u00ebl, chief executive of Arianespace, of the launch of JWST in a postlaunch news briefing. Full details of the performance of the rocket would come after a review later, he said, but noted that the performance of the rocket would maximize the life of JWST by reducing the amount of propellant it will have to use to correct its trajectory. The launch, though, is just the beginning of a long deployment and commissioning process for the telescope, with many key steps still ahead. \"Generally speaking, the launch is of the order of 80% of the risk in a mission. I would say that, by our analysis, by various ways of assessing that, here it may be 20% or the risk, perhaps 30%,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, at the postlaunch briefing. \"We have retired quite some risk, but what is ahead remains is risk that we're going to take down step by step.\" The next key event will be 12.5 hours after liftoff, when the spacecraft performs a course correction maneuver called MCC-1a. That maneuver, and a second smaller one called MCC-1b two days after liftoff, will send the spacecraft to the Earth-sun L-2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, arriving there 29 days after launch. Over the next two weeks, JWST will conduct a series of deployments to unfold into its final form. In the first week, controllers will direct the deployment of the spacecraft's sunshield, a structure made of five layers of Kapton material the area of a tennis court that will keep the telescope and its instruments cold enough to conduct infrared observations. In this second week, the telescope's mirrors, including its 18-segment primary mirror 6.5 meters across, will lock into place. That schedule is subject to change, project officials cautioned in the weeks leading up to the launch, depending on the progress of the deployments and any issues that come up. JWST has 344 single-point failures, 80% of which are in deployment systems, but those officials said they have various options to address any problems that come up during deployment. Once deployed, scientists and engineers will spend months commissioning the telescope, including aligning its optics, and then its four instruments, a process that will take about six months to complete. \"As the project manager, I won't breathe a sigh of relief until we declare we're operational 180 days after launch,\" Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said at a briefing in November. At that point, astronomers will finally be able to capitalize on the $10 billion spacecraft, which until now was primarily known for years of development delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns that affected other NASA science programs and, at times, threatened the flagship astronomy mission with cancellation. The four instruments on JWST, including contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, will study objects ranging from bodies in our own solar system to the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang. Other key science goals include studies of stellar and galactic evolution and characterization of exoplanets, including those potentially like the Earth. \"What are we going to do with this great telescope? We're going to look at everything there is in the universe that we can see,\" said John Mather, JWST senior project scientist at NASA Goddard who won the Nobel Prize in physics for studies of the cosmic microwave background. Astronomers and others are optimistic that JWST will be able to, at long last, fulfill the lofty expectations set for it. \"This is a once-in-a-generation event,\" said Pam Melroy, NASA deputy administrator, at a Dec. 21 press briefing. \"This is a high-risk and a very high-payoff program. We've done everything we can think of to make Webb successful, and now we just need to go do it.\" \"This space telescope has been decades in the making and, as with most extraordinary projects that are transformative, there have been some speed bumps, there have been setbacks along the way,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at that briefing. \"This is the kind of a mission that only NASA and our partners can carry out.

The $10 billion observatory unfurled its huge sunshield on Friday, carefully unfolding the five-layer structure by sequentially deploying two booms. \"Shine bright like a diamond. With the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or 'arm,' Webb's sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space,\" mission team members said via Webb's Twitter account Friday night. The sunshield is one of the most crucial and complicated features of Webb, which launched on Dec. 25 to seek out faint heat signals from the early universe. Detecting such signals requires that Webb keep its instruments and optics extremely cold, and the sunshield will help it do just that by reflecting and radiating away solar energy. The shiny silver shield measures 69.5 feet long by 46.5 feet wide when fully deployed - far too large to fit inside the protective payload fairing of any currently operational rocket. So it was designed to launch in a highly compact configuration and then unfold once Webb got to space. That deployment is an elaborate, multistep process with many different potential failure points that could sink the entire mission. \"Webb's sunshield assembly includes 140 release mechanisms, approximately 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors, bearings, springs, gears, about 400 pulleys and 90 cables totaling 1,312 feet 400 m ,\" Webb spacecraft systems engineer Krystal Puga, who works at Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor for the mission, said in a video about Webb's deployments that NASA posted in October. Sunshield deployment began on Tuesday when Webb lowered the two pallets that hold the five-layer structure. Additional steps followed over the next few days. On Thursday, for example, the observatory released the cover that had protected the sunshield during its time on Earth and launch to space. That cover complicated Friday's activities a bit: The Webb team delayed boom deployment by a few hours to make sure that the cover had fully rolled up as planned, and as needed. \"Switches that should have indicated that the cover rolled up did not trigger when they were supposed to,\" Patrick Lynch, deputy chief of the communications office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, wrote in a blog post Friday. \"However, secondary and tertiary sources offered confirmation that it had,\" Lynch added. \"Temperature data seemed to show that the sunshield cover unrolled to block sunlight from a sensor, and gyroscope sensors indicated motion consistent with the sunshield cover release devices being activated.\" Webb team members initiated deployment of the port mid-boom at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday, Lynch wrote, and the activity wrapped up at 4:49 p.m. EST. Extension of the starboard mid-boom began at 6:31 p.m. EST and was done by around 10:13 p.m. EST, Lynch wrote in another blog post. Unfurling the sunshield is a huge milestone, so Webb team members are likely breathing big sighs of relief after Friday's success. But the sunshield work isn't done yet; its five thin Kapton layers must still be brought up to the proper tension, which the mission team aims to do over the weekend. After that's done, the focus will shift to deploying Webb's secondary mirror and its 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror. Those tasks are expected to be complete by Jan. 7 at the earliest, but deployment timelines are flexible, so don't be shocked if that target isn't met. Locking the mirrors into their proper place will bring Webb's complex main deployment phase to an end. The next major milestone to follow will be an engine burn, scheduled for 29 days after launch, that will insert Webb into orbit around its final destination: the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 2, a gravitationally stable spot 930,000 miles from our planet. Webb team members will still have a lot of work to do after the observatory arrives at L2. They'll have to precisely align the 18 segments of Webb's primary mirror so the pieces work together as a single light-collecting surface, for example, and check out and calibrate the telescope's four scientific instruments. Regular science operations are expected to start six months after launch, in the summer of 2022. For at least five years after that, Webb will study some of the universe's first stars and galaxies, hunt for intriguing compounds in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets and make a variety of other potentially transformative cosmic observations.

Mission control engineers at Nasa's Goddard space flight centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, began by sending their initial commands to tiny motors called actuators that slowly position and fine-tune the telescope's principal mirror. Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 6.5 metres in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble telescope. The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Christmas Day.

The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, said. Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment \"is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair\", Feinberg said. \"All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,\" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at -240C in the vacuum of space, he added. The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary mirror into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system. If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said. The $9bn telescope, described by Nasa as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100m years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8bn years ago. The telescope is an international collaboration led by Nasa in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.

Here's what happens next", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "Since its launch on Christmas day, astronomers have eagerly followed the complex deployment and unfurling of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the largest to ever take to the skies. Right around the time this article is published, it's expected Webb will have reached a place called the Earth-Sun \"second Lagrange point\", or \"L2\". This is a point in space about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth where the gravity from both the Sun and Earth help to keep an orbiting satellite balanced in motion. Now the astronomical community - including my team of Swinburne University astronomers - is preparing for a new epoch of major discoveries. 30 years and US$10 billion. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Conversation looking forward to the launch of Webb, and reminiscing about the amazing early days of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, Webb's planned launch date was in 2018. And when the project was originally conceived in the 1990s, the goal was to launch before 2010. Why did it take nearly 30 years, and more than US$10 billion, to get Webb off the ground? First, it's the largest telescope ever put into space, with a gold-coated mirror 6.5m in diameter. With size comes complexity, as the entire structure needed to be folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Ariane rocket. Second, there were two major engineering marvels to accomplish with Webb. For a large telescope to produce the sharpest images possible, the mirror's surface needs to be aligned along a curve with extreme precision. For Webb this means unfolding and positioning the 18 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, plus a secondary mirror, to a precision of 25 billionths of a metre. Also, Webb will be observing infrared light, so it must be kept incredibly cold to maximise its sensitivity. This means it must be kept far away from Earth, which is a source of heat and light. It must also be completely protected from the Sun - achieved by a 20m multilayered reflective sunshield. All of Webb's major spacecraft deployments, including the unfurling of the primary mirror and sunshield, were completed on January 8. The entire process involved more than 300 single points of failure. The remaining tiny motions will take place over the next few months. The main mission. Webb's primary mission will be to witness the birth of the first stars and galaxies in the early Universe. As the light from these very faint galaxies travels across the vast gulf of space, and 13.8 billion years of time, it gets stretched by the overall expansion of the Universe in a process we call \" cosmological redshift \". This stretching means what started out as extremely energetic ultraviolet radiation from young, hot and massive stars will be received by Webb as infrared light. This is why its mirrors are coated in gold: compared with silver or aluminium, gold is a better reflector of infrared light and red light. Webb will see much farther into the infrared than Hubble could. It's also up to a million times more sensitive than ground-based telescopes, where the light from distant galaxies is drowned out by the infrared emission of Earth's own hot atmosphere. Because of these previous technological limitations, the first billion years of cosmic history has barely been explored. We don't know when or how the first stars formed. This is a complex question as stars produce heavy elements when they die. These elements pollute the interstellar gas in galaxies and change how this gas behaves and collapses to form later generations of stars. All current star formation we can observe, such as in the Milky Way, is from enriched interstellar gas. We haven't yet seen how stars form in pristine gas, which is without any heavy elements - as such a state hasn't existed for more than 13 billion years. But we think formation from pristine gas likely had a large effect on the properties of the first stellar populations. A deep space observatory. In addition to studying the early Universe, Webb will be a NASA \" Great Observatory \" and will support a diversity of other projects. It will allow scientists to peer into regions obscured by dust, such as the centres of galaxies where supermassive black holes lurk, or regions of intense star formation in our galaxy and others. Webb will also be sensitive to the coldest objects, including very low mass stars, and planets orbiting other stars within the Milky Way. One big improvement on Hubble is that Webb will be well-equipped for spectroscopy, dissecting light into its component wavelengths. This will let us measure the cosmic redshift of galaxies precisely, and figure out what elements they're made of. Closer to home, Webb will help us find molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon dioxide within the solar system, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It will be able to see these in the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars, which is particularly exciting for the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomers await with anticipation for the first data to be collected in the next few months. While the most dramatic and risky mechanical motions have been completed, the telescope continues to move, and the mirror segments are making tiny nanometre-sized motions to bring it into a focus. This will take many weeks as the telescope cools to its operating temperature. For myself, perhaps the most exciting aspect to look forward to is the completely unknown. With Webb, we'll be observing a previously murky cosmic era, when physical conditions were very different to those in the modern Universe. The history of astronomy suggests we can expect paradigm-shifting discoveries.

That star, called HD 84406, is located 241 light-years from Earth and part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The images will not be used for science, but will help the ground teams align the 18 golden segments of Webb's 21-foot-wide main mirror. The images will be taken by Webb's Near Infrared Camera, which first has to cool down to its operational temperature of minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit. \"At the beginning, we will have 18 individual blurry images,\" Mark McCaughrean, a scientist at the JWST Science Working Group and senior advisor at the European Space Agency, who is familiar with the process, told Space.com. \"At the end, we will have one nice sharp image.\" NIRCam will keep staring at HD 84406 while Webb's optics experts move the mirror segments in nanometer-scale steps to create a perfectly smooth surface. This work is expected to last until late April. Only after that will the individual science instruments start fully training their eyes on objects in the near and distant universe. The first proper images are expected to be revealed to the public in late June or early July. McCaughrean said that none of the other three instruments could take over NIRCam's job in helping to align the mirror. The telescope's success depends on NIRCam and it simply isn't allowed to fail. \"If NIRCam failed, we wouldn't be able to align the mirror,\" said McCaughrean. \"That's why it's essentially two cameras in one. There is full redundancy. If one fails, we still have the other.\" Of the remaining three instruments, the Mid-Infrared Instrument has already been partially turned on during the telescope's month-long cruise to its destination. In case of the other two - the Near Infrared Spectrograph and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph - the control teams have now turned off the heaters that kept them warm during the cruise phase. These heaters allowed the instruments to gradually release the air trapped inside them and prevent water condensation and ice build-up. It will take weeks for the instruments to reach their operational temperatures. For MIRI, this temperature is only 10 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which the motion of atoms stops. The spectrographs can operate at slightly warmer temperatures of minus 393 degrees F. These extremely low temperatures are key for Webb to be able to perform its scientific tasks. The telescope was designed to image the oldest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe in the first hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. But because of the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these galaxies is only visible in infrared wavelengths. Since infrared light is essentially heat, the dim signal wouldn't be noticeable if the telescope itself radiated any warmth. While the cameras, like NIRCam and MIRI, will produce stunning images of stars and galaxies, the spectrographs will provide detailed information about the chemical composition of those distant objects, McCaughrean explained. The James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its destination, the Lagrangian Point 2, on Jan. 24. L2 is a point on the sun-Earth axis located at a distance of 930,000 miles from Earth away from the sun. The gravitational interplay of the two bodies creates stable conditions at L2, which makes it a popular spot for astronomy missions. A spacecraft in this spot orbits the sun in sync with Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope launched on Dec. 25 after a decade of delays. The $10 billion mission, dreamed up by astronomers in the early 1990s, pushed the limits of what's technically possible. Once its mirrors are aligned and instruments calibrated, Webb is expected to revolutionize many areas of astronomy. In addition to the first stars and galaxies, Webb will contribute to the study of exoplanets, star formation, dark matter and even the solar system and its asteroids.

The team recently completed the third of seven planned steps to align the 18 hexagonal segments of Webb's mirror, marking nearly the halfway point in a complex, weeks-long process. The second and third stages were respectively called segment alignment and image stacking, representing larger movements of the main mirror. Subsequent stages will make more minute adjustments to take an image of a distant star and gradually bring it to a single, precise point, NASA said in a statement(opens in new tab) Friday (Feb. 25). \"We still have work to do, but we are increasingly pleased with the results we're seeing,\" Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the same statement. \"Years of planning and testing are paying dividends, and the team could not be more excited to see what the next few weeks and months bring.\" During the segment alignment stage, Webb engineers refined an initial image of a star rendered 18 times. Engineers made minor adjustments to the main mirror and changed the alignment of Webb's secondary mirror. These repositionings were key to \"overlapping the light from all the mirrors so that they can work in unison,\" Webb officials said in the update. Then the third stage, image stacking, saw the focused dots reflected by each mirror stacked on top of one another. Photons of light from the individual segments were each rendered to the same location of a sensor on the telescope's near-infrared mirror (NIRCam). \"The team activated sets of six mirrors at a time and commanded them to repoint their light to overlap, until all dots of starlight overlapped with each other,\" Webb officials said of image stacking. Next will come the fourth phase of mirror alignment, called coarse phasing. That phase is already underway. NIRCam will be used to receive the light spectra (or wavelengths) from 20 pairings of the mirror segments. The process, Webb officials said, will allow engineers to correct small differences in heights between mirror segments. \"This will make the single dot of starlight progressively sharper and more focused in the coming weeks,\" NASA officials said, noting that the segments will gradually align to achieve an accuracy smaller than a single wavelength of light.

Upon completing the seventh and final stage of telescope alignment, the team held a set of key decision meetings and unanimously agreed that Webb is ready to move forward into its next and final series of preparations, known as science instrument commissioning. This process will take about two months before scientific operations begin in the summer. The alignment of the telescope across all of Webb's instruments can be seen in a series of images that captures the observatory's full field of view. \"These remarkable test images from a successfully aligned telescope demonstrate what people across countries and continents can achieve when there is a bold scientific vision to explore the universe,\" said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The optical performance of the telescope continues to be better than the engineering team's most optimistic predictions. Webb's mirrors are now directing fully focused light collected from space down into each instrument, and each instrument is successfully capturing images with the light being delivered to them. The image quality delivered to all instruments is \"diffraction-limited,\" meaning that the fineness of detail that can be seen is as good as physically possible given the size of the telescope. From this point forward the only changes to the mirrors will be very small, periodic adjustments to the primary mirror segments. \"With the completion of telescope alignment and half a lifetime's worth of effort, my role on the James Webb Space Telescope mission has come to an end,\" said Scott Acton, Webb wavefront sensing and controls scientist, Ball Aerospace. \"These images have profoundly changed the way I see the universe. We are surrounded by a symphony of creation; there are galaxies everywhere! It is my hope that everyone in the world can see them.\" Now, the Webb team will turn its attention to science instrument commissioning. Each instrument is a highly sophisticated set of detectors equipped with unique lenses, masks, filters, and customized equipment that helps it perform the science it was designed to achieve. The specialized characteristics of these instruments will be configured and operated in various combinations during the instrument commissioning phase to fully confirm their readiness for science. With the formal conclusion of telescope alignment, key personnel involved with the commissioning of each instrument have arrived at the Mission Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, and some personnel involved with telescope alignment have concluded their duties. Though telescope alignment is complete, some telescope calibration activities remain: As part of scientific instrument commissioning, the telescope will be commanded to point to different areas in the sky where the total amount of solar radiation hitting the observatory will vary to confirm thermal stability when changing targets. Furthermore, ongoing maintenance observations every two days will monitor the mirror alignment and, when needed, apply corrections to keep the mirrors in their aligned locations.

The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary mirror into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system. If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said. The $9bn telescope, described by Nasa as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100m years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8bn years ago. The telescope is an international collaboration led by Nasa in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.

Here's what happens next", "date": "2022-01-24", "content": "Since its launch on Christmas day, astronomers have eagerly followed the complex deployment and unfurling of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope - the largest to ever take to the skies. Right around the time this article is published, it's expected Webb will have reached a place called the Earth-Sun \"second Lagrange point\", or \"L2\". This is a point in space about 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth where the gravity from both the Sun and Earth help to keep an orbiting satellite balanced in motion. Now the astronomical community - including my team of Swinburne University astronomers - is preparing for a new epoch of major discoveries. 30 years and US$10 billion. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Conversation looking forward to the launch of Webb, and reminiscing about the amazing early days of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. Back then, Webb's planned launch date was in 2018. And when the project was originally conceived in the 1990s, the goal was to launch before 2010. Why did it take nearly 30 years, and more than US$10 billion, to get Webb off the ground? First, it's the largest telescope ever put into space, with a gold-coated mirror 6.5m in diameter. With size comes complexity, as the entire structure needed to be folded to fit inside the nose cone of an Ariane rocket. Second, there were two major engineering marvels to accomplish with Webb. For a large telescope to produce the sharpest images possible, the mirror's surface needs to be aligned along a curve with extreme precision. For Webb this means unfolding and positioning the 18 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, plus a secondary mirror, to a precision of 25 billionths of a metre. Also, Webb will be observing infrared light, so it must be kept incredibly cold to maximise its sensitivity. This means it must be kept far away from Earth, which is a source of heat and light. It must also be completely protected from the Sun - achieved by a 20m multilayered reflective sunshield. All of Webb's major spacecraft deployments, including the unfurling of the primary mirror and sunshield, were completed on January 8. The entire process involved more than 300 single points of failure. The remaining tiny motions will take place over the next few months. The main mission. Webb's primary mission will be to witness the birth of the first stars and galaxies in the early Universe. As the light from these very faint galaxies travels across the vast gulf of space, and 13.8 billion years of time, it gets stretched by the overall expansion of the Universe in a process we call \" cosmological redshift \". This stretching means what started out as extremely energetic ultraviolet radiation from young, hot and massive stars will be received by Webb as infrared light. This is why its mirrors are coated in gold: compared with silver or aluminium, gold is a better reflector of infrared light and red light. Webb will see much farther into the infrared than Hubble could. It's also up to a million times more sensitive than ground-based telescopes, where the light from distant galaxies is drowned out by the infrared emission of Earth's own hot atmosphere. Because of these previous technological limitations, the first billion years of cosmic history has barely been explored. We don't know when or how the first stars formed. This is a complex question as stars produce heavy elements when they die. These elements pollute the interstellar gas in galaxies and change how this gas behaves and collapses to form later generations of stars. All current star formation we can observe, such as in the Milky Way, is from enriched interstellar gas. We haven't yet seen how stars form in pristine gas, which is without any heavy elements - as such a state hasn't existed for more than 13 billion years. But we think formation from pristine gas likely had a large effect on the properties of the first stellar populations. A deep space observatory. In addition to studying the early Universe, Webb will be a NASA \" Great Observatory \" and will support a diversity of other projects. It will allow scientists to peer into regions obscured by dust, such as the centres of galaxies where supermassive black holes lurk, or regions of intense star formation in our galaxy and others. Webb will also be sensitive to the coldest objects, including very low mass stars, and planets orbiting other stars within the Milky Way. One big improvement on Hubble is that Webb will be well-equipped for spectroscopy, dissecting light into its component wavelengths. This will let us measure the cosmic redshift of galaxies precisely, and figure out what elements they're made of. Closer to home, Webb will help us find molecules such as water, ammonia, carbon dioxide within the solar system, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It will be able to see these in the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars, which is particularly exciting for the search for extraterrestrial life. Astronomers await with anticipation for the first data to be collected in the next few months. While the most dramatic and risky mechanical motions have been completed, the telescope continues to move, and the mirror segments are making tiny nanometre-sized motions to bring it into a focus. This will take many weeks as the telescope cools to its operating temperature. For myself, perhaps the most exciting aspect to look forward to is the completely unknown. With Webb, we'll be observing a previously murky cosmic era, when physical conditions were very different to those in the modern Universe. The history of astronomy suggests we can expect paradigm-shifting discoveries.

That star, called HD 84406, is located 241 light-years from Earth and part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The images will not be used for science, but will help the ground teams align the 18 golden segments of Webb's 21-foot-wide main mirror. The images will be taken by Webb's Near Infrared Camera, which first has to cool down to its operational temperature of minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit. \"At the beginning, we will have 18 individual blurry images,\" Mark McCaughrean, a scientist at the JWST Science Working Group and senior advisor at the European Space Agency, who is familiar with the process, told Space.com. \"At the end, we will have one nice sharp image.\" NIRCam will keep staring at HD 84406 while Webb's optics experts move the mirror segments in nanometer-scale steps to create a perfectly smooth surface. This work is expected to last until late April. Only after that will the individual science instruments start fully training their eyes on objects in the near and distant universe. The first proper images are expected to be revealed to the public in late June or early July. McCaughrean said that none of the other three instruments could take over NIRCam's job in helping to align the mirror. The telescope's success depends on NIRCam and it simply isn't allowed to fail. \"If NIRCam failed, we wouldn't be able to align the mirror,\" said McCaughrean. \"That's why it's essentially two cameras in one. There is full redundancy. If one fails, we still have the other.\" Of the remaining three instruments, the Mid-Infrared Instrument has already been partially turned on during the telescope's month-long cruise to its destination. In case of the other two - the Near Infrared Spectrograph and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph - the control teams have now turned off the heaters that kept them warm during the cruise phase. These heaters allowed the instruments to gradually release the air trapped inside them and prevent water condensation and ice build-up. It will take weeks for the instruments to reach their operational temperatures. For MIRI, this temperature is only 10 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which the motion of atoms stops. The spectrographs can operate at slightly warmer temperatures of minus 393 degrees F. These extremely low temperatures are key for Webb to be able to perform its scientific tasks. The telescope was designed to image the oldest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe in the first hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. But because of the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these galaxies is only visible in infrared wavelengths. Since infrared light is essentially heat, the dim signal wouldn't be noticeable if the telescope itself radiated any warmth. While the cameras, like NIRCam and MIRI, will produce stunning images of stars and galaxies, the spectrographs will provide detailed information about the chemical composition of those distant objects, McCaughrean explained. The James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its destination, the Lagrangian Point 2, on Jan. 24. L2 is a point on the sun-Earth axis located at a distance of 930,000 miles from Earth away from the sun. The gravitational interplay of the two bodies creates stable conditions at L2, which makes it a popular spot for astronomy missions. A spacecraft in this spot orbits the sun in sync with Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope launched on Dec. 25 after a decade of delays. The $10 billion mission, dreamed up by astronomers in the early 1990s, pushed the limits of what's technically possible. Once its mirrors are aligned and instruments calibrated, Webb is expected to revolutionize many areas of astronomy. In addition to the first stars and galaxies, Webb will contribute to the study of exoplanets, star formation, dark matter and even the solar system and its asteroids.

The team recently completed the third of seven planned steps to align the 18 hexagonal segments of Webb's mirror, marking nearly the halfway point in a complex, weeks-long process. The second and third stages were respectively called segment alignment and image stacking, representing larger movements of the main mirror. Subsequent stages will make more minute adjustments to take an image of a distant star and gradually bring it to a single, precise point, NASA said in a statement(opens in new tab) Friday (Feb. 25). \"We still have work to do, but we are increasingly pleased with the results we're seeing,\" Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the same statement. \"Years of planning and testing are paying dividends, and the team could not be more excited to see what the next few weeks and months bring.\" During the segment alignment stage, Webb engineers refined an initial image of a star rendered 18 times. Engineers made minor adjustments to the main mirror and changed the alignment of Webb's secondary mirror. These repositionings were key to \"overlapping the light from all the mirrors so that they can work in unison,\" Webb officials said in the update. Then the third stage, image stacking, saw the focused dots reflected by each mirror stacked on top of one another. Photons of light from the individual segments were each rendered to the same location of a sensor on the telescope's near-infrared mirror (NIRCam). \"The team activated sets of six mirrors at a time and commanded them to repoint their light to overlap, until all dots of starlight overlapped with each other,\" Webb officials said of image stacking. Next will come the fourth phase of mirror alignment, called coarse phasing. That phase is already underway. NIRCam will be used to receive the light spectra (or wavelengths) from 20 pairings of the mirror segments. The process, Webb officials said, will allow engineers to correct small differences in heights between mirror segments. \"This will make the single dot of starlight progressively sharper and more focused in the coming weeks,\" NASA officials said, noting that the segments will gradually align to achieve an accuracy smaller than a single wavelength of light.

This process will take about two months before scientific operations begin in the summer. The alignment of the telescope across all of Webb's instruments can be seen in a series of images that captures the observatory's full field of view. \"These remarkable test images from a successfully aligned telescope demonstrate what people across countries and continents can achieve when there is a bold scientific vision to explore the universe,\" said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The optical performance of the telescope continues to be better than the engineering team's most optimistic predictions. Webb's mirrors are now directing fully focused light collected from space down into each instrument, and each instrument is successfully capturing images with the light being delivered to them. The image quality delivered to all instruments is \"diffraction-limited,\" meaning that the fineness of detail that can be seen is as good as physically possible given the size of the telescope. From this point forward the only changes to the mirrors will be very small, periodic adjustments to the primary mirror segments. \"With the completion of telescope alignment and half a lifetime's worth of effort, my role on the James Webb Space Telescope mission has come to an end,\" said Scott Acton, Webb wavefront sensing and controls scientist, Ball Aerospace. \"These images have profoundly changed the way I see the universe.

With the formal conclusion of telescope alignment, key personnel involved with the commissioning of each instrument have arrived at the Mission Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, and some personnel involved with telescope alignment have concluded their duties.

NASA is revving up to release its very first interstellar discoveries from the groundbreaking James Webb Space Telescope. Come July 12, we may begin seeing the universe through a vastly clearer lens. And in preparation for the highly anticipated day, JWST researchers have been meticulously perfecting each of the scope's trailblazing pieces of equipment -- and on that note, we have a couple of updates. NASA scientists announced on June 23 that they'd calibrated the eye of a JWST-mounted device called NIRSpec. That was a pretty big milestone because of the streamlined way NASA organized the road to regular JWST use. The agency basically has to get through 17 instrument \"modes,\" which you can think of as testing checkpoints, through analysis and observation before fully booting up the space explorer. With those NIRSpec achievements, the agency had passed the halfway point on the mode ledger -- bringing the grand total to 10 out of 17 complete. \"The recent confirmation of NIRSpec target acquisition ... primes the NIRSpec team for our last activities of commissioning,\" the team said. \"We cannot wait to see the first NIRSpec science observations coming this summer!\" And on July 1, the agency brought that total up to 15 of 17 modes complete as well as confirming that three of four major instruments are fully accounted for. All that's left is getting NIRCam -- JWST's big-dog imager -- up to speed. A quick recap of the James Webb specs. There are four key components to JWST, each of which contributes to those 17 modes outlined by the agency. Of note, almost all these facets rely on some type of infrared light detection, which means they can study a part of the electromagnetic spectrum invisible to human eyes. \"Study of the intensity or brightness of light across the wavelengths can provide key diagnostic information about the nature of various objects across the universe,\" the JWST team said. \"From extrasolar planets around distant stars, to faint galaxies at the edge of the universe, and objects in our own solar system.\" You can read here about the science of infrared in more detail. But returning to JWST's technology army, here's the breakdown. Its alpha instrument is probably the Near-Infrared Camera, or NIRCam. NIRCam will essentially lead the charge in detecting and imaging the cosmos as it was when time began. \"If NIRCam doesn't work, the telescope doesn't work,\" said Alison Nordt, space science and instrumentation director at aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, who's been a part of the JWST since the beginning. Then, there's the Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, which has both a camera and a spectrograph aimed at dissecting items illuminated by light in the middle part of the infrared electromagnetic region, and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, or NIRISS, which is basically an exoplanet hunting machine. Also aboard JWST, you'll find a navigation system, aka the fine guidance sensor, which helps the scope, well, not get lost. And finally, the star of NASA's recent update is the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, or NIRSpec. What is NIRSpec? \"The Near-Infrared Spectrograph is the instrument on the Webb telescope that observes spectra of astrophysical and planetary objects at near infrared wavelengths,\" the JWST team said. In other words, it works to examine space-borne phenomena that emit light in the near infrared region, but rather than merely image those objects, it can study their chemical composition. That's the intrigue of spectrography. You get more than a picture of a planet, you get details of what it would be like to stand on it. And in terms of target acquisition, the JWST team says NIRSpec has a mirror that can place cosmic targets in their proper locations as the telescope explores. This is crucial because such information helps NIRSpec's spectrograph know where to look. There are two ways the mirror does this -- the Wide Aperture Target Acquisition and the Micro-Shutter Assembly-based Target Acquisition. During testing, the team said, WATA performed \"excellently\" and MSATA made solid progress, and lucky for us, both successes give us awesome cosmic pictures, like the one featured up top. Further, with regard to MSATA, the James Webb team says this method is quite difficult to nail down. It calls for a proper estimation of NIRSpec science spectral intensity within one-tenth of the device's shutter width. That's incredibly precise. For context, it's \"the approximate size of a bumblebee, 1.5 centimeters, viewed from 150 kilometers away,\" the team said. Now that NASA has these successes down, just two more modes to go before we hit July 12 -- the day we've all been waiting for. Good luck, NIRCam, and to the stars, JWST.

Joe Biden, who unveiled the image at a White House event, called the moment \"historic\" and said it provided \"a new window into the history of our universe\". \"It's hard to even fathom,\" said the US president. \"It's astounding. It's an historic moment for science and technology, for America and all of humanity.\" Bill Nelson, administrator of Nasa, said the image showed the light of galaxies bending around other galaxies, traveling for billions of years before reaching the telescope. \"We are looking back more than 13 billion years,\" he said, adding that more images to be released by the space agency would reach back further, to about 13.5 billion years, close to the estimated start point of the universe itself. \"We are going back almost to the beginning,\" he said. The release of the image is a preview of a series of high-resolution color pictures from JWST that will be shown off by Nasa on Tuesday. They will include \"the deepest image of our universe that has ever been taken\", according to Nelson. Experts have said the telescope, three decades in the making and launched last year, could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by providing detailed infrared images of the universe. The $10bn telescope is able to peek inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the oldest galaxies in the universe by using a system of lenses, filters and prisms to detect signals in the infrared spectrum, which is invisible to the human eye. The system has so far \"performed flawlessly\", according to Marcia Rieke, professor of astronomy at University of Arizona. \"Webb can see backwards in time just after the big bang by looking for galaxies that are so far away, the light has taken many billions of years to get from those galaxies to ourselves,\" said Jonathan Gardner, deputy senior project scientist at Nasa, during a recent news conference. \"Webb is bigger than Hubble so that it can see fainter galaxies that are further away.\" The telescope, which is a joint endeavor with the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency, has been in development since the mid-1990s and was finally propelled into space in December. It is described as the most powerful telescope ever to be sent into space and is currently about 1m miles from Earth, performing its task of scanning ancient galaxies. The initial goal of the project was to see the first stars and galaxies formed following the big bang, watching \"the universe turn the lights on for the first time\", as Eric Smith, Webb program scientist, put it. The telescope should be considered \"one of humanity's great engineering achievements\", said Kamala Harris, the US vice-president. \"The whole observatory is performing stunningly well,\" said Gillian Wright, director of the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh, also principal investigator for the mid- infrared instrument on JWST. \"It's hard to take in how fantastic it has turned out to be. It is utterly amazing.\" Nasa said JWST has five initial cosmic targets for observation, including the Carina nebula, a sort of celestial nursery where stars form. The nebula is about 7,600 light years away and is home to many enormous stars, several times larger than the sun. Other areas of focus include WASP-96 b, a giant planet outside our solar system that is made mainly of gas; the southern ring nebula, an expanding cloud of gas surrounding a dying star that's 2,000 light years from Earth; and Stephan's quintet, notable for being the first compact galaxy group discovered in 1877. Images from these targets will be unveiled by Nasa on Tuesday. \"It's exhilarating to see the fantastic James Webb space telescope image released today,\" said Richard Ellis, professor of astrophysics at University College London who was part of the committee that first conceived the telescope. \"As we are ourselves made of the material synthesized in stars over the past 13 billion years, JWST has the unique ability to trace back to our own origins in this remarkable universe.

After full review, the observatory has been confirmed to be capable of capturing crisp, well-focused images with each of its four powerful onboard science instruments. Upon completing the seventh and final stage of telescope alignment, the team held a set of key decision meetings and unanimously agreed that Webb is ready to move forward into its next and final series of preparations, known as science instrument commissioning. This process will take about two months before scientific operations begin in the summer. The alignment of the telescope across all of Webb's instruments can be seen in a series of images that captures the observatory's full field of view. \"These remarkable test images from a successfully aligned telescope demonstrate what people across countries and continents can achieve when there is a bold scientific vision to explore the universe,\" said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The optical performance of the telescope continues to be better than the engineering team's most optimistic predictions. Webb's mirrors are now directing fully focused light collected from space down into each instrument, and each instrument is successfully capturing images with the light being delivered to them.

Is it serious? It appears not-despite the impact knocking the telescope slightly out of alignment. Webb \"recently sustained an impact to one primary mirror segment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a tweet. \"After initial assessments, the team found the telescope is still performing at a level that exceeds all mission requirements.\" He added that micrometeoroid strikes are an unavoidable aspect of operating in space.

Analysis and measurements are ongoing, said NASA, but it doesn't look like those initial images-or the science program that will follow-will be greatly affected. That's because engineers have been able to adjust its 18 mirrors to correct for the damaged segment. \"We always knew that Webb would have to weather the space environment, which includes harsh ultraviolet light and charged particles from the Sun, cosmic rays from exotic sources in the galaxy, and occasional strikes by micrometeoroids within our solar system,\" said Paul Geithner, technical deputy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"We designed and built Webb with performance margin-optical, thermal, electrical, mechanical-to ensure it can perform its ambitious science mission even after many years in space.\" That includes dust-sized particles flying at extreme velocities, though this impact was larger than was modeled when Webb was being built, said NASA.

Then, there's the Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, which has both a camera and a spectrograph aimed at dissecting items illuminated by light in the middle part of the infrared electromagnetic region, and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, or NIRISS, which is basically an exoplanet hunting machine. Also aboard JWST, you'll find a navigation system, aka the fine guidance sensor, which helps the scope, well, not get lost. And finally, the star of NASA's recent update is the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, or NIRSpec. What is NIRSpec? \"The Near-Infrared Spectrograph is the instrument on the Webb telescope that observes spectra of astrophysical and planetary objects at near infrared wavelengths,\" the JWST team said. In other words, it works to examine space-borne phenomena that emit light in the near infrared region, but rather than merely image those objects, it can study their chemical composition. That's the intrigue of spectrography. You get more than a picture of a planet, you get details of what it would be like to stand on it. And in terms of target acquisition, the JWST team says NIRSpec has a mirror that can place cosmic targets in their proper locations as the telescope explores. This is crucial because such information helps NIRSpec's spectrograph know where to look. There are two ways the mirror does this -- the Wide Aperture Target Acquisition and the Micro-Shutter Assembly-based Target Acquisition. During testing, the team said, WATA performed \"excellently\" and MSATA made solid progress, and lucky for us, both successes give us awesome cosmic pictures, like the one featured up top. Further, with regard to MSATA, the James Webb team says this method is quite difficult to nail down. It calls for a proper estimation of NIRSpec science spectral intensity within one-tenth of the device's shutter width. That's incredibly precise. For context, it's \"the approximate size of a bumblebee, 1.5 centimeters, viewed from 150 kilometers away,\" the team said. Now that NASA has these successes down, just two more modes to go before we hit July 12 -- the day we've all been waiting for. Good luck, NIRCam, and to the stars, JWST.

The telescope, an international collaboration with ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency), provides a unique perspective with its infrared sensitivity on our neighboring planet, complementing data being collected by orbiters, rovers, and other telescopes. Webb's unique observation post nearly a million miles away at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2 (L2) provides a view of Mars' observable disk (the portion of the sunlit side that is facing the telescope). As a result, Webb can capture images and spectra with the spectral resolution needed to study short-term phenomena like dust storms, weather patterns, seasonal changes, and, in a single observation, processes that occur at different times (daytime, sunset, and nighttime) of a Martian day. Because it is so close, the Red Planet is one of the brightest objects in the night sky in terms of both visible light (which human eyes can see) and the infrared light that Webb is designed to detect. This poses special challenges to the observatory, which was built to detect the extremely faint light of the most distant galaxies in the universe. Webb's instruments are so sensitive that without special observing techniques, the bright infrared light from Mars is blinding, causing a phenomenon known as \"detector saturation.\" Astronomers adjusted for Mars' extreme brightness by using very short exposures, measuring only some of the light that hit the detectors, and applying special data analysis techniques. Webb's first images of Mars, captured by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), show a region of the planet's eastern hemisphere at two different wavelengths, or colors of infrared light. This image shows a surface reference map from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the left, with the two Webb NIRCam instrument field of views overlaid. The near-infrared images from Webb are on shown on the right. The NIRCam shorter-wavelength (2.1 microns) image [top right] is dominated by reflected sunlight, and thus reveals surface details similar to those apparent in visible-light images [left]. The rings of the Huygens Crater, the dark volcanic rock of Syrtis Major, and brightening in the Hellas Basin are all apparent in this image. The NIRCam longer-wavelength (4.3 microns) image [lower right] shows thermal emission - light given off by the planet as it loses heat. The brightness of 4.3-micron light is related to the temperature of the surface and the atmosphere. The brightest region on the planet is where the Sun is nearly overhead, because it is generally warmest. The brightness decreases toward the polar regions, which receive less sunlight, and less light is emitted from the cooler northern hemisphere, which is experiencing winter at this time of year. However, temperature is not the only factor affecting the amount of 4.3-micron light reaching Webb with this filter. As light emitted by the planet passes through Mars' atmosphere, some gets absorbed by carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules. The Hellas Basin - which is the largest well-preserved impact structure on Mars, spanning more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) - appears darker than the surroundings because of this effect. \"This is actually not a thermal effect at Hellas,\" explained the principal investigator, Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who designed these Webb observations. \"The Hellas Basin is a lower altitude, and thus experiences higher air pressure. That higher pressure leads to a suppression of the thermal emission at this particular wavelength range [4.1-4.4 microns] due to an effect called pressure broadening. It will be very interesting to tease apart these competing effects in these data.\" Villanueva and his team also released Webb's first near-infrared spectrum of Mars, demonstrating Webb's power to study the Red Planet with spectroscopy. Whereas the images show differences in brightness integrated over a large number of wavelengths from place to place across the planet at a particular day and time, the spectrum shows the subtle variations in brightness between hundreds of different wavelengths representative of the planet as a whole. Astronomers will analyze the features of the spectrum to gather additional information about the surface and atmosphere of the planet. This infrared spectrum was obtained by combining measurements from all six of the high-resolution spectroscopy modes of Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). Preliminary analysis of the spectrum shows a rich set of spectral features that contain information about dust, icy clouds, what kind of rocks are on the planet's surface, and the composition of the atmosphere. The spectral signatures - including deep valleys known as absorption features - of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide are easily detected with Webb. The researchers have been analyzing the spectral data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to a scientific journal for peer review and publication. In the future, the Mars team will be using this imaging and spectroscopic data to explore regional differences across the planet, and to search for trace gases in the atmosphere, including methane and hydrogen chloride. These NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of Mars were conducted as part of Webb's Cycle 1 Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) solar system program led by Heidi Hammel of AURA.

NASA and the ESA have shared early images of Mars, taken on September 5th, that promise new insights into the planet's atmosphere. Data from the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) is already offering a few surprises. For starters, the giant Hellas Basin is oddly darker than nearby areas at the hottest time of the day, NASA's Giuliano Liuzzi and Space.com noted - higher air pressure at the basin's lower altitude has suppressed thermal emissions. The JWST imagery also gave space agencies an opportunity to share Mars' near-infrared atmospheric composition using the telescope's onboard spectrograph array. The spectroscopic 'map' (pictured at middle) shows the planet absorbing carbon dioxide at several different wavelengths, and also shows the presences of carbon monoxide and water. A future research paper will provide more detail about the Martian air's chemistry. It was particularly tricky to record the images. Mars is one of the brightest objects the James Webb telescope can see - a problem for an observatory designed to study the most distant objects in the universe. Researchers countered this by capturing very short exposures and using special techniques to analyze the findings. This is only the initial wave of pictures and data. It will take more observations to reveal more about Mars. However, the spectral info already hints at more information about the planet's materials. Liuzzi also thinks JWST studies could settle disputes over the presence of methane on Mars, potentially signalling that the Red Planet harbored life in its distant past.

The exoplanet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable. The image, as seen through four different light filters, shows how Webb's powerful infrared gaze can easily capture worlds beyond our solar system, pointing the way to future observations that will reveal more information than ever before about exoplanets. \"This is a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally,\" said Sasha Hinkley, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, who led these observations with a large international collaboration. Webb is an international mission led by NASA in collaboration with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The exoplanet in Webb's image, called HIP 65426 b, is about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter, and these observations could help narrow that down even further. It is young as planets go - about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth. Astronomers discovered the planet in 2017 using the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile and took images of it using short infrared wavelengths of light. Webb's view, at longer infrared wavelengths, reveals new details that ground-based telescopes would not be able to detect because of the intrinsic infrared glow of Earth's atmosphere. Researchers have been analyzing the data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to journals for peer review. But Webb's first capture of an exoplanet already hints at future possibilities for studying distant worlds. Since HIP 65426 b is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun, it is sufficiently distant from the star that Webb can easily separate the planet from the star in the image. Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are both equipped with coronagraphs, which are sets of tiny masks that block out starlight, enabling Webb to take direct images of certain exoplanets like this one. NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch later this decade, will demonstrate an even more advanced coronagraph. \"It was really impressive how well the Webb coronagraphs worked to suppress the light of the host star,\" Hinkley said. Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared. In each filter image, the planet appears as a slightly differently shaped blob of light. That is because of the particulars of Webb's optical system and how it translates light through the different optics. \"Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,\" said Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the analysis of the images. \"At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.\" While this is not the first direct image of an exoplanet taken from space - the Hubble Space Telescope has captured direct exoplanet images previously - HIP 65426 b points the way forward for Webb's exoplanet exploration. \"I think what's most exciting is that we've only just begun,\" Carter said. \"There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and formation. We may even discover previously unknown planets, too.\" ", "url": "https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "The Webb Telescope Has Been Hit By Something. Here's What It Means For Science", "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has been hit by a micrometeoroid, which has damaged one of the 18 beryllium-gold segments that makes up its main 6.5-meter mirror. It happened between May 23 and 25 according to NASA with the result being a \"marginally detectable effect in the data.\" Its C3 segment is thought to have been impacted by small dust particles. Is it serious? It appears not-despite the impact knocking the telescope slightly out of alignment. Webb \"recently sustained an impact to one primary mirror segment,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a tweet. \"After initial assessments, the team found the telescope is still performing at a level that exceeds all mission requirements.\" He added that micrometeoroid strikes are an unavoidable aspect of operating in space. Webb-a $10 billion space telescope that sees in the infrared part of the spectrum-launched on Christmas Day in 2021 and has since February been orbiting the L2 point about a million miles/1.6 million kilometres from Earth. Its \"first light\" images are due to be published on July 12. They're expected to be a dazzling demonstration of just what the world's most advanced space observatory ever is capable of. Analysis and measurements are ongoing, said NASA, but it doesn't look like those initial images-or the science program that will follow-will be greatly affected. That's because engineers have been able to adjust its 18 mirrors to correct for the damaged segment. \"We always knew that Webb would have to weather the space environment, which includes harsh ultraviolet light and charged particles from the Sun, cosmic rays from exotic sources in the galaxy, and occasional strikes by micrometeoroids within our solar system,\" said Paul Geithner, technical deputy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"We designed and built Webb with performance margin-optical, thermal, electrical, mechanical-to ensure it can perform its ambitious science mission even after many years in space.\" That includes dust-sized particles flying at extreme velocities, though this impact was larger than was modeled when Webb was being built, said NASA. However, it added that Webb's initial performance is still well above expectations. It's not the first time Webb has been struck. \"Since launch, we have had four smaller measurable micrometeoroid strikes that were consistent with expectations and this one more recently that is larger than our degradation predictions assumed,\" said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA Goddard. \"We will use this flight data to update our analysis of performance over time and also develop operational approaches to assure we maximize the imaging performance of Webb to the best extent possible for many years to come.\" Although the recent impact is classed as an \"unavoidable chance event\" Webb's engineers are able to maneuver it to protect the optics from known meteor showers.

And in preparation for the highly anticipated day, JWST researchers have been meticulously perfecting each of the scope's trailblazing pieces of equipment -- and on that note, we have a couple of updates. NASA scientists announced on June 23 that they'd calibrated the eye of a JWST-mounted device called NIRSpec. That was a pretty big milestone because of the streamlined way NASA organized the road to regular JWST use. The agency basically has to get through 17 instrument \"modes,\" which you can think of as testing checkpoints, through analysis and observation before fully booting up the space explorer. With those NIRSpec achievements, the agency had passed the halfway point on the mode ledger -- bringing the grand total to 10 out of 17 complete. \"The recent confirmation of NIRSpec target acquisition ... primes the NIRSpec team for our last activities of commissioning,\" the team said. \"We cannot wait to see the first NIRSpec science observations coming this summer!\" And on July 1, the agency brought that total up to 15 of 17 modes complete as well as confirming that three of four major instruments are fully accounted for. All that's left is getting NIRCam -- JWST's big-dog imager -- up to speed. A quick recap of the James Webb specs. There are four key components to JWST, each of which contributes to those 17 modes outlined by the agency. Of note, almost all these facets rely on some type of infrared light detection, which means they can study a part of the electromagnetic spectrum invisible to human eyes. \"Study of the intensity or brightness of light across the wavelengths can provide key diagnostic information about the nature of various objects across the universe,\" the JWST team said. \"From extrasolar planets around distant stars, to faint galaxies at the edge of the universe, and objects in our own solar system.\" You can read here about the science of infrared in more detail.

Webb's first images of Mars, captured by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), show a region of the planet's eastern hemisphere at two different wavelengths, or colors of infrared light. This image shows a surface reference map from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the left, with the two Webb NIRCam instrument field of views overlaid. The near-infrared images from Webb are on shown on the right. The NIRCam shorter-wavelength (2.1 microns) image [top right] is dominated by reflected sunlight, and thus reveals surface details similar to those apparent in visible-light images [left]. The rings of the Huygens Crater, the dark volcanic rock of Syrtis Major, and brightening in the Hellas Basin are all apparent in this image. The NIRCam longer-wavelength (4.3 microns) image [lower right] shows thermal emission - light given off by the planet as it loses heat. The brightness of 4.3-micron light is related to the temperature of the surface and the atmosphere. The brightest region on the planet is where the Sun is nearly overhead, because it is generally warmest. The brightness decreases toward the polar regions, which receive less sunlight, and less light is emitted from the cooler northern hemisphere, which is experiencing winter at this time of year. However, temperature is not the only factor affecting the amount of 4.3-micron light reaching Webb with this filter. As light emitted by the planet passes through Mars' atmosphere, some gets absorbed by carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules. The Hellas Basin - which is the largest well-preserved impact structure on Mars, spanning more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) - appears darker than the surroundings because of this effect. \"This is actually not a thermal effect at Hellas,\" explained the principal investigator, Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who designed these Webb observations. \"The Hellas Basin is a lower altitude, and thus experiences higher air pressure. That higher pressure leads to a suppression of the thermal emission at this particular wavelength range [4.1-4.4 microns] due to an effect called pressure broadening. It will be very interesting to tease apart these competing effects in these data.\" Villanueva and his team also released Webb's first near-infrared spectrum of Mars, demonstrating Webb's power to study the Red Planet with spectroscopy. Whereas the images show differences in brightness integrated over a large number of wavelengths from place to place across the planet at a particular day and time, the spectrum shows the subtle variations in brightness between hundreds of different wavelengths representative of the planet as a whole. Astronomers will analyze the features of the spectrum to gather additional information about the surface and atmosphere of the planet. This infrared spectrum was obtained by combining measurements from all six of the high-resolution spectroscopy modes of Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). Preliminary analysis of the spectrum shows a rich set of spectral features that contain information about dust, icy clouds, what kind of rocks are on the planet's surface, and the composition of the atmosphere. The spectral signatures - including deep valleys known as absorption features - of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide are easily detected with Webb. The researchers have been analyzing the spectral data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to a scientific journal for peer review and publication. In the future, the Mars team will be using this imaging and spectroscopic data to explore regional differences across the planet, and to search for trace gases in the atmosphere, including methane and hydrogen chloride. These NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of Mars were conducted as part of Webb's Cycle 1 Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) solar system program led by Heidi Hammel of AURA.

NASA and the ESA have shared early images of Mars, taken on September 5th, that promise new insights into the planet's atmosphere. Data from the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) is already offering a few surprises. For starters, the giant Hellas Basin is oddly darker than nearby areas at the hottest time of the day, NASA's Giuliano Liuzzi and Space.com noted - higher air pressure at the basin's lower altitude has suppressed thermal emissions. The JWST imagery also gave space agencies an opportunity to share Mars' near-infrared atmospheric composition using the telescope's onboard spectrograph array. The spectroscopic 'map' (pictured at middle) shows the planet absorbing carbon dioxide at several different wavelengths, and also shows the presences of carbon monoxide and water. A future research paper will provide more detail about the Martian air's chemistry. It was particularly tricky to record the images. Mars is one of the brightest objects the James Webb telescope can see - a problem for an observatory designed to study the most distant objects in the universe. Researchers countered this by capturing very short exposures and using special techniques to analyze the findings. This is only the initial wave of pictures and data. It will take more observations to reveal more about Mars. However, the spectral info already hints at more information about the planet's materials.

The exoplanet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable. The image, as seen through four different light filters, shows how Webb's powerful infrared gaze can easily capture worlds beyond our solar system, pointing the way to future observations that will reveal more information than ever before about exoplanets. \"This is a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally,\" said Sasha Hinkley, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, who led these observations with a large international collaboration. Webb is an international mission led by NASA in collaboration with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The exoplanet in Webb's image, called HIP 65426 b, is about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter, and these observations could help narrow that down even further. It is young as planets go - about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth. Astronomers discovered the planet in 2017 using the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile and took images of it using short infrared wavelengths of light. Webb's view, at longer infrared wavelengths, reveals new details that ground-based telescopes would not be able to detect because of the intrinsic infrared glow of Earth's atmosphere. Researchers have been analyzing the data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to journals for peer review. But Webb's first capture of an exoplanet already hints at future possibilities for studying distant worlds. Since HIP 65426 b is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun, it is sufficiently distant from the star that Webb can easily separate the planet from the star in the image. Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are both equipped with coronagraphs, which are sets of tiny masks that block out starlight, enabling Webb to take direct images of certain exoplanets like this one. NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch later this decade, will demonstrate an even more advanced coronagraph. \"It was really impressive how well the Webb coronagraphs worked to suppress the light of the host star,\" Hinkley said. Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared. In each filter image, the planet appears as a slightly differently shaped blob of light. That is because of the particulars of Webb's optical system and how it translates light through the different optics. \"Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,\" said Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the analysis of the images. \"At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.\" While this is not the first direct image of an exoplanet taken from space - the Hubble Space Telescope has captured direct exoplanet images previously - HIP 65426 b points the way forward for Webb's exoplanet exploration. \"I think what's most exciting is that we've only just begun,\" Carter said. \"There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and formation. We may even discover previously unknown planets, too.\" ", "url": "https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA James Webb Space Telescope Nearly Done With Final Testing", "date": "2022-07-07", "content": "It's almost time. NASA is revving up to release its very first interstellar discoveries from the groundbreaking James Webb Space Telescope. Come July 12, we may begin seeing the universe through a vastly clearer lens. And in preparation for the highly anticipated day, JWST researchers have been meticulously perfecting each of the scope's trailblazing pieces of equipment -- and on that note, we have a couple of updates. NASA scientists announced on June 23 that they'd calibrated the eye of a JWST-mounted device called NIRSpec. That was a pretty big milestone because of the streamlined way NASA organized the road to regular JWST use. The agency basically has to get through 17 instrument \"modes,\" which you can think of as testing checkpoints, through analysis and observation before fully booting up the space explorer. With those NIRSpec achievements, the agency had passed the halfway point on the mode ledger -- bringing the grand total to 10 out of 17 complete. \"The recent confirmation of NIRSpec target acquisition ... primes the NIRSpec team for our last activities of commissioning,\" the team said. \"We cannot wait to see the first NIRSpec science observations coming this summer!\" And on July 1, the agency brought that total up to 15 of 17 modes complete as well as confirming that three of four major instruments are fully accounted for. All that's left is getting NIRCam -- JWST's big-dog imager -- up to speed. A quick recap of the James Webb specs. There are four key components to JWST, each of which contributes to those 17 modes outlined by the agency. Of note, almost all these facets rely on some type of infrared light detection, which means they can study a part of the electromagnetic spectrum invisible to human eyes. \"Study of the intensity or brightness of light across the wavelengths can provide key diagnostic information about the nature of various objects across the universe,\" the JWST team said. \"From extrasolar planets around distant stars, to faint galaxies at the edge of the universe, and objects in our own solar system.\" You can read here about the science of infrared in more detail. But returning to JWST's technology army, here's the breakdown. Its alpha instrument is probably the Near-Infrared Camera, or NIRCam. NIRCam will essentially lead the charge in detecting and imaging the cosmos as it was when time began. \"If NIRCam doesn't work, the telescope doesn't work,\" said Alison Nordt, space science and instrumentation director at aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, who's been a part of the JWST since the beginning. Then, there's the Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, which has both a camera and a spectrograph aimed at dissecting items illuminated by light in the middle part of the infrared electromagnetic region, and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, or NIRISS, which is basically an exoplanet hunting machine. Also aboard JWST, you'll find a navigation system, aka the fine guidance sensor, which helps the scope, well, not get lost. And finally, the star of NASA's recent update is the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, or NIRSpec. What is NIRSpec? \"The Near-Infrared Spectrograph is the instrument on the Webb telescope that observes spectra of astrophysical and planetary objects at near infrared wavelengths,\" the JWST team said. In other words, it works to examine space-borne phenomena that emit light in the near infrared region, but rather than merely image those objects, it can study their chemical composition. That's the intrigue of spectrography. You get more than a picture of a planet, you get details of what it would be like to stand on it. And in terms of target acquisition, the JWST team says NIRSpec has a mirror that can place cosmic targets in their proper locations as the telescope explores. This is crucial because such information helps NIRSpec's spectrograph know where to look. There are two ways the mirror does this -- the Wide Aperture Target Acquisition and the Micro-Shutter Assembly-based Target Acquisition. During testing, the team said, WATA performed \"excellently\" and MSATA made solid progress, and lucky for us, both successes give us awesome cosmic pictures, like the one featured up top. Further, with regard to MSATA, the James Webb team says this method is quite difficult to nail down. It calls for a proper estimation of NIRSpec science spectral intensity within one-tenth of the device's shutter width. That's incredibly precise. For context, it's \"the approximate size of a bumblebee, 1.5 centimeters, viewed from 150 kilometers away,\" the team said. Now that NASA has these successes down, just two more modes to go before we hit July 12 -- the day we've all been waiting for. Good luck, NIRCam, and to the stars, JWST.

The small slice of the universe, called SMACS 0723, has been captured in sharp detail by the James Webb space telescope, showing that particular cluster as it was 4.6bn years ago, as well as the light from many different twinkling galaxies which are among the oldest in the universe. Joe Biden, who unveiled the image at a White House event, called the moment \"historic\" and said it provided \"a new window into the history of our universe\". \"It's hard to even fathom,\" said the US president. \"It's astounding. It's an historic moment for science and technology, for America and all of humanity.\" Bill Nelson, administrator of Nasa, said the image showed the light of galaxies bending around other galaxies, traveling for billions of years before reaching the telescope. \"We are looking back more than 13 billion years,\" he said, adding that more images to be released by the space agency would reach back further, to about 13.5 billion years, close to the estimated start point of the universe itself. \"We are going back almost to the beginning,\" he said. The release of the image is a preview of a series of high-resolution color pictures from JWST that will be shown off by Nasa on Tuesday. They will include \"the deepest image of our universe that has ever been taken\", according to Nelson. Experts have said the telescope, three decades in the making and launched last year, could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by providing detailed infrared images of the universe. The $10bn telescope is able to peek inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the oldest galaxies in the universe by using a system of lenses, filters and prisms to detect signals in the infrared spectrum, which is invisible to the human eye. The system has so far \"performed flawlessly\", according to Marcia Rieke, professor of astronomy at University of Arizona. \"Webb can see backwards in time just after the big bang by looking for galaxies that are so far away, the light has taken many billions of years to get from those galaxies to ourselves,\" said Jonathan Gardner, deputy senior project scientist at Nasa, during a recent news conference. \"Webb is bigger than Hubble so that it can see fainter galaxies that are further away.\" The telescope, which is a joint endeavor with the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency, has been in development since the mid-1990s and was finally propelled into space in December. It is described as the most powerful telescope ever to be sent into space and is currently about 1m miles from Earth, performing its task of scanning ancient galaxies. The initial goal of the project was to see the first stars and galaxies formed following the big bang, watching \"the universe turn the lights on for the first time\", as Eric Smith, Webb program scientist, put it. The telescope should be considered \"one of humanity's great engineering achievements\", said Kamala Harris, the US vice-president. \"The whole observatory is performing stunningly well,\" said Gillian Wright, director of the UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh, also principal investigator for the mid- infrared instrument on JWST. \"It's hard to take in how fantastic it has turned out to be. It is utterly amazing.\" Nasa said JWST has five initial cosmic targets for observation, including the Carina nebula, a sort of celestial nursery where stars form. The nebula is about 7,600 light years away and is home to many enormous stars, several times larger than the sun. Other areas of focus include WASP-96 b, a giant planet outside our solar system that is made mainly of gas; the southern ring nebula, an expanding cloud of gas surrounding a dying star that's 2,000 light years from Earth; and Stephan's quintet, notable for being the first compact galaxy group discovered in 1877. Images from these targets will be unveiled by Nasa on Tuesday. \"It's exhilarating to see the fantastic James Webb space telescope image released today,\" said Richard Ellis, professor of astrophysics at University College London who was part of the committee that first conceived the telescope. \"As we are ourselves made of the material synthesized in stars over the past 13 billion years, JWST has the unique ability to trace back to our own origins in this remarkable universe. Everyone can take part in this amazing adventure.\" This article was amended on 12 July 2022 to clarify that while the image shows galaxies from as long as 13bn years ago, the SMACS 0723 cluster is seen as it was 4.6bn years ago.

The telescope, an international collaboration with ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency), provides a unique perspective with its infrared sensitivity on our neighboring planet, complementing data being collected by orbiters, rovers, and other telescopes. Webb's unique observation post nearly a million miles away at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2 (L2) provides a view of Mars' observable disk (the portion of the sunlit side that is facing the telescope). As a result, Webb can capture images and spectra with the spectral resolution needed to study short-term phenomena like dust storms, weather patterns, seasonal changes, and, in a single observation, processes that occur at different times (daytime, sunset, and nighttime) of a Martian day. Because it is so close, the Red Planet is one of the brightest objects in the night sky in terms of both visible light (which human eyes can see) and the infrared light that Webb is designed to detect.

The Hellas Basin - which is the largest well-preserved impact structure on Mars, spanning more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) - appears darker than the surroundings because of this effect. \"This is actually not a thermal effect at Hellas,\" explained the principal investigator, Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who designed these Webb observations. \"The Hellas Basin is a lower altitude, and thus experiences higher air pressure. That higher pressure leads to a suppression of the thermal emission at this particular wavelength range [4.1-4.4 microns] due to an effect called pressure broadening. It will be very interesting to tease apart these competing effects in these data.\" Villanueva and his team also released Webb's first near-infrared spectrum of Mars, demonstrating Webb's power to study the Red Planet with spectroscopy. Whereas the images show differences in brightness integrated over a large number of wavelengths from place to place across the planet at a particular day and time, the spectrum shows the subtle variations in brightness between hundreds of different wavelengths representative of the planet as a whole. Astronomers will analyze the features of the spectrum to gather additional information about the surface and atmosphere of the planet. This infrared spectrum was obtained by combining measurements from all six of the high-resolution spectroscopy modes of Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). Preliminary analysis of the spectrum shows a rich set of spectral features that contain information about dust, icy clouds, what kind of rocks are on the planet's surface, and the composition of the atmosphere. The spectral signatures - including deep valleys known as absorption features - of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide are easily detected with Webb. The researchers have been analyzing the spectral data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to a scientific journal for peer review and publication. In the future, the Mars team will be using this imaging and spectroscopic data to explore regional differences across the planet, and to search for trace gases in the atmosphere, including methane and hydrogen chloride. These NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of Mars were conducted as part of Webb's Cycle 1 Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) solar system program led by Heidi Hammel of AURA.

NASA and the ESA have shared early images of Mars, taken on September 5th, that promise new insights into the planet's atmosphere. Data from the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) is already offering a few surprises. For starters, the giant Hellas Basin is oddly darker than nearby areas at the hottest time of the day, NASA's Giuliano Liuzzi and Space.com noted - higher air pressure at the basin's lower altitude has suppressed thermal emissions. The JWST imagery also gave space agencies an opportunity to share Mars' near-infrared atmospheric composition using the telescope's onboard spectrograph array. The spectroscopic 'map' (pictured at middle) shows the planet absorbing carbon dioxide at several different wavelengths, and also shows the presences of carbon monoxide and water. A future research paper will provide more detail about the Martian air's chemistry. It was particularly tricky to record the images. Mars is one of the brightest objects the James Webb telescope can see - a problem for an observatory designed to study the most distant objects in the universe. Researchers countered this by capturing very short exposures and using special techniques to analyze the findings. This is only the initial wave of pictures and data. It will take more observations to reveal more about Mars. However, the spectral info already hints at more information about the planet's materials. Liuzzi also thinks JWST studies could settle disputes over the presence of methane on Mars, potentially signalling that the Red Planet harbored life in its distant past.

The exoplanet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable. The image, as seen through four different light filters, shows how Webb's powerful infrared gaze can easily capture worlds beyond our solar system, pointing the way to future observations that will reveal more information than ever before about exoplanets. \"This is a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally,\" said Sasha Hinkley, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, who led these observations with a large international collaboration. Webb is an international mission led by NASA in collaboration with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The exoplanet in Webb's image, called HIP 65426 b, is about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter, and these observations could help narrow that down even further. It is young as planets go - about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth. Astronomers discovered the planet in 2017 using the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile and took images of it using short infrared wavelengths of light. Webb's view, at longer infrared wavelengths, reveals new details that ground-based telescopes would not be able to detect because of the intrinsic infrared glow of Earth's atmosphere. Researchers have been analyzing the data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to journals for peer review. But Webb's first capture of an exoplanet already hints at future possibilities for studying distant worlds. Since HIP 65426 b is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun, it is sufficiently distant from the star that Webb can easily separate the planet from the star in the image. Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are both equipped with coronagraphs, which are sets of tiny masks that block out starlight, enabling Webb to take direct images of certain exoplanets like this one. NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch later this decade, will demonstrate an even more advanced coronagraph. \"It was really impressive how well the Webb coronagraphs worked to suppress the light of the host star,\" Hinkley said. Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared. In each filter image, the planet appears as a slightly differently shaped blob of light. That is because of the particulars of Webb's optical system and how it translates light through the different optics. \"Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,\" said Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the analysis of the images. \"At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.\" While this is not the first direct image of an exoplanet taken from space - the Hubble Space Telescope has captured direct exoplanet images previously - HIP 65426 b points the way forward for Webb's exoplanet exploration. \"I think what's most exciting is that we've only just begun,\" Carter said. \"There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and formation. We may even discover previously unknown planets, too.\" ", "url": "https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/09/01/nasas-webb-takes-its-first-ever-direct-image-of-distant-world/"}]}]
