[{"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Selecting the Next Creative Idea for Exploring the Solar System", "date": "2014-12-01", "content": "With the release of the official Announcement of Opportunity (AO) early in November, NASA has officially begun the competition to select its next low cost ($450M) Discovery program planetary mission. Because planetary scientists are free to propose missions to any destination in the solar system other than the sun and Earth, these competitions bring out the creativity in the planetary science program. Will we get a Venus orbiter? A return to the Mars polar regions? A comet lander? An orbiter around the exposed core of a protoplanet? Flybys of Jupiter's moon Io? These are just the start of the list of missions likely to be proposed. The breadth of possibilities for these small missions is in contrast to that for NASA's larger planetary missions. For its mid-cost ($700M to $800M) New Frontiers missions, scientists only can propose missions from a list of around five high priority missions identified once every ten years in the Decadal Survey. Targets for NASA's largest missions (>$1.5B), the Flagships like Cassini at Saturn, also are chosen from an even shorter list approved in the Decadal Surveys. Practicalities will limit the ambitions of the Discovery proposals, though. Foremost among these is the tight cost cap, $450M. This is just a little more than half the funds available to New Frontiers missions such as the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission that is in development. The Discovery cost cap also is less than a fifth the cost of the Flagship Curiosity rover that is on Mars or a quarter the cost of the proposed Europa Clipper mission. Missions also will need to depend on solar power. In the future, NASA hopes to make radioisotope (plutonium-238) power systems available for Discovery missions, which would open up missions to the far outer solar system or the permanently shadowed lunar craters among other destinations. For the current selection, however, NASA cannot build a radioisotope system in time, with the result that the chosen mission will need to depend on solar cells. This limits the next mission to go no further from the sun than Jupiter. (For an article on the status of NASA's plutonium-238 program, check out this article from the journal Nature.) Based on the NASA's last competition, the planetary science community hasn't run out of ideas. An informal tally of proposals (NASA doesn't release information on proposals not selected as finalists) included seven Venus, three lunar, four Martian or Martian moon, eight asteroid, three comet, one Io, and two Titan proposals. (The previous competition had an option for a radioisotope power system that enabled several of the proposals.) Most teams don't discuss their proposal ideas (this is a highly competitive business), but so far for this latest competition I'm aware of proposals for Venus missions, a Martian polar lander (IceBreaker), a spacecraft to study Mars' two moons (PADME), and a mission to the asteroid Psyche that would explore the core of a protoplanet. Next June, NASA's managers will announce a list of finalists for the current competition, and we will see which proposals the agency's reviewers believe have the best combination of scientific merit and feasibility. These teams then will have approximately a year to prepare more detailed proposals (Phase A studies) followed by NASA's announcement of the final winner in September 2016. The selected mission must launch by the end of 2021. During its first decade of this program, NASA's Discovery program selected missions approximately every two years. The next decade saw just two missions selected as NASA's budgets tightened and it had to pay for the development of other missions. Based on the latest proposed NASA budget (for Fiscal Year 2015, which has yet to be approved by Congress), NASA would return to selecting Discovery missions more frequently, perhaps every two to three years. The higher flight rate for Discovery missions would come at a cost, however. The NASA budget does not include proposed funding for additional New Frontiers missions, ruling out more challenging missions such as landing on Venus or returning samples from the moon or from a comet. For the last two Discovery mission selections, a number of scientists have felt that NASA was overly conservative, selecting the safest rather than the scientifically most compelling mission from the finalists. (See, for example, this article from the journal Nature.) In the last selection, for example, NASA passed over its last chance to do an inexpensive landing on of the lakes of Saturn's moon Titan for decades in favor of a Mars lander than will reuse much of the technology proven by the previous Phoenix lander. (I will hasten to say, though, that the selected Mars InSight lander will conduct excellent science; no mission makes the finalist list that wouldn't do great science.) As the list of these selected low cost missions has grown, many of the easiest and lowest cost ideas have already been flown. As a result, the complexity of missions has risen over time (see this blog post), making them more difficult to develop and fly within the cost cap. Several of the selected Discovery missions also suffered significant budget overruns, delaying the start of further new missions and subjecting NASA to Congressional criticisms (see this blog post). Perhaps as a result of more conservatively judging missions during their selection, cost overruns have become less common.", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/20141201-selecting-the-next-creative-discovery-mission"}, {"title": "NASA receives proposals for new planetary science mission", "date": "2015-02-24", "content": "The proposals are in for a new NASA robotic mission for launch in 2021 to explore the solar system, and scientists have submitted concepts for probes to the moon, planets, asteroids and comets for a chance to win $450 million in federal funding. Scientists had to send in their proposals by Feb. 18 for consideration by NASA managers as the next mission in the space agency's Discovery program, a series of relatively low-cost, focused science probes aimed at exploring the solar system. Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division, said Feb. 19 that the agency plans to select at least two finalists from the proposals in May to receive $3 million federal grants for detailed concept studies. NASA should pick a single winner by September 2016, he told a meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group. \"We'll rapidly get down to making some announcements as soon as we can get through the evaluation,\" Green said. The mission must be ready for launch by the end of 2021, and must cost no more than $450 million, excluding the launcher, which NASA pays from a separate account. Up to one-third of the mission's cost can come from international partners without counting against the $450 million cost cap. The concept selected by NASA will become the 13th mission in the agency's Discovery program, which started in the early 1990s and had its first launch in 1996. Discovery missions launched to date include the Mars Pathfinder rover mission, the NEAR Shoemaker probe that first orbited an asteroid, and the Stardust project, which returned samples of comet and interstellar dust to Earth. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft currently orbiting Mercury, the planet-hunting Kepler telescope, and the Dawn mission now approaching the dwarf planet Ceres were also developed and launched under the auspices of the Discovery program. The 12th Discovery mission, the InSight Mars lander, is due for launch in March 2016 to touch down on the red planet and measure its seismic activity. The competition now underway will end with the selection of the 13th Discovery mission. NASA hopes to infuse the next mission with new technologies, offering up government-furnished equipment with incentives to sweeten the deal for principal investigators leading each proposal. The government has offered to supply a deep space optical communications system to test new high-speed data links with Earth, giving science teams an extra $30 million above their $450 million cost cap if they choose to use the laser telecom unit. NASA's LADEE mission demonstrated laser communications between the moon and Earth in 2013, but optical communications has not been tested from greater distances. If science teams wish to send entry probes into the atmospheres of Venus or Saturn, they will need a new type of heat shield. NASA's solicitation included a provision to furnish a newly-developed 3D-woven heat shield with a $10 million incentive. A deep space atomic clock is available with a $5 million bonus, and NASA has offered to provide xenon ion thrusters and radioisotope heater units without incentives. NASA stipulates the mission must use solar power, limiting mission possibilities beyond Jupiter and Saturn. The Discovery solicitation released in November came four years after the last opportunity for a low-cost planetary mission in 2010, which ended with the selection of the InSight Mars lander. Green said NASA has funding in the White House's proposed budget to speed up the pace of Discovery missions, with another call for proposals as soon as late 2017. \"Our plan is to bring Discovery calls in closer,\" Green said. \"Right now, the president's budget supports about every 36 months. It's not the 24 months that we'd like, but this is far healthier than it had been projected in the past.\" The New Frontiers program, which covers medium-cost interplanetary missions between low-cost Discovery projects and multibillion-dollar flagship missions, should begin the process for the selection of its next mission in 2016, Green said. The mission will have a cost cap around $1 billion, following up on the New Horizons probe approaching Pluto, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission set for launch in September 2016.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/02/24/nasa-receives-proposals-for-new-planetary-science-mission/"}, {"title": "Diverse destinations considered for new interplanetary probe", "date": "2015-04-12", "content": "Science teams from across the United States have submitted 28 proposals for missions to explore the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, touch the asteroid-like satellites orbiting Mars, visit unseen worlds and hunt for objects that could strike Earth one day. But only one of the concepts will win NASA funding and fly into space. NASA will select at least two of the proposals for federal grants in August, with final approval a year later for a single mission to proceed toward launch. The mission will join a family of space probes within NASA's Discovery program, a set of highly-focused, cost-capped projects that have been dispatched to destinations throughout the inner solar system - places inside the orbit of Jupiter. Many of the proposed concepts will double as science probes and technological trailblazers, demonstrating lightning-fast communications systems, more powerful ion drive engines, ultra-precise atomic clocks and a new 3D-woven heat shield design. Some scientists in charge of the would-be space missions are talking about their concepts, giving presentations to scientific advisory boards and presenting at conferences. Others are withholding details or keeping their proposals entirely under wraps. The proposals were due in February and could target any object in the solar system besides Earth and the sun. A glance at the missions disclosed so far reveals a diverse list of destinations and objectives - from remote-sensing telescopes to probes that will taste and sniff the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. NASA changed the rules of the competition for the next Discovery-class mission. For the first time, the project's $450 million cost cap will not include post-launch operations expenses. The cost limit also excludes expenditures for launch services and international contributions, which are paid from a separate NASA account. The space agency barred the use of a nuclear power source for the mission, limiting options for spacecraft needing to travel far from the sun. NASA is conserving its supply of plutonium for a future Mars rover mission until the U.S. government can restart production of the material. Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona, said the adjustment in NASA's cost allocations for the next Discovery mission could shift up to $100 million from under the cost cap to outside of it. The savings are especially notable for missions that will take several years to travel to the outer planets, cruise time that would usually eat up funding without producing meaningful science results. NASA will still have to spend the money, but it no longer counts against a mission proposal. The new costing guidelines change the decision calculus of researchers who want to propose. For the first time, probes targeting the outer solar system can fit into the $450 million cost cap, McEwen said in an interview at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. McEwen took advantage of the new rules, submitting a proposal for an ambitious mission to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. The Io Volcano Observer mission would launch in May 2021, swing into orbit around Jupiter in February 2026 and conduct at least nine flybys of Io, employing a high-speed optical communications antenna to beam data back to Earth. One of the flybys would zip just above the Pele vent, one of the most active volcanoes in the solar system. Fresh eruptions regularly reconstitute Io's scarred surface, and the hyperactive world may resemble how Earth appeared just after it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Io's volcanoes are driven by the tidal tug of Jupiter's immense gravity, which heats up churning molten rock to a boiling point. The tidal forces trigger widespread eruptions - NASA's Galileo mission saw more than 100 active volcanoes - and open a window into a planet's internal workings. McEwen said his mission's suite of cameras, heat detectors and spectrometers would collect 900 times more data on Io than the Galileo orbiter obtained during its eight-year tour around Jupiter, which ended in 2003. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which developed NASA's New Horizons and Messenger spacecraft to Pluto and Mercury, would lead construction and operations of the Io probe, McEwen said. If approved, the Io Volcano Observer could be joined by two other missions - flagship-class probes under development by NASA and the European Space Agency - flying around Jupiter at the same time. Another mission to the outer solar system was proposed by Jonathan Lunine, a scientist from Cornell University who specializes in the habitability of extraterrestrial worlds. Lunine's team came up with a spacecraft built in-house at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory called the Enceladus Life Finder. The mission, known as ELF, would fly 10 times through plumes of water launched above the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus The Cassini orbiter currently at Saturn discovered the plumes in 2005, tracing their source to fractures in Enceladus's icy crust dubbed \"tiger stripes\" by scientists. Equipped with instrumentation far more sensitive than available on the 1990s-era Cassini orbiter, the ELF mission would search for biosignatures in the geysers on Enceladus. The polar jets loft water, salts and organic molecules dozens of miles over the moon's surface from an underground regional ocean. \"The ocean is being delivered into space through the jets,\" Lunine said in a presentation in February to a NASA scientific advisory panel. \"These are essentially free samples, and this process has been going on for decades, if not for centuries, at least.\" Scientists announced in March that hot springs likely dot the bottom of the subsurface ocean, evidence supporting the theory that the water could be warmed by thermal vents similar to features found deep in Earth's oceans. Cassini's final swing through Enceladus's water plumes is planned later this year. While Cassini detected the plumes, scientists need a new mission to make more detailed measurements on the ocean's temperature, the water's acidity, and energy sources available on Enceladus. ELF's instruments would measure amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - analyze fatty acids, and determine whether methane found in the plumes could have been produced by organisms. \"For life, you need certain amino acids, types of carbon, an abundance of methane to other hydrocarbons, and if all these are within a certain range, it's pretty indicative of a biotic system,\" Lunine said. The proposed probes to Io and Enceladus would each rely on solar electricity generators - \"remote fusion power\" as McEwen calls it - pushing the frontiers of solar cell technology. NASA's Juno orbiter now en route to Jupiter will be the first spacecraft to use solar power in the outer planets, employing three huge solar panels to harness energy from sunlight, even as it grows dimmer with distance. Advancements in solar array design now make missions to Jupiter and Saturn feasible at lower cost. The probes just need large extendable solar panels to generate enough power, officials said. The leaps in technology and revamped accounting rules bring Jupiter, Saturn and their moons - once relegated to multibillion-dollar flagship missions - into the realm of a half-billion-dollar Discovery-class program. Humanity's robotic presence in the outer solar system is set to diminish by the end of the decade. By then, the Cassini mission will have completed a guided crash into Saturn, the New Horizons probe will finish its encounters with Pluto and potentially another distant icy world, and Juno's research into Jupiter's interior and magnetic field will be over. Spacecraft planned to visit the moons of Jupiter will not launch until the 2020s. The ability to launch less costly probes to faraway destinations could restore exploration at the outer planets. Asteroids and comets have been popular targets for past Discovery missions, and there is no shortage of small worlds still unvisited by human-built spacecraft. One proposal would send a probe to Psyche, a nearly 150-mile-wide (240-kilometer) asteroid scientists believe is the leftover metallic core of a protoplanet from the ancient solar system. Circling the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Psyche is a world unlike any ever studied up close. It is made almost entirely of nickel and iron, the same composition as Earth's inner core. Lindy Elkins-Tanton, director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, leads the science team behind the Psyche mission. She said in an interview that the spacecraft - built by Space Systems/Loral - would take five years to cruise from Earth to Psyche in the 2020s. If approved, the probe will carry ion engines to guide itself toward the asteroid belt and rendezvous with Psyche, where it will enter orbit for at least a year. The mission is tasked to find out if Psyche was once a larger body that had its crust and mantle stripped away, exposing the metallic core. \"This is one of the few missions (proposed) that's truly exploration,\" Elkins-Tanton said in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. \"Nobody has ever seen a metal world before. We have no idea what it's going to look like.\" The Dark Asteroid Rendezvous mission, or DARe, would launch in May 2021 and orbit at least two asteroids. The mission could be augmented with flybys of more objects, according to Keith Noll, DARe's principal investigator from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Noll said DARe will need an electrically-powered propulsion system to achieve its mission, arriving in orbit around its first target in 2024 and reaching a secondary destination by 2029. DARe would go to asteroids that are remnant building blocks of the planets, giving context to other bodies visited by robotic spacecraft. \"A lot of missions have gone to targets that are unique,\" Noll said in an interview. \"We want to go to targets we think are fairly typical objects.\" Citing competitive concerns, Noll declined to disclose the mission's destinations or who will provide DARe's instruments and spacecraft bus. Scientists at the University of Colorado and JPL said they responded to NASA's call for proposals with the Binary Asteroid in-situ Explorer, or BASiX. The mission would blast off in December 2020 and reach its destination in May 2024. Built by Ball Aerospace, BASiX aims for asteroid 1996 FG3, an object with its own mini-moon. The probe will drop explosive pods to detonate on the asteroid and gauge the surface's strength and cohesion. A report published in Nature magazine listed another asteroid mission under consideration in the Discovery competition. The Lucy mission would tour Trojan asteroids that circle the sun in clusters in the same orbital path as Jupiter, but Nature reported little is known about the concept. Comets may also prove to be high-priority research subjects for the next Discovery mission. Scientists have discussed at least one proposal, a mission designed to scan comet Tempel 2 with radar, probing the nucleus's internal structure and mapping the body with a color camera and thermal imager. The Comet Radar Explorer, or CORE, would launch in July 2021 and rendezvous with comet Tempel 1 in late 2026. Led by scientists at Arizona State University, the mission's spacecraft would be built by Orbital ATK and its sensor complement would include contributions from Germany and Italy. A trio of proposals would focus on the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, determined to answer basic questions about the origins of the red planet's enigmatic satellites. The Phobos and Deimos Origin Assessment, or PANDORA, mission would be ready for launch by June 2020. The Boeing-built spacecraft would use an all-electric propulsion system to spiral toward Mars on a two-year cruise, arriving in August 2022, according to Tom Prettyman, PANDORA's deputy principal investigator from the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. PANDORA would begin a four-year survey of the Martian moons, spending time in orbit around Phobos and Deimos, dipping close to each satellite's cratered surface to obtain high-resolution imagery and measure their composition. The Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance and Landed Investigation, or MERLIN, would land on Phobos in October 2024 for a 90-day mission to explore the moon's origins, testing a hypothesis that the body initially formed in the outer solar system and somehow made it to Mars. Managed, constructed and operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, MERLIN would launch in late 2021 and conduct several flybys of Deimos before homing in on Phobos, according to scientists. The lander could be commanded to take off again and hop to a different location on Phobos. A laser telecom system would allow the craft to send back real-time video of the moons, officials said at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. The proposed PADME probe would depart Earth in August 2020, reach Mars orbit in February 2021 and zip by Phobos 16 times and encounter Deimos nine times over a one-year primary mission. Based on a NASA-built bullet-shaped spacecraft bus flown to the moon in 2013, PADME stands for Photos and Deimos and Mars Environment. Like the other missions to the Martian moons, PADME would help scientists resolve the origins of Phobos and Deimos. After its work at Mars is complete, NASA could use PADME to experiment with deep space laser communications and repurpose the spacecraft to escape the red planet's gravitational grasp and head for an asteroid flyby. Scientists behind the PADME mission at NASA's Ames Research Center tout it as a cheaper, less risky option to the more ambitious concepts primed to visit the Martian moons. Scientists reportedly submitted a proposal for at least one Mars lander named Mars Icebreaker, which would descend to the Martian polar plains using a landing craft similar to the Phoenix mission that touched down there in 2008. Nature's report on the Discovery competition indicated scientists sent in proposals for several projects to visit Venus, which was last explored by a NASA spacecraft in 1994, when the Magellan radar mapping mission ended. Europe's Venus Express mission orbiter Earth's scorching sister planet for eight years until it ran out of fuel in late 2014. NASA bypassed several Venus mission proposals in the last round of Discovery selections, opting to fund the InSight lander to Mars for research on the red planet's seismic activity. The Venus missions proposed last round included probes with radars to map the planet in greater detail than Magellan. Radar waves can see through Venus's thick envelope of clouds and resolve the planet's terrain. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's VERITAS - Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR Topography and Spectroscopy - mission would survey the planet with X-band radar from an orbit 220 kilometres (136 miles) in altitude. Another concept called the RAVEN mission - short for Radar at Venus - is also being vetted by NASA after being refined through studies by scientists from academic institutions and engineers from Boeing. An exotic mission to dispatch a balloon and atmospheric entry probe to Venus is also up for NASA support. The Venus Atmosphere and Surface Explorer, or VASE, would take a four-month journey to Venus and deploy a large balloon in the planet's upper atmosphere. The VASE mission would be led by Larry Esposito, a scientist at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The balloon would circumnavigate the planet twice, collecting its own measurements 55 kilometres (34 miles) above the planet while relaying data from a deep entry probe designed to obtain a vertical profile of Venus's sweltering atmosphere. The entry probe's mission would last about 90 minutes on a suicide plunge into the atmosphere, and the balloon would function for up to two weeks after arrival. Closer to Earth, a team of scientists led by Ian Garrick-Bethell has pitched NASA on deploying a fleet of more than 30 small shoebox-sized CubeSats around the moon to observe its interaction with the solar wind, study strange localized magnetic swirls, and track the movement of water across the airless lunar surface. Named NanoSWARM, the mission would be ready for liftoff by February 2020, according to Garrick-Bethell, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The 10-month mission could be accomplished for $200 million, less than half of the Discovery-class cost cap, he said in an interview. A barebones mothership would shepherd the CubeSats from Earth to the moon, then release the tiny satellites on trajectories to impact the lunar surface to study the moon's uneven magnetism. Other CubeSats will deploy into low-altitude orbits to gather detailed data on hydrogen and water distributions at the lunar south pole. Some of the CubeSats will come from South Korean students and scientists through an international partnership agreement, Garrick-Bethell said. Another lunar mission likely proposed - but not confirmed - to NASA in February was the Moon Age and Regolith Explorer. The MARE lander would touch down on one of the moon's dark, young lava flows and gauge the age of the rock at the landing site. Researchers in charge of two telescope concepts have discussed their mission plans in detail. The Near-Earth Object Camera, or NEOCam, would be positioned at the gravitationally-stable L1 libration point a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. NEOCam's infrared detector will locate approximately two-thirds of the large asteroids that could eventually impact our planet, expanding the growing catalog of nearby objects deemed potentially hazardous to Earth. The NEOCam team at JPL won money from NASA in 2010 to further develop the telescope's infrared camera system made by Teledyne Imaging Sensors, setting the stage for a full-up mission proposal in 2015. Built by Ball Aerospace, NEOCam would be fitted with a sunshade to allow the telescope's sensitive detectors to track asteroids near the sun, revealing a population of objects invisible to existing observatories. The Kuiper telescope conceived by Jim Bell, an astronomer based at Arizona State University, would launch in 2021 to the L2 Lagrange point a million miles away - but in the opposite direction from Earth as NEOCam. Like NEOCam, Kuiper would be built by Ball Aerospace. Its three-year mission would observe the solar system's gas giants, moons like Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and distant smaller objects as far away as Pluto. Bell described the Kuiper proposal as \"three missions in one.\" The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune will get special focus, and Kuiper will survey the distribution of small bodies in the outer solar system to help determine how the huge planets changed their orbits since they formed. Kuiper's telescope is half the size of Hubble, but it would begin operations just as NASA expects the legendary Earth-orbiting observatory to end its mission.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/04/12/diverse-destinations-considered-for-new-interplanetary-probe/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA receives proposals for new planetary science mission", "date": "2015-02-24", "content": "The proposals are in for a new NASA robotic mission for launch in 2021 to explore the solar system, and scientists have submitted concepts for probes to the moon, planets, asteroids and comets for a chance to win $450 million in federal funding.

One of the flybys would zip just above the Pele vent, one of the most active volcanoes in the solar system. Fresh eruptions regularly reconstitute Io's scarred surface, and the hyperactive world may resemble how Earth appeared just after it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Io's volcanoes are driven by the tidal tug of Jupiter's immense gravity, which heats up churning molten rock to a boiling point. The tidal forces trigger widespread eruptions - NASA's Galileo mission saw more than 100 active volcanoes - and open a window into a planet's internal workings. McEwen said his mission's suite of cameras, heat detectors and spectrometers would collect 900 times more data on Io than the Galileo orbiter obtained during its eight-year tour around Jupiter, which ended in 2003. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which developed NASA's New Horizons and Messenger spacecraft to Pluto and Mercury, would lead construction and operations of the Io probe, McEwen said. If approved, the Io Volcano Observer could be joined by two other missions - flagship-class probes under development by NASA and the European Space Agency - flying around Jupiter at the same time. Another mission to the outer solar system was proposed by Jonathan Lunine, a scientist from Cornell University who specializes in the habitability of extraterrestrial worlds. Lunine's team came up with a spacecraft built in-house at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory called the Enceladus Life Finder. The mission, known as ELF, would fly 10 times through plumes of water launched above the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus The Cassini orbiter currently at Saturn discovered the plumes in 2005, tracing their source to fractures in Enceladus's icy crust dubbed \"tiger stripes\" by scientists. Equipped with instrumentation far more sensitive than available on the 1990s-era Cassini orbiter, the ELF mission would search for biosignatures in the geysers on Enceladus. The polar jets loft water, salts and organic molecules dozens of miles over the moon's surface from an underground regional ocean. \"The ocean is being delivered into space through the jets,\" Lunine said in a presentation in February to a NASA scientific advisory panel. \"These are essentially free samples, and this process has been going on for decades, if not for centuries, at least.\" Scientists announced in March that hot springs likely dot the bottom of the subsurface ocean, evidence supporting the theory that the water could be warmed by thermal vents similar to features found deep in Earth's oceans. Cassini's final swing through Enceladus's water plumes is planned later this year. While Cassini detected the plumes, scientists need a new mission to make more detailed measurements on the ocean's temperature, the water's acidity, and energy sources available on Enceladus. ELF's instruments would measure amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - analyze fatty acids, and determine whether methane found in the plumes could have been produced by organisms. \"For life, you need certain amino acids, types of carbon, an abundance of methane to other hydrocarbons, and if all these are within a certain range, it's pretty indicative of a biotic system,\" Lunine said. The proposed probes to Io and Enceladus would each rely on solar electricity generators - \"remote fusion power\" as McEwen calls it - pushing the frontiers of solar cell technology. NASA's Juno orbiter now en route to Jupiter will be the first spacecraft to use solar power in the outer planets, employing three huge solar panels to harness energy from sunlight, even as it grows dimmer with distance. Advancements in solar array design now make missions to Jupiter and Saturn feasible at lower cost. The probes just need large extendable solar panels to generate enough power, officials said. The leaps in technology and revamped accounting rules bring Jupiter, Saturn and their moons - once relegated to multibillion-dollar flagship missions - into the realm of a half-billion-dollar Discovery-class program. Humanity's robotic presence in the outer solar system is set to diminish by the end of the decade. By then, the Cassini mission will have completed a guided crash into Saturn, the New Horizons probe will finish its encounters with Pluto and potentially another distant icy world, and Juno's research into Jupiter's interior and magnetic field will be over. Spacecraft planned to visit the moons of Jupiter will not launch until the 2020s. The ability to launch less costly probes to faraway destinations could restore exploration at the outer planets. Asteroids and comets have been popular targets for past Discovery missions, and there is no shortage of small worlds still unvisited by human-built spacecraft. One proposal would send a probe to Psyche, a nearly 150-mile-wide (240-kilometer) asteroid scientists believe is the leftover metallic core of a protoplanet from the ancient solar system. Circling the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Psyche is a world unlike any ever studied up close. It is made almost entirely of nickel and iron, the same composition as Earth's inner core. Lindy Elkins-Tanton, director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, leads the science team behind the Psyche mission. She said in an interview that the spacecraft - built by Space Systems/Loral - would take five years to cruise from Earth to Psyche in the 2020s. If approved, the probe will carry ion engines to guide itself toward the asteroid belt and rendezvous with Psyche, where it will enter orbit for at least a year. The mission is tasked to find out if Psyche was once a larger body that had its crust and mantle stripped away, exposing the metallic core. \"This is one of the few missions (proposed) that's truly exploration,\" Elkins-Tanton said in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. \"Nobody has ever seen a metal world before. We have no idea what it's going to look like.\" The Dark Asteroid Rendezvous mission, or DARe, would launch in May 2021 and orbit at least two asteroids. The mission could be augmented with flybys of more objects, according to Keith Noll, DARe's principal investigator from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Noll said DARe will need an electrically-powered propulsion system to achieve its mission, arriving in orbit around its first target in 2024 and reaching a secondary destination by 2029. DARe would go to asteroids that are remnant building blocks of the planets, giving context to other bodies visited by robotic spacecraft. \"A lot of missions have gone to targets that are unique,\" Noll said in an interview. \"We want to go to targets we think are fairly typical objects.\" Citing competitive concerns, Noll declined to disclose the mission's destinations or who will provide DARe's instruments and spacecraft bus. Scientists at the University of Colorado and JPL said they responded to NASA's call for proposals with the Binary Asteroid in-situ Explorer, or BASiX. The mission would blast off in December 2020 and reach its destination in May 2024. Built by Ball Aerospace, BASiX aims for asteroid 1996 FG3, an object with its own mini-moon. The probe will drop explosive pods to detonate on the asteroid and gauge the surface's strength and cohesion. A report published in Nature magazine listed another asteroid mission under consideration in the Discovery competition. The Lucy mission would tour Trojan asteroids that circle the sun in clusters in the same orbital path as Jupiter, but Nature reported little is known about the concept. Comets may also prove to be high-priority research subjects for the next Discovery mission. Scientists have discussed at least one proposal, a mission designed to scan comet Tempel 2 with radar, probing the nucleus's internal structure and mapping the body with a color camera and thermal imager. The Comet Radar Explorer, or CORE, would launch in July 2021 and rendezvous with comet Tempel 1 in late 2026. Led by scientists at Arizona State University, the mission's spacecraft would be built by Orbital ATK and its sensor complement would include contributions from Germany and Italy. A trio of proposals would focus on the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, determined to answer basic questions about the origins of the red planet's enigmatic satellites. The Phobos and Deimos Origin Assessment, or PANDORA, mission would be ready for launch by June 2020. The Boeing-built spacecraft would use an all-electric propulsion system to spiral toward Mars on a two-year cruise, arriving in August 2022, according to Tom Prettyman, PANDORA's deputy principal investigator from the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. PANDORA would begin a four-year survey of the Martian moons, spending time in orbit around Phobos and Deimos, dipping close to each satellite's cratered surface to obtain high-resolution imagery and measure their composition. The Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance and Landed Investigation, or MERLIN, would land on Phobos in October 2024 for a 90-day mission to explore the moon's origins, testing a hypothesis that the body initially formed in the outer solar system and somehow made it to Mars. Managed, constructed and operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, MERLIN would launch in late 2021 and conduct several flybys of Deimos before homing in on Phobos, according to scientists. The lander could be commanded to take off again and hop to a different location on Phobos. A laser telecom system would allow the craft to send back real-time video of the moons, officials said at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. The proposed PADME probe would depart Earth in August 2020, reach Mars orbit in February 2021 and zip by Phobos 16 times and encounter Deimos nine times over a one-year primary mission. Based on a NASA-built bullet-shaped spacecraft bus flown to the moon in 2013, PADME stands for Photos and Deimos and Mars Environment. Like the other missions to the Martian moons, PADME would help scientists resolve the origins of Phobos and Deimos. After its work at Mars is complete, NASA could use PADME to experiment with deep space laser communications and repurpose the spacecraft to escape the red planet's gravitational grasp and head for an asteroid flyby. Scientists behind the PADME mission at NASA's Ames Research Center tout it as a cheaper, less risky option to the more ambitious concepts primed to visit the Martian moons. Scientists reportedly submitted a proposal for at least one Mars lander named Mars Icebreaker, which would descend to the Martian polar plains using a landing craft similar to the Phoenix mission that touched down there in 2008. Nature's report on the Discovery competition indicated scientists sent in proposals for several projects to visit Venus, which was last explored by a NASA spacecraft in 1994, when the Magellan radar mapping mission ended. Europe's Venus Express mission orbiter Earth's scorching sister planet for eight years until it ran out of fuel in late 2014. NASA bypassed several Venus mission proposals in the last round of Discovery selections, opting to fund the InSight lander to Mars for research on the red planet's seismic activity. The Venus missions proposed last round included probes with radars to map the planet in greater detail than Magellan. Radar waves can see through Venus's thick envelope of clouds and resolve the planet's terrain. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's VERITAS - Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR Topography and Spectroscopy - mission would survey the planet with X-band radar from an orbit 220 kilometres (136 miles) in altitude. Another concept called the RAVEN mission - short for Radar at Venus - is also being vetted by NASA after being refined through studies by scientists from academic institutions and engineers from Boeing. An exotic mission to dispatch a balloon and atmospheric entry probe to Venus is also up for NASA support. The Venus Atmosphere and Surface Explorer, or VASE, would take a four-month journey to Venus and deploy a large balloon in the planet's upper atmosphere. The VASE mission would be led by Larry Esposito, a scientist at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The balloon would circumnavigate the planet twice, collecting its own measurements 55 kilometres (34 miles) above the planet while relaying data from a deep entry probe designed to obtain a vertical profile of Venus's sweltering atmosphere. The entry probe's mission would last about 90 minutes on a suicide plunge into the atmosphere, and the balloon would function for up to two weeks after arrival. Closer to Earth, a team of scientists led by Ian Garrick-Bethell has pitched NASA on deploying a fleet of more than 30 small shoebox-sized CubeSats around the moon to observe its interaction with the solar wind, study strange localized magnetic swirls, and track the movement of water across the airless lunar surface. Named NanoSWARM, the mission would be ready for liftoff by February 2020, according to Garrick-Bethell, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The 10-month mission could be accomplished for $200 million, less than half of the Discovery-class cost cap, he said in an interview. A barebones mothership would shepherd the CubeSats from Earth to the moon, then release the tiny satellites on trajectories to impact the lunar surface to study the moon's uneven magnetism. Other CubeSats will deploy into low-altitude orbits to gather detailed data on hydrogen and water distributions at the lunar south pole. Some of the CubeSats will come from South Korean students and scientists through an international partnership agreement, Garrick-Bethell said. Another lunar mission likely proposed - but not confirmed - to NASA in February was the Moon Age and Regolith Explorer. The MARE lander would touch down on one of the moon's dark, young lava flows and gauge the age of the rock at the landing site. Researchers in charge of two telescope concepts have discussed their mission plans in detail. The Near-Earth Object Camera, or NEOCam, would be positioned at the gravitationally-stable L1 libration point a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. NEOCam's infrared detector will locate approximately two-thirds of the large asteroids that could eventually impact our planet, expanding the growing catalog of nearby objects deemed potentially hazardous to Earth. The NEOCam team at JPL won money from NASA in 2010 to further develop the telescope's infrared camera system made by Teledyne Imaging Sensors, setting the stage for a full-up mission proposal in 2015. Built by Ball Aerospace, NEOCam would be fitted with a sunshade to allow the telescope's sensitive detectors to track asteroids near the sun, revealing a population of objects invisible to existing observatories. The Kuiper telescope conceived by Jim Bell, an astronomer based at Arizona State University, would launch in 2021 to the L2 Lagrange point a million miles away - but in the opposite direction from Earth as NEOCam. Like NEOCam, Kuiper would be built by Ball Aerospace. Its three-year mission would observe the solar system's gas giants, moons like Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and distant smaller objects as far away as Pluto. Bell described the Kuiper proposal as \"three missions in one.\" The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune will get special focus, and Kuiper will survey the distribution of small bodies in the outer solar system to help determine how the huge planets changed their orbits since they formed. Kuiper's telescope is half the size of Hubble, but it would begin operations just as NASA expects the legendary Earth-orbiting observatory to end its mission.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/04/12/diverse-destinations-considered-for-new-interplanetary-probe/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA receives proposals for new planetary science mission", "date": "2015-02-24", "content": "The proposals are in for a new NASA robotic mission for launch in 2021 to explore the solar system, and scientists have submitted concepts for probes to the moon, planets, asteroids and comets for a chance to win $450 million in federal funding. Scientists had to send in their proposals by Feb. 18 for consideration by NASA managers as the next mission in the space agency's Discovery program, a series of relatively low-cost, focused science probes aimed at exploring the solar system. Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division, said Feb. 19 that the agency plans to select at least two finalists from the proposals in May to receive $3 million federal grants for detailed concept studies. NASA should pick a single winner by September 2016, he told a meeting of the Outer Planets Assessment Group. \"We'll rapidly get down to making some announcements as soon as we can get through the evaluation,\" Green said. The mission must be ready for launch by the end of 2021, and must cost no more than $450 million, excluding the launcher, which NASA pays from a separate account. Up to one-third of the mission's cost can come from international partners without counting against the $450 million cost cap. The concept selected by NASA will become the 13th mission in the agency's Discovery program, which started in the early 1990s and had its first launch in 1996. Discovery missions launched to date include the Mars Pathfinder rover mission, the NEAR Shoemaker probe that first orbited an asteroid, and the Stardust project, which returned samples of comet and interstellar dust to Earth. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft currently orbiting Mercury, the planet-hunting Kepler telescope, and the Dawn mission now approaching the dwarf planet Ceres were also developed and launched under the auspices of the Discovery program. The 12th Discovery mission, the InSight Mars lander, is due for launch in March 2016 to touch down on the red planet and measure its seismic activity. The competition now underway will end with the selection of the 13th Discovery mission. NASA hopes to infuse the next mission with new technologies, offering up government-furnished equipment with incentives to sweeten the deal for principal investigators leading each proposal. The government has offered to supply a deep space optical communications system to test new high-speed data links with Earth, giving science teams an extra $30 million above their $450 million cost cap if they choose to use the laser telecom unit. NASA's LADEE mission demonstrated laser communications between the moon and Earth in 2013, but optical communications has not been tested from greater distances. If science teams wish to send entry probes into the atmospheres of Venus or Saturn, they will need a new type of heat shield. NASA's solicitation included a provision to furnish a newly-developed 3D-woven heat shield with a $10 million incentive. A deep space atomic clock is available with a $5 million bonus, and NASA has offered to provide xenon ion thrusters and radioisotope heater units without incentives. NASA stipulates the mission must use solar power, limiting mission possibilities beyond Jupiter and Saturn. The Discovery solicitation released in November came four years after the last opportunity for a low-cost planetary mission in 2010, which ended with the selection of the InSight Mars lander. Green said NASA has funding in the White House's proposed budget to speed up the pace of Discovery missions, with another call for proposals as soon as late 2017. \"Our plan is to bring Discovery calls in closer,\" Green said. \"Right now, the president's budget supports about every 36 months. It's not the 24 months that we'd like, but this is far healthier than it had been projected in the past.\" The New Frontiers program, which covers medium-cost interplanetary missions between low-cost Discovery projects and multibillion-dollar flagship missions, should begin the process for the selection of its next mission in 2016, Green said. The mission will have a cost cap around $1 billion, following up on the New Horizons probe approaching Pluto, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission set for launch in September 2016.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/02/24/nasa-receives-proposals-for-new-planetary-science-mission/"}, {"title": "Diverse destinations considered for new interplanetary probe", "date": "2015-04-12", "content": "Science teams from across the United States have submitted 28 proposals for missions to explore the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, touch the asteroid-like satellites orbiting Mars, visit unseen worlds and hunt for objects that could strike Earth one day. But only one of the concepts will win NASA funding and fly into space. NASA will select at least two of the proposals for federal grants in August, with final approval a year later for a single mission to proceed toward launch. The mission will join a family of space probes within NASA's Discovery program, a set of highly-focused, cost-capped projects that have been dispatched to destinations throughout the inner solar system - places inside the orbit of Jupiter. Many of the proposed concepts will double as science probes and technological trailblazers, demonstrating lightning-fast communications systems, more powerful ion drive engines, ultra-precise atomic clocks and a new 3D-woven heat shield design. Some scientists in charge of the would-be space missions are talking about their concepts, giving presentations to scientific advisory boards and presenting at conferences. Others are withholding details or keeping their proposals entirely under wraps. The proposals were due in February and could target any object in the solar system besides Earth and the sun. A glance at the missions disclosed so far reveals a diverse list of destinations and objectives - from remote-sensing telescopes to probes that will taste and sniff the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. NASA changed the rules of the competition for the next Discovery-class mission. For the first time, the project's $450 million cost cap will not include post-launch operations expenses. The cost limit also excludes expenditures for launch services and international contributions, which are paid from a separate NASA account. The space agency barred the use of a nuclear power source for the mission, limiting options for spacecraft needing to travel far from the sun. NASA is conserving its supply of plutonium for a future Mars rover mission until the U.S. government can restart production of the material. Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona, said the adjustment in NASA's cost allocations for the next Discovery mission could shift up to $100 million from under the cost cap to outside of it. The savings are especially notable for missions that will take several years to travel to the outer planets, cruise time that would usually eat up funding without producing meaningful science results. NASA will still have to spend the money, but it no longer counts against a mission proposal. The new costing guidelines change the decision calculus of researchers who want to propose. For the first time, probes targeting the outer solar system can fit into the $450 million cost cap, McEwen said in an interview at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. McEwen took advantage of the new rules, submitting a proposal for an ambitious mission to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io.

Named NanoSWARM, the mission would be ready for liftoff by February 2020, according to Garrick-Bethell, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The 10-month mission could be accomplished for $200 million, less than half of the Discovery-class cost cap, he said in an interview. A barebones mothership would shepherd the CubeSats from Earth to the moon, then release the tiny satellites on trajectories to impact the lunar surface to study the moon's uneven magnetism. Other CubeSats will deploy into low-altitude orbits to gather detailed data on hydrogen and water distributions at the lunar south pole. Some of the CubeSats will come from South Korean students and scientists through an international partnership agreement, Garrick-Bethell said. Another lunar mission likely proposed - but not confirmed - to NASA in February was the Moon Age and Regolith Explorer. The MARE lander would touch down on one of the moon's dark, young lava flows and gauge the age of the rock at the landing site. Researchers in charge of two telescope concepts have discussed their mission plans in detail. The Near-Earth Object Camera, or NEOCam, would be positioned at the gravitationally-stable L1 libration point a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. NEOCam's infrared detector will locate approximately two-thirds of the large asteroids that could eventually impact our planet, expanding the growing catalog of nearby objects deemed potentially hazardous to Earth. The NEOCam team at JPL won money from NASA in 2010 to further develop the telescope's infrared camera system made by Teledyne Imaging Sensors, setting the stage for a full-up mission proposal in 2015. Built by Ball Aerospace, NEOCam would be fitted with a sunshade to allow the telescope's sensitive detectors to track asteroids near the sun, revealing a population of objects invisible to existing observatories. The Kuiper telescope conceived by Jim Bell, an astronomer based at Arizona State University, would launch in 2021 to the L2 Lagrange point a million miles away - but in the opposite direction from Earth as NEOCam. Like NEOCam, Kuiper would be built by Ball Aerospace. Its three-year mission would observe the solar system's gas giants, moons like Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and distant smaller objects as far away as Pluto. Bell described the Kuiper proposal as \"three missions in one.\" The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune will get special focus, and Kuiper will survey the distribution of small bodies in the outer solar system to help determine how the huge planets changed their orbits since they formed. Kuiper's telescope is half the size of Hubble, but it would begin operations just as NASA expects the legendary Earth-orbiting observatory to end its mission.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/04/12/diverse-destinations-considered-for-new-interplanetary-probe/"}, {"title": "Small Bodies Dominate NASA's Latest Discovery Competition", "date": "2015-07-07", "content": "Over half of the 28 proposals NASA received for a $450 million robotic solar-system mission launching in 2021 seek to explore small bodies such as comets, asteroids or tiny moons. The reveal came after a marathon session of presentations here June 30 at the latest NASA-chartered Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) meeting, where representatives of 16 proposed missions for NASA's 13th Discovery competition briefed attendees for nearly three hours. Discovery missions are proposed and led by a single principal investigator. Mission costs excluding launch are capped at $450 million, with NASA bearing all expenses. The agency will pick at least two finalists around September to square off in a second round of competition that will last about a year, Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science, said July 14. Finalists will receive up to $3 million of study-money to further their case. NASA will pick winner around September 2016, Green said. While not all of the presenters at the June SBAG meeting disclosed industry sponsors, several did. Among the big-name companies who have thrown their hats into the ring as potential spacecraft primes in the ongoing Discovery competition are: Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colorado, picked as prime by five presenters. Boeing Defense, Space and Security, St. Louis, selected by one presenter. Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver, identified as a prime on three of the proposals briefed at SBAG. Orbital ATK, Dulles, Virginia, named as a prime by two presenters. Here are all 16 proposed Discovery missions presented to the SBAG June 30, including name, principal investigator, proposed operations, and, when divulged, the would-be prime contractor. Proposals are sorted alphabetically by destination type. Asteroids: Lucy. Principal investigator: Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The mission is a flyby tour of five so-called Trojan asteroids close to Jupiter's orbit. Prime contractor: Lockheed Martin. NEOCam. Principal investigator: Amy Mainzer. Mainzer, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is also principal investigator of the NEOWISE mission, which repurposed the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to observe near-Earth asteroids and comets. NEOCam would essentially do the same thing with a new spacecraft carrying instruments that do not need cryogenic cooling (the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer's primary astrophysics mission was cut short when its cooling system failed). Prime Contractor: Ball. Advanced Jovian Asteroid Explorer. Principal investigator: John Mustard, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The ambitious proposal would cram flybys, orbits and landings into a single mission, taking a 12-year cruise out to a Trojan asteroid close to Jupiter's orbit and, after a year of observations, dropping a small instrument package on the asteroid. Dark Asteroid Rendezvous. Principal investigator: Keith Noll, a planetary astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The mission would orbit and map two asteroids in the inner solar system expected by scientists to carry volatile materials that originated in the outer solar system. Prime Contractor: Orbital ATK. Binary Asteroid In-Situ Explorer. Principal investigator: Dan Scheeres, University of Colorado, Boulder. The mission would orbit a near-Earth asteroid and drop explosive pods onto its surface to create new craters. Ejecta from these craters would help the probe better understand the body's surface composition than remote observation alone. Prime Contractor: Ball. Psyche. Principal investigator: Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Arizona State University. The mission would orbit a metallic asteroid that, in its origin, may have been a planetary core dislodged by a violent impact with some other solar-system body. Comets: Comet Radar Explorer. Principal investigator: Erik Asphaug, Arizona State University. The mission would attempt to map the nucleus of comet Temple 2. Prime Contractor: Orbital ATK. Comet Hartley Analysis to Gather Ancient Links to Life. Principal investigator: Jessica Sunshine, University of Maryland. The mission, a reboot of the Comet Hopper lander that made the finals in the prevous Discovery competition, would visit and observe comet Hartley 2. Unlike Comet Hopper, the new mission will visit only a single comet. Prime Contractor: Lockheed Martin. Primitive Material Explorer. Principal investigator: Hunter Waite, the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. This mission would also visit and observe comet Hartley 2. Prime Contractor: Ball. Kuiper belt and beyond: Kuiper. Principal investigator: Jim Bell, Arizona State University. The space telescope would fly to the gravitationally stable Earth-moon Lagrange Point 2 and observe the faraway Kuiper belt beyond Pluto's orbit. Prime Contractor: Ball. Whipple. Principal investigator: Charles Alcock, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Another space telescope to observe both the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, which lies beyond. The cloud is home to many comets that occasionally make million-year journeys to the inner solar system only to melt as they get too close to the sun. Prime Contractor: Ball. Mars Moons: Mars Moon Exploration, Reconnaissance, and Landed Investigation. Principal investigator: Scott Murchie, principal professional staffer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The combination probe-lander would remotely observe and touch down on both martian moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos and Deimos Origin Assessment. Principal investigator: Carol Raymond, manager of the Small Bodies Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and deputy principal investigator of the onoging Dawn mission, which is now exploring the planetoid Ceres. Raymond's proposal involves exploring Mars' two moons with an orbiter built on one of Boeing's all-electric 702SP satellites. Once the primary mission is finished, Raymond would turn the spacecraft over to NASA's Mars program for use as a communications relay. Prime Contractor: Boeing Defense, Space and Security. Phobos and Deimos and Mars Environment. Principal investigator: Anthony Colaprete, NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California, and principal investigator of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite that launched in 2009. Colaprete's mission would feature an upgraded version the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft, launched to Earth's moon in 2013. Prime: NASA Ames. Multiple types of small bodies: Proteus. Principal investigator: Karen Meech,the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. The probe would visit both a comet and an asteroid to investigate whether Earth's water might have been planted here by extraterrestrial bodies. Prime Contractor: Lockheed Martin. Main Belt Asteroid and NEO Tour With Imaging and Spectroscopy. Principal investigator: Andy Rivkin, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The probe would visit nine asteroids, including near-Earth asteroids and some in the so-called main asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Openness among competitors has become a hallmark of the latest NASA Discovery competition. Until a downselect, NASA is not required to identify any of the proposals it received, or say who submitted them. Even then, the agency typically divulges only the names of the proposals it selects for further study. However, principal investigators may share details of their missions, if they wish. This time around, they have done so, early and often. The most recent SBAG meeting is not the only time this year aspiring Discovery principal investigators have shared their plans. Some Discovery candidates, including missions to Mars and Venus, went public in Berlin during the German Aerospace Center's Low Cost Planetary Mission Conference in June. Other hopefuls came out even earlier, during the Universities Space Research Association's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March at The Woodlands, Texas.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/small-bodies-dominate-nasas-latest-discovery-competition/"}, {"title": "Proposals to Explore the Solar System's Smallest Worlds", "date": "2015-07-27", "content": "This summer, NASA's managers are in the delightful position of having a tough choice to make. For the space agency's lowest cost planetary missions, known as Discovery missions, NASA's managers ask the planetary science community to propose the missions they'd like to see fly. Any solar system body except the Sun and Earth (both covered under other programs) can be targeted. There's a strict cost cap of $450M for the spacecraft and instruments, with the agency separately picking up other costs such as the launch and mission operations. The competitions are extremely competitive, with a single mission selected every few years from what's typically a field of 25 to 30 proposals. Because it's common to resubmit proposals in the next competition, in the past, proposers often have been reluctant to even give the names of their missions and only a few released any details of the concepts. Why give your competitors ideas for their next proposal? For the Discovery competition in progress (the thirteenth), that near silence has been broken and most teams have published or presented summaries (and in at least one case, nearly a full description) of their proposed missions. We now know at least the names and destinations of 24 of the 28 proposals. I am delighted with the creativity and quality of the ideas. I suspect that NASA's managers are equally impressed and find themselves having to make a tough choice this summer among a number of top-notch proposals. My understanding of the selection process is that each proposal is evaluated twice for the initial round of selection. First, teams of scientists review the scientific merits of the proposals and rank them. Second, teams of engineers review the proposals for technical feasibility and the likelihood of being built within the cost cap. The very few proposals that receive top scores in both evaluations become eligible to be selected as finalists that receive funding for a year to more fully develop their concepts (typically three proposals in recent competitions). Approximately a year later, NASA's associate administrator for science makes the ultimate selection from among the finalists. Launch of the selected mission is expected by 2021. The openness of the proposing teams for the current competition allowed James Callahan to publish brief summaries of most of the proposals. I've published fuller descriptions for the four proposals for missions to study the outer planets, as well as more detailed descriptions of a proposed mission to a metallic asteroid and a mission to remap Venus with modern instruments. (While the latter focused on a European proposal for their own mission competition, at least two teams reportedly have submitted similar proposals for the current Discovery competition.) At a meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group at the end of June, scientists proposing missions to the solar system's comets and asteroids gave 10 minute summaries of their proposals. In this post, I'll report on the concepts presented. The key to thinking about the small body Discovery proposals is to understand how diverse these worlds are. They lay scattered from the inner solar system to the edge of interstellar space. Some are rich in volatiles and are commonly called comets. Some are almost all rock and are called asteroids. Some (like Ceres where the Dawn spacecraft now orbits) are mixtures of both and we don't yet have a good name for them. Within these broad classes of objects, they show tremendous diversity in size, shape, and composition. To understand the clues these bodies provide on the solar system and its formation, we need to explore a few of them in depth to tease out their subtle details. We also need to observe many more with less detail to build up a statistical understanding of their diversity. Each of the small body Discovery mission proposals plays to one or the other of these strategies.", "url": "https://www.planetary.org/articles/20150727-proposals-to-explore-the-solar-systems-smallest-worlds"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Diverse destinations considered for new interplanetary probe", "date": "2015-04-12", "content": "Science teams from across the United States have submitted 28 proposals for missions to explore the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, touch the asteroid-like satellites orbiting Mars, visit unseen worlds and hunt for objects that could strike Earth one day. But only one of the concepts will win NASA funding and fly into space. NASA will select at least two of the proposals for federal grants in August, with final approval a year later for a single mission to proceed toward launch. The mission will join a family of space probes within NASA's Discovery program, a set of highly-focused, cost-capped projects that have been dispatched to destinations throughout the inner solar system - places inside the orbit of Jupiter. Many of the proposed concepts will double as science probes and technological trailblazers, demonstrating lightning-fast communications systems, more powerful ion drive engines, ultra-precise atomic clocks and a new 3D-woven heat shield design. Some scientists in charge of the would-be space missions are talking about their concepts, giving presentations to scientific advisory boards and presenting at conferences. Others are withholding details or keeping their proposals entirely under wraps. The proposals were due in February and could target any object in the solar system besides Earth and the sun. A glance at the missions disclosed so far reveals a diverse list of destinations and objectives - from remote-sensing telescopes to probes that will taste and sniff the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. NASA changed the rules of the competition for the next Discovery-class mission. For the first time, the project's $450 million cost cap will not include post-launch operations expenses. The cost limit also excludes expenditures for launch services and international contributions, which are paid from a separate NASA account. The space agency barred the use of a nuclear power source for the mission, limiting options for spacecraft needing to travel far from the sun. NASA is conserving its supply of plutonium for a future Mars rover mission until the U.S. government can restart production of the material. Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona, said the adjustment in NASA's cost allocations for the next Discovery mission could shift up to $100 million from under the cost cap to outside of it. The savings are especially notable for missions that will take several years to travel to the outer planets, cruise time that would usually eat up funding without producing meaningful science results. NASA will still have to spend the money, but it no longer counts against a mission proposal. The new costing guidelines change the decision calculus of researchers who want to propose. For the first time, probes targeting the outer solar system can fit into the $450 million cost cap, McEwen said in an interview at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. McEwen took advantage of the new rules, submitting a proposal for an ambitious mission to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. The Io Volcano Observer mission would launch in May 2021, swing into orbit around Jupiter in February 2026 and conduct at least nine flybys of Io, employing a high-speed optical communications antenna to beam data back to Earth. One of the flybys would zip just above the Pele vent, one of the most active volcanoes in the solar system. Fresh eruptions regularly reconstitute Io's scarred surface, and the hyperactive world may resemble how Earth appeared just after it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Io's volcanoes are driven by the tidal tug of Jupiter's immense gravity, which heats up churning molten rock to a boiling point. The tidal forces trigger widespread eruptions - NASA's Galileo mission saw more than 100 active volcanoes - and open a window into a planet's internal workings. McEwen said his mission's suite of cameras, heat detectors and spectrometers would collect 900 times more data on Io than the Galileo orbiter obtained during its eight-year tour around Jupiter, which ended in 2003. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which developed NASA's New Horizons and Messenger spacecraft to Pluto and Mercury, would lead construction and operations of the Io probe, McEwen said. If approved, the Io Volcano Observer could be joined by two other missions - flagship-class probes under development by NASA and the European Space Agency - flying around Jupiter at the same time. Another mission to the outer solar system was proposed by Jonathan Lunine, a scientist from Cornell University who specializes in the habitability of extraterrestrial worlds. Lunine's team came up with a spacecraft built in-house at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory called the Enceladus Life Finder. The mission, known as ELF, would fly 10 times through plumes of water launched above the south pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus The Cassini orbiter currently at Saturn discovered the plumes in 2005, tracing their source to fractures in Enceladus's icy crust dubbed \"tiger stripes\" by scientists. Equipped with instrumentation far more sensitive than available on the 1990s-era Cassini orbiter, the ELF mission would search for biosignatures in the geysers on Enceladus. The polar jets loft water, salts and organic molecules dozens of miles over the moon's surface from an underground regional ocean. \"The ocean is being delivered into space through the jets,\" Lunine said in a presentation in February to a NASA scientific advisory panel. \"These are essentially free samples, and this process has been going on for decades, if not for centuries, at least.\" Scientists announced in March that hot springs likely dot the bottom of the subsurface ocean, evidence supporting the theory that the water could be warmed by thermal vents similar to features found deep in Earth's oceans. Cassini's final swing through Enceladus's water plumes is planned later this year. While Cassini detected the plumes, scientists need a new mission to make more detailed measurements on the ocean's temperature, the water's acidity, and energy sources available on Enceladus. ELF's instruments would measure amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - analyze fatty acids, and determine whether methane found in the plumes could have been produced by organisms. \"For life, you need certain amino acids, types of carbon, an abundance of methane to other hydrocarbons, and if all these are within a certain range, it's pretty indicative of a biotic system,\" Lunine said. The proposed probes to Io and Enceladus would each rely on solar electricity generators - \"remote fusion power\" as McEwen calls it - pushing the frontiers of solar cell technology. NASA's Juno orbiter now en route to Jupiter will be the first spacecraft to use solar power in the outer planets, employing three huge solar panels to harness energy from sunlight, even as it grows dimmer with distance. Advancements in solar array design now make missions to Jupiter and Saturn feasible at lower cost. The probes just need large extendable solar panels to generate enough power, officials said. The leaps in technology and revamped accounting rules bring Jupiter, Saturn and their moons - once relegated to multibillion-dollar flagship missions - into the realm of a half-billion-dollar Discovery-class program. Humanity's robotic presence in the outer solar system is set to diminish by the end of the decade. By then, the Cassini mission will have completed a guided crash into Saturn, the New Horizons probe will finish its encounters with Pluto and potentially another distant icy world, and Juno's research into Jupiter's interior and magnetic field will be over. Spacecraft planned to visit the moons of Jupiter will not launch until the 2020s. The ability to launch less costly probes to faraway destinations could restore exploration at the outer planets. Asteroids and comets have been popular targets for past Discovery missions, and there is no shortage of small worlds still unvisited by human-built spacecraft. One proposal would send a probe to Psyche, a nearly 150-mile-wide (240-kilometer) asteroid scientists believe is the leftover metallic core of a protoplanet from the ancient solar system. Circling the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Psyche is a world unlike any ever studied up close. It is made almost entirely of nickel and iron, the same composition as Earth's inner core. Lindy Elkins-Tanton, director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, leads the science team behind the Psyche mission. She said in an interview that the spacecraft - built by Space Systems/Loral - would take five years to cruise from Earth to Psyche in the 2020s. If approved, the probe will carry ion engines to guide itself toward the asteroid belt and rendezvous with Psyche, where it will enter orbit for at least a year. The mission is tasked to find out if Psyche was once a larger body that had its crust and mantle stripped away, exposing the metallic core. \"This is one of the few missions (proposed) that's truly exploration,\" Elkins-Tanton said in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. \"Nobody has ever seen a metal world before. We have no idea what it's going to look like.\" The Dark Asteroid Rendezvous mission, or DARe, would launch in May 2021 and orbit at least two asteroids. The mission could be augmented with flybys of more objects, according to Keith Noll, DARe's principal investigator from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Noll said DARe will need an electrically-powered propulsion system to achieve its mission, arriving in orbit around its first target in 2024 and reaching a secondary destination by 2029. DARe would go to asteroids that are remnant building blocks of the planets, giving context to other bodies visited by robotic spacecraft. \"A lot of missions have gone to targets that are unique,\" Noll said in an interview. \"We want to go to targets we think are fairly typical objects.\" Citing competitive concerns, Noll declined to disclose the mission's destinations or who will provide DARe's instruments and spacecraft bus. Scientists at the University of Colorado and JPL said they responded to NASA's call for proposals with the Binary Asteroid in-situ Explorer, or BASiX. The mission would blast off in December 2020 and reach its destination in May 2024. Built by Ball Aerospace, BASiX aims for asteroid 1996 FG3, an object with its own mini-moon. The probe will drop explosive pods to detonate on the asteroid and gauge the surface's strength and cohesion. A report published in Nature magazine listed another asteroid mission under consideration in the Discovery competition. The Lucy mission would tour Trojan asteroids that circle the sun in clusters in the same orbital path as Jupiter, but Nature reported little is known about the concept. Comets may also prove to be high-priority research subjects for the next Discovery mission. Scientists have discussed at least one proposal, a mission designed to scan comet Tempel 2 with radar, probing the nucleus's internal structure and mapping the body with a color camera and thermal imager. The Comet Radar Explorer, or CORE, would launch in July 2021 and rendezvous with comet Tempel 1 in late 2026. Led by scientists at Arizona State University, the mission's spacecraft would be built by Orbital ATK and its sensor complement would include contributions from Germany and Italy. A trio of proposals would focus on the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, determined to answer basic questions about the origins of the red planet's enigmatic satellites. The Phobos and Deimos Origin Assessment, or PANDORA, mission would be ready for launch by June 2020. The Boeing-built spacecraft would use an all-electric propulsion system to spiral toward Mars on a two-year cruise, arriving in August 2022, according to Tom Prettyman, PANDORA's deputy principal investigator from the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. PANDORA would begin a four-year survey of the Martian moons, spending time in orbit around Phobos and Deimos, dipping close to each satellite's cratered surface to obtain high-resolution imagery and measure their composition. The Mars-Moons Exploration, Reconnaissance and Landed Investigation, or MERLIN, would land on Phobos in October 2024 for a 90-day mission to explore the moon's origins, testing a hypothesis that the body initially formed in the outer solar system and somehow made it to Mars. Managed, constructed and operated by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, MERLIN would launch in late 2021 and conduct several flybys of Deimos before homing in on Phobos, according to scientists. The lander could be commanded to take off again and hop to a different location on Phobos. A laser telecom system would allow the craft to send back real-time video of the moons, officials said at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. The proposed PADME probe would depart Earth in August 2020, reach Mars orbit in February 2021 and zip by Phobos 16 times and encounter Deimos nine times over a one-year primary mission. Based on a NASA-built bullet-shaped spacecraft bus flown to the moon in 2013, PADME stands for Photos and Deimos and Mars Environment. Like the other missions to the Martian moons, PADME would help scientists resolve the origins of Phobos and Deimos. After its work at Mars is complete, NASA could use PADME to experiment with deep space laser communications and repurpose the spacecraft to escape the red planet's gravitational grasp and head for an asteroid flyby. Scientists behind the PADME mission at NASA's Ames Research Center tout it as a cheaper, less risky option to the more ambitious concepts primed to visit the Martian moons. Scientists reportedly submitted a proposal for at least one Mars lander named Mars Icebreaker, which would descend to the Martian polar plains using a landing craft similar to the Phoenix mission that touched down there in 2008. Nature's report on the Discovery competition indicated scientists sent in proposals for several projects to visit Venus, which was last explored by a NASA spacecraft in 1994, when the Magellan radar mapping mission ended. Europe's Venus Express mission orbiter Earth's scorching sister planet for eight years until it ran out of fuel in late 2014. NASA bypassed several Venus mission proposals in the last round of Discovery selections, opting to fund the InSight lander to Mars for research on the red planet's seismic activity. The Venus missions proposed last round included probes with radars to map the planet in greater detail than Magellan. Radar waves can see through Venus's thick envelope of clouds and resolve the planet's terrain. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's VERITAS - Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR Topography and Spectroscopy - mission would survey the planet with X-band radar from an orbit 220 kilometres (136 miles) in altitude. Another concept called the RAVEN mission - short for Radar at Venus - is also being vetted by NASA after being refined through studies by scientists from academic institutions and engineers from Boeing. An exotic mission to dispatch a balloon and atmospheric entry probe to Venus is also up for NASA support. The Venus Atmosphere and Surface Explorer, or VASE, would take a four-month journey to Venus and deploy a large balloon in the planet's upper atmosphere. The VASE mission would be led by Larry Esposito, a scientist at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The balloon would circumnavigate the planet twice, collecting its own measurements 55 kilometres (34 miles) above the planet while relaying data from a deep entry probe designed to obtain a vertical profile of Venus's sweltering atmosphere. The entry probe's mission would last about 90 minutes on a suicide plunge into the atmosphere, and the balloon would function for up to two weeks after arrival. Closer to Earth, a team of scientists led by Ian Garrick-Bethell has pitched NASA on deploying a fleet of more than 30 small shoebox-sized CubeSats around the moon to observe its interaction with the solar wind, study strange localized magnetic swirls, and track the movement of water across the airless lunar surface. Named NanoSWARM, the mission would be ready for liftoff by February 2020, according to Garrick-Bethell, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. The 10-month mission could be accomplished for $200 million, less than half of the Discovery-class cost cap, he said in an interview. A barebones mothership would shepherd the CubeSats from Earth to the moon, then release the tiny satellites on trajectories to impact the lunar surface to study the moon's uneven magnetism. Other CubeSats will deploy into low-altitude orbits to gather detailed data on hydrogen and water distributions at the lunar south pole. Some of the CubeSats will come from South Korean students and scientists through an international partnership agreement, Garrick-Bethell said. Another lunar mission likely proposed - but not confirmed - to NASA in February was the Moon Age and Regolith Explorer. The MARE lander would touch down on one of the moon's dark, young lava flows and gauge the age of the rock at the landing site. Researchers in charge of two telescope concepts have discussed their mission plans in detail. The Near-Earth Object Camera, or NEOCam, would be positioned at the gravitationally-stable L1 libration point a million miles from Earth in line with the sun. NEOCam's infrared detector will locate approximately two-thirds of the large asteroids that could eventually impact our planet, expanding the growing catalog of nearby objects deemed potentially hazardous to Earth. The NEOCam team at JPL won money from NASA in 2010 to further develop the telescope's infrared camera system made by Teledyne Imaging Sensors, setting the stage for a full-up mission proposal in 2015. Built by Ball Aerospace, NEOCam would be fitted with a sunshade to allow the telescope's sensitive detectors to track asteroids near the sun, revealing a population of objects invisible to existing observatories. The Kuiper telescope conceived by Jim Bell, an astronomer based at Arizona State University, would launch in 2021 to the L2 Lagrange point a million miles away - but in the opposite direction from Earth as NEOCam. Like NEOCam, Kuiper would be built by Ball Aerospace. Its three-year mission would observe the solar system's gas giants, moons like Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and distant smaller objects as far away as Pluto. Bell described the Kuiper proposal as \"three missions in one.\" The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune will get special focus, and Kuiper will survey the distribution of small bodies in the outer solar system to help determine how the huge planets changed their orbits since they formed. Kuiper's telescope is half the size of Hubble, but it would begin operations just as NASA expects the legendary Earth-orbiting observatory to end its mission.", "url": "https://astronomynow.com/2015/04/12/diverse-destinations-considered-for-new-interplanetary-probe/"}, {"title": "Small Bodies Dominate NASA's Latest Discovery Competition", "date": "2015-07-07", "content": "Over half of the 28 proposals NASA received for a $450 million robotic solar-system mission launching in 2021 seek to explore small bodies such as comets, asteroids or tiny moons.

NEOCam would essentially do the same thing with a new spacecraft carrying instruments that do not need cryogenic cooling (the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer's primary astrophysics mission was cut short when its cooling system failed). Prime Contractor: Ball. Advanced Jovian Asteroid Explorer. Principal investigator: John Mustard, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The ambitious proposal would cram flybys, orbits and landings into a single mission, taking a 12-year cruise out to a Trojan asteroid close to Jupiter's orbit and, after a year of observations, dropping a small instrument package on the asteroid. Dark Asteroid Rendezvous. Principal investigator: Keith Noll, a planetary astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The mission would orbit and map two asteroids in the inner solar system expected by scientists to carry volatile materials that originated in the outer solar system. Prime Contractor: Orbital ATK. Binary Asteroid In-Situ Explorer. Principal investigator: Dan Scheeres, University of Colorado, Boulder. The mission would orbit a near-Earth asteroid and drop explosive pods onto its surface to create new craters. Ejecta from these craters would help the probe better understand the body's surface composition than remote observation alone. Prime Contractor: Ball. Psyche. Principal investigator: Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Arizona State University. The mission would orbit a metallic asteroid that, in its origin, may have been a planetary core dislodged by a violent impact with some other solar-system body. Comets: Comet Radar Explorer. Principal investigator: Erik Asphaug, Arizona State University. The mission would attempt to map the nucleus of comet Temple 2. Prime Contractor: Orbital ATK. Comet Hartley Analysis to Gather Ancient Links to Life. Principal investigator: Jessica Sunshine, University of Maryland. The mission, a reboot of the Comet Hopper lander that made the finals in the prevous Discovery competition, would visit and observe comet Hartley 2. Unlike Comet Hopper, the new mission will visit only a single comet. Prime Contractor: Lockheed Martin. Primitive Material Explorer. Principal investigator: Hunter Waite, the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. This mission would also visit and observe comet Hartley 2. Prime Contractor: Ball. Kuiper belt and beyond: Kuiper. Principal investigator: Jim Bell, Arizona State University. The space telescope would fly to the gravitationally stable Earth-moon Lagrange Point 2 and observe the faraway Kuiper belt beyond Pluto's orbit. Prime Contractor: Ball. Whipple. Principal investigator: Charles Alcock, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Another space telescope to observe both the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, which lies beyond. The cloud is home to many comets that occasionally make million-year journeys to the inner solar system only to melt as they get too close to the sun. Prime Contractor: Ball. Mars Moons: Mars Moon Exploration, Reconnaissance, and Landed Investigation. Principal investigator: Scott Murchie, principal professional staffer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The combination probe-lander would remotely observe and touch down on both martian moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos and Deimos Origin Assessment. Principal investigator: Carol Raymond, manager of the Small Bodies Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and deputy principal investigator of the onoging Dawn mission, which is now exploring the planetoid Ceres. Raymond's proposal involves exploring Mars' two moons with an orbiter built on one of Boeing's all-electric 702SP satellites. Once the primary mission is finished, Raymond would turn the spacecraft over to NASA's Mars program for use as a communications relay. Prime Contractor: Boeing Defense, Space and Security. Phobos and Deimos and Mars Environment. Principal investigator: Anthony Colaprete, NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California, and principal investigator of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite that launched in 2009. Colaprete's mission would feature an upgraded version the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer spacecraft, launched to Earth's moon in 2013. Prime: NASA Ames. Multiple types of small bodies: Proteus. Principal investigator: Karen Meech,the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. The probe would visit both a comet and an asteroid to investigate whether Earth's water might have been planted here by extraterrestrial bodies. Prime Contractor: Lockheed Martin. Main Belt Asteroid and NEO Tour With Imaging and Spectroscopy. Principal investigator: Andy Rivkin, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The probe would visit nine asteroids, including near-Earth asteroids and some in the so-called main asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Openness among competitors has become a hallmark of the latest NASA Discovery competition. Until a downselect, NASA is not required to identify any of the proposals it received, or say who submitted them. Even then, the agency typically divulges only the names of the proposals it selects for further study. However, principal investigators may share details of their missions, if they wish. This time around, they have done so, early and often. The most recent SBAG meeting is not the only time this year aspiring Discovery principal investigators have shared their plans. Some Discovery candidates, including missions to Mars and Venus, went public in Berlin during the German Aerospace Center's Low Cost Planetary Mission Conference in June.

For the space agency's lowest cost planetary missions, known as Discovery missions, NASA's managers ask the planetary science community to propose the missions they'd like to see fly. Any solar system body except the Sun and Earth (both covered under other programs) can be targeted. There's a strict cost cap of $450M for the spacecraft and instruments, with the agency separately picking up other costs such as the launch and mission operations. The competitions are extremely competitive, with a single mission selected every few years from what's typically a field of 25 to 30 proposals. Because it's common to resubmit proposals in the next competition, in the past, proposers often have been reluctant to even give the names of their missions and only a few released any details of the concepts. Why give your competitors ideas for their next proposal? For the Discovery competition in progress (the thirteenth), that near silence has been broken and most teams have published or presented summaries (and in at least one case, nearly a full description) of their proposed missions. We now know at least the names and destinations of 24 of the 28 proposals. I am delighted with the creativity and quality of the ideas. I suspect that NASA's managers are equally impressed and find themselves having to make a tough choice this summer among a number of top-notch proposals. My understanding of the selection process is that each proposal is evaluated twice for the initial round of selection. First, teams of scientists review the scientific merits of the proposals and rank them. Second, teams of engineers review the proposals for technical feasibility and the likelihood of being built within the cost cap. The very few proposals that receive top scores in both evaluations become eligible to be selected as finalists that receive funding for a year to more fully develop their concepts (typically three proposals in recent competitions). Approximately a year later, NASA's associate administrator for science makes the ultimate selection from among the finalists. Launch of the selected mission is expected by 2021. The openness of the proposing teams for the current competition allowed James Callahan to publish brief summaries of most of the proposals. I've published fuller descriptions for the four proposals for missions to study the outer planets, as well as more detailed descriptions of a proposed mission to a metallic asteroid and a mission to remap Venus with modern instruments. (While the latter focused on a European proposal for their own mission competition, at least two teams reportedly have submitted similar proposals for the current Discovery competition.) At a meeting of the Small Bodies Assessment Group at the end of June, scientists proposing missions to the solar system's comets and asteroids gave 10 minute summaries of their proposals. In this post, I'll report on the concepts presented. The key to thinking about the small body Discovery proposals is to understand how diverse these worlds are. They lay scattered from the inner solar system to the edge of interstellar space. Some are rich in volatiles and are commonly called comets. Some are almost all rock and are called asteroids. Some (like Ceres where the Dawn spacecraft now orbits) are mixtures of both and we don't yet have a good name for them. Within these broad classes of objects, they show tremendous diversity in size, shape, and composition. To understand the clues these bodies provide on the solar system and its formation, we need to explore a few of them in depth to tease out their subtle details. We also need to observe many more with less detail to build up a statistical understanding of their diversity.

Goddard would manage the project.The Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy mission (VERITAS). VERITAS would produce global, high-resolution topography and imaging of Venus' surface and produce the first maps of deformation and global surface composition. Suzanne Smrekar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California is the principal investigator. JPL would manage the project.

Hoping to focus the next round of exploration efforts to places other than Mars, the five semifinalists (which were announced this past September) include proposed missions to Venus, Near-Earth Objects, and asteroids. When it comes to asteroid exploration, one of the possible contenders is Lucy - a proposed reconnaissance orbiter that would study Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids. In addition to being the first mission of its kind, examining the Trojans Asteroids could also lead to several scientific finds that will help us to better understand the history of the Solar System. By definition, Trojan are populations of asteroids that share their orbit with other planets or moons, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two Lagrangian points of stability. The most significant population of Trojans in the Solar System are Jupiter's, with a total of 6,178 having been found as of January 2015. In accordance with astronomical conventions, objects found in this population are named after mythical figures from the Trojan War. There are two main theories as to where Jupiter's Trojans came from. The first suggests that they formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and were caught by the gas giant's gravity as it accumulated hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk. Since they would have shared the same approximate orbit as the forming gas giant, they would have been caught in its gravity and orbited it ever since. The second theory, part of the Nice model, proposes that the Jupiter Trojans were captured about 500-600 million years after the Solar System's formation. During this period Uranus, Neptune - and to a lesser extent, Saturn - moved outward, whereas Jupiter moved slightly inward. This migration could have destabilized the primordial Kuiper Belt, throwing millions of objects into the inner Solar System, some of which Jupiter then captured. In either case, the presence of Trojan asteroids around Jupiter can be traced back to the early Solar System. Studying them therefore presents an opportunity to learn more about its history and formation. And if in fact the Trojans are migrant from the Kuiper Belt, it would also be a chance for scientists to learn more about the most distant reaches of the solar system without having to send a mission all the way out there. The mission would be led by Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, with the Goddard Space Center managing the project. Its targets would most likely include asteroid (3548) Eurybates, (21900) 1999 VQ10, (11351) 1997 TS25, and the binary (617) Patroclus/Menoetius. It would also visit a main-belt asteroid (1981 EQ5) on the way. The spacecraft would perform scans of the asteroids and determine their geology, surface features, compositions, masses and densities using a sophisticated suite of remote-sensing and radio instruments. In addition, during it's proposed 11-year mission, Lucy would also gather information on the asteroids thermal and other physical properties from close range. The project is named Lucy in honor of one of the most influential human fossils found on Earth. Discovered in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia in 1974, Lucy's remains - several hundred bone fragments that belonged to a member the hominid species of Australopithecus afarensis - proved to be an extraordinary find that advanced our knowledge of hominid species evolution. Levison and his team are hoping that a similar find can be made using the probe of the same name. As he and his colleagues describe it, the Lucy mission is aimed at \"Surveying the diversity of Trojan asteroids: The fossils of planet formation.\" \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said Levinson. \"Because the Trojan asteroids are remnants of that primordial material, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. These asteroids are in an area that really is the last population of objects in the solar system to be visited.\" The payload is expected to include three complementary imaging and mapping instruments, including a color imaging and infrared mapping spectrometer, a high-resolution visible imager, and a thermal infrared spectrometer. NASA has also offered an additional $5 to $30 million in funding if mission planners choose to incorporate a laser communications system, a 3D woven heat shield, a Deep Space atomic clock, and/or ion engines. As one of the semifinalists, the Lucy mission has received $3 million dollars to conduct concept design studies and analyses over the course of the next year. After a detailed review and evaluation of the concept studies, NASA will make the final selections by September 2016. In the end, one or two missions will receive the mission's budget of $450 million (not including launch vehicle funding or post-launch operations) and will be launched by 2020 at the earliest.

Hoping to focus the next round of exploration efforts to places other than Mars, the five semifinalists (which were announced this past September) include proposed missions to Venus, Near-Earth Objects, and asteroids. When it comes to asteroid exploration, one of the possible contenders is Lucy - a proposed reconnaissance orbiter that would study Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids. In addition to being the first mission of its kind, examining the Trojans Asteroids could also lead to several scientific finds that will help us to better understand the history of the Solar System. By definition, Trojan are populations of asteroids that share their orbit with other planets or moons, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two Lagrangian points of stability. The most significant population of Trojans in the Solar System are Jupiter's, with a total of 6,178 having been found as of January 2015. In accordance with astronomical conventions, objects found in this population are named after mythical figures from the Trojan War. There are two main theories as to where Jupiter's Trojans came from. The first suggests that they formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and were caught by the gas giant's gravity as it accumulated hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk. Since they would have shared the same approximate orbit as the forming gas giant, they would have been caught in its gravity and orbited it ever since. The second theory, part of the Nice model, proposes that the Jupiter Trojans were captured about 500-600 million years after the Solar System's formation. During this period Uranus, Neptune - and to a lesser extent, Saturn - moved outward, whereas Jupiter moved slightly inward. This migration could have destabilized the primordial Kuiper Belt, throwing millions of objects into the inner Solar System, some of which Jupiter then captured. In either case, the presence of Trojan asteroids around Jupiter can be traced back to the early Solar System. Studying them therefore presents an opportunity to learn more about its history and formation. And if in fact the Trojans are migrant from the Kuiper Belt, it would also be a chance for scientists to learn more about the most distant reaches of the solar system without having to send a mission all the way out there. The mission would be led by Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, with the Goddard Space Center managing the project. Its targets would most likely include asteroid (3548) Eurybates, (21900) 1999 VQ10, (11351) 1997 TS25, and the binary (617) Patroclus/Menoetius. It would also visit a main-belt asteroid (1981 EQ5) on the way. The spacecraft would perform scans of the asteroids and determine their geology, surface features, compositions, masses and densities using a sophisticated suite of remote-sensing and radio instruments. In addition, during it's proposed 11-year mission, Lucy would also gather information on the asteroids thermal and other physical properties from close range. The project is named Lucy in honor of one of the most influential human fossils found on Earth. Discovered in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia in 1974, Lucy's remains - several hundred bone fragments that belonged to a member the hominid species of Australopithecus afarensis - proved to be an extraordinary find that advanced our knowledge of hominid species evolution. Levison and his team are hoping that a similar find can be made using the probe of the same name. As he and his colleagues describe it, the Lucy mission is aimed at \"Surveying the diversity of Trojan asteroids: The fossils of planet formation.\" \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said Levinson. \"Because the Trojan asteroids are remnants of that primordial material, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. These asteroids are in an area that really is the last population of objects in the solar system to be visited.\" The payload is expected to include three complementary imaging and mapping instruments, including a color imaging and infrared mapping spectrometer, a high-resolution visible imager, and a thermal infrared spectrometer. NASA has also offered an additional $5 to $30 million in funding if mission planners choose to incorporate a laser communications system, a 3D woven heat shield, a Deep Space atomic clock, and/or ion engines. As one of the semifinalists, the Lucy mission has received $3 million dollars to conduct concept design studies and analyses over the course of the next year. After a detailed review and evaluation of the concept studies, NASA will make the final selections by September 2016. In the end, one or two missions will receive the mission's budget of $450 million (not including launch vehicle funding or post-launch operations) and will be launched by 2020 at the earliest.

The device continues a growing tradition of hands-on engineering for exploration that has become hallmark of the school, said Christensen, Regents' Professor of geological sciences. The announcement Wednesday came as NASA also selected for development an ASU- led mission to a metallic asteroid. Both projects were approved through NASA's Discovery Program, a series of cost-capped exploratory missions into the solar system. The Lucy mission was named for the iconic fossil skeleton, since it will investigate a particular collection of primitive asteroids that scientists hope may uncover fossils of planetary formation. Its flight plan calls for a 2021 launch. Among the potential targets for an extended mission is asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson, named for the discoverer of the Lucy fossil and director of ASU's Institute of Human Origins in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. \"With each new mission, we're expanding the types of solar system objects we're studying here at ASU.\" Institute in Boulder, Colorado, the mission is under the direction of principal investigator Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute. The target objects for the Lucy mission are asteroids that have never before been studied at close range. These minor planets circle the sun at same distance as Jupiter, roughly five times farther out than Earth, and in the same 12-year orbit as Jupiter. Through a quirk of orbital dynamics, they remain caught in two swarms, one leading and one trailing Jupiter as it orbits the sun. The first of these asteroids was discovered in 1906 and named for the Greek warrior Achilles from Homer's epic poem \"The Iliad.\" As more asteroids were discovered in similar orbits, astronomers started naming them after Homeric Greek and Trojan warriors. Those with Greek names orbit ahead of Jupiter, the Trojan-named ones orbit behind. Collectively, however, both groups are called Trojans, and there are now nearly 6,200 known asteroids in Trojan orbits with Jupiter. The mission should arrive among the Trojans in 2027 and visit six asteroids by 2033. Because Jupiter's Trojan asteroids orbit far from the sun, they all have very cold surfaces. The role in the mission for TES, Christensen said, is to measure temperatures with great precision all over each asteroid that the Lucy spacecraft visits. \"By mapping how temperatures vary by the local time of day,\" Christensen explained, \"we can map the surface properties of these previously unknown objects.\" That will help planetary scientists decipher their histories and how they have changed since the solar system's early days. \"With each new mission,\" Christensen said, \"we're expanding the types of solar system objects we're studying here are ASU.\" ", "url": "https://news.asu.edu/20170104-asu-instrument-fly-new-nasa-mission-distant-trojan-asteroids"}, {"title": "NASA Unveils 2 New Missions to Study Truly Strange Asteroids", "date": "2017-01-05", "content": "NASA's next low-cost planetary missions will attempt to unravel the mysteries of some seriously bizarre asteroids.

If all goes according to plan, the probe will visit an asteroid in the main asteroid belt - located between Mars and Jupiter - in 2025, and then go on to study six Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, NASA officials said. There are two streams of Trojan asteroids. One trails Jupiter, and the other leads the giant planet around the sun. Scientists think both streams may be planetary building blocks that formed far from the sun before being captured into their current orbits by Jupiter's powerful gravity. \"This is a unique opportunity,\" Lucy principal investigator Harold Levison, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in the same statement. \"Because the Trojans are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system.

Violent collisions billions of years ago might have stripped away the layers of rock that once lay atop this metallic object, scientists say. \"This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world - not one of rock or ice, but of metal,\" said Psyche principal investigator Lindy Elkins-Tanton, of Arizona State University. \"16 Psyche is the only known object of its kind in the solar system, and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core.

Several members of the Lucy mission team also are veterans of the New Horizons mission. Lucy also will build on the success of the OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid Bennu, with the OTES instrument and several members of the OSIRIS-REx team. The Psyche mission will explore one of the most intriguing targets in the main asteroid belt - a giant metal asteroid, known as 16 Psyche, about three times farther away from the sun than is the Earth. This asteroid measures about 130 miles (210 kilometers) in diameter and, unlike most other asteroids that are rocky or icy bodies, is thought to be comprised mostly of metallic iron and nickel, similar to Earth's core. Scientists wonder whether Psyche could be an exposed core of an early planet that could have been as large as Mars, but which lost its rocky outer layers due to a number of violent collisions billions of years ago. The mission will help scientists understand how planets and other bodies separated into their layers - including cores, mantles and crusts - early in their histories. \"This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world - not one of rock or ice, but of metal,\" said Psyche Principal Investigator Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University in Tempe. \"16 Psyche is the only known object of its kind in the solar system, and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core.

In addition to selecting the Lucy and Psyche missions for formulation, the agency will extend funding for the Near Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) project for an additional year. The NEOCam space telescope is designed to survey regions of space closest to Earth's orbit, where potentially hazardous asteroids may be found. \"These are true missions of discovery that integrate into NASA's larger strategy of investigating how the solar system formed and evolved,\" said NASA's Planetary Science Director Jim Green. \"We've explored terrestrial planets, gas giants, and a range of other bodies orbiting the sun.

They are managed for NASA's Planetary Science Division by the Planetary Missions Program Office at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The missions are designed and led by a principal investigator, who assembles a team of scientists and engineers, to address key science questions about the solar system. The Discovery Program portfolio includes 12 prior selections such as the MESSENGER mission to study Mercury, the Dawn mission to explore asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and the InSight Mars lander, scheduled to launch in May 2018.

The Lucy and Psyche spacecraft will join NASA's line of cost-capped Discovery missions, a program under which the agency's Mars Pathfinder rover, the Messenger mission to orbit Mercury, and the Dawn probe currently orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres were developed, built and launched. Picked from a slate of 28 proposals submitted to NASA in 2015, Lucy and Psyche will visit worlds never before seen close-up as scientists seek to sort out the violent early history of the solar system, in which proto-planets coalesced from mergers and collisions between rocks and boulders in a disk around the sun. Lucy will launch in October 2021 on a preliminary trajectory to escape the bonds of Earth's gravity, then return for flybys to use the planet's gravity to slingshot toward the mission's targets in the asteroid belt and beyond. The probe's first destination in April 2025 will be the asteroid DonaldJohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The Lucy spacecraft will then head as far as 500 million miles from the sun on a series of high-speed passes through groups of Trojan asteroids, primitive worlds trapped by Jupiter's gravity in swarms ahead of and behind the giant planet's path. Lucy will fly by at least six Trojan asteroids at close range from August 2027 through March 2033, the first time a spacecraft has visited a member of the Trojan population, which some scientists estimate may number in the hundreds of thousands of objects. \"Lucy is a flyby mission,\" said Harold Levison, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"Lucy fits in with NASA's history of exploration - first you do flybys, then you do rendezvous and then you do landings. In our case, in order to cover the diversity that we need to cover, we need to move quickly through the Trojan swarms to cover a lot of real estate, and that means that we're doing flybys only.\" The Jupiter Trojans may hold clues about the evolution of the solar system, especially the outer planets and the formation of Jupiter and its moons, scientists said. The frozen mini-worlds could be time capsules, keeping the characteristics they had more than 4 billion years ago, before scientists believe the immense pull of Jupiter's gravity trapped them in their current locations. Because of their distance from Earth, fragments from the Jupiter Trojans have never fallen to the ground as meteorites, robbing scientists of any insight into their history and make-up. \"These objects are totally unknown,\" Levison said. \"Not only are they unknown because we've never really visited them with a spacecraft, unlike almost every other small body population in the solar system, these objects do not contribute to the meteorite record on Earth. Comets, main belt asteroids, near-Earth asteroids, all are contributing, but not Trojans because of their proximity to Jupiter's orbit.\" The Psyche mission, named for its destination, will depart Earth in October 2023. Its trajectory will take the spacecraft on gravity assist flybys around Earth and Mars in 2024 and 2025, then to the asteroid Psyche in 2030, where the probe will enter orbit for at least 12 months of detailed measurements and observations. \"Psyche is a small world that's made entirely of iron-nickel metal,\" said Linda Elkins-Tanton, the Psyche mission's principal investigator from Arizona State University. \"Humankind has visited rocky worlds, and icy worlds, and worlds made of gas, but we have never seen a metal world. Psyche has never been visited or had a picture taken that was more than a point of light, so it's apperance remains a mystery. This mission will be true exploration and discovery.\" Asteroid Psyche resides in the outer part of the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, with an average distance of around 270 million miles from the sun, three times farther than the Earth. Telescopic observations indicate Psyche is about 186 miles in diameter, but its topography and shape remain a mystery. Astronomical observations show that Psyche's metallic composition is much like Earth's super-dense, super-heated inner core, an environmental unreachable by humans or modern research tools. \"We think that Psyche is the metal core of a small planet that was destroyed in the high-energy, high-speed first one-one hundredth of the age of our solar system,\" Elkins-Tanton said. \"By visiting Psyche, we can literally visit a planetary core the only way that humankind ever can.\" The Lucy and Psyche missions come with strict cost constraints imposed by NASA. The space agency's cost cap for the missions is $450 million each, a figure that does not include launch costs. Levison said the Lucy spacecraft will be built by Lockheed Martin in Denver and will be based on the company's design of previous interplanetary probes, most recently the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission launched in September 2016. Space Systems/Loral of Palo Alto, California, will manufacture the Psyche spacecraft with a suite of ion thrusters to steer the probe toward its destination. Based on the company's 1300-series design for commercial communications satellites, Psyche is the first spacecraft SSL will build for a NASA Discovery-class interplanetary mission. Lucy will fly with conventional chemical rocket thrusters, relying primarily on gravity assists to bend its trajectory toward the Trojan swarms, Levison said. To be managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, respectively, Lucy and Psyche came out on top in NASA's evaluation of five finalists culled from a list of 28 initial proposals submitted to the agency in early 2015. The winning missions beat out two robotic probes that would have flown to Venus - an orbiter with a radar mapping instrument and a craft that would have studied Venus's atmosphere during an hour-long parachute-assisted descent. A fifth finalist was called NEOCam, an observatory planned to search for asteroids that could threaten Earth. While NASA did not approve NEOCam for full development, officials plan to continue funding the mission's team at JPL for at least another year, aiming to reduce risk and keep the project alive for a possible future selection. NASA picks Discovery missions in competitions among scientists with interests in the planets, asteroids, comets. Researchers are charged with assembling broad scientific and industrial teams that include developers of science instruments, spacecraft builders and project management experts. \"In that competition, we're looking for top science, top scientific implementation, and minimizing our technical risk,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division. \"Each of the principal investigators have a cost cap they must be able to stay under. All these factors are folded into a comprehensive evaluation. \"It would be wonderful if we could have selected more than two, but of course, obviously we're delighted with the two selections, and our ability to move forward with two,\" Green said during the Jan. 4 announcement of Lucy and Psyche. \"Our budget in the past hasn't enabled us to always do that.\" Green on Jan. 11 told NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, a committee of scientists specializing in research on asteroids, comets and dwarf planets, that the launch dates for Lucy and Psyche are staggered to fit within the agency's planetary science budget and based on orbital mechanics. \"These are the two that were the most technically ready, with top science,\" Green said. \"One of the charges we gave them was to look for optimal launch windows,\" he said. \"That gives us the greatest flexibility to make a selection of two, where we have staggered launch windows.\" Lucy will get a head start on its development, with its launch date set for October 2021. Psyche will follow a couple of years later. NASA has typically picked just one Discovery mission during each competition. The last Discovery competition resulted in the approval of the InSight Mars lander in August 2012, with a target launch date in March 2016. InSight's seismic research mission to the Martian surface has been delayed due to technical issues, with launch now scheduled in May 2018. NASA is trying to reduce the time between Discovery-class missions, after the National Research Council recommended the agency mount competitions every two years, close to the cadence achieved earlier in the Discovery program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But NASA's planetary science funding waned over the last decade, and the agency's relatively low-cost Discovery program suffered. More costly flagship- level science missions like the Curiosity rover also took up a large slice of NASA's remaining planetary science budget. Green said NASA's current budget allows for a new Discovery competition within three years, down from the four-and-a-half years between the selections of InSight and Lucy and Psyche. \"The administration and Congress have approved a healthy program that can't quite get us to 24 months, but gets it now closer to 32-36 months,\" Green said Jan. 11.

The Lucy mission will carry an ASU-designed and -developed thermal emission spectrometer, which will measure surface temperatures on each asteroid the spacecraft visits, said Philip Christensen of the university's School of Earth and Space Exploration. \"I'm really excited about this instrument, the third to be built here at SESE,\" said Christensen, thermal emission spectrometer designer and principal investigator. The device continues a growing tradition of hands-on engineering for exploration that has become hallmark of the school, said Christensen, Regents' Professor of geological sciences. The announcement Wednesday came as NASA also selected for development an ASU- led mission to a metallic asteroid. Both projects were approved through NASA's Discovery Program, a series of cost-capped exploratory missions into the solar system. The Lucy mission was named for the iconic fossil skeleton, since it will investigate a particular collection of primitive asteroids that scientists hope may uncover fossils of planetary formation. Its flight plan calls for a 2021 launch. Among the potential targets for an extended mission is asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson, named for the discoverer of the Lucy fossil and director of ASU's Institute of Human Origins in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. \"With each new mission, we're expanding the types of solar system objects we're studying here at ASU.\" Institute in Boulder, Colorado, the mission is under the direction of principal investigator Harold Levison of the Southwest Research Institute. The target objects for the Lucy mission are asteroids that have never before been studied at close range. These minor planets circle the sun at same distance as Jupiter, roughly five times farther out than Earth, and in the same 12-year orbit as Jupiter. Through a quirk of orbital dynamics, they remain caught in two swarms, one leading and one trailing Jupiter as it orbits the sun. The first of these asteroids was discovered in 1906 and named for the Greek warrior Achilles from Homer's epic poem \"The Iliad.\" As more asteroids were discovered in similar orbits, astronomers started naming them after Homeric Greek and Trojan warriors. Those with Greek names orbit ahead of Jupiter, the Trojan-named ones orbit behind. Collectively, however, both groups are called Trojans, and there are now nearly 6,200 known asteroids in Trojan orbits with Jupiter. The mission should arrive among the Trojans in 2027 and visit six asteroids by 2033. Because Jupiter's Trojan asteroids orbit far from the sun, they all have very cold surfaces. The role in the mission for TES, Christensen said, is to measure temperatures with great precision all over each asteroid that the Lucy spacecraft visits. \"By mapping how temperatures vary by the local time of day,\" Christensen explained, \"we can map the surface properties of these previously unknown objects.\" That will help planetary scientists decipher their histories and how they have changed since the solar system's early days. \"With each new mission,\" Christensen said, \"we're expanding the types of solar system objects we're studying here are ASU.\" ", "url": "https://news.asu.edu/20170104-asu-instrument-fly-new-nasa-mission-distant-trojan-asteroids"}, {"title": "NASA Unveils 2 New Missions to Study Truly Strange Asteroids", "date": "2017-01-05", "content": "NASA's next low-cost planetary missions will attempt to unravel the mysteries of some seriously bizarre asteroids. The space agency has selected projects called Lucy and Psyche via its Discovery Program, which funds highly focused space missions to destinations throughout the solar system. The Lucy project will investigate the Trojan asteroids, which share an orbit with Jupiter, while Psyche will journey to the asteroid belt to study a huge, metallic asteroid named 16 Psyche that resides there. \"This is what Discovery Program missions are all about - boldly going to places we've never been to enable groundbreaking science,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a statement today (Jan. 4). Lucy is scheduled to launch in October 2021. If all goes according to plan, the probe will visit an asteroid in the main asteroid belt - located between Mars and Jupiter - in 2025, and then go on to study six Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, NASA officials said. There are two streams of Trojan asteroids. One trails Jupiter, and the other leads the giant planet around the sun. Scientists think both streams may be planetary building blocks that formed far from the sun before being captured into their current orbits by Jupiter's powerful gravity. \"This is a unique opportunity,\" Lucy principal investigator Harold Levison, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in the same statement. \"Because the Trojans are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. Lucy, like the human fossil for which it is named, will revolutionize the understanding of our origins.\" Psyche will explore one of the oddest objects in the solar system - a 130-mile-wide (210 kilometers) metallic asteroid that may be the core of an ancient, Mars-size planet. Violent collisions billions of years ago might have stripped away the layers of rock that once lay atop this metallic object, scientists say. \"This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world - not one of rock or ice, but of metal,\" said Psyche principal investigator Lindy Elkins-Tanton, of Arizona State University. \"16 Psyche is the only known object of its kind in the solar system, and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core.

Lucy and Psyche were among five Discovery finalists that NASA announced last year. One of these other finalists, the dangerous-asteroid-hunting Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam), will get an additional year's worth of funding for continued development, NASA officials said. The Discovery Program, which was founded in 1992, supports relatively low-cost planetary missions; development costs for the current crop are capped at about $450 million apiece, NASA officials said. The agency has funded 12 other Discovery missions in addition to those announced today, including the planet-hunting Kepler space telescope, the Dawn mission to the huge asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and the InSight Mars lander, which is due to launch next year.

It's slated to arrive at its first destination, a main belt asteroid, in 2025. From 2027 to 2033, Lucy will explore six Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These asteroids are trapped by Jupiter's gravity in two swarms that share the planet's orbit, one leading and one trailing Jupiter in its 12-year circuit around the sun. The Trojans are thought to be relics of a much earlier era in the history of the solar system, and may have formed far beyond Jupiter's current orbit. \"This is a unique opportunity,\" said Harold F.

Several members of the Lucy mission team also are veterans of the New Horizons mission. Lucy also will build on the success of the OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid Bennu, with the OTES instrument and several members of the OSIRIS-REx team. The Psyche mission will explore one of the most intriguing targets in the main asteroid belt - a giant metal asteroid, known as 16 Psyche, about three times farther away from the sun than is the Earth. This asteroid measures about 130 miles (210 kilometers) in diameter and, unlike most other asteroids that are rocky or icy bodies, is thought to be comprised mostly of metallic iron and nickel, similar to Earth's core. Scientists wonder whether Psyche could be an exposed core of an early planet that could have been as large as Mars, but which lost its rocky outer layers due to a number of violent collisions billions of years ago. The mission will help scientists understand how planets and other bodies separated into their layers - including cores, mantles and crusts - early in their histories. \"This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world - not one of rock or ice, but of metal,\" said Psyche Principal Investigator Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University in Tempe. \"16 Psyche is the only known object of its kind in the solar system, and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core.

In addition to selecting the Lucy and Psyche missions for formulation, the agency will extend funding for the Near Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) project for an additional year. The NEOCam space telescope is designed to survey regions of space closest to Earth's orbit, where potentially hazardous asteroids may be found. \"These are true missions of discovery that integrate into NASA's larger strategy of investigating how the solar system formed and evolved,\" said NASA's Planetary Science Director Jim Green. \"We've explored terrestrial planets, gas giants, and a range of other bodies orbiting the sun. Lucy will observe primitive remnants from farther out in the solar system, while Psyche will directly observe the interior of a planetary body. These additional pieces of the puzzle will help us understand how the sun and its family of planets formed, changed over time, and became places where life could develop and be sustained - and what the future may hold.\" Discovery Program class missions like these are relatively low-cost, their development capped at about $450 million. They are managed for NASA's Planetary Science Division by the Planetary Missions Program Office at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The missions are designed and led by a principal investigator, who assembles a team of scientists and engineers, to address key science questions about the solar system. The Discovery Program portfolio includes 12 prior selections such as the MESSENGER mission to study Mercury, the Dawn mission to explore asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and the InSight Mars lander, scheduled to launch in May 2018. NASA's other missions to asteroids began with the NEAR orbiter of asteroid Eros, which arrived in 2000, and continues with Dawn, which orbited Vesta and now is in an extended mission phase at Ceres. The OSIRIS-REx mission, which launched on Sept. 8, 2016, is speeding toward a 2018 rendezvous with the asteroid Bennu, and will deliver a sample back to Earth in 2023.

Picked from a slate of 28 proposals submitted to NASA in 2015, Lucy and Psyche will visit worlds never before seen close-up as scientists seek to sort out the violent early history of the solar system, in which proto-planets coalesced from mergers and collisions between rocks and boulders in a disk around the sun. Lucy will launch in October 2021 on a preliminary trajectory to escape the bonds of Earth's gravity, then return for flybys to use the planet's gravity to slingshot toward the mission's targets in the asteroid belt and beyond. The probe's first destination in April 2025 will be the asteroid DonaldJohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The Lucy spacecraft will then head as far as 500 million miles from the sun on a series of high-speed passes through groups of Trojan asteroids, primitive worlds trapped by Jupiter's gravity in swarms ahead of and behind the giant planet's path. Lucy will fly by at least six Trojan asteroids at close range from August 2027 through March 2033, the first time a spacecraft has visited a member of the Trojan population, which some scientists estimate may number in the hundreds of thousands of objects. \"Lucy is a flyby mission,\" said Harold Levison, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"Lucy fits in with NASA's history of exploration - first you do flybys, then you do rendezvous and then you do landings. In our case, in order to cover the diversity that we need to cover, we need to move quickly through the Trojan swarms to cover a lot of real estate, and that means that we're doing flybys only.\" The Jupiter Trojans may hold clues about the evolution of the solar system, especially the outer planets and the formation of Jupiter and its moons, scientists said. The frozen mini-worlds could be time capsules, keeping the characteristics they had more than 4 billion years ago, before scientists believe the immense pull of Jupiter's gravity trapped them in their current locations.

The spacecraft will make its first practice run by April 2025, and complete its mission around February 2034. Named after the early hominid fossil \"Lucy\" discovered in Ethiopia in the 1970s, this Lucyis searching for fossils of a different type. \"NASA has an overall goal of trying to understand how the solar system was formed. To do that it is important to find objects that haven't changed much,\" said KinetX President and CEO Kjell Stakkestad. \"The chance to see these objects up close, rather than looking at a Hubble telescope assessment from a distance, is super important to verify whether scientists have their theories correct.\" Stakkestad said drawing a roadmap for a space mission like Lucyis not trivial. He compared it to \"a game of cosmic billiards.\" \"It's not like driving to the store, where you can start and stop. You have to try to take into account gravity, and try to slingshot around and line yourself up in the right time and place so you can head to the next body,\" he said. The bodies in question are asteroids know as \"Trojans\" which orbit the planet Jupiter. According to a fact sheet assembled by Lucy's principle scientific investigator H.F. Levinson, the mission \"will perform an exhaustive landmark investigation that visits six of these primitive asteroids,\" and use \"high-heritage remote sensing instruments to map the geology, surface color and composition, thermal and other physical properties of its targets at close range.\" Coming within a few kilometers of asteroids is complicated by the fact that their exact position is unknown, and that it takes around 30 minutes for a radio signal to travel between the spacecraft and the KinetX navigation team on earth. Stakkestad said that Lucymust have its flight path pre-programmed, and then it will adjust itself with sensors to avoid colliding with its targets or missing them completely. The project budget overall is about $500 million. Arizona will probably get around $10 million to $15 million of that, according to Stakkestad. In addition to KinetX's involvement, members of the science team are from both Arizona State University and the University of Arizona. \"Arizona has a remarkable capability for space work,\" he said. \"What's really interesting is that Lucy is a Discovery class mission, and two were selected this year. One is Lucyand one is called Psyche, and the principle investigator for Psyche is from ASU. There aren't many states that can say they have two missions going like that.\" Stakkestad said that Lucywould add to KinetX's growing wealth of deep-space experience and that would help win future NASA contracts. He sees a bright future for Arizona as a leader in space exploration, but that future is not without obstacles. Although the aerospace industry provides high-paying jobs, \"We can't seem to get that knowledge out to the government to explain why they need to work hard with companies to grow that capability. Most states don't have anything close to what Arizona has,\" Stakkestad said. He also said he sometimes has trouble recruiting talent to the state. \"I know were having this problem, and I'm sure other companies are, too.

The spacecraft will make its first practice run by April 2025, and complete its mission around February 2034. Named after the early hominid fossil \"Lucy\" discovered in Ethiopia in the 1970s, this Lucyis searching for fossils of a different type. \"NASA has an overall goal of trying to understand how the solar system was formed. To do that it is important to find objects that haven't changed much,\" said KinetX President and CEO Kjell Stakkestad. \"The chance to see these objects up close, rather than looking at a Hubble telescope assessment from a distance, is super important to verify whether scientists have their theories correct.\" Stakkestad said drawing a roadmap for a space mission like Lucyis not trivial. He compared it to \"a game of cosmic billiards.\" \"It's not like driving to the store, where you can start and stop. You have to try to take into account gravity, and try to slingshot around and line yourself up in the right time and place so you can head to the next body,\" he said. The bodies in question are asteroids know as \"Trojans\" which orbit the planet Jupiter. According to a fact sheet assembled by Lucy's principle scientific investigator H.F. Levinson, the mission \"will perform an exhaustive landmark investigation that visits six of these primitive asteroids,\" and use \"high-heritage remote sensing instruments to map the geology, surface color and composition, thermal and other physical properties of its targets at close range.\" Coming within a few kilometers of asteroids is complicated by the fact that their exact position is unknown, and that it takes around 30 minutes for a radio signal to travel between the spacecraft and the KinetX navigation team on earth. Stakkestad said that Lucymust have its flight path pre-programmed, and then it will adjust itself with sensors to avoid colliding with its targets or missing them completely. The project budget overall is about $500 million. Arizona will probably get around $10 million to $15 million of that, according to Stakkestad. In addition to KinetX's involvement, members of the science team are from both Arizona State University and the University of Arizona. \"Arizona has a remarkable capability for space work,\" he said. \"What's really interesting is that Lucy is a Discovery class mission, and two were selected this year. One is Lucyand one is called Psyche, and the principle investigator for Psyche is from ASU. There aren't many states that can say they have two missions going like that.\" Stakkestad said that Lucywould add to KinetX's growing wealth of deep-space experience and that would help win future NASA contracts. He sees a bright future for Arizona as a leader in space exploration, but that future is not without obstacles. Although the aerospace industry provides high-paying jobs, \"We can't seem to get that knowledge out to the government to explain why they need to work hard with companies to grow that capability. Most states don't have anything close to what Arizona has,\" Stakkestad said. He also said he sometimes has trouble recruiting talent to the state. \"I know were having this problem, and I'm sure other companies are, too. The education system here is so horrible, were 50th out of 50 states on what we spend on students,\" he said. \"When I try to entice people to come and work on exciting projects here, if they're younger people with a young family, they are really hesitant to come.\" Despite the challenges, Stakkestad is optimistic about the future of KinetX. \"Lucygives us the ability to figure out complex technologies to solve problems, and that knowledge can be used for commercial space programs or sometimes other programs that aren't necessarily in space.

The Lucy mission will launch in 2021 and will fly by six of these asteroids between 2025 and 2033. Lucy is a NASA Discovery mission, led by Dr. Harold F. Levison from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland manages the mission for NASA. Lockheed Martin is building the Lucy spacecraft and will operate it in flight from its Mission Support Area in Denver, Colorado. MSSS will provide a system called the Terminal Tracking Camera (T2CAM), a version of MSSS's off-the-shelf ECAM space camera product line, with mission-specific enhancements to its optics, digital logic, and software. The two redundant cameras are ECAM-M50s, with the standard ECAM NFOV lens system (see image of a flight ECAM-M50 with a NFOV lens), and the cameras are controlled by an ECAM-DVR8 (see image of ORISIS-REx TAGCAMS ECAM-DVR8). T2CAM will be used to resolve residual navigation errors on approach, which enables high precision pointing of Lucy's instruments. It will also be used to perform opportunistic science, such as photometric studies and shape modeling of the asteroids. Jacob Schaffner, lead engineer of ECAM development at MSSS, said, \"Although the ECAM system was originally intended for engineering purposes, we're gratified by the number of mixed-use and science applications our customers have found for it. We feel that our science experience positions us to offer the most cost-effective and capable imaging systems currently available.\" MSSS has a long history of building and operating science instruments for NASA spacecraft, most recently the Curiosity Mars rover and the Juno mission to Jupiter, and is currently building instruments for the Mars 2020 rover, the Psyche mission to the asteroid of the same name, and the Korean Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter, as well as engineering cameras for a wide variety of Earth orbiting missions. For Lockheed Martin, MSSS provided the ECAM-based TAGCAMS system for the OSIRIS-REx mission, which will arrive at its target, the asteroid Bennu, later this year. T2Cam on Lucy will be very similar in performance to TAGCAMS, which is illustrated by the TAGCAMS images of the Earth and Moon acquired during the OSIRIS-REx Earth Gravity Assist maneuver in 2017.", "url": "https://www.msss.com/news/index.php?id=131"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Mission to Jupiter's Trojans Given the Green Light for Development", "date": "2018-10-31", "content": "NASA's mission to perform the first reconnaissance of the Trojans, a population of primitive asteroids orbiting in tandem with Jupiter, passed a critical milestone today.

And now, we're one step closer to exploring some of the most mysterious asteroids in the solar system. On October 30, NASA announced that they've been given the green light to start building Lucy, a spacecraft that will probe Jupiter's trojan asteroids and is set to launch in October of 2021. On top of giving the go-ahead for construction, NASA has also solidified the mission's budget, schedule, and its suite of high-powered instruments. The much-anticipated project will study two populations of asteroids caught by Jupiter's gravity, about which little is known. Studying asteroids is a hefty task, and it's not going to be a quick one, either. The Lucy mission, named after the 3.2 million year-old hominin fossil who helped us understand human evolution, will take almost 12 years to complete. Once it's finished, though, the craft will have probed seven different asteroids - six trojans and one main-belt asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. After launching from Cape Canaveral, the craft will orbit twice around Earth before relying on a gravity assist to fling it out into space. In this slingshot-like maneuver, Lucy will approach Earth from behind and dip briefly into its strong gravitational field for a speed boost. This move will help both reduce the mission's overall travel time and cut down on the amount of heavy fuel it needs to carry. The first stop on its celestial voyage will be at 52246 Donaldjohanson, a small main-belt asteroid named after the famous paleoanthropologist who discovered Lucy. It will orbit close to the asteroid and use its infrared mapping spectrometer, thermal infrared spectrometer, and high-resolution visible imager to study its surface composition and physical properties. With one asteroid under its belt, the mission will continue on its journey to the trojans. These famous asteroids circle the Sun in the same orbit as Jupiter, with one massive group flying ahead of the gas giant, and another trailing behind at what's known as Lagrangian points. Using the same instruments and techniques, Lucy will probe four trojans in the group leading Jupiter and two in its orbital trail. When it comes to tracking our solar system's history, Lucy's data could prove highly valuable. It's believed that asteroids are ancient fragments leftover from our solar system's formation, and that they, unlike planets and moons, have roughly the same structure and chemical composition that they did when they first formed. It's also thought that asteroids could have transported organic molecules, like water, to larger celestial bodies. By determining the compositions of these relics, Lucy could gain insight into the chemical elements that made up our infant solar system, and help researchers trace its formation and evolution.

The space agency announced the contract award to ULA on Thursday, extending the company's history of launching prominent interplanetary missions, a list that includes still-operating probes such as the InSight and Curiosity landers to Mars, the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. Built by Lockheed Martin, the Lucy spacecraft will lift off aboard an Atlas 5 rocket with a four-meter (13-foot) diameter payload shroud and no solid rocket boosters, a variant known as the \"401\" configuration. The launch will occur at ULA's Complex 41 launch pad at Cape Canaveral. \"We could not be more pleased that NASA has selected ULA to launch this amazing planetary science mission,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's president and chief executive officer. \"This mission has a once-in-a-lifetime planetary launch window, and Atlas 5's world-leading schedule certainty, coupled with our reliability and performance provided the optimal vehicle for this mission.\" The launch window for the Lucy mission opens Oct. 16, 2021, and extends several weeks. If the launch is delayed beyond the 2021 launch window, a backup opportunity is available approximately one year later, according to Simone Marchi, Lucy's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute. \"Our Atlas 5 rocket has launched 79 times achieving 100 percent mission success, and we look forward to working again with our mission partners to explore our universe,\" Bruno said in a statement. The launch contract is valued at $148.3 million, a figure that includes the launch service and other mission-related costs, according to NASA. ULA said NASA selected the Atlas 5 rocket after a \"competitive launch service task order evaluation\" by the space agency's Launch Services Program. ULA's Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets are certified to launch NASA's robotic interplanetary science missions, alongside SpaceX's Falcon 9 launcher. Both companies are expected to submit bids for each task order competition managed the Launch Services Program. After launching aboard the Atlas 5 rocket, Lucy will a combination of on-board thrusters and three gravity assist flybys with Earth to spiral into an elongated orbit around the sun, first to encounter a main-belt asteroid between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in 2025, then to explore six objects farther out in the solar system five times farther from the sun than the Earth. Lucy will be the first mission to visit a class of solar system objects known as the Trojan asteroids, which orbit in tandem with Jupiter, with groups ahead of and behind the giant planet in its path around the sun. Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids represent a diverse sample of the types of small planetary building blocks that populated the solar system after its formation 4.5 billion years ago. \"If there's anything we've learned in the last 30 years, it's the planets like Earth do not form, excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder. \"They form as a result of a complex interaction of various regions of the solar system handing material back and forth as the planets accreted. As a result, to understand where a planet like the Earth comes from, you really have to understand the system as a whole.\" That's why NASA has launched, or is developing, nearly a dozen robotic missions to explore asteroids, comets and objects in the distant Kuiper Belt - all in the last 25 years. Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's science directorate, said the space agency is investing between $5 billion and $6 billion in missions to small bodies in the current decade. \"The reason why these (objects) are particularly interesting is because they are sculpted by the formation of the planetary system, and most of the material in it has remained roughly unchanged since the beginning of the solar system, and that's why NASA has put so much effort into trying to understand these bodies,\" Levison said. \"Lucy will launch in just about 1,000 days, which is a little intimidating to me,\" Levison said. \"We're going to have a main-belt asteroid rehearsal in 2025, and five Trojan encounters going between 2027 and 2033, for a total of six objects because one of the objects we're studying is going to be a binary, which is, I must admit, my favorite.\" Initially thought to be the remnant leftovers from the formation of Jupiter, the Trojan asteroids actually appear different from one another, with some appearing reddish in color, and others have a dark charcoal-like color. Levison co-authored the Nice model, which suggests the solar system's four giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - all formed relatively close together, with a disk of dust and rocks extending farther from the sun. \"The Nice model predicts that this planetary system was unstable,\" Levison said. \"The orbits went basically nuts. Uranus and Neptune gravitationally scattered off one another and were thrown out into this disk of material by Jupiter and Saturn. The disk went kablooey because of the gravitational effects of the planets, and ... most of the material was thrown out into interstellar space, but you have a small population right about Jupiter, which represents the Trojans. \"This is just a theory, but if this is all true, then the Trojan population represents objects that formed throughout that disk (in the early solar system), so it's an opportunity for us to understand that disk by just going to the small region that we call the Trojans,\" he said. \"In order to take advantage of this diversity, we need to be able to cover a lot of real estate, and study a lot of these objects,\" Levison said. After Lucy's launch, the spacecraft will return to fly by Earth on Oct. 16, 2022, and Dec. 13, 2024, to use the planet's gravity to slingshot farther from the sun. The probe will encounter its first extraterrestrial target on April 20, 2025, when it speeds by the 2.4-mile-wide (3.9-kilometer) asteroid Donaldjohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. \"Lucy is named after the human ancestor fossil because these objects really represent the fossils of planet formation, so in honor of that, we named this asteroid Donald Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy,\" Levison said. Lucy will fly by four objects in one of the Trojan swarms over a 15-month period from August 2027 through November 2028, then return back to Earth for another gravity assist flyby on Dec. 26, 2030, to bend the spacecraft's trajectory to aim for a binary pair of Trojan asteroids - named Patroclus and Menoetius - on March 2, 2033. \"This is a flyby mission,\" Levison said. \"We're going to just about everything that we can do during a flyby. We're going to look at surface geology, we're going to get colors, we're going to get compositions, we're going to be able to measure the mass of these objects as we fly by using the Doppler shift, and we're going to look for satellites and rings.\" Lucy's four major science instruments - largely based on hardware flown on previous interplanetary missions - will be mounted to an articulating platform at the top of the spacecraft, which stands around 15 feet (5 meters) tall and has two fan-shaped UltraFlex solar array wings built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, formerly known as Orbital ATK. Lucy's chemical propulsion system will be fueled by hydrazine for major in-space maneuvers. The spacecraft is expected to weigh no more than 3,163 pounds (1,435 kilograms) at launch, with fuel loaded, Levison said. NASA selected Lucy in 2017 from 28 proposals submitted by U.S. science teams as part of the Discovery line of cost-capped planetary probes, a program under which the agency's Mars Pathfinder rover, the Messenger mission to orbit Mercury, the Dawn spacecraft that visited Vesta and Ceres in the asteroid belt, and the InSight lander currently on Mars were developed, built and launched. In addition to Lucy, NASA selected the Psyche mission to explore a unique asteroid made almost entirely of iron-nickel metal. Psyche will launch in August 2022 and reach its destination in January 2026. The Lucy and Psyche missions costs to NASA are capped at $450 million each, excluding launch costs.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/02/01/ula-wins-contract-to-launch-nasas-lucy-mission-to-visit-unexplored-asteroids/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy mission gets caught in a fight between rocket companies", "date": "2019-02-20", "content": "Building a spacecraft is about managing various forms of risk: the risk of hardware failure, software errors, design flaws, you name it. But the project managers of Lucy, an upcoming NASA mission to distant trojan asteroids, face a new type of risk: the risk that they could miss a launch window due to legal battles between rocket companies. On 31 January, NASA's Launch Services Program announced that it had awarded a contract to United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch Lucy into space. The company's Atlas V-401 rocket, the same configuration that launched MAVEN to Mars, was selected for a cost of $148 million. SpaceX, which had proposed its Falcon 9 rocket for the same purpose, filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 11 days later, triggering a formal review. In response, NASA issued a stop-work order to ULA while the contract is under review, which could take as long as 3 months. SpaceX justified its protest by saying that the company \"offered a solution with extraordinarily high confidence of mission success at a price dramatically lower than the award amount, so we believe the decision to pay vastly more [to ULA] for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers.\" People familiar with the Lucy project emphasized that mission planning continues despite the launch vehicle uncertainty. However, the uncertainty about which rocket they will use makes it difficult to optimize the spacecraft design to maximize its performance and minimize its fuel use. According to a GAO report on major NASA projects from 2018, Lucy has passed its preliminary design review and its team is working to finalize its design specifications ahead of entering the most complicated (and expensive) phase of the mission: the period where the hardware is built, integrated, and tested. Knowing the launch vehicle is an important part of mission planning at this stage. Lucy must be ready in time for a 20-day launch window that opens in October of 2021. If the GAO rules in favor of SpaceX, the most likely outcome is that the launch contract will be re-opened for bidding. The recompeting this process could take upwards of 6 months, which, combined with uncertain spacecraft integration requirements, could cause Lucy to miss its 2021 launch window. There is a backup launch opportunity in 2022, though this is not ideal. It is less energetically favorable (it requires more fuel) and it is less monetarily favorable (it adds another year of development costs). These additional development costs could end up costing NASA more than any savings enabled by SpaceX. Numbers are not forthcoming at this stage, but we can look to past examples of mission delays to get a rough sense of their cost. NASA's InSight mission infamously missed its 2016 launch window due to quality issues with a major scientific instrument. Like Lucy, InSight was a Discovery-class planetary mission. Its resulting 2-year delay added $154 million to the cost of the mission. It's reasonable, then, to assume that an additional year delay of Lucy would cost NASA in the neighborhood of $75 - $100 million. This additional cost to the mission would likely negate any savings provided by SpaceX's Falcon 9 (costs tend to be higher than SpaceX's published costs for the Falcon 9 due to additional launch service requirements for government payloads). While we don't know SpaceX's bid for Lucy, the Falcon 9 launch of the DSCOVR spacecraft cost the government $97 million in 2015 and its launch of the astrophysics mission TESS cost $87 million in 2017. In a statement to Space News, ULA emphasized its ability to stick to launch schedules, implying NASA's choice of the Atlas V over a Falcon 9 was driven by Lucy's narrow, 20-day launch window. SpaceX's argument is that their bid would save taxpayer dollars. But recompeting the contract could cause a launch delay, and ultimately cost NASA more in the long run.

Lockheed Martin is building the Lucy spacecraft and will operate it in flight from its Mission Support Area in Denver, Colorado. MSSS will provide a system called the Terminal Tracking Camera (T2CAM), a version of MSSS's off-the-shelf ECAM space camera product line, with mission-specific enhancements to its optics, digital logic, and software. The two redundant cameras are ECAM-M50s, with the standard ECAM NFOV lens system (see image of a flight ECAM-M50 with a NFOV lens), and the cameras are controlled by an ECAM-DVR8 (see image of ORISIS-REx TAGCAMS ECAM-DVR8). T2CAM will be used to resolve residual navigation errors on approach, which enables high precision pointing of Lucy's instruments. It will also be used to perform opportunistic science, such as photometric studies and shape modeling of the asteroids. Jacob Schaffner, lead engineer of ECAM development at MSSS, said, \"Although the ECAM system was originally intended for engineering purposes, we're gratified by the number of mixed-use and science applications our customers have found for it.

The space agency announced the contract award to ULA on Thursday, extending the company's history of launching prominent interplanetary missions, a list that includes still-operating probes such as the InSight and Curiosity landers to Mars, the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. Built by Lockheed Martin, the Lucy spacecraft will lift off aboard an Atlas 5 rocket with a four-meter (13-foot) diameter payload shroud and no solid rocket boosters, a variant known as the \"401\" configuration. The launch will occur at ULA's Complex 41 launch pad at Cape Canaveral. \"We could not be more pleased that NASA has selected ULA to launch this amazing planetary science mission,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's president and chief executive officer. \"This mission has a once-in-a-lifetime planetary launch window, and Atlas 5's world-leading schedule certainty, coupled with our reliability and performance provided the optimal vehicle for this mission.\" The launch window for the Lucy mission opens Oct. 16, 2021, and extends several weeks. If the launch is delayed beyond the 2021 launch window, a backup opportunity is available approximately one year later, according to Simone Marchi, Lucy's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute. \"Our Atlas 5 rocket has launched 79 times achieving 100 percent mission success, and we look forward to working again with our mission partners to explore our universe,\" Bruno said in a statement. The launch contract is valued at $148.3 million, a figure that includes the launch service and other mission-related costs, according to NASA. ULA said NASA selected the Atlas 5 rocket after a \"competitive launch service task order evaluation\" by the space agency's Launch Services Program. ULA's Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets are certified to launch NASA's robotic interplanetary science missions, alongside SpaceX's Falcon 9 launcher. Both companies are expected to submit bids for each task order competition managed the Launch Services Program. After launching aboard the Atlas 5 rocket, Lucy will a combination of on-board thrusters and three gravity assist flybys with Earth to spiral into an elongated orbit around the sun, first to encounter a main-belt asteroid between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in 2025, then to explore six objects farther out in the solar system five times farther from the sun than the Earth. Lucy will be the first mission to visit a class of solar system objects known as the Trojan asteroids, which orbit in tandem with Jupiter, with groups ahead of and behind the giant planet in its path around the sun. Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids represent a diverse sample of the types of small planetary building blocks that populated the solar system after its formation 4.5 billion years ago. \"If there's anything we've learned in the last 30 years, it's the planets like Earth do not form, excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder. \"They form as a result of a complex interaction of various regions of the solar system handing material back and forth as the planets accreted. As a result, to understand where a planet like the Earth comes from, you really have to understand the system as a whole.\" That's why NASA has launched, or is developing, nearly a dozen robotic missions to explore asteroids, comets and objects in the distant Kuiper Belt - all in the last 25 years. Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's science directorate, said the space agency is investing between $5 billion and $6 billion in missions to small bodies in the current decade. \"The reason why these (objects) are particularly interesting is because they are sculpted by the formation of the planetary system, and most of the material in it has remained roughly unchanged since the beginning of the solar system, and that's why NASA has put so much effort into trying to understand these bodies,\" Levison said. \"Lucy will launch in just about 1,000 days, which is a little intimidating to me,\" Levison said. \"We're going to have a main-belt asteroid rehearsal in 2025, and five Trojan encounters going between 2027 and 2033, for a total of six objects because one of the objects we're studying is going to be a binary, which is, I must admit, my favorite.\" Initially thought to be the remnant leftovers from the formation of Jupiter, the Trojan asteroids actually appear different from one another, with some appearing reddish in color, and others have a dark charcoal-like color. Levison co-authored the Nice model, which suggests the solar system's four giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - all formed relatively close together, with a disk of dust and rocks extending farther from the sun. \"The Nice model predicts that this planetary system was unstable,\" Levison said. \"The orbits went basically nuts. Uranus and Neptune gravitationally scattered off one another and were thrown out into this disk of material by Jupiter and Saturn. The disk went kablooey because of the gravitational effects of the planets, and ... most of the material was thrown out into interstellar space, but you have a small population right about Jupiter, which represents the Trojans. \"This is just a theory, but if this is all true, then the Trojan population represents objects that formed throughout that disk (in the early solar system), so it's an opportunity for us to understand that disk by just going to the small region that we call the Trojans,\" he said. \"In order to take advantage of this diversity, we need to be able to cover a lot of real estate, and study a lot of these objects,\" Levison said. After Lucy's launch, the spacecraft will return to fly by Earth on Oct. 16, 2022, and Dec. 13, 2024, to use the planet's gravity to slingshot farther from the sun. The probe will encounter its first extraterrestrial target on April 20, 2025, when it speeds by the 2.4-mile-wide (3.9-kilometer) asteroid Donaldjohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. \"Lucy is named after the human ancestor fossil because these objects really represent the fossils of planet formation, so in honor of that, we named this asteroid Donald Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy,\" Levison said. Lucy will fly by four objects in one of the Trojan swarms over a 15-month period from August 2027 through November 2028, then return back to Earth for another gravity assist flyby on Dec. 26, 2030, to bend the spacecraft's trajectory to aim for a binary pair of Trojan asteroids - named Patroclus and Menoetius - on March 2, 2033. \"This is a flyby mission,\" Levison said. \"We're going to just about everything that we can do during a flyby. We're going to look at surface geology, we're going to get colors, we're going to get compositions, we're going to be able to measure the mass of these objects as we fly by using the Doppler shift, and we're going to look for satellites and rings.\" Lucy's four major science instruments - largely based on hardware flown on previous interplanetary missions - will be mounted to an articulating platform at the top of the spacecraft, which stands around 15 feet (5 meters) tall and has two fan-shaped UltraFlex solar array wings built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, formerly known as Orbital ATK. Lucy's chemical propulsion system will be fueled by hydrazine for major in-space maneuvers. The spacecraft is expected to weigh no more than 3,163 pounds (1,435 kilograms) at launch, with fuel loaded, Levison said. NASA selected Lucy in 2017 from 28 proposals submitted by U.S. science teams as part of the Discovery line of cost-capped planetary probes, a program under which the agency's Mars Pathfinder rover, the Messenger mission to orbit Mercury, the Dawn spacecraft that visited Vesta and Ceres in the asteroid belt, and the InSight lander currently on Mars were developed, built and launched. In addition to Lucy, NASA selected the Psyche mission to explore a unique asteroid made almost entirely of iron-nickel metal. Psyche will launch in August 2022 and reach its destination in January 2026. The Lucy and Psyche missions costs to NASA are capped at $450 million each, excluding launch costs.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/02/01/ula-wins-contract-to-launch-nasas-lucy-mission-to-visit-unexplored-asteroids/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy mission gets caught in a fight between rocket companies", "date": "2019-02-20", "content": "Building a spacecraft is about managing various forms of risk: the risk of hardware failure, software errors, design flaws, you name it. But the project managers of Lucy, an upcoming NASA mission to distant trojan asteroids, face a new type of risk: the risk that they could miss a launch window due to legal battles between rocket companies. On 31 January, NASA's Launch Services Program announced that it had awarded a contract to United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch Lucy into space. The company's Atlas V-401 rocket, the same configuration that launched MAVEN to Mars, was selected for a cost of $148 million. SpaceX, which had proposed its Falcon 9 rocket for the same purpose, filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 11 days later, triggering a formal review. In response, NASA issued a stop-work order to ULA while the contract is under review, which could take as long as 3 months. SpaceX justified its protest by saying that the company \"offered a solution with extraordinarily high confidence of mission success at a price dramatically lower than the award amount, so we believe the decision to pay vastly more [to ULA] for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers.\" People familiar with the Lucy project emphasized that mission planning continues despite the launch vehicle uncertainty. However, the uncertainty about which rocket they will use makes it difficult to optimize the spacecraft design to maximize its performance and minimize its fuel use. According to a GAO report on major NASA projects from 2018, Lucy has passed its preliminary design review and its team is working to finalize its design specifications ahead of entering the most complicated (and expensive) phase of the mission: the period where the hardware is built, integrated, and tested. Knowing the launch vehicle is an important part of mission planning at this stage. Lucy must be ready in time for a 20-day launch window that opens in October of 2021. If the GAO rules in favor of SpaceX, the most likely outcome is that the launch contract will be re-opened for bidding.

That covered a contract NASA awarded Jan. 31 to ULA for the launch of Lucy, a mission slated for launch in October 2021 to visit several Trojan asteroids in the same orbit around the sun as Jupiter. SpaceX did not disclose the reason it withdrew the protest, and a company spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by SpaceNews about the withdrawal. According to GAO's website, SpaceX filed a separate protest over the same contract March 25, which was also withdrawn April 4. The company also declined to comment on the difference between the two protests. When it filed the protest in February, SpaceX argued it could perform the same mission for a \"dramatically lower\" price than the $148.3 million value of the ULA contract. \"We believe the decision to pay vastly more to Boeing and Lockheed for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers,\" a company spokesperson said then. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA said that it was selected in part because it offered schedule assurance for the mission.

The space agency announced the contract award to ULA on Thursday, extending the company's history of launching prominent interplanetary missions, a list that includes still-operating probes such as the InSight and Curiosity landers to Mars, the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. Built by Lockheed Martin, the Lucy spacecraft will lift off aboard an Atlas 5 rocket with a four-meter (13-foot) diameter payload shroud and no solid rocket boosters, a variant known as the \"401\" configuration. The launch will occur at ULA's Complex 41 launch pad at Cape Canaveral. \"We could not be more pleased that NASA has selected ULA to launch this amazing planetary science mission,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's president and chief executive officer. \"This mission has a once-in-a-lifetime planetary launch window, and Atlas 5's world-leading schedule certainty, coupled with our reliability and performance provided the optimal vehicle for this mission.\" The launch window for the Lucy mission opens Oct. 16, 2021, and extends several weeks. If the launch is delayed beyond the 2021 launch window, a backup opportunity is available approximately one year later, according to Simone Marchi, Lucy's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute. \"Our Atlas 5 rocket has launched 79 times achieving 100 percent mission success, and we look forward to working again with our mission partners to explore our universe,\" Bruno said in a statement. The launch contract is valued at $148.3 million, a figure that includes the launch service and other mission-related costs, according to NASA. ULA said NASA selected the Atlas 5 rocket after a \"competitive launch service task order evaluation\" by the space agency's Launch Services Program. ULA's Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets are certified to launch NASA's robotic interplanetary science missions, alongside SpaceX's Falcon 9 launcher. Both companies are expected to submit bids for each task order competition managed the Launch Services Program. After launching aboard the Atlas 5 rocket, Lucy will a combination of on-board thrusters and three gravity assist flybys with Earth to spiral into an elongated orbit around the sun, first to encounter a main-belt asteroid between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in 2025, then to explore six objects farther out in the solar system five times farther from the sun than the Earth. Lucy will be the first mission to visit a class of solar system objects known as the Trojan asteroids, which orbit in tandem with Jupiter, with groups ahead of and behind the giant planet in its path around the sun. Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids represent a diverse sample of the types of small planetary building blocks that populated the solar system after its formation 4.5 billion years ago. \"If there's anything we've learned in the last 30 years, it's the planets like Earth do not form, excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder. \"They form as a result of a complex interaction of various regions of the solar system handing material back and forth as the planets accreted. As a result, to understand where a planet like the Earth comes from, you really have to understand the system as a whole.\" That's why NASA has launched, or is developing, nearly a dozen robotic missions to explore asteroids, comets and objects in the distant Kuiper Belt - all in the last 25 years. Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's science directorate, said the space agency is investing between $5 billion and $6 billion in missions to small bodies in the current decade. \"The reason why these (objects) are particularly interesting is because they are sculpted by the formation of the planetary system, and most of the material in it has remained roughly unchanged since the beginning of the solar system, and that's why NASA has put so much effort into trying to understand these bodies,\" Levison said. \"Lucy will launch in just about 1,000 days, which is a little intimidating to me,\" Levison said. \"We're going to have a main-belt asteroid rehearsal in 2025, and five Trojan encounters going between 2027 and 2033, for a total of six objects because one of the objects we're studying is going to be a binary, which is, I must admit, my favorite.\" Initially thought to be the remnant leftovers from the formation of Jupiter, the Trojan asteroids actually appear different from one another, with some appearing reddish in color, and others have a dark charcoal-like color. Levison co-authored the Nice model, which suggests the solar system's four giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - all formed relatively close together, with a disk of dust and rocks extending farther from the sun. \"The Nice model predicts that this planetary system was unstable,\" Levison said. \"The orbits went basically nuts. Uranus and Neptune gravitationally scattered off one another and were thrown out into this disk of material by Jupiter and Saturn. The disk went kablooey because of the gravitational effects of the planets, and ... most of the material was thrown out into interstellar space, but you have a small population right about Jupiter, which represents the Trojans. \"This is just a theory, but if this is all true, then the Trojan population represents objects that formed throughout that disk (in the early solar system), so it's an opportunity for us to understand that disk by just going to the small region that we call the Trojans,\" he said. \"In order to take advantage of this diversity, we need to be able to cover a lot of real estate, and study a lot of these objects,\" Levison said. After Lucy's launch, the spacecraft will return to fly by Earth on Oct. 16, 2022, and Dec. 13, 2024, to use the planet's gravity to slingshot farther from the sun. The probe will encounter its first extraterrestrial target on April 20, 2025, when it speeds by the 2.4-mile-wide (3.9-kilometer) asteroid Donaldjohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. \"Lucy is named after the human ancestor fossil because these objects really represent the fossils of planet formation, so in honor of that, we named this asteroid Donald Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy,\" Levison said. Lucy will fly by four objects in one of the Trojan swarms over a 15-month period from August 2027 through November 2028, then return back to Earth for another gravity assist flyby on Dec. 26, 2030, to bend the spacecraft's trajectory to aim for a binary pair of Trojan asteroids - named Patroclus and Menoetius - on March 2, 2033. \"This is a flyby mission,\" Levison said. \"We're going to just about everything that we can do during a flyby. We're going to look at surface geology, we're going to get colors, we're going to get compositions, we're going to be able to measure the mass of these objects as we fly by using the Doppler shift, and we're going to look for satellites and rings.\" Lucy's four major science instruments - largely based on hardware flown on previous interplanetary missions - will be mounted to an articulating platform at the top of the spacecraft, which stands around 15 feet (5 meters) tall and has two fan-shaped UltraFlex solar array wings built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, formerly known as Orbital ATK. Lucy's chemical propulsion system will be fueled by hydrazine for major in-space maneuvers. The spacecraft is expected to weigh no more than 3,163 pounds (1,435 kilograms) at launch, with fuel loaded, Levison said. NASA selected Lucy in 2017 from 28 proposals submitted by U.S. science teams as part of the Discovery line of cost-capped planetary probes, a program under which the agency's Mars Pathfinder rover, the Messenger mission to orbit Mercury, the Dawn spacecraft that visited Vesta and Ceres in the asteroid belt, and the InSight lander currently on Mars were developed, built and launched. In addition to Lucy, NASA selected the Psyche mission to explore a unique asteroid made almost entirely of iron-nickel metal. Psyche will launch in August 2022 and reach its destination in January 2026. The Lucy and Psyche missions costs to NASA are capped at $450 million each, excluding launch costs.", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/02/01/ula-wins-contract-to-launch-nasas-lucy-mission-to-visit-unexplored-asteroids/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy mission gets caught in a fight between rocket companies", "date": "2019-02-20", "content": "Building a spacecraft is about managing various forms of risk: the risk of hardware failure, software errors, design flaws, you name it. But the project managers of Lucy, an upcoming NASA mission to distant trojan asteroids, face a new type of risk: the risk that they could miss a launch window due to legal battles between rocket companies. On 31 January, NASA's Launch Services Program announced that it had awarded a contract to United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch Lucy into space. The company's Atlas V-401 rocket, the same configuration that launched MAVEN to Mars, was selected for a cost of $148 million. SpaceX, which had proposed its Falcon 9 rocket for the same purpose, filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 11 days later, triggering a formal review. In response, NASA issued a stop-work order to ULA while the contract is under review, which could take as long as 3 months. SpaceX justified its protest by saying that the company \"offered a solution with extraordinarily high confidence of mission success at a price dramatically lower than the award amount, so we believe the decision to pay vastly more [to ULA] for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers.\" People familiar with the Lucy project emphasized that mission planning continues despite the launch vehicle uncertainty. However, the uncertainty about which rocket they will use makes it difficult to optimize the spacecraft design to maximize its performance and minimize its fuel use. According to a GAO report on major NASA projects from 2018, Lucy has passed its preliminary design review and its team is working to finalize its design specifications ahead of entering the most complicated (and expensive) phase of the mission: the period where the hardware is built, integrated, and tested. Knowing the launch vehicle is an important part of mission planning at this stage. Lucy must be ready in time for a 20-day launch window that opens in October of 2021. If the GAO rules in favor of SpaceX, the most likely outcome is that the launch contract will be re-opened for bidding. The recompeting this process could take upwards of 6 months, which, combined with uncertain spacecraft integration requirements, could cause Lucy to miss its 2021 launch window. There is a backup launch opportunity in 2022, though this is not ideal. It is less energetically favorable (it requires more fuel) and it is less monetarily favorable (it adds another year of development costs). These additional development costs could end up costing NASA more than any savings enabled by SpaceX. Numbers are not forthcoming at this stage, but we can look to past examples of mission delays to get a rough sense of their cost. NASA's InSight mission infamously missed its 2016 launch window due to quality issues with a major scientific instrument. Like Lucy, InSight was a Discovery-class planetary mission. Its resulting 2-year delay added $154 million to the cost of the mission. It's reasonable, then, to assume that an additional year delay of Lucy would cost NASA in the neighborhood of $75 - $100 million. This additional cost to the mission would likely negate any savings provided by SpaceX's Falcon 9 (costs tend to be higher than SpaceX's published costs for the Falcon 9 due to additional launch service requirements for government payloads). While we don't know SpaceX's bid for Lucy, the Falcon 9 launch of the DSCOVR spacecraft cost the government $97 million in 2015 and its launch of the astrophysics mission TESS cost $87 million in 2017. In a statement to Space News, ULA emphasized its ability to stick to launch schedules, implying NASA's choice of the Atlas V over a Falcon 9 was driven by Lucy's narrow, 20-day launch window. SpaceX's argument is that their bid would save taxpayer dollars. But recompeting the contract could cause a launch delay, and ultimately cost NASA more in the long run.

That covered a contract NASA awarded Jan. 31 to ULA for the launch of Lucy, a mission slated for launch in October 2021 to visit several Trojan asteroids in the same orbit around the sun as Jupiter. SpaceX did not disclose the reason it withdrew the protest, and a company spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by SpaceNews about the withdrawal. According to GAO's website, SpaceX filed a separate protest over the same contract March 25, which was also withdrawn April 4. The company also declined to comment on the difference between the two protests. When it filed the protest in February, SpaceX argued it could perform the same mission for a \"dramatically lower\" price than the $148.3 million value of the ULA contract. \"We believe the decision to pay vastly more to Boeing and Lockheed for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers,\" a company spokesperson said then. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA said that it was selected in part because it offered schedule assurance for the mission. Lucy must launch during a 20-day window in October 2021 in order to carry out its complex trajectory of flybys of six Trojan asteroids and one in the main asteroid belt.

SpaceX's decision to withdraw the protest comes to a relief to many familiar with development of Lucy. They were concerned about potential additional costs to the mission and threats to its schedule if GAO upheld the protest and forced NASA to recompete the contract for the launch. That additional work, such as planning to be compatible with two different launch vehicles while the contract was recompeted, threatened to negate any launch vehicle savings. SpaceX, meanwhile, is moving ahead with preparations for its next launch, of the Arabsat-6A satellite on the second flight of the Falcon Heavy. The company said the launch was now scheduled for April 10 from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A after the rocket's three booster cores performed a static-fire test on the pad April 5. \"This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we're being extra cautious.

According to GAO's website, SpaceX filed a separate protest over the same contract March 25, which was also withdrawn April 4. The company also declined to comment on the difference between the two protests. When it filed the protest in February, SpaceX argued it could perform the same mission for a \"dramatically lower\" price than the $148.3 million value of the ULA contract. \"We believe the decision to pay vastly more to Boeing and Lockheed for the same mission was therefore not in the best interest of the agency or the American taxpayers,\" a company spokesperson said then. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA said that it was selected in part because it offered schedule assurance for the mission. Lucy must launch during a 20-day window in October 2021 in order to carry out its complex trajectory of flybys of six Trojan asteroids and one in the main asteroid belt. Should the launch miss that window, the mission cannot be flown as currently planned. \"This mission has a once-in-a-lifetime planetary launch window, and Atlas 5's world-leading schedule certainty, coupled with our reliability and performance provided the optimal vehicle for this mission,\" Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said in the January statement announcing the launch contract. SpaceX's decision to withdraw the protest comes to a relief to many familiar with development of Lucy. They were concerned about potential additional costs to the mission and threats to its schedule if GAO upheld the protest and forced NASA to recompete the contract for the launch. That additional work, such as planning to be compatible with two different launch vehicles while the contract was recompeted, threatened to negate any launch vehicle savings. SpaceX, meanwhile, is moving ahead with preparations for its next launch, of the Arabsat-6A satellite on the second flight of the Falcon Heavy. The company said the launch was now scheduled for April 10 from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A after the rocket's three booster cores performed a static-fire test on the pad April 5. \"This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we're being extra cautious.

Hal Levison, who is the mission's principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., is over the moon by this fact. He said that he is happy now the team is over the design phase and is currently working on the actual spacecraft. It is finally getting real, and taking shape. At the review there were many things that the board looked into. Among them were instrument payload, system-level test plans for flight hardware and software, systems engineering, mission assurance, the ground system. The mission is taking shape but is set to launch in 2021. It is two years from now, the team has enough time to create the spacecraft and prepare for the mission. It will be a 12 year journey and the spacecraft will study seven different Asteroids. These Trojan Asteroids orbit at the distance of Jupiter from the sun. Trojan Asteroids are specifically the Asteroids which share orbits. Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids share its orbits with the sun. The Lucy Mission will gather more information on the Asteroids, their composition, their path. Keith Noll, a Lucy project scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland said that the dedication of the team is commendable.

Set to launch in 2021, its 12-year journey of almost 4 billion miles will explore the Trojan asteroids, a population of ancient small bodies that share an orbit with Jupiter. This first-ever mission to the Trojans was already going to break records by visiting seven asteroids during a single mission. Now, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Lucy team discovered that the first Trojan target, Eurybates, has a satellite. This discovery provides an additional object for Lucy to study. \"If I had to bet that one of our destinations had a satellite, it would have been this one,\" said SwRI's Hal Levison, principal investigator of the mission. \"Eurybates is considered the largest remnant of a giant collision that occurred billions of years ago. Simulations show that asteroid collisions like the one that made Eurybates and its family often produce small satellites.\" This correlates with big Kuiper Belt objects thought to be cousins to the Trojans, which show evidence of both massive collisions and small satellites. \"At the Lucy science team meeting last November, my colleague Keith Noll pointed out a suspicious-looking spot next to an image of Eurybates. I quickly downloaded the next set of data and realised that the spot was still there, but it had moved, just like a satellite would,\" said Caltech's Mike Brown, a Lucy science team member. \"We asked for more HST time to confirm the existence of the satellite, and we were given three tries,\" said Noll, Goddard Spaceflight Center's project scientist for the mission. \"In the first two observations, we didn't see anything, so we began to think we might be unlucky. But on the third orbit, there it was!\" The small object was difficult to spot, in part, because Eurybates is 6,000 times brighter than its satellite. This implies that it's less than 1 km across, which, if correct, would make it among the smallest objects ever visited by a spacecraft. \"Before we believed that it was actually real, we had to make sure that a single satellite could actually fit all of the data,\" said SwRI's Cathy Olkin, deputy principal investigator of the Lucy mission. \"Using computer simulations, we demonstrated many possible satellite orbits that match both the observations where we can see the satellite, as well as the times when we don't.\" While the current data are enough to confirm the existence of the satellite, the Lucy team will collect more HST data later this year to better understand the object's orbit.

The findings were presented today at the EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2019 in Geneva by Dr Franck Marchis of the SETI Institute. Orus is the fifth object that Lucy will visit during a circuitous tour of seven different asteroids. The mission is due for launch in 2021 and will fly past Orus, which is part of a group of primitive bodies known as the Trojans, in 2028. On 7th September 2019, a team from the Unistellar citizen science project flew to Oman and successfully observed an event known as an occultation, in which Orus passed in front of a star, blocking its light for a few seconds. Measuring precisely the time that the star is hidden enables astronomers to estimate the diameter of the asteroid and other physical properties. This is the first time an Orus occultation has been observed successfully. Making multiple occultation measurements over the next few years will help the Lucy team to build up an accurate picture of Orus's shape and rotation. Marc Buie, an astronomer at Southwest Research Institute, provided the predicted path of the occultation using a combination of observations from the ESA space telescope Gaia, and ground-based facilities like PanSTARRS, as well as other robotic telescopes. A new occultation by Orus will be visible in Australia on 4th November of this year. \"Calculations based previous on our observations from Oman give a diameter of about 54.8 kilometres for Orus, which is in line with estimations. We don't yet know much about Orus, such as its shape and whether it possesses one or several satellites. The observation has proved that our predictions of the orbit of Orus are accurate and we can now plan a campaign to make multiple occultation observations,\" said Dr. Franck Marchis, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute and Unistellar's Chief Scientific Officer. The Lucy mission will be the first spacecraft to study Jupiter's Trojans - two loose groups of asteroids that orbit the Sun, with one group always ahead of Jupiter in its path, the other always behind. These primitive objects hold crucial information about the history of our Solar System. Because many uncertainties surround the targeted asteroids, NASA needs to understand their shape and trajectories, and therefore to improve the path of its $450 million spacecraft. Determining the shape and size of an asteroid will, for example, allow engineers to optimise the exploration schedule, and increase the science return generated by the mission. The SETI Institute is partnering with the Unistellar, the start-up behind the eVscope digital telescope, to develop a citizen astronomy programme in response to NASA's call to the astronomical community to contribute to its Lucy space mission. They plan to use a worldwide network of 2,500 eVscopes to observe occultations by Lucy targets to derive their size, shape, and determine the existence of companion asteroids. Oman was the most favourable spot on Earth from which to observe the occultation. \"Everything worked perfectly at our station located near Khalil. We were able to capture a light-curve full of valuable information and we have demonstrated that this is do-able with the eVscope prototype,\" said Dr Marchis. \"We hope to work with observers all over the world to support the Lucy mission.\" ", "url": "https://www.europlanet-society.org/citizen-science-starts-to-reveal-lucy-mission-target-orus/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy Mission Clears Critical Milestone", "date": "2019-10-21", "content": "NASA's Lucy mission successfully completed its Critical Design Review on Oct. 18.

But on the third orbit, there it was!\" The small object was difficult to spot, in part, because Eurybates is 6,000 times brighter than its satellite. This implies that it's less than 1 km across, which, if correct, would make it among the smallest objects ever visited by a spacecraft. \"Before we believed that it was actually real, we had to make sure that a single satellite could actually fit all of the data,\" said SwRI's Cathy Olkin, deputy principal investigator of the Lucy mission. \"Using computer simulations, we demonstrated many possible satellite orbits that match both the observations where we can see the satellite, as well as the times when we don't.\" While the current data are enough to confirm the existence of the satellite, the Lucy team will collect more HST data later this year to better understand the object's orbit.

Also known as Discovery 13, it is part of the Discovery Missions that aim to explore the Solar System. Now, NASA has discovered that one of the Trojan asteroids, that the spacecraft will be paying a visit to, has a small satellite. The team found that the Trojan asteroid Eurybates has a small satellite in stow. The discovery was made using images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. It was initially observed by the telescope in 2018 but was first noticed by a Lucy team member in November 2019. The additional observation opportunity won't affect the design or schedule of the mission. While Lucy is set to launch in 2021, it won't be until 2027 that the spacecraft performs the fly-by manoeuvre about the Trojan asteroid. The spacecraft will fly-by six asteroids, one asteroid in the main belt and six Trojan asteroids near Jupiter, over a period of 12 years. Trojan asteroids serve as a window in early days of the stellar space as they are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets of the Solar System. Orbiting the Sun in two stable orbits, these fossils of planetary formation are located inside and outside the Jupiter's orbit. The Lucy mission will help scientists understand the origins and the evolution of the solar system just like the first fossilized human ancestor it was named after shed light on the genesis of human beings.

NASA's next planetary mission, the Perseverance Mars rover, remains on schedule for liftoff July 17 from Cape Canaveral. NASA has assigned a high priority to the Perseverance rover, and agency is using government aircraft to shuttle workers between the Kennedy Space Center and the rover team's home base at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Perseverance rover mission, estimated to cost roughly $2.7 billion, is the first Mars rover NASA has launched to the Red Planet since 2011. The mission has a 20-day window to depart Earth in July or August, or else wait for the next alignment of Earth and Mars in 2022, a delay that NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said could cost $500 million. Although they haven't received the same top-priority classification as the Perseverance Mars rover, other planetary missions with launch windows in the next couple of years are progressing toward their launch dates. The Lucy mission, a robotic probe to study an unexplored population of asteroids, is on track for liftoff in October 2021. Lockheed Martin is set to begin assembling the spacecraft in August, and production of major components is well underway, according to Hal Levison, the Lucy mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. Like other major aerospace contractors, Lockheed Martin's spacecraft manufacturing facility near Denver is exempt from local and state stay-at-home orders. \"Aerospace is considered an essential industry,\" Levison said. \"Except at Goddard Space Flight Center, which is closed, all the work is getting done that needs to get done. People have gone to weird schedules. They'll have two schedules in a day, and they'll have half as many people there, and they're working in teams to handle and minimize the threat from the virus. But all the work is continuing to happen.\" NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is in charge of developing one of Lucy's science instruments, a color imager, but the space center is closed to all personnel, except employees required to protect life and critical infrastructure. While hands-on work continues on most of the Lucy spacecraft's components, all members of the science team are working remotely. \"Originally, the infrastructure of the telecommuting couldn't handle the transition, so there was a lot of frustration,\" Levison said in an interview with Spaceflight Now. \"There are psychological impacts. (That's) probably the worst aspect of it. You build very close relationships with your team members, and a lot of that comes from being in the same room with them. So not having that is a drag.\" Levison said Lucy's engineering team has largely cleared technical issues related to the Lucy spacecraft's fan-shaped UltraFlex solar arrays and propulsion system. \"Right now, we're in the process of building what we need to put it all together,\" Levison said. \"We've had our share of challenges. The solar arrays, which are huge, didn't scale up from the previous designs as well as we had hoped. So that has been a challenge for them. We've had some things happen with propulsion that were sort of self-inflicted.\" But those issues are largely behind the Lucy team, Levison said. The schedule has a couple of months of margin to meet Lucy's planned launch date of Oct. 16, 2021, on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket. \"So far, all the technical issues we've had are now solved,\" he said. \"So really, except for the virus, there's nothing between us and getting to the finish line on time. Our budget situation is actually really healthy ... So far, everything looks good.\" Lucy's UltraFlex solar arrays, made by Northrop Grumman, are bigger versions of the fan-shaped solar arrays flown on the Cygnus space stations supply ship. \"Scaling things up, it's much more complicated than the previous ones were,\" Levison said. \"So that was a challenge that they needed to take a step back and redesign, for example, the central hub. These solar arrays open like a Chinese fan, so getting all the wiring through the hub was a problem.\" The nearly $1 billion Lucy mission will be the first to visit a class of solar system objects known as the Trojan asteroids, which orbit in tandem with Jupiter, with groups ahead of and behind the giant planet in its path around the sun. Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids represent a diverse sample of the types of small planetary building blocks that populated the solar system after its formation 4.5 billion years ago. Lucy will fly by seven different asteroids from 2025 through 2033. If the mission misses its October 2021 launch window, there's a backup launch opportunity in October 2022, Levison said. Preparations for launch of the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission have also continued as scientists and managers work remotely. Technicians working on the JUICE spacecraft itself have largely kept pace with pre-coronavirus schedules, but some development delays related to the pandemic are likely inevitable, according to Giuseppe Sarri, ESA's JUICE project manager. In early April, the JUICE spacecraft chassis departed ArianeGroup's Orbital Propulsion Center in Lampoldshausen, Germany, where technicians integrated the probe's chemical propulsion system. Teams then delivered the JUICE spacecraft to an Airbus Defense and Space facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany, where JUICE's prime contractor will begin installing electronic units. \"Most of the industrial team is working in shifts,\" Sarri said in an interview with Spaceflight Now. \"The way they work is they have two shifts of six hours each, not overlapping.\" The two shifts help ensure technicians can meet physical distancing guidelines, with a limited number of people inside the manufacturing facility at one time. \"Therefore, this allows them to work,\" Sarri said. \"I'm not saying it's (entirely) nominal because there's some inefficiency in the transfer, but the activities that were on the critical path, they are still nominal.\" JUICE's primary launch window opens May 21, 2022, and extends until June 10 of that year. It will launch on an Ariane 5 ECA or Ariane 64 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. Assuming a launch in May or June 2022, JUICE will reach Jupiter in October 2029 and conduct a series of close flybys of three of Jupiter's icy moons - Callisto, Europa and Ganymede - before entering orbit around Ganymede itself in December 2032. With the final phase of JUICE's mission at Ganymede, the spacecraft will become the first in history to orbit around the moon of another planet. JUICE is the first European-led mission to the outer solar system. The mission's 10 remote sensing, geophysical and in situ instruments include a camera suite, spectrometers, a laser altimeter for topographic measurements, an ice-penetrating radar, and a package of plasma wave sensors, particle detectors, a magnetometer, and a payload to study the gravity field of Jupiter and its moons. Scientists want to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere and magnetosphere, and collect up-close data about Jupiter's three moons believed to harbor underground oceans of liquid water. In parallel with the spacecraft assembly work in Germany, teams around Europe and in the United States are building and testing JUICE's scientific instruments. \"There is a scientific institution which is in charge of each instrument, but most of the work is done by industry,\" Sarri said. \"That is the case for the Italian instrument, and the same for the two German instruments. So for those instruments, the industry is working in shifts. That's allowed to continue. \"It's more difficult for instruments where there is an institution like a university or a research center because they have less capability to organize in shifts, to work extended hours, etc. But I would say that they are almost all still working.\" Sarri said JUICE had around three months of schedule margin before the coronavirus pandemic hit. \"I would expect we will have to erode part of of our margin,\" Sarri said. \"I'm not positive, but I think that we will not eat up all the margin ... Of course, we will have less margin, which means that if we have other problems in the future we will be a bit less healthy in terms of margin.\" The next launch opportunity for JUICE is just three months later - in August and September 2022. But the backup launch window would put JUICE on a slower trajectory toward Jupiter. The three-month slip would result in a two-year delay in JUICE's arrival at the giant planet from 2029 to 2031. \"I'm very positive to launch in 2022, and I'm still reasonably optimistic to keep it in June 2022,\" Sarri said. \"It's clear that we are accumulating a delay, but it's not dramatic yet. It depends on how far the situation will go.\" Development of NASA's Psyche mission - scheduled for launch in July 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket - is also continuing, according to Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the mission's principal investigator from Arizona State University. Maxar, formerly known as Space Systems/Loral, is building the Psyche spacecraft in Palo Alto, California. Production of the chassis of the Psyche probe has started at Maxar, which completed the spacecraft's critical design review April 15. A mission-level critical design review is scheduled for next month to finalize and freeze the overall design. Assuming a launch in July 2022, the Psyche spacecraft will reach Mars in May 2023, where it will use the planet's gravity to slingshot into the asteroid belt. The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at asteroid Psyche in January 2026, then orbit the metallic world for 21 months. The asteroid is about the size of Massachusetts and has an irregular shape. It completes one rotation every 4.2 hours. Observations of Psyche through telescopes suggest the asteroid is composed largely of nickel-iron metal, suggesting the asteroid could be the leftover core from the building block of a planet, or planetesimal, in the early solar system more than 4 billion years ago. \"We're moving forward on all fronts, though some a little more slowly than before,\" Elkins-Tanton told Spaceflight Now. \"Truly, safety of the team comes first.\"", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/29/scientists-optimistic-planetary-probes-wont-face-coronavirus-related-launch-delays/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Scientists optimistic planetary probes won't face coronavirus launch delays", "date": "2020-04-29", "content": "Launches of interplanetary missions can only depart Earth when the positions of the planets are just right, and officials managing the development of probes set for launch in 2021 and 2022 to explore asteroids and Jupiter says construction milestones and reviews are proceeding to keep the projects on schedule despite the coronavirus pandemic.

Observations of Psyche through telescopes suggest the asteroid is composed largely of nickel-iron metal, suggesting the asteroid could be the leftover core from the building block of a planet, or planetesimal, in the early solar system more than 4 billion years ago. \"We're moving forward on all fronts, though some a little more slowly than before,\" Elkins-Tanton told Spaceflight Now. \"Truly, safety of the team comes first.\"", "url": "https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/29/scientists-optimistic-planetary-probes-wont-face-coronavirus-related-launch-delays/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy Mission Passes Critical Mission Milestone", "date": "2020-08-03", "content": "Last week marked the completion of a major milestone on the path to spacecraft assembly, test, and launch operations for NASA's Lucy mission. The Systems Integration Review ensured segments, components, and subsystems, scientific instrumentation, electrical and communication systems, and navigation systems are on schedule to be integrated into the system. It confirmed that facilities, support personnel, and plans and procedures are on schedule to support integration. The four-day meeting took place from July 27-30. On July 31, the standing review board briefed the team on the results. Due to Covid-19, the review occurred virtually. In order to keep the team safe during the pandemic, NASA and the partner institutions delayed construction on some of the instruments and components. The Lucy assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) team developed a new schedule to allow the team to reorder the assembly and testing timeline to give components and subsystems the flexibility they need and still get the spacecraft ready for an on-schedule launch in October 2021. \"No one anticipated that we would be building a spacecraft under these circumstances,\" said Lucy Principal Investigator, Hal Levison, \"but I once again have been impressed by this team's creativity and resiliency to overcome any challenge placed before them.\" Successful completion of this System Integration Review means that the project can proceed with assembling and testing the spacecraft in preparations for launch. The spacecraft is on track to begin ATLO next month at the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facilities in Littleton.

Ancient small bodies that share an orbit with Jupiter, it's thought that the Trojan asteroids could hold clues to understanding the early Solar System-and perhaps even give clues to the the origins of Earth's organic material. The mission, called \"Lucy,\" has just passed NASA's System Integration Review-albeit a virtual version, thanks to the pandemic-which means the spacecraft can now be built ready for launch next year. Here's everything you need to know about NASA's upcoming \"Lucy\" mission. Planning to launch in October 2021, Lucy-which is led by the Southwest Research Institute -will begin a 12-year mission to flyby six Jupiter Trojans, four of which are binary asteroids. As it does so its instruments will investigate, map and analyze the asteroids in an effort to tease-out their origins-and the formation of the Solar System. Lucy will also flyby an asteroid in the main Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. What are Trojan asteroids? Remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, Trojan asteroids share an orbit with Jupiter. There are two main groups; one ahead of Jupiter in its orbital path, the other behind. They're held in a Lagrange point stabilized by the Sun in something of a gravitational balancing act. When will the mission launch and how long will it last? Lucy will launch in October 2021, but after that it has a 12 -ear journey to reach its first target. Lucy will then have two close Earth flybys to get a gravity-assist push before encountering the Trojan asteroids. It will visit five in one of the Trojan groups, then in 2025 get another gravity assist from Earth to take it to the other group-via a small Main Belt asteroid-where it will visit one more Trojan asteroid in 2033. Lucy will then cycle between between the two Trojan clouds every six years. Why is it called 'Lucy'? The mission is named after a 3.2 million-year old fossil skeleton of a human ancestor, called Australopithecus Afarensis-and nicknamed Lucy-which was discovered in 1974 in Hadar, Ethiopia. It is thought that Lucy was more closely related than any other fossil to the genus Homo as a direct ancestor or a close relative of an unknown ancestor. NASA is hoping that its space mission will be similarly revolutionary in extending our understanding of the Solar System's origins. The asteroid that the NASA's spacecraft will visit in the Asteroid Belt has been named Donaldjohanson for Donald Johanson, the discoverer of the Lucy fossil. Who is building 'Lucy?' The spacecraft's construction will begin later this month at the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facilities in Littleton, Colorado. It will then be tested in preparation for launch. Goddard Spaceflight Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Arizona State University have developed a Lucy's cameras and mapping instruments, which Lockheed Martin will integrate into Lucy between now and February. \"It has been hard not being able to get together as a team and not being able to travel to see the instruments being built and tested,\" said Deputy Principal Investigator Dr. Cathy Olkin, also of SwRI. \"Still, the team really has surpassed themselves, keeping everyone safe while still carrying out the crucial operations needed to get the mission past this major milestone.\" Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.

And, thanks to a recent milestone permitting integration of the instruments and main vehicle, that's exactly what will happen next. \"Each phase of the mission is more exciting than the last,\" Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado and principal investigator for the Lucy mission, said in a statement. \"While, of course, Lucy still has several years and a few billion miles to go before we reach our real goal - exploring the never-before-seen Trojan asteroids - seeing this spacecraft come together is just incredible.\" While NASA has built plenty of asteroid missions before, the agency has never visited Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, which orbit the sun in two large clusters - one behind Jupiter and one ahead of it. Scientists hope that the mission will give them up-close looks at the main types of space rocks found in Jupiter's Trojan clusters, all of which likely hide water deep below their surface. And because Trojans formed around the same time as the solar system, they serve as individual fossils that could help scientists understand how our whole neighborhood formed. But first, Lucy needs to finish up its agenda here on Earth. By passing a standard NASA milestone dubbed Key Decision Point-D recently, Lucy engineers got the greenlight to assemble and test the spacecraft and its instruments, NASA announced on Aug. 28. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the spacecraft is on track to receive its instruments beginning in October, which will also see another procedural milestone called the Mission Operation Review. By July, NASA says, the spacecraft will be ready to head to Florida for last- minute launch preparations. Lucy's launch window opens on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will make its first asteroid flyby in April 2025. \"This team has been truly incredible,\" Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy's project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. \"Building a spacecraft is never easy, but seeing the team persevere through all of the challenges that they have encountered is inspiring.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-asteroid-mission-lucy-prepares-for-launch.html"}, {"title": "First Scientific Instrument Installed on NASA's Lucy Spacecraft", "date": "2020-11-03", "content": "Before the NASA Lucy mission can begin its long journey to the Trojan asteroids, the first scientific camera to be delivered to the spacecraft had to take a 1,500 mile journey across the continental United States.

I would like to thank the APL team for all their hard work getting the instrument to the spacecraft on time during the COVID19 pandemic.\" The Trojan asteroids are two groups of asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun. Scientists have evidence that these asteroids may have been scattered from all over the outer solar system early in the solar system's history, and have been trapped in these stable locations for over four billion years. No spacecraft has ever been to this population of small bodies, and Lucy will fly by seven of these Trojan asteroids, plus a main belt asteroid, allowing it to survey the diversity of this population in a single record-breaking mission. L'LORRI is the first scientific instrument to be installed on Lucy. L'LORRI is sometimes referred to as Lucy's \"eagle eyes\" because it has the highest spatial resolution of all of Lucy's cameras. This instrument, which is panchromatic (covering 0.35 to 0.85 microns), will produce black and white images that will provide the most detailed views of the surfaces of these never before seen bodies. \"L'LORRI is quite similar to its predecessor, the LORRI instrument that flew on New Horizons and sent back incredible images of the Pluto system and the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth,\" says Hal Weaver, lead of the instrument team at APL. \"I can't wait to see the images from this L'LORRI instrument and what they will teach us about the Trojan asteroids.\" In addition to L'LORRI, two more scientific instruments will be added to Lucy over the next few months. L'TES (the Lucy Thermal Emission Spectrometer), is being built at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. L'Ralph, which is being built at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland, is two instruments in one, a color visible imager (the Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera, MVIC) and an infrared imaging spectrometer (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, LEISA). Together, along with the Terminal Tracking cameras T2CAM and the High Gain Antenna, which will facilitate both communications and radio science, these instruments will reveal this never before explored population of asteroids in unprecedented detail. \"The L'LORRI Pre-Environmental Review was held back in early August and to see what this team has accomplished over the last several months, under a pandemic, is astonishing,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"I commend the L'LORRI team for their hard work, resiliency, and dedication.

The Systems Integration Review ensured segments, components, and subsystems, scientific instrumentation, electrical and communication systems, and navigation systems are on schedule to be integrated into the system. It confirmed that facilities, support personnel, and plans and procedures are on schedule to support integration. The four-day meeting took place from July 27-30. On July 31, the standing review board briefed the team on the results. Due to Covid-19, the review occurred virtually. In order to keep the team safe during the pandemic, NASA and the partner institutions delayed construction on some of the instruments and components. The Lucy assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) team developed a new schedule to allow the team to reorder the assembly and testing timeline to give components and subsystems the flexibility they need and still get the spacecraft ready for an on-schedule launch in October 2021. \"No one anticipated that we would be building a spacecraft under these circumstances,\" said Lucy Principal Investigator, Hal Levison, \"but I once again have been impressed by this team's creativity and resiliency to overcome any challenge placed before them.\" Successful completion of this System Integration Review means that the project can proceed with assembling and testing the spacecraft in preparations for launch. The spacecraft is on track to begin ATLO next month at the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facilities in Littleton. Another upcoming milestone is the Key Decision Point-D (KDP-D), which occurs after the project has completed a series of independent reviews that cover the technical health, schedule and cost of the project. Lucy's KDP-D is currently scheduled for late August of this year. Lucy will be the first space mission to study the Trojan asteroids, a population of small bodies orbiting the Sun \"leading\" and \"trailing\" Jupiter, at the same distance from the Sun as the gas giant. With flyby encounters past eight different asteroids - one in the Main Asteroid Belt and seven in the Trojan swarms, Lucy will be the first space mission in history to explore so many different destinations in independent orbits around our Sun.

Ancient small bodies that share an orbit with Jupiter, it's thought that the Trojan asteroids could hold clues to understanding the early Solar System-and perhaps even give clues to the the origins of Earth's organic material. The mission, called \"Lucy,\" has just passed NASA's System Integration Review-albeit a virtual version, thanks to the pandemic-which means the spacecraft can now be built ready for launch next year. Here's everything you need to know about NASA's upcoming \"Lucy\" mission. Planning to launch in October 2021, Lucy-which is led by the Southwest Research Institute -will begin a 12-year mission to flyby six Jupiter Trojans, four of which are binary asteroids. As it does so its instruments will investigate, map and analyze the asteroids in an effort to tease-out their origins-and the formation of the Solar System. Lucy will also flyby an asteroid in the main Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. What are Trojan asteroids? Remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, Trojan asteroids share an orbit with Jupiter. There are two main groups; one ahead of Jupiter in its orbital path, the other behind. They're held in a Lagrange point stabilized by the Sun in something of a gravitational balancing act. When will the mission launch and how long will it last? Lucy will launch in October 2021, but after that it has a 12 -ear journey to reach its first target. Lucy will then have two close Earth flybys to get a gravity-assist push before encountering the Trojan asteroids. It will visit five in one of the Trojan groups, then in 2025 get another gravity assist from Earth to take it to the other group-via a small Main Belt asteroid-where it will visit one more Trojan asteroid in 2033. Lucy will then cycle between between the two Trojan clouds every six years. Why is it called 'Lucy'? The mission is named after a 3.2 million-year old fossil skeleton of a human ancestor, called Australopithecus Afarensis-and nicknamed Lucy-which was discovered in 1974 in Hadar, Ethiopia. It is thought that Lucy was more closely related than any other fossil to the genus Homo as a direct ancestor or a close relative of an unknown ancestor. NASA is hoping that its space mission will be similarly revolutionary in extending our understanding of the Solar System's origins. The asteroid that the NASA's spacecraft will visit in the Asteroid Belt has been named Donaldjohanson for Donald Johanson, the discoverer of the Lucy fossil. Who is building 'Lucy?' The spacecraft's construction will begin later this month at the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facilities in Littleton, Colorado. It will then be tested in preparation for launch. Goddard Spaceflight Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Arizona State University have developed a Lucy's cameras and mapping instruments, which Lockheed Martin will integrate into Lucy between now and February. \"It has been hard not being able to get together as a team and not being able to travel to see the instruments being built and tested,\" said Deputy Principal Investigator Dr. Cathy Olkin, also of SwRI. \"Still, the team really has surpassed themselves, keeping everyone safe while still carrying out the crucial operations needed to get the mission past this major milestone.\" Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.

The milestone, known as Key Decision Point-D (KDP-D), represents the official transition from the mission's development stage to delivery of components, testing, assembly and integration leading to launch. During this part of the mission's life cycle, known as Phase D, the spacecraft bus (the structure that will carry the science instruments) is completed, the instruments are integrated into the spacecraft and tested, and the spacecraft is shipped to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for integration with the launch vehicle. \"Each phase of the mission is more exciting than the last,\" says Lucy Principal Investigator Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO. \"While, of course, Lucy still has several years and a few billion miles to go before we reach our real goal - exploring the never-before-seen Trojan asteroids - seeing this spacecraft come together is just incredible.\" Assembly, Testing and Launch Operations (ATLO) began on schedule last week at Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, despite many unforeseen challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic.

The spacecraft, which will be the first to explore the Trojan asteroids - a population of small bodies that share an orbit with Jupiter - is in the final stages of the assembly process. Just five months ago, at the beginning of the Assembly, Testing and Launch operations (ATLO) process, the components of the Lucy spacecraft were being built all over the country. Today, a nearly assembled spacecraft sits in the high bay in Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. \"A bit over a year and a half ago, I was excited to hold the first small pieces of metal that were destined to travel to the Trojan asteroids,\" says Hal Levison, principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"Now there is an actual spacecraft, nearly ready to go. It is incredible.\" The final instrument, L'Ralph, was built by NASA's Goddard Space Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was received at Lockheed Martin on January 21 and integrated on to the spacecraft on January 26. L'Ralph is the most complicated instrument that will fly on Lucy, as it is actually two instruments in one. The Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), will take visible light color images of the Trojan asteroids. The Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA), will collect infrared spectra of the asteroids. Both of these components will work together to allow Lucy to determine the composition of the Trojan asteroids and provide insight into the early history of our solar system. The L'Ralph instrument experienced significant COVID-19 related delays, particularly when construction had to be halted when Goddard was placed under stage 4 COVID restrictions in April of last year. However, both the L'Ralph team at Goddard and the ATLO team at Lockheed Martin rose to the challenge and developed a new schedule that allowed everyone to work safely while keeping the spacecraft on track for its originally planned October 16, 2021 launch. \"The L'Ralph team has done an outstanding job to deliver a fantastic instrument,\" says Dennis Reuter, L'Ralph instrument principal investigator, from Goddard. \"Doing what they did under normal conditions would have been remarkable. Doing it under the actual conditions that had to be dealt with is amazing.\" L'Ralph has been installed on Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform. This platform provides the spacecraft significant flexibility during the encounters---the instruments can point at the Trojan asteroids during the high-speed flybys while the high gain antenna remains pointed at Earth---as well as carrying out fine adjustments and out-of-plane pointing to get the best data possible on these elusive objects. Lucy's other two scientific instruments, L'TES and L'LORRI, designed and built at Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, respectively, as well as the two Terminal Tracking Cameras have already been installed on the platform. Now that L'Ralph is installed, the platform itself will be installed onto the spacecraft bus - making Lucy one step closer to ready for her 12-year-long journey to the Trojans. \"Lucy ATLO has been tremendously successful and having L'Ralph delivered and integrated onto the Instrument Pointing Platform is a great start to the new year,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, mission project manager from Goddard.

The Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (L'LORRI) traveled from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), in Laurel, Maryland, where it was built and tested, to Lockheed Martin Space, in Littleton, Colorado, where the spacecraft is being assembled. It was received safely at Lockheed Martin on October 25 and was successfully integrated onto the spacecraft on October 30. \"Lucy is an amazing spacecraft, but I'm always looking forward to the day when we start getting data from these never before seen fossils of the solar system,\" says Lucy principal investigator, Hal Levison. \"Now that we have installed the first scientific instrument, we are one step closer to that day. I would like to thank the APL team for all their hard work getting the instrument to the spacecraft on time during the COVID19 pandemic.\" The Trojan asteroids are two groups of asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun. Scientists have evidence that these asteroids may have been scattered from all over the outer solar system early in the solar system's history, and have been trapped in these stable locations for over four billion years. No spacecraft has ever been to this population of small bodies, and Lucy will fly by seven of these Trojan asteroids, plus a main belt asteroid, allowing it to survey the diversity of this population in a single record-breaking mission. L'LORRI is the first scientific instrument to be installed on Lucy. L'LORRI is sometimes referred to as Lucy's \"eagle eyes\" because it has the highest spatial resolution of all of Lucy's cameras. This instrument, which is panchromatic (covering 0.35 to 0.85 microns), will produce black and white images that will provide the most detailed views of the surfaces of these never before seen bodies. \"L'LORRI is quite similar to its predecessor, the LORRI instrument that flew on New Horizons and sent back incredible images of the Pluto system and the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth,\" says Hal Weaver, lead of the instrument team at APL. \"I can't wait to see the images from this L'LORRI instrument and what they will teach us about the Trojan asteroids.\" In addition to L'LORRI, two more scientific instruments will be added to Lucy over the next few months. L'TES (the Lucy Thermal Emission Spectrometer), is being built at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. L'Ralph, which is being built at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland, is two instruments in one, a color visible imager (the Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera, MVIC) and an infrared imaging spectrometer (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, LEISA). Together, along with the Terminal Tracking cameras T2CAM and the High Gain Antenna, which will facilitate both communications and radio science, these instruments will reveal this never before explored population of asteroids in unprecedented detail. \"The L'LORRI Pre-Environmental Review was held back in early August and to see what this team has accomplished over the last several months, under a pandemic, is astonishing,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"I commend the L'LORRI team for their hard work, resiliency, and dedication.

The mission takes its name from the fossilized human ancestor (called \"Lucy\" by her discoverers) whose skeleton provided unique insight into humanity's evolution. Likewise, the Lucy mission will revolutionize our knowledge of planetary origins and the birth of our solar system more than 4 billion years ago. L'TES, developed by a team at Arizona State University (ASU), is effectively a remote thermometer. It will measure the far infrared energy emitted by the Trojan asteroids as the Lucy spacecraft flies by an unprecedented seven of these objects during this first ever mission to this population. The instrument arrived at Lockheed Martin Space on December 13 and was successfully integrated on to the spacecraft on December 16. By measuring the Trojan asteroids' temperatures, L'TES will provide the team with important information on the material properties of the surfaces. As the spacecraft will not be able to touch down on the asteroids during these high speed encounters, this instrument will allow the team to infer whether the surface material is loose, like sand, or consolidated, like rocks. In addition, L'TES will collect spectral information using thermal infrared observations in the wavelength range from 4 to 50 micrometers. \"The L'TES team has used our experienced designing, manufacturing, and operating similar thermal emission spectrometers on other missions such as OSIRIS-REx and the Mars Global Surveyor as we built this instrument,\" said Instrument Principal Investigator, Phil Christensen. \"Each instrument has its own challenges, but based on our experience we expect L'TES to give us excellent data, as well as likely some surprises, about these enigmatic objects.\" Despite the challenges surrounding the COVID-19 pandemics, Lucy is on schedule to launch in October 2021 as originally planned. \"I am constantly impressed by the agility and flexibility of this team to handle any challenges set before them,\" said mission Principal Investigator, Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute. \"Just five years ago this mission was an idea on paper, and now we have many major components of the spacecraft and payload assembled, tested, and ready to go.\" In addition to L'TES, Lucy's High Gain Antenna, which will enable spacecraft communication with the Earth for navigation and data collection, as well as precise measurement of the masses of the Trojan asteroids, was recently installed.

Today, a nearly assembled spacecraft sits in the high bay in Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. \"A bit over a year and a half ago, I was excited to hold the first small pieces of metal that were destined to travel to the Trojan asteroids,\" says Hal Levison, principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"Now there is an actual spacecraft, nearly ready to go. It is incredible.\" The final instrument, L'Ralph, was built by NASA's Goddard Space Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was received at Lockheed Martin on January 21 and integrated on to the spacecraft on January 26. L'Ralph is the most complicated instrument that will fly on Lucy, as it is actually two instruments in one. The Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), will take visible light color images of the Trojan asteroids. The Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA), will collect infrared spectra of the asteroids. Both of these components will work together to allow Lucy to determine the composition of the Trojan asteroids and provide insight into the early history of our solar system. The L'Ralph instrument experienced significant COVID-19 related delays, particularly when construction had to be halted when Goddard was placed under stage 4 COVID restrictions in April of last year. However, both the L'Ralph team at Goddard and the ATLO team at Lockheed Martin rose to the challenge and developed a new schedule that allowed everyone to work safely while keeping the spacecraft on track for its originally planned October 16, 2021 launch. \"The L'Ralph team has done an outstanding job to deliver a fantastic instrument,\" says Dennis Reuter, L'Ralph instrument principal investigator, from Goddard. \"Doing what they did under normal conditions would have been remarkable. Doing it under the actual conditions that had to be dealt with is amazing.\" L'Ralph has been installed on Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform. This platform provides the spacecraft significant flexibility during the encounters---the instruments can point at the Trojan asteroids during the high-speed flybys while the high gain antenna remains pointed at Earth---as well as carrying out fine adjustments and out-of-plane pointing to get the best data possible on these elusive objects. Lucy's other two scientific instruments, L'TES and L'LORRI, designed and built at Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, respectively, as well as the two Terminal Tracking Cameras have already been installed on the platform. Now that L'Ralph is installed, the platform itself will be installed onto the spacecraft bus - making Lucy one step closer to ready for her 12-year-long journey to the Trojans. \"Lucy ATLO has been tremendously successful and having L'Ralph delivered and integrated onto the Instrument Pointing Platform is a great start to the new year,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, mission project manager from Goddard. Southwest Research Institute's Hal Levison and Cathy Olkin are the principal investigator and deputy principal investigator of the Lucy Mission. Goddard provides overall mission management, systems engineering and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space is building the spacecraft.

Despite the complexity of the flight and the spacecraft, the hard part of developing Lucy was the Covid-19 pandemic, said Richard Lipe, who oversees the Lucy program for Lockheed Martin Space. The team started putting instruments on the spacecraft body just as the shutdowns of spring 2020 arrived. Even so, they were able to keep the project on schedule in the ensuing months and avoid serious issues, Lipe said. \"It's pretty impressive.

Lucy will, at one point in the journey, be nearly six times more distant from the Sun than the earth. Its flight will provide Lucy only fleeting chances to gather images and data about the asteroids it passes. The distance creates a 45-minute delay in transmissions to and from the spacecraft, meaning real-time flying of Lucy is impossible and Lockheed Martin Space's development of capable software is key, Lipe said. \"It's absolutely critical this spacecraft fly and control itself,\" Lipe said. \"If something happens, the spacecraft has to take care of it on its own.\" The company put Lucy into a chamber and subjected it to the freezing temperatures of deep space, vibrations, and up to 150 decibels of sound simulating the stresses of launch.

Harold Levison, chief scientist at the Southwest Research Institute office in Boulder, conceived of Lucy and is principal investigator leading the research that's hoped to shed light on the formation of planets in our solar system by examining a rare type of asteroids, known as Trojans, that orbit in the same gravitational plane as Jupiter. Not much is known about the Trojans, and Levison hopes that studying them can tell scientists about material that made the planets in the inner part of the solar system, where the earth is found. NASA selected the Lucy mission in 2017 for one of its Discovery class projects, capped at $450 million in spacecraft and mission development cost. The Lucy spacecraft, launched atop a rocket made by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, will fly by four Trojan asteroids over 12 months starting in 2027. Then, after crossing the solar system, it's slated to reach the second swarm of Trojan asteroids in 2033. The flight path passes all the known types of Trojan-class asteroids. Lucy's first asteroid pass won't be of a Trojan asteroid, but of one from the inner asteroid belt, in 2025. That asteroid, fittingly, is 52246 donaldjahanson, an asteroid named after paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who discovered the primate fossil that became known as \"Lucy.\" ", "url": ""}, {"title": "Lucy spacecraft passes pre-shipment review, on track for October launch", "date": "2021-07-26", "content": "NASA and Lockheed Martin are another step closer to the launch of their Lucy Trojan Explorer mission, with the craft completing its pre-shipment review ahead of transportation to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida in August. Lucy will be the first mission of its kind, set to explore several asteroids in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The craft is targeted to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket no earlier than October 16, 2021 at 05:35 EDT from SLC-41. The Lucy interplanetary spacecraft is part of NASA's Discovery program. Originally proposed in May 2014, Lucy became a finalist in 2015 alongside Psyche, DAVINCI, VERITAS, and NEOCam. In January 2017, Lucy and Psyche were chosen as the 13th and 14th Discovery missions, respectively. DAVINCI and VERITAS were later selected in a follow-on Discovery program competition as the 15th and 16th missions in June 2021. NEOCam was also ultimately selected to fly by NASA in 2021 but not as part of the Discovery program. Soon after being selected, the Lucy team began finalizing the design of the spacecraft. In October 2018, NASA approved the preliminary design review and a year later also approved the critical design review. This allowed the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, to begin assembly and testing of the spacecraft. Lucy was built at the Lockheed Martin Waterton facility in Colorado, incorporating lessons learned from the prior builds of the New Horizons and OSIRIS- REx spacecrafts. The three science instruments Lucy will carry were derived from those two prior missions. Lucy's LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager is a high spatial resolution visible imager based on the LORRI instrument used on New Horizons. L'LORRI will provide highly detailed images of the Trojan asteroid surfaces. It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laborator y. Similarly, Lucy's Thermal Emission Spectrometer will detect radiation emitting from the Trojan asteroids. It is based on the OTES used on OSIRIS-REx and the EMIRS used on the Al-Amal Mars mission; it was built by Arizona State University. The third and final instrument is L'Ralph, which is made of two sub- instruments: the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera, a collar visible imager, and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, an infrared spectrometer. L'Ralph is based on the Ralph instrument flown on New Horizons and will be used to measure silicates, ice, and organics on the surface of the Trojan asteroids. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft will also use its radio telecommunications hardware and high- gain antenna to measure doppler shifts that will help determine the mass of the Trojans. Once fully fueled, Lucy will have a launch mass of 1,550 kg. The body of the spacecraft is 14.25 m in width and 7.2 m in height. The spacecraft will also use twin 7.3 m diameter circular solar arrays as part of its power system. A 2-meter diameter high gain antenna will be used to communicate with Earth. Lucy will also carry a special message. Known as the \"Lucy Plaque,\" this element of the mission will be used as a time capsule, carrying messages and diagrams. It will be similar to the \"Pioneer plaque\" used on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. Main assembly of Lucy was completed in February 2021, with teams then transitioning to thermal vacuum, vibration and shock, and electromagnetic testing. In April 2021, Lucy stretched its wings in a successful solar array deployment test. With those test complete, Lucy passed its pre-shipment review in July 2021 and is in processing for delivery to Cape Canaveral in August. Once at the launch site, it will undergo final testing and fueling before being placed in the Atlas V's 4.2-meter diameter payload fairing. Lucy will be launched from CCSFS SLC-41 on an Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V is United Launch Alliance's workhorse: a two-stage to orbit rocket consisting of an Atlas Common Core Booster powered by a single Russian RD-180 engine and the Centaur III upper stage powered by a single RL-10. Once in its fairing, Lucy will be placed on top of the Atlas V rocket. Launch is currently set for no earlier than October 16, 2021, the beginning of a 21-day launch window that ends on November 5. Following launch, Lucy will perform two gravity assist flybys of Earth in 2022 and 2024 to kick off its 12 year mission throughout the solar system. These flybys will put Lucy on the correct trajectory to intercept all seven of the asteroids it is expected to study. After completing the second Earth flyby, Lucy will be on the correct trajectory to flyby the first set of Trojan asteroids located at Jupiter's L4 Lagrange point. However, before performing its L4 asteroid flybys, Lucy will first flyby asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson. 52246 Donaldjohanson is a main-belt asteroid that's 4 km in diameter and located in the primary asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy will use 52246 Donaldjohanson as a rehearsal for its flybys of the Trojans - just as New Horizons used Jupiter as a practice target ahead of its eventual encounter with Pluto. Although it may be used as a rehearsal, 52246 Donaldjohanson will provide valuable data on the C-type asteroid, which has been identified as a fragment of a massive collision 130 million years ago which formed the Erigone family of asteroids that 52246 Donaldjohanson is a part of. Lucy is currently expected to flyby the asteroid on April 20, 2025. After performing the flyby, Lucy will coast through interplanetary space for two years before arriving at the L4 \"swarm\" of Trojan asteroids in 2027. The groups of asteroids located at Jupiter's Lagrange points are described as \"swarms\" due to each asteroid's close proximity to another. The L4 swarm is known as the \"Greek camp\" of Trojan asteroids due to most of the asteroids being named after Greek heroes in the Trojan war or from around the same time period. Once at the L4 swarm, Lucy will prepare for flybys of four Trojan asteroids. The first flyby, set to take place on August 12, 2027, will bring Lucy to asteroid 3548 Eurybates. Eurybates is 64 km in diameter and classified as a C-type asteroid. Like 52246 Donaldjohanson, Eurybates is part of a collisional family in the Greek camp. Eurybates also has a tiny, 1 km in diameter satellite named Queta which will be studied as well. Eurybates is an interesting target as it is a C-type asteroid, which are quite rare in the Trojan families while being common in the main belt. A little over a month after its flyby of Eurybates and Queta, Lucy will flyby asteroid 15094 Polymele. Polymele will be the smallest Trojan visited, at just 21 km in diameter. Like the final two Trojans Lucy will visit, Polymele is a P-type asteroid with a low albedo, a featureless reddish spectrum, possible organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, and possibly water ice in its interior. Lucy's flyby of Polymele will mark the first time a spacecraft has visited a P-type asteroid. Scientists currently believe Polymele may be a fragment of a collision between an object and a larger P-type asteroid. Lucy's flyby of Polymele is currently planned for September 15, 2027. The craft will then coast through the Greek camp L4 swarm Trojans for 7 months, culminating on April 18, 2028 with a flyby of asteroid 11341 Leucus - its 3rd L4 Trojan asteroid flyby. Leucus is a D-type asteroid that is 34 km in diameter. Scientists plan to compare Leucus to the other D-type asteroids Lucy will visit to understand what materials make up this class of dark red asteroids. Leucus itself is likely quite elongated in shape, as its brightness fluctuates when observed from Earth. Lucy may also provide answers to why Leucus rotates as slowly as it does - once every 19.4 days. The final asteroid in the L4 swarm to be visited by Lucy will be 21900 Orus, another D-type asteroid. Lucy is expected to pass the 51 km diameter asteroid on November 11, 2028, a little less than six months after its flyby of Leucus. At this point, Lucy will exit Jupiter's L4 point and begin a coast-phase toward Earth, performing a gravity-assist with the planet in December 2030 to send it on a trajectory to Jupiter's L5 point. When it arrives at the L5 Trojan swarm, known as the \"Trojan camp,\" in 2033, it will examine its final two Trojan asteroids in a single flyby. The binary pair 617 Patroclus and Menoetius orbit one another with a separation of 680 km. Patroclus is 113 km in diameter while Menoetius is slightly smaller at 104 km. Both Trojans are P-type asteroids, similar to the L4 Trojan Polymele, which Lucy will have visited 6 years earlier at this point. Scientists currently believe the two Trojans are primordial asteroids, leftover material from the formation of the solar system. Lucy is currently planned to flyby 617 Patroclus and Menoetius on March 2, 2033. At this point, the original mission will end. At the completion of Lucy's mission, the daring spacecraft will become the only mission in history to visit 8 different locations in a single mission.

Main assembly of Lucy was completed in February 2021, with teams then transitioning to thermal vacuum, vibration and shock, and electromagnetic testing. In April 2021, Lucy stretched its wings in a successful solar array deployment test. With those test complete, Lucy passed its pre-shipment review in July 2021 and is in processing for delivery to Cape Canaveral in August. Once at the launch site, it will undergo final testing and fueling before being placed in the Atlas V's 4.2-meter diameter payload fairing. Lucy will be launched from CCSFS SLC-41 on an Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V is United Launch Alliance's workhorse: a two-stage to orbit rocket consisting of an Atlas Common Core Booster powered by a single Russian RD-180 engine and the Centaur III upper stage powered by a single RL-10. Once in its fairing, Lucy will be placed on top of the Atlas V rocket. Launch is currently set for no earlier than October 16, 2021, the beginning of a 21-day launch window that ends on November 5. Following launch, Lucy will perform two gravity assist flybys of Earth in 2022 and 2024 to kick off its 12 year mission throughout the solar system. These flybys will put Lucy on the correct trajectory to intercept all seven of the asteroids it is expected to study. After completing the second Earth flyby, Lucy will be on the correct trajectory to flyby the first set of Trojan asteroids located at Jupiter's L4 Lagrange point. However, before performing its L4 asteroid flybys, Lucy will first flyby asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson. 52246 Donaldjohanson is a main-belt asteroid that's 4 km in diameter and located in the primary asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy will use 52246 Donaldjohanson as a rehearsal for its flybys of the Trojans - just as New Horizons used Jupiter as a practice target ahead of its eventual encounter with Pluto. Although it may be used as a rehearsal, 52246 Donaldjohanson will provide valuable data on the C-type asteroid, which has been identified as a fragment of a massive collision 130 million years ago which formed the Erigone family of asteroids that 52246 Donaldjohanson is a part of. Lucy is currently expected to flyby the asteroid on April 20, 2025. After performing the flyby, Lucy will coast through interplanetary space for two years before arriving at the L4 \"swarm\" of Trojan asteroids in 2027. The groups of asteroids located at Jupiter's Lagrange points are described as \"swarms\" due to each asteroid's close proximity to another. The L4 swarm is known as the \"Greek camp\" of Trojan asteroids due to most of the asteroids being named after Greek heroes in the Trojan war or from around the same time period. Once at the L4 swarm, Lucy will prepare for flybys of four Trojan asteroids. The first flyby, set to take place on August 12, 2027, will bring Lucy to asteroid 3548 Eurybates. Eurybates is 64 km in diameter and classified as a C-type asteroid. Like 52246 Donaldjohanson, Eurybates is part of a collisional family in the Greek camp. Eurybates also has a tiny, 1 km in diameter satellite named Queta which will be studied as well. Eurybates is an interesting target as it is a C-type asteroid, which are quite rare in the Trojan families while being common in the main belt. A little over a month after its flyby of Eurybates and Queta, Lucy will flyby asteroid 15094 Polymele. Polymele will be the smallest Trojan visited, at just 21 km in diameter. Like the final two Trojans Lucy will visit, Polymele is a P-type asteroid with a low albedo, a featureless reddish spectrum, possible organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, and possibly water ice in its interior. Lucy's flyby of Polymele will mark the first time a spacecraft has visited a P-type asteroid. Scientists currently believe Polymele may be a fragment of a collision between an object and a larger P-type asteroid. Lucy's flyby of Polymele is currently planned for September 15, 2027. The craft will then coast through the Greek camp L4 swarm Trojans for 7 months, culminating on April 18, 2028 with a flyby of asteroid 11341 Leucus - its 3rd L4 Trojan asteroid flyby. Leucus is a D-type asteroid that is 34 km in diameter. Scientists plan to compare Leucus to the other D-type asteroids Lucy will visit to understand what materials make up this class of dark red asteroids. Leucus itself is likely quite elongated in shape, as its brightness fluctuates when observed from Earth. Lucy may also provide answers to why Leucus rotates as slowly as it does - once every 19.4 days. The final asteroid in the L4 swarm to be visited by Lucy will be 21900 Orus, another D-type asteroid. Lucy is expected to pass the 51 km diameter asteroid on November 11, 2028, a little less than six months after its flyby of Leucus. At this point, Lucy will exit Jupiter's L4 point and begin a coast-phase toward Earth, performing a gravity-assist with the planet in December 2030 to send it on a trajectory to Jupiter's L5 point. When it arrives at the L5 Trojan swarm, known as the \"Trojan camp,\" in 2033, it will examine its final two Trojan asteroids in a single flyby. The binary pair 617 Patroclus and Menoetius orbit one another with a separation of 680 km. Patroclus is 113 km in diameter while Menoetius is slightly smaller at 104 km. Both Trojans are P-type asteroids, similar to the L4 Trojan Polymele, which Lucy will have visited 6 years earlier at this point. Scientists currently believe the two Trojans are primordial asteroids, leftover material from the formation of the solar system. Lucy is currently planned to flyby 617 Patroclus and Menoetius on March 2, 2033. At this point, the original mission will end. At the completion of Lucy's mission, the daring spacecraft will become the only mission in history to visit 8 different locations in a single mission.

Lucy will undergo final testing and fueling prior to being moved to its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. \"The coronavirus pandemic required us to re-engineer the way we conducted assembly, integration, and testing,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"When I think about where the project was a year ago and the challenges we faced, I couldn't be prouder of the entire team. The fact that the spacecraft is safely at KSC is a testament to the sacrifice and dedication shown by every member of the team and their families.\" The Lucy mission is the first space mission to explore a diverse population of small bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These small bodies are remnants of our early solar system, now trapped in stable orbits associated with the giant planet Jupiter, forming two \"swarms\" that lead in front of and trail behind Jupiter in its path around the Sun. These orbits are clustered around stable points of gravitational equilibrium known as Lagrange Points. Over its twelve-year primary mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids, flying by one main belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids. Lucy also incorporates three Earth-gravity assists to reach the Trojan swarms and accomplish these targeted encounters. The spacecraft was transported from Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the spacecraft in its Littleton, Colorado, facility. \"It takes a lot of coordination and careful planning to get this spacecraft to its launch site, and I'm very proud of the team who worked so tirelessly through a global pandemic to get us to this moment,\" said Rich Lipe, Lockheed Martin Lucy program manager. Over the weekend, the team transferred the spacecraft from its shipping container into the Astrotech cleanroom and performed post-ship inspections, confirming that Lucy arrived in good condition. The spacecraft is now ready to begin its final round of testing and pre-launch checks, which include software tests, instrument and powered functional tests, propulsion propellent load tests, telecommunication tests, and spacecraft self-tests. \"It is hard to believe that we are finally here after over seven years of hard work,\" says Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \"We would not have made it without an extremely talented and dedicated team.

Designed and built by Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado, the spacecraft made its way safely enclosed in a cargo container from Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado.

Lucy represents NASA's first mission to the swarm of asteroids known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These are a cluster of asteroids located on either side of Jupiter and along its same orbital path. The mission is expected to involve taking the spacecraft on two separate passes of Earth for gravity-assisted boosts: one in 2022 and another in 2024. From there, Lucy will begin its journey to seven separate asteroids in the Trojan swarm.

The journey, slated to launch Oct. 16, requires surviving the harsh radiation and brutal cold of space and three passes of the earth to get Lucy a speed boost from the planet's gravity. Despite the complexity of the flight and the spacecraft, the hard part of developing Lucy was the Covid-19 pandemic, said Richard Lipe, who oversees the Lucy program for Lockheed Martin Space. The team started putting instruments on the spacecraft body just as the shutdowns of spring 2020 arrived. Even so, they were able to keep the project on schedule in the ensuing months and avoid serious issues, Lipe said. \"It's pretty impressive. It gets me a little busted up to think about it,\" he said. \"I'm proud to be a program manager of Lucy.\" The assembly, test and launch crew broke into two teams that isolated from each other and split work time, Lipe said. If a Covid-19 infection arose in one team, the others could still work on Lucy. Lockheed Martin Space ran Lucy and its suite of three scientific instruments through exhaustive tests this spring readying it to be shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, late this summer. Inside Lucy is more than 8 miles of wiring and 364 connectors, Lipe said. A lot can go wrong building something so complicated, and Lucy has to last in the harsh environment of space through 2033. Lucy will, at one point in the journey, be nearly six times more distant from the Sun than the earth. Its flight will provide Lucy only fleeting chances to gather images and data about the asteroids it passes. The distance creates a 45-minute delay in transmissions to and from the spacecraft, meaning real-time flying of Lucy is impossible and Lockheed Martin Space's development of capable software is key, Lipe said. \"It's absolutely critical this spacecraft fly and control itself,\" Lipe said. \"If something happens, the spacecraft has to take care of it on its own.\" The company put Lucy into a chamber and subjected it to the freezing temperatures of deep space, vibrations, and up to 150 decibels of sound simulating the stresses of launch. The clean room and program work areas require people to don special suits, shoe covers and gloves. That added to Covid-19 protections and made for a safe-seeming environment to work in with a pandemic going on, but even so, the team figured out handling many spacecraft assembly and testing tasks while working remotely, said Cory Prykull, manager of the team assembling and testing Lucy. The company is reusing a shipping container that protected the space probe Cassini during its transport from testing from the headquarters campus to the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. Lucy will take that same journey from Jefferson County to Buckley Space Force Base for the military cargo plane flight in late summer, accompanied by Prykull the entire way. \"Once it's on a plane, it's real. We're almost there,\" he said. Harold Levison, chief scientist at the Southwest Research Institute office in Boulder, conceived of Lucy and is principal investigator leading the research that's hoped to shed light on the formation of planets in our solar system by examining a rare type of asteroids, known as Trojans, that orbit in the same gravitational plane as Jupiter. Not much is known about the Trojans, and Levison hopes that studying them can tell scientists about material that made the planets in the inner part of the solar system, where the earth is found. NASA selected the Lucy mission in 2017 for one of its Discovery class projects, capped at $450 million in spacecraft and mission development cost. The Lucy spacecraft, launched atop a rocket made by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, will fly by four Trojan asteroids over 12 months starting in 2027. Then, after crossing the solar system, it's slated to reach the second swarm of Trojan asteroids in 2033. The flight path passes all the known types of Trojan-class asteroids. Lucy's first asteroid pass won't be of a Trojan asteroid, but of one from the inner asteroid belt, in 2025. That asteroid, fittingly, is 52246 donaldjahanson, an asteroid named after paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who discovered the primate fossil that became known as \"Lucy.\" ", "url": ""}, {"title": "Lucy spacecraft passes pre-shipment review, on track for October launch", "date": "2021-07-26", "content": "NASA and Lockheed Martin are another step closer to the launch of their Lucy Trojan Explorer mission, with the craft completing its pre-shipment review ahead of transportation to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida in August. Lucy will be the first mission of its kind, set to explore several asteroids in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The craft is targeted to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket no earlier than October 16, 2021 at 05:35 EDT from SLC-41. The Lucy interplanetary spacecraft is part of NASA's Discovery program. Originally proposed in May 2014, Lucy became a finalist in 2015 alongside Psyche, DAVINCI, VERITAS, and NEOCam. In January 2017, Lucy and Psyche were chosen as the 13th and 14th Discovery missions, respectively. DAVINCI and VERITAS were later selected in a follow-on Discovery program competition as the 15th and 16th missions in June 2021. NEOCam was also ultimately selected to fly by NASA in 2021 but not as part of the Discovery program. Soon after being selected, the Lucy team began finalizing the design of the spacecraft. In October 2018, NASA approved the preliminary design review and a year later also approved the critical design review. This allowed the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, to begin assembly and testing of the spacecraft. Lucy was built at the Lockheed Martin Waterton facility in Colorado, incorporating lessons learned from the prior builds of the New Horizons and OSIRIS- REx spacecrafts. The three science instruments Lucy will carry were derived from those two prior missions. Lucy's LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager is a high spatial resolution visible imager based on the LORRI instrument used on New Horizons. L'LORRI will provide highly detailed images of the Trojan asteroid surfaces. It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laborator y. Similarly, Lucy's Thermal Emission Spectrometer will detect radiation emitting from the Trojan asteroids. It is based on the OTES used on OSIRIS-REx and the EMIRS used on the Al-Amal Mars mission; it was built by Arizona State University. The third and final instrument is L'Ralph, which is made of two sub- instruments: the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera, a collar visible imager, and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, an infrared spectrometer. L'Ralph is based on the Ralph instrument flown on New Horizons and will be used to measure silicates, ice, and organics on the surface of the Trojan asteroids. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft will also use its radio telecommunications hardware and high- gain antenna to measure doppler shifts that will help determine the mass of the Trojans. Once fully fueled, Lucy will have a launch mass of 1,550 kg. The body of the spacecraft is 14.25 m in width and 7.2 m in height. The spacecraft will also use twin 7.3 m diameter circular solar arrays as part of its power system. A 2-meter diameter high gain antenna will be used to communicate with Earth. Lucy will also carry a special message. Known as the \"Lucy Plaque,\" this element of the mission will be used as a time capsule, carrying messages and diagrams. It will be similar to the \"Pioneer plaque\" used on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft.

Named after characters in Greek mythology, these asteroids circle the Sun in two swarms, with one group leading ahead of Jupiter in its path, the other trailing behind it. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit these asteroids. By studying these asteroids up close, scientists hope to hone their theories on how our solar system's planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they ended up in their current configuration. \"With Lucy, we're going to eight never-before-seen asteroids in 12 years with a single spacecraft,\" said Tom Statler, Lucy project scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for discovery as we probe into our solar system's distant past.\" Following all pandemic protocols, Lucy team members have spent the past eight weeks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparing the spacecraft for flight. Engineers have tested the spacecraft's mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems and practiced executing the launch sequence from the mission operations centers at Kennedy and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. In early August, engineers installed the spacecraft's high-gain antenna, its second most prominent feature after the expansive solar arrays, which will allow the spacecraft to communicate with Earth. \"There has been a lot of hands-on work,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This summer has gone by so fast; it's hard to believe we're nearly at launch.\" On Sept. 18, propulsion engineers finished filling Lucy's fuel tanks with approximately 1,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine and liquid oxygen, which make up 40% of the mass of the spacecraft. The fuel will be used for precise maneuvers that will propel Lucy to its asteroid destinations on schedule, while the solar arrays - each the width of a school bus - will recharge the batteries that will power spacecraft instruments. The Lucy spacecraft will soon be packed into the two halves of the launch vehicle fairing, which will close around it like a clamshell. After the spacecraft is encapsulated, the Lucy team will be able to communicate with it electrically through an \"umbilical cord.\" \"Launching a spacecraft is almost like sending a child off to college - you've done what can for them to get them ready for that next big step on their own,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

A few days prior to launch, engineers will power up the Lucy spacecraft in preparation for the mission. This process will take about 20 minutes. \"The spacecraft will sit in launch configuration and the engineering team will continuously monitor its health and status to make sure Lucy is ready to go,\" said Jessica Lounsbury, the Lucy project systems engineer at Goddard. \"And then it's launch day.\" Lucy's first launch attempt is scheduled for 5:34 a.m. EDT on Oct. 16. That day, the team will be \"called to stations\" at 1 a.m., which is when everyone is expected to arrive at mission control and other stations to monitor the spacecraft and run through the full launch countdown procedures. If weather or any other issues prohibit a launch that day, the team will have additional launch opportunities beginning the following day. Lucy's principal investigator is based out of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of Southwest Research Institute, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Goddard provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft.

But Lucy appears to have encountered its first obstacle: One of the probe's two solar arrays, which are powering Lucy's exploration, may not properly be locked in place. \"Lucy's two solar arrays have deployed, and both are producing power and the battery is charging,\" NASA said Sunday in a blog post. \"While one of the arrays has latched, indications are that the second array may not be fully latched.\" \"In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety. The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate director for science, tweeted Sunday that he's confident the array issue will be solved. \"NASA's Lucy mission is safe and stable,\" he said. \"The two solar arrays have deployed, but one may not be fully latched. The team is analyzing data to determine next steps. This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well.\" The two solar arrays were folded when Lucy launched and were designed to unfurl like Chinese fans once the spacecraft reached space. The arrays were expected to take 20 minutes to fully unfurl, which the mission's principal investigator said would \"determine if the rest of the 12-year mission will be a success.\" The solar panels were successfully deployed 91 minutes after launch. Now it's just a matter of getting the second one to latch properly. CNET reached out to the Lucy team for confirmation on how the unlatched arrays might affect performance and how the issue may be rectified but didn't immediately hear back. Lucy's ultimate goal is to explore a set of asteroids that travel in Jupiter's orbit and have never been studied up close before. These Trojan asteroids move as huge swarms, or camps, at the Lagrangian points in Jupiter's orbit. Lagrangian points are regions where the push and pull of gravity from both Jupiter and the sun lock the camps in place, leading and trailing Jupiter in its journey around the sun in perpetuity. The collection of amorphous space rocks is like a series of cosmic fossils, providing a window into the earliest era of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Lucy will act as a cosmic paleontologist, flying past eight \"fossils\" at a distance and studying their surfaces with infrared imagers and cameras.

The Lucy team is evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the solar array in its current state. Any attempt to safely redeploy the array would occur no earlier than Nov. 16. This spacecraft is designed to travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft. The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter holds the current record, but Lucy will be farther when it flies through the Trojan asteroids. Other far-flung predecessors have relied on nuclear power. The spacecraft's two solar arrays were too big to be opened simultaneously on Earth; the testing facility couldn't accommodate the wingspan. So Lucy's team opened one solar array, closed it, moved the spacecraft and then opened the other solar array. The spacecraft never attempted to open them at the same time before reaching microgravity. These solar arrays should generate 18,000 watts of power when the spacecraft is near Earth. Katie Oakman, Lucy's structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, said that's enough to power her house and a couple of her neighbors. Near the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's two solar arrays would generate just 500 watts of power. This would turn on a few lights in the living room but not power the microwave. Yet it's sufficient for Lucy's science instruments that will need 82 watts of power when flying by the asteroids.

Unfortunately, a day after a successful launch, Lucy had problems. NASA named the craft Lucy in honor of the famous fossilized human ancestor. The mission's primary focus is to better better understand the solar system's formation by studying Trojan asteroids. NASA has experience with ambitious projects that require expensive technology and missions that do not always go as planned. For example, when the Hubble telescope was launched, astronauts had to fly to it and fix its defective mirrors. Recently, NASA has had its share of failures on Mars. NASA admitted defeat on its Insight Lander-a probe that could not penetrate the Red Planet's rocky surface. Three days after the launch of Lucy, NASA announced that only one of the solar arrays had fully deployed, while the other one only partially deployed. Lucy was settling into an Earth- orbiting cruise speed while top NASA experts tried to figure out how to solve the problem. The 12-year mission is possible thanks to Lucy's unique large solar panels-folded like origami to fit into the rocket payload carrier. The large solar panels are designed to harness enough energy for the craft as it moves further away from the sun. Without power, a spacecraft is good as dead. The latest NASA communications show that experts may be leaning towards their usual style of rolling with the problem due to the impossibilities of fixing it. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing,\" NASA said. So while engineers are looking into the data to understand what went wrong, they are also making calculations to figure out if Lucy will be able to do all the things it is supposed to do in the darker areas of the solar system. NASA admitted that they still cannot respond to whether the solar array malfunction will have long-term implications for the mission. Fortunately, other programmed tasks like thruster maneuvering and autonomous navigation configurations worked as planned. So it is more than likely that with or without a fully deployed solar array, Lucy will be directed to continue its journey to the swarms of Trojan asteroids. Scientists believe that these asteroids are remnants of the same material that formed giant planets and see them as \"fossilized space objects\" that hold the keys to understanding the solar system's evolution.

Shortly after Lucy's Oct. 16 liftoff, mission team members determined that one of the spacecraft's two huge solar arrays had not fully deployed. Lucy's handlers have been working hard on the problem, but it remains unsolved at present. \"Analysis indicates that the array is between 75% and 95% deployed. It is currently being held in place by a lanyard, specifically designed to help unfurl the arrays during deployment,\" NASA officials wrote in an update on Wednesday afternoon. \"An anomaly response team continues to work on establishing what caused the solar array to not fully deploy,\" NASA officials added. \"NASA and SwRI are evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the array in its current state. Any attempt to safely redeploy the array would occur no earlier than Nov. 16.\" SwRI is the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, the home base for Lucy's principal investigator, Hal Levison. Aside from the solar-array problem, Lucy and its systems are in good shape, NASA officials said. The spacecraft continues to check off milestones and has performed several small maneuvers as planned. It's currently in cruise mode, \"which is the standard flight mode for outbound flight and allows for substantial autonomy for the spacecraft,\" NASA officials wrote in the update. Another big milestone is scheduled for Friday. On that day, the Lucy team plans to point the spacecraft toward Earth, so they can prepare to start checking out its scientific instruments, NASA officials wrote today. Lucy is embarked on a long and ambitious deep-space trek that will see it fly by eight different asteroids between 2025 and 2033. Seven of those space rocks are Trojans, little-studied asteroids that zoom around the sun in Jupiter's orbit, but ahead of or behind the giant planet. The eighth resides in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Sunlight is about 25 times weaker in the realm of the Trojans than the flow we experience here on Earth, so Lucy needs huge solar arrays to soak it up. Each of its two panels is 23.9 feet wide when fully deployed. Lucy will visit more asteroids than any other spacecraft, if all goes according to plan. And it will set another record as well: No solar-powered spacecraft has ever operated as far from the sun as Lucy aims to, although NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe comes close.

The journey, slated to launch Oct. 16, requires surviving the harsh radiation and brutal cold of space and three passes of the earth to get Lucy a speed boost from the planet's gravity. Despite the complexity of the flight and the spacecraft, the hard part of developing Lucy was the Covid-19 pandemic, said Richard Lipe, who oversees the Lucy program for Lockheed Martin Space. The team started putting instruments on the spacecraft body just as the shutdowns of spring 2020 arrived. Even so, they were able to keep the project on schedule in the ensuing months and avoid serious issues, Lipe said. \"It's pretty impressive. It gets me a little busted up to think about it,\" he said. \"I'm proud to be a program manager of Lucy.\" The assembly, test and launch crew broke into two teams that isolated from each other and split work time, Lipe said. If a Covid-19 infection arose in one team, the others could still work on Lucy. Lockheed Martin Space ran Lucy and its suite of three scientific instruments through exhaustive tests this spring readying it to be shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, late this summer. Inside Lucy is more than 8 miles of wiring and 364 connectors, Lipe said. A lot can go wrong building something so complicated, and Lucy has to last in the harsh environment of space through 2033. Lucy will, at one point in the journey, be nearly six times more distant from the Sun than the earth. Its flight will provide Lucy only fleeting chances to gather images and data about the asteroids it passes. The distance creates a 45-minute delay in transmissions to and from the spacecraft, meaning real-time flying of Lucy is impossible and Lockheed Martin Space's development of capable software is key, Lipe said. \"It's absolutely critical this spacecraft fly and control itself,\" Lipe said. \"If something happens, the spacecraft has to take care of it on its own.\" The company put Lucy into a chamber and subjected it to the freezing temperatures of deep space, vibrations, and up to 150 decibels of sound simulating the stresses of launch. The clean room and program work areas require people to don special suits, shoe covers and gloves. That added to Covid-19 protections and made for a safe-seeming environment to work in with a pandemic going on, but even so, the team figured out handling many spacecraft assembly and testing tasks while working remotely, said Cory Prykull, manager of the team assembling and testing Lucy. The company is reusing a shipping container that protected the space probe Cassini during its transport from testing from the headquarters campus to the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. Lucy will take that same journey from Jefferson County to Buckley Space Force Base for the military cargo plane flight in late summer, accompanied by Prykull the entire way. \"Once it's on a plane, it's real. We're almost there,\" he said. Harold Levison, chief scientist at the Southwest Research Institute office in Boulder, conceived of Lucy and is principal investigator leading the research that's hoped to shed light on the formation of planets in our solar system by examining a rare type of asteroids, known as Trojans, that orbit in the same gravitational plane as Jupiter. Not much is known about the Trojans, and Levison hopes that studying them can tell scientists about material that made the planets in the inner part of the solar system, where the earth is found. NASA selected the Lucy mission in 2017 for one of its Discovery class projects, capped at $450 million in spacecraft and mission development cost. The Lucy spacecraft, launched atop a rocket made by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, will fly by four Trojan asteroids over 12 months starting in 2027. Then, after crossing the solar system, it's slated to reach the second swarm of Trojan asteroids in 2033. The flight path passes all the known types of Trojan-class asteroids. Lucy's first asteroid pass won't be of a Trojan asteroid, but of one from the inner asteroid belt, in 2025. That asteroid, fittingly, is 52246 donaldjahanson, an asteroid named after paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who discovered the primate fossil that became known as \"Lucy.\" ", "url": ""}, {"title": "Lucy spacecraft passes pre-shipment review, on track for October launch", "date": "2021-07-26", "content": "NASA and Lockheed Martin are another step closer to the launch of their Lucy Trojan Explorer mission, with the craft completing its pre-shipment review ahead of transportation to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida in August. Lucy will be the first mission of its kind, set to explore several asteroids in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The craft is targeted to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket no earlier than October 16, 2021 at 05:35 EDT from SLC-41. The Lucy interplanetary spacecraft is part of NASA's Discovery program. Originally proposed in May 2014, Lucy became a finalist in 2015 alongside Psyche, DAVINCI, VERITAS, and NEOCam. In January 2017, Lucy and Psyche were chosen as the 13th and 14th Discovery missions, respectively. DAVINCI and VERITAS were later selected in a follow-on Discovery program competition as the 15th and 16th missions in June 2021. NEOCam was also ultimately selected to fly by NASA in 2021 but not as part of the Discovery program. Soon after being selected, the Lucy team began finalizing the design of the spacecraft. In October 2018, NASA approved the preliminary design review and a year later also approved the critical design review. This allowed the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, to begin assembly and testing of the spacecraft. Lucy was built at the Lockheed Martin Waterton facility in Colorado, incorporating lessons learned from the prior builds of the New Horizons and OSIRIS- REx spacecrafts. The three science instruments Lucy will carry were derived from those two prior missions. Lucy's LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager is a high spatial resolution visible imager based on the LORRI instrument used on New Horizons. L'LORRI will provide highly detailed images of the Trojan asteroid surfaces. It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laborator y. Similarly, Lucy's Thermal Emission Spectrometer will detect radiation emitting from the Trojan asteroids. It is based on the OTES used on OSIRIS-REx and the EMIRS used on the Al-Amal Mars mission; it was built by Arizona State University. The third and final instrument is L'Ralph, which is made of two sub- instruments: the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera, a collar visible imager, and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, an infrared spectrometer. L'Ralph is based on the Ralph instrument flown on New Horizons and will be used to measure silicates, ice, and organics on the surface of the Trojan asteroids. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft will also use its radio telecommunications hardware and high- gain antenna to measure doppler shifts that will help determine the mass of the Trojans. Once fully fueled, Lucy will have a launch mass of 1,550 kg. The body of the spacecraft is 14.25 m in width and 7.2 m in height. The spacecraft will also use twin 7.3 m diameter circular solar arrays as part of its power system. A 2-meter diameter high gain antenna will be used to communicate with Earth. Lucy will also carry a special message. Known as the \"Lucy Plaque,\" this element of the mission will be used as a time capsule, carrying messages and diagrams. It will be similar to the \"Pioneer plaque\" used on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. Main assembly of Lucy was completed in February 2021, with teams then transitioning to thermal vacuum, vibration and shock, and electromagnetic testing. In April 2021, Lucy stretched its wings in a successful solar array deployment test. With those test complete, Lucy passed its pre-shipment review in July 2021 and is in processing for delivery to Cape Canaveral in August. Once at the launch site, it will undergo final testing and fueling before being placed in the Atlas V's 4.2-meter diameter payload fairing. Lucy will be launched from CCSFS SLC-41 on an Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V is United Launch Alliance's workhorse: a two-stage to orbit rocket consisting of an Atlas Common Core Booster powered by a single Russian RD-180 engine and the Centaur III upper stage powered by a single RL-10. Once in its fairing, Lucy will be placed on top of the Atlas V rocket. Launch is currently set for no earlier than October 16, 2021, the beginning of a 21-day launch window that ends on November 5. Following launch, Lucy will perform two gravity assist flybys of Earth in 2022 and 2024 to kick off its 12 year mission throughout the solar system. These flybys will put Lucy on the correct trajectory to intercept all seven of the asteroids it is expected to study. After completing the second Earth flyby, Lucy will be on the correct trajectory to flyby the first set of Trojan asteroids located at Jupiter's L4 Lagrange point. However, before performing its L4 asteroid flybys, Lucy will first flyby asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson. 52246 Donaldjohanson is a main-belt asteroid that's 4 km in diameter and located in the primary asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy will use 52246 Donaldjohanson as a rehearsal for its flybys of the Trojans - just as New Horizons used Jupiter as a practice target ahead of its eventual encounter with Pluto. Although it may be used as a rehearsal, 52246 Donaldjohanson will provide valuable data on the C-type asteroid, which has been identified as a fragment of a massive collision 130 million years ago which formed the Erigone family of asteroids that 52246 Donaldjohanson is a part of. Lucy is currently expected to flyby the asteroid on April 20, 2025. After performing the flyby, Lucy will coast through interplanetary space for two years before arriving at the L4 \"swarm\" of Trojan asteroids in 2027. The groups of asteroids located at Jupiter's Lagrange points are described as \"swarms\" due to each asteroid's close proximity to another. The L4 swarm is known as the \"Greek camp\" of Trojan asteroids due to most of the asteroids being named after Greek heroes in the Trojan war or from around the same time period. Once at the L4 swarm, Lucy will prepare for flybys of four Trojan asteroids. The first flyby, set to take place on August 12, 2027, will bring Lucy to asteroid 3548 Eurybates. Eurybates is 64 km in diameter and classified as a C-type asteroid. Like 52246 Donaldjohanson, Eurybates is part of a collisional family in the Greek camp. Eurybates also has a tiny, 1 km in diameter satellite named Queta which will be studied as well. Eurybates is an interesting target as it is a C-type asteroid, which are quite rare in the Trojan families while being common in the main belt. A little over a month after its flyby of Eurybates and Queta, Lucy will flyby asteroid 15094 Polymele. Polymele will be the smallest Trojan visited, at just 21 km in diameter. Like the final two Trojans Lucy will visit, Polymele is a P-type asteroid with a low albedo, a featureless reddish spectrum, possible organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, and possibly water ice in its interior. Lucy's flyby of Polymele will mark the first time a spacecraft has visited a P-type asteroid. Scientists currently believe Polymele may be a fragment of a collision between an object and a larger P-type asteroid. Lucy's flyby of Polymele is currently planned for September 15, 2027. The craft will then coast through the Greek camp L4 swarm Trojans for 7 months, culminating on April 18, 2028 with a flyby of asteroid 11341 Leucus - its 3rd L4 Trojan asteroid flyby. Leucus is a D-type asteroid that is 34 km in diameter. Scientists plan to compare Leucus to the other D-type asteroids Lucy will visit to understand what materials make up this class of dark red asteroids. Leucus itself is likely quite elongated in shape, as its brightness fluctuates when observed from Earth. Lucy may also provide answers to why Leucus rotates as slowly as it does - once every 19.4 days. The final asteroid in the L4 swarm to be visited by Lucy will be 21900 Orus, another D-type asteroid. Lucy is expected to pass the 51 km diameter asteroid on November 11, 2028, a little less than six months after its flyby of Leucus. At this point, Lucy will exit Jupiter's L4 point and begin a coast-phase toward Earth, performing a gravity-assist with the planet in December 2030 to send it on a trajectory to Jupiter's L5 point. When it arrives at the L5 Trojan swarm, known as the \"Trojan camp,\" in 2033, it will examine its final two Trojan asteroids in a single flyby. The binary pair 617 Patroclus and Menoetius orbit one another with a separation of 680 km. Patroclus is 113 km in diameter while Menoetius is slightly smaller at 104 km. Both Trojans are P-type asteroids, similar to the L4 Trojan Polymele, which Lucy will have visited 6 years earlier at this point. Scientists currently believe the two Trojans are primordial asteroids, leftover material from the formation of the solar system. Lucy is currently planned to flyby 617 Patroclus and Menoetius on March 2, 2033. At this point, the original mission will end. At the completion of Lucy's mission, the daring spacecraft will become the only mission in history to visit 8 different locations in a single mission.

These orbits are clustered around stable points of gravitational equilibrium known as Lagrange Points. Over its twelve-year primary mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids, flying by one main belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids. Lucy also incorporates three Earth-gravity assists to reach the Trojan swarms and accomplish these targeted encounters.

Named after characters in Greek mythology, these asteroids circle the Sun in two swarms, with one group leading ahead of Jupiter in its path, the other trailing behind it. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit these asteroids. By studying these asteroids up close, scientists hope to hone their theories on how our solar system's planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they ended up in their current configuration. \"With Lucy, we're going to eight never-before-seen asteroids in 12 years with a single spacecraft,\" said Tom Statler, Lucy project scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for discovery as we probe into our solar system's distant past.\" Following all pandemic protocols, Lucy team members have spent the past eight weeks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparing the spacecraft for flight. Engineers have tested the spacecraft's mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems and practiced executing the launch sequence from the mission operations centers at Kennedy and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. In early August, engineers installed the spacecraft's high-gain antenna, its second most prominent feature after the expansive solar arrays, which will allow the spacecraft to communicate with Earth. \"There has been a lot of hands-on work,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This summer has gone by so fast; it's hard to believe we're nearly at launch.\" On Sept. 18, propulsion engineers finished filling Lucy's fuel tanks with approximately 1,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine and liquid oxygen, which make up 40% of the mass of the spacecraft. The fuel will be used for precise maneuvers that will propel Lucy to its asteroid destinations on schedule, while the solar arrays - each the width of a school bus - will recharge the batteries that will power spacecraft instruments. The Lucy spacecraft will soon be packed into the two halves of the launch vehicle fairing, which will close around it like a clamshell. After the spacecraft is encapsulated, the Lucy team will be able to communicate with it electrically through an \"umbilical cord.\" \"Launching a spacecraft is almost like sending a child off to college - you've done what can for them to get them ready for that next big step on their own,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

But Lucy appears to have encountered its first obstacle: One of the probe's two solar arrays, which are powering Lucy's exploration, may not properly be locked in place. \"Lucy's two solar arrays have deployed, and both are producing power and the battery is charging,\" NASA said Sunday in a blog post. \"While one of the arrays has latched, indications are that the second array may not be fully latched.\" \"In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety. The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate director for science, tweeted Sunday that he's confident the array issue will be solved. \"NASA's Lucy mission is safe and stable,\" he said. \"The two solar arrays have deployed, but one may not be fully latched. The team is analyzing data to determine next steps. This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well.\" The two solar arrays were folded when Lucy launched and were designed to unfurl like Chinese fans once the spacecraft reached space. The arrays were expected to take 20 minutes to fully unfurl, which the mission's principal investigator said would \"determine if the rest of the 12-year mission will be a success.\" The solar panels were successfully deployed 91 minutes after launch. Now it's just a matter of getting the second one to latch properly. CNET reached out to the Lucy team for confirmation on how the unlatched arrays might affect performance and how the issue may be rectified but didn't immediately hear back. Lucy's ultimate goal is to explore a set of asteroids that travel in Jupiter's orbit and have never been studied up close before. These Trojan asteroids move as huge swarms, or camps, at the Lagrangian points in Jupiter's orbit. Lagrangian points are regions where the push and pull of gravity from both Jupiter and the sun lock the camps in place, leading and trailing Jupiter in its journey around the sun in perpetuity. The collection of amorphous space rocks is like a series of cosmic fossils, providing a window into the earliest era of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Lucy will act as a cosmic paleontologist, flying past eight \"fossils\" at a distance and studying their surfaces with infrared imagers and cameras.

The Lucy team is evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the solar array in its current state. Any attempt to safely redeploy the array would occur no earlier than Nov. 16. This spacecraft is designed to travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft. The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter holds the current record, but Lucy will be farther when it flies through the Trojan asteroids. Other far-flung predecessors have relied on nuclear power. The spacecraft's two solar arrays were too big to be opened simultaneously on Earth; the testing facility couldn't accommodate the wingspan. So Lucy's team opened one solar array, closed it, moved the spacecraft and then opened the other solar array. The spacecraft never attempted to open them at the same time before reaching microgravity. These solar arrays should generate 18,000 watts of power when the spacecraft is near Earth. Katie Oakman, Lucy's structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, said that's enough to power her house and a couple of her neighbors. Near the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's two solar arrays would generate just 500 watts of power. This would turn on a few lights in the living room but not power the microwave. Yet it's sufficient for Lucy's science instruments that will need 82 watts of power when flying by the asteroids.

Unfortunately, a day after a successful launch, Lucy had problems. NASA named the craft Lucy in honor of the famous fossilized human ancestor. The mission's primary focus is to better better understand the solar system's formation by studying Trojan asteroids. NASA has experience with ambitious projects that require expensive technology and missions that do not always go as planned. For example, when the Hubble telescope was launched, astronauts had to fly to it and fix its defective mirrors. Recently, NASA has had its share of failures on Mars. NASA admitted defeat on its Insight Lander-a probe that could not penetrate the Red Planet's rocky surface. Three days after the launch of Lucy, NASA announced that only one of the solar arrays had fully deployed, while the other one only partially deployed. Lucy was settling into an Earth- orbiting cruise speed while top NASA experts tried to figure out how to solve the problem. The 12-year mission is possible thanks to Lucy's unique large solar panels-folded like origami to fit into the rocket payload carrier. The large solar panels are designed to harness enough energy for the craft as it moves further away from the sun. Without power, a spacecraft is good as dead. The latest NASA communications show that experts may be leaning towards their usual style of rolling with the problem due to the impossibilities of fixing it. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing,\" NASA said. So while engineers are looking into the data to understand what went wrong, they are also making calculations to figure out if Lucy will be able to do all the things it is supposed to do in the darker areas of the solar system. NASA admitted that they still cannot respond to whether the solar array malfunction will have long-term implications for the mission. Fortunately, other programmed tasks like thruster maneuvering and autonomous navigation configurations worked as planned. So it is more than likely that with or without a fully deployed solar array, Lucy will be directed to continue its journey to the swarms of Trojan asteroids. Scientists believe that these asteroids are remnants of the same material that formed giant planets and see them as \"fossilized space objects\" that hold the keys to understanding the solar system's evolution.

Lucy's handlers have been working hard on the problem, but it remains unsolved at present. \"Analysis indicates that the array is between 75% and 95% deployed. It is currently being held in place by a lanyard, specifically designed to help unfurl the arrays during deployment,\" NASA officials wrote in an update on Wednesday afternoon. \"An anomaly response team continues to work on establishing what caused the solar array to not fully deploy,\" NASA officials added. \"NASA and SwRI are evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the array in its current state. Any attempt to safely redeploy the array would occur no earlier than Nov. 16.\" SwRI is the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, the home base for Lucy's principal investigator, Hal Levison. Aside from the solar-array problem, Lucy and its systems are in good shape, NASA officials said. The spacecraft continues to check off milestones and has performed several small maneuvers as planned. It's currently in cruise mode, \"which is the standard flight mode for outbound flight and allows for substantial autonomy for the spacecraft,\" NASA officials wrote in the update. Another big milestone is scheduled for Friday. On that day, the Lucy team plans to point the spacecraft toward Earth, so they can prepare to start checking out its scientific instruments, NASA officials wrote today. Lucy is embarked on a long and ambitious deep-space trek that will see it fly by eight different asteroids between 2025 and 2033. Seven of those space rocks are Trojans, little-studied asteroids that zoom around the sun in Jupiter's orbit, but ahead of or behind the giant planet. The eighth resides in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Sunlight is about 25 times weaker in the realm of the Trojans than the flow we experience here on Earth, so Lucy needs huge solar arrays to soak it up. Each of its two panels is 23.9 feet wide when fully deployed. Lucy will visit more asteroids than any other spacecraft, if all goes according to plan. And it will set another record as well: No solar-powered spacecraft has ever operated as far from the sun as Lucy aims to, although NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe comes close.

Advertisement Lucy's solar panels are a crucial part of the spacecraft's ambitious mission to get scientists their first-ever up-close look at asteroids that orbit in the same path as Jupiter, called the Trojans. Lucy will explore the Trojan asteroids with a suite of remote sensing instruments. Additionally, the navigation cameras will be used to determine the shapes of the Trojan asteroids. Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids are small bodies that are remnants of our early solar system, now trapped in stable orbits associated with, but not close to, the giant planet Jupiter. These primitive bodies hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. Moreover, when Lucy is making its flybys, it will break the record for the farthest from the sun a spacecraft has run exclusively on solar power.

The journey, slated to launch Oct. 16, requires surviving the harsh radiation and brutal cold of space and three passes of the earth to get Lucy a speed boost from the planet's gravity. Despite the complexity of the flight and the spacecraft, the hard part of developing Lucy was the Covid-19 pandemic, said Richard Lipe, who oversees the Lucy program for Lockheed Martin Space. The team started putting instruments on the spacecraft body just as the shutdowns of spring 2020 arrived. Even so, they were able to keep the project on schedule in the ensuing months and avoid serious issues, Lipe said. \"It's pretty impressive. It gets me a little busted up to think about it,\" he said. \"I'm proud to be a program manager of Lucy.\" The assembly, test and launch crew broke into two teams that isolated from each other and split work time, Lipe said. If a Covid-19 infection arose in one team, the others could still work on Lucy. Lockheed Martin Space ran Lucy and its suite of three scientific instruments through exhaustive tests this spring readying it to be shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, late this summer. Inside Lucy is more than 8 miles of wiring and 364 connectors, Lipe said. A lot can go wrong building something so complicated, and Lucy has to last in the harsh environment of space through 2033. Lucy will, at one point in the journey, be nearly six times more distant from the Sun than the earth. Its flight will provide Lucy only fleeting chances to gather images and data about the asteroids it passes. The distance creates a 45-minute delay in transmissions to and from the spacecraft, meaning real-time flying of Lucy is impossible and Lockheed Martin Space's development of capable software is key, Lipe said. \"It's absolutely critical this spacecraft fly and control itself,\" Lipe said. \"If something happens, the spacecraft has to take care of it on its own.\" The company put Lucy into a chamber and subjected it to the freezing temperatures of deep space, vibrations, and up to 150 decibels of sound simulating the stresses of launch. The clean room and program work areas require people to don special suits, shoe covers and gloves. That added to Covid-19 protections and made for a safe-seeming environment to work in with a pandemic going on, but even so, the team figured out handling many spacecraft assembly and testing tasks while working remotely, said Cory Prykull, manager of the team assembling and testing Lucy. The company is reusing a shipping container that protected the space probe Cassini during its transport from testing from the headquarters campus to the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. Lucy will take that same journey from Jefferson County to Buckley Space Force Base for the military cargo plane flight in late summer, accompanied by Prykull the entire way. \"Once it's on a plane, it's real. We're almost there,\" he said. Harold Levison, chief scientist at the Southwest Research Institute office in Boulder, conceived of Lucy and is principal investigator leading the research that's hoped to shed light on the formation of planets in our solar system by examining a rare type of asteroids, known as Trojans, that orbit in the same gravitational plane as Jupiter. Not much is known about the Trojans, and Levison hopes that studying them can tell scientists about material that made the planets in the inner part of the solar system, where the earth is found. NASA selected the Lucy mission in 2017 for one of its Discovery class projects, capped at $450 million in spacecraft and mission development cost. The Lucy spacecraft, launched atop a rocket made by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, will fly by four Trojan asteroids over 12 months starting in 2027. Then, after crossing the solar system, it's slated to reach the second swarm of Trojan asteroids in 2033. The flight path passes all the known types of Trojan-class asteroids. Lucy's first asteroid pass won't be of a Trojan asteroid, but of one from the inner asteroid belt, in 2025. That asteroid, fittingly, is 52246 donaldjahanson, an asteroid named after paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, who discovered the primate fossil that became known as \"Lucy.\" ", "url": ""}, {"title": "Lucy spacecraft passes pre-shipment review, on track for October launch", "date": "2021-07-26", "content": "NASA and Lockheed Martin are another step closer to the launch of their Lucy Trojan Explorer mission, with the craft completing its pre-shipment review ahead of transportation to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida in August. Lucy will be the first mission of its kind, set to explore several asteroids in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The craft is targeted to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket no earlier than October 16, 2021 at 05:35 EDT from SLC-41. The Lucy interplanetary spacecraft is part of NASA's Discovery program. Originally proposed in May 2014, Lucy became a finalist in 2015 alongside Psyche, DAVINCI, VERITAS, and NEOCam. In January 2017, Lucy and Psyche were chosen as the 13th and 14th Discovery missions, respectively. DAVINCI and VERITAS were later selected in a follow-on Discovery program competition as the 15th and 16th missions in June 2021. NEOCam was also ultimately selected to fly by NASA in 2021 but not as part of the Discovery program. Soon after being selected, the Lucy team began finalizing the design of the spacecraft. In October 2018, NASA approved the preliminary design review and a year later also approved the critical design review. This allowed the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, to begin assembly and testing of the spacecraft. Lucy was built at the Lockheed Martin Waterton facility in Colorado, incorporating lessons learned from the prior builds of the New Horizons and OSIRIS- REx spacecrafts. The three science instruments Lucy will carry were derived from those two prior missions. Lucy's LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager is a high spatial resolution visible imager based on the LORRI instrument used on New Horizons. L'LORRI will provide highly detailed images of the Trojan asteroid surfaces. It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laborator y. Similarly, Lucy's Thermal Emission Spectrometer will detect radiation emitting from the Trojan asteroids. It is based on the OTES used on OSIRIS-REx and the EMIRS used on the Al-Amal Mars mission; it was built by Arizona State University. The third and final instrument is L'Ralph, which is made of two sub- instruments: the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera, a collar visible imager, and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, an infrared spectrometer. L'Ralph is based on the Ralph instrument flown on New Horizons and will be used to measure silicates, ice, and organics on the surface of the Trojan asteroids. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft will also use its radio telecommunications hardware and high- gain antenna to measure doppler shifts that will help determine the mass of the Trojans. Once fully fueled, Lucy will have a launch mass of 1,550 kg. The body of the spacecraft is 14.25 m in width and 7.2 m in height. The spacecraft will also use twin 7.3 m diameter circular solar arrays as part of its power system. A 2-meter diameter high gain antenna will be used to communicate with Earth. Lucy will also carry a special message. Known as the \"Lucy Plaque,\" this element of the mission will be used as a time capsule, carrying messages and diagrams. It will be similar to the \"Pioneer plaque\" used on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. Main assembly of Lucy was completed in February 2021, with teams then transitioning to thermal vacuum, vibration and shock, and electromagnetic testing. In April 2021, Lucy stretched its wings in a successful solar array deployment test. With those test complete, Lucy passed its pre-shipment review in July 2021 and is in processing for delivery to Cape Canaveral in August. Once at the launch site, it will undergo final testing and fueling before being placed in the Atlas V's 4.2-meter diameter payload fairing. Lucy will be launched from CCSFS SLC-41 on an Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V is United Launch Alliance's workhorse: a two-stage to orbit rocket consisting of an Atlas Common Core Booster powered by a single Russian RD-180 engine and the Centaur III upper stage powered by a single RL-10. Once in its fairing, Lucy will be placed on top of the Atlas V rocket. Launch is currently set for no earlier than October 16, 2021, the beginning of a 21-day launch window that ends on November 5. Following launch, Lucy will perform two gravity assist flybys of Earth in 2022 and 2024 to kick off its 12 year mission throughout the solar system. These flybys will put Lucy on the correct trajectory to intercept all seven of the asteroids it is expected to study. After completing the second Earth flyby, Lucy will be on the correct trajectory to flyby the first set of Trojan asteroids located at Jupiter's L4 Lagrange point. However, before performing its L4 asteroid flybys, Lucy will first flyby asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson. 52246 Donaldjohanson is a main-belt asteroid that's 4 km in diameter and located in the primary asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy will use 52246 Donaldjohanson as a rehearsal for its flybys of the Trojans - just as New Horizons used Jupiter as a practice target ahead of its eventual encounter with Pluto. Although it may be used as a rehearsal, 52246 Donaldjohanson will provide valuable data on the C-type asteroid, which has been identified as a fragment of a massive collision 130 million years ago which formed the Erigone family of asteroids that 52246 Donaldjohanson is a part of. Lucy is currently expected to flyby the asteroid on April 20, 2025. After performing the flyby, Lucy will coast through interplanetary space for two years before arriving at the L4 \"swarm\" of Trojan asteroids in 2027. The groups of asteroids located at Jupiter's Lagrange points are described as \"swarms\" due to each asteroid's close proximity to another. The L4 swarm is known as the \"Greek camp\" of Trojan asteroids due to most of the asteroids being named after Greek heroes in the Trojan war or from around the same time period. Once at the L4 swarm, Lucy will prepare for flybys of four Trojan asteroids. The first flyby, set to take place on August 12, 2027, will bring Lucy to asteroid 3548 Eurybates. Eurybates is 64 km in diameter and classified as a C-type asteroid. Like 52246 Donaldjohanson, Eurybates is part of a collisional family in the Greek camp. Eurybates also has a tiny, 1 km in diameter satellite named Queta which will be studied as well. Eurybates is an interesting target as it is a C-type asteroid, which are quite rare in the Trojan families while being common in the main belt. A little over a month after its flyby of Eurybates and Queta, Lucy will flyby asteroid 15094 Polymele. Polymele will be the smallest Trojan visited, at just 21 km in diameter. Like the final two Trojans Lucy will visit, Polymele is a P-type asteroid with a low albedo, a featureless reddish spectrum, possible organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, and possibly water ice in its interior. Lucy's flyby of Polymele will mark the first time a spacecraft has visited a P-type asteroid. Scientists currently believe Polymele may be a fragment of a collision between an object and a larger P-type asteroid. Lucy's flyby of Polymele is currently planned for September 15, 2027. The craft will then coast through the Greek camp L4 swarm Trojans for 7 months, culminating on April 18, 2028 with a flyby of asteroid 11341 Leucus - its 3rd L4 Trojan asteroid flyby. Leucus is a D-type asteroid that is 34 km in diameter. Scientists plan to compare Leucus to the other D-type asteroids Lucy will visit to understand what materials make up this class of dark red asteroids. Leucus itself is likely quite elongated in shape, as its brightness fluctuates when observed from Earth. Lucy may also provide answers to why Leucus rotates as slowly as it does - once every 19.4 days. The final asteroid in the L4 swarm to be visited by Lucy will be 21900 Orus, another D-type asteroid. Lucy is expected to pass the 51 km diameter asteroid on November 11, 2028, a little less than six months after its flyby of Leucus. At this point, Lucy will exit Jupiter's L4 point and begin a coast-phase toward Earth, performing a gravity-assist with the planet in December 2030 to send it on a trajectory to Jupiter's L5 point. When it arrives at the L5 Trojan swarm, known as the \"Trojan camp,\" in 2033, it will examine its final two Trojan asteroids in a single flyby. The binary pair 617 Patroclus and Menoetius orbit one another with a separation of 680 km. Patroclus is 113 km in diameter while Menoetius is slightly smaller at 104 km. Both Trojans are P-type asteroids, similar to the L4 Trojan Polymele, which Lucy will have visited 6 years earlier at this point. Scientists currently believe the two Trojans are primordial asteroids, leftover material from the formation of the solar system. Lucy is currently planned to flyby 617 Patroclus and Menoetius on March 2, 2033. At this point, the original mission will end. At the completion of Lucy's mission, the daring spacecraft will become the only mission in history to visit 8 different locations in a single mission.

These small bodies are remnants of our early solar system, now trapped in stable orbits associated with the giant planet Jupiter, forming two \"swarms\" that lead in front of and trail behind Jupiter in its path around the Sun. These orbits are clustered around stable points of gravitational equilibrium known as Lagrange Points. Over its twelve-year primary mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids, flying by one main belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids. Lucy also incorporates three Earth-gravity assists to reach the Trojan swarms and accomplish these targeted encounters. The spacecraft was transported from Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the spacecraft in its Littleton, Colorado, facility. \"It takes a lot of coordination and careful planning to get this spacecraft to its launch site, and I'm very proud of the team who worked so tirelessly through a global pandemic to get us to this moment,\" said Rich Lipe, Lockheed Martin Lucy program manager.

Lucy represents NASA's first mission to the swarm of asteroids known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These are a cluster of asteroids located on either side of Jupiter and along its same orbital path. The mission is expected to involve taking the spacecraft on two separate passes of Earth for gravity-assisted boosts: one in 2022 and another in 2024.

Named after characters in Greek mythology, these asteroids circle the Sun in two swarms, with one group leading ahead of Jupiter in its path, the other trailing behind it. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit these asteroids. By studying these asteroids up close, scientists hope to hone their theories on how our solar system's planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they ended up in their current configuration. \"With Lucy, we're going to eight never-before-seen asteroids in 12 years with a single spacecraft,\" said Tom Statler, Lucy project scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for discovery as we probe into our solar system's distant past.\" Following all pandemic protocols, Lucy team members have spent the past eight weeks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparing the spacecraft for flight. Engineers have tested the spacecraft's mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems and practiced executing the launch sequence from the mission operations centers at Kennedy and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. In early August, engineers installed the spacecraft's high-gain antenna, its second most prominent feature after the expansive solar arrays, which will allow the spacecraft to communicate with Earth. \"There has been a lot of hands-on work,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This summer has gone by so fast; it's hard to believe we're nearly at launch.\" On Sept. 18, propulsion engineers finished filling Lucy's fuel tanks with approximately 1,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine and liquid oxygen, which make up 40% of the mass of the spacecraft. The fuel will be used for precise maneuvers that will propel Lucy to its asteroid destinations on schedule, while the solar arrays - each the width of a school bus - will recharge the batteries that will power spacecraft instruments. The Lucy spacecraft will soon be packed into the two halves of the launch vehicle fairing, which will close around it like a clamshell. After the spacecraft is encapsulated, the Lucy team will be able to communicate with it electrically through an \"umbilical cord.\" \"Launching a spacecraft is almost like sending a child off to college - you've done what can for them to get them ready for that next big step on their own,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. In early October, the encapsulated spacecraft will be transported to the Vehicle Integration Facility at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, where it will be \"mated\" with the United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V will lift off from Space Launch Complex 41.The rocket will carry Lucy outside Earth's atmosphere to begin the long journey to the Trojan asteroids. A few days prior to launch, engineers will power up the Lucy spacecraft in preparation for the mission. This process will take about 20 minutes. \"The spacecraft will sit in launch configuration and the engineering team will continuously monitor its health and status to make sure Lucy is ready to go,\" said Jessica Lounsbury, the Lucy project systems engineer at Goddard. \"And then it's launch day.\" Lucy's first launch attempt is scheduled for 5:34 a.m. EDT on Oct. 16. That day, the team will be \"called to stations\" at 1 a.m., which is when everyone is expected to arrive at mission control and other stations to monitor the spacecraft and run through the full launch countdown procedures. If weather or any other issues prohibit a launch that day, the team will have additional launch opportunities beginning the following day. Lucy's principal investigator is based out of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of Southwest Research Institute, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Goddard provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft. Lucy is the 13th mission in NASA's Discovery Program. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Discovery Program for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The launch is managed by NASA's Launch Services Program based at Kennedy.

But Lucy appears to have encountered its first obstacle: One of the probe's two solar arrays, which are powering Lucy's exploration, may not properly be locked in place. \"Lucy's two solar arrays have deployed, and both are producing power and the battery is charging,\" NASA said Sunday in a blog post. \"While one of the arrays has latched, indications are that the second array may not be fully latched.\" \"In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety. The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate director for science, tweeted Sunday that he's confident the array issue will be solved. \"NASA's Lucy mission is safe and stable,\" he said. \"The two solar arrays have deployed, but one may not be fully latched. The team is analyzing data to determine next steps. This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well.\" The two solar arrays were folded when Lucy launched and were designed to unfurl like Chinese fans once the spacecraft reached space. The arrays were expected to take 20 minutes to fully unfurl, which the mission's principal investigator said would \"determine if the rest of the 12-year mission will be a success.\" The solar panels were successfully deployed 91 minutes after launch. Now it's just a matter of getting the second one to latch properly. CNET reached out to the Lucy team for confirmation on how the unlatched arrays might affect performance and how the issue may be rectified but didn't immediately hear back. Lucy's ultimate goal is to explore a set of asteroids that travel in Jupiter's orbit and have never been studied up close before. These Trojan asteroids move as huge swarms, or camps, at the Lagrangian points in Jupiter's orbit. Lagrangian points are regions where the push and pull of gravity from both Jupiter and the sun lock the camps in place, leading and trailing Jupiter in its journey around the sun in perpetuity. The collection of amorphous space rocks is like a series of cosmic fossils, providing a window into the earliest era of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Lucy will act as a cosmic paleontologist, flying past eight \"fossils\" at a distance and studying their surfaces with infrared imagers and cameras.

The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter holds the current record, but Lucy will be farther when it flies through the Trojan asteroids. Other far-flung predecessors have relied on nuclear power. The spacecraft's two solar arrays were too big to be opened simultaneously on Earth; the testing facility couldn't accommodate the wingspan. So Lucy's team opened one solar array, closed it, moved the spacecraft and then opened the other solar array. The spacecraft never attempted to open them at the same time before reaching microgravity. These solar arrays should generate 18,000 watts of power when the spacecraft is near Earth. Katie Oakman, Lucy's structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, said that's enough to power her house and a couple of her neighbors. Near the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's two solar arrays would generate just 500 watts of power. This would turn on a few lights in the living room but not power the microwave. Yet it's sufficient for Lucy's science instruments that will need 82 watts of power when flying by the asteroids.

Unfortunately, a day after a successful launch, Lucy had problems. NASA named the craft Lucy in honor of the famous fossilized human ancestor. The mission's primary focus is to better better understand the solar system's formation by studying Trojan asteroids. NASA has experience with ambitious projects that require expensive technology and missions that do not always go as planned. For example, when the Hubble telescope was launched, astronauts had to fly to it and fix its defective mirrors. Recently, NASA has had its share of failures on Mars. NASA admitted defeat on its Insight Lander-a probe that could not penetrate the Red Planet's rocky surface. Three days after the launch of Lucy, NASA announced that only one of the solar arrays had fully deployed, while the other one only partially deployed. Lucy was settling into an Earth- orbiting cruise speed while top NASA experts tried to figure out how to solve the problem. The 12-year mission is possible thanks to Lucy's unique large solar panels-folded like origami to fit into the rocket payload carrier. The large solar panels are designed to harness enough energy for the craft as it moves further away from the sun. Without power, a spacecraft is good as dead. The latest NASA communications show that experts may be leaning towards their usual style of rolling with the problem due to the impossibilities of fixing it. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing,\" NASA said. So while engineers are looking into the data to understand what went wrong, they are also making calculations to figure out if Lucy will be able to do all the things it is supposed to do in the darker areas of the solar system. NASA admitted that they still cannot respond to whether the solar array malfunction will have long-term implications for the mission. Fortunately, other programmed tasks like thruster maneuvering and autonomous navigation configurations worked as planned. So it is more than likely that with or without a fully deployed solar array, Lucy will be directed to continue its journey to the swarms of Trojan asteroids. Scientists believe that these asteroids are remnants of the same material that formed giant planets and see them as \"fossilized space objects\" that hold the keys to understanding the solar system's evolution.

It is currently being held in place by a lanyard, specifically designed to help unfurl the arrays during deployment,\" NASA officials wrote in an update on Wednesday afternoon. \"An anomaly response team continues to work on establishing what caused the solar array to not fully deploy,\" NASA officials added. \"NASA and SwRI are evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the array in its current state.

It's currently in cruise mode, \"which is the standard flight mode for outbound flight and allows for substantial autonomy for the spacecraft,\" NASA officials wrote in the update. Another big milestone is scheduled for Friday. On that day, the Lucy team plans to point the spacecraft toward Earth, so they can prepare to start checking out its scientific instruments, NASA officials wrote today. Lucy is embarked on a long and ambitious deep-space trek that will see it fly by eight different asteroids between 2025 and 2033. Seven of those space rocks are Trojans, little-studied asteroids that zoom around the sun in Jupiter's orbit, but ahead of or behind the giant planet. The eighth resides in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Sunlight is about 25 times weaker in the realm of the Trojans than the flow we experience here on Earth, so Lucy needs huge solar arrays to soak it up. Each of its two panels is 23.9 feet wide when fully deployed. Lucy will visit more asteroids than any other spacecraft, if all goes according to plan. And it will set another record as well: No solar-powered spacecraft has ever operated as far from the sun as Lucy aims to, although NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe comes close.

Lucy will explore the Trojan asteroids with a suite of remote sensing instruments. Additionally, the navigation cameras will be used to determine the shapes of the Trojan asteroids. Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids are small bodies that are remnants of our early solar system, now trapped in stable orbits associated with, but not close to, the giant planet Jupiter. These primitive bodies hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system.

The NASA Lucy launch took place on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will fly 445 million miles away from Earth to explore swarms of asteroids that orbit the sun in two groups - one ahead of Jupiter, and one behind, according to NASA. They're called the Trojan asteroids, and no spacecraft ever paid them a visit. These asteroid clusters have been orbiting the Sun for billions of years, and NASA's pre-mission tests show that they're probably made from the same ancient material that originally formed planets like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn. In lunar terms, they're simple, but they're time capsules that could give humanity some incredible insights into the birth of the solar system and the formation of life. What's the NASA Lucy mission plan? The NASA Lucy mission's sheer distance means it's a long-term journey - the probe will fly past Earth on Oct. 15, 2022 and use our planet's gravitational pull in several different phases so it can be flung towards the Trojan clusters, according to NASA. Lucy will arrive at the main solar system's asteroid belt in April 2025, and it'll analyze seven different Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033. And then, in March 2033, the Lucy mission will end. But Lucy won't stop there - it will continue its solar orbit for millions of years. NASA first mooted Lucy in 2015, and it was formally picked as a viable mission in 2017. Its first designs were approved in 2018, and it began assembly and testing in August 2020. The final NASA Lucy spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July 2021 ahead of the autumn launch period, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy might seem an odd name for a space mission, but it's named after a fossilized skeleton called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. That fossil is around 3 million years old, and it taught us loads of new things about the evolution of humanity, according to Arizona State University. So it's a fitting name for a space mission that NASA hopes will lead to similar discoveries from interstellar fossils. What will the NASA Lucy spacecraft test? The NASA Lucy spacecraft will fly past seven Trojan asteroids and carry out remote testing with its range of advanced instruments. NASA plans to examine the geology on the surface of each asteroid to check out their age, structure and shape, and other tools will check each asteroid for minerals, ice and organic materials, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Other tools will measure the mass and density of each asteroid and will map their interior structures, too. NASA doesn't quite know what Lucy will find - after all, no mission has ever been there. But the mission will supply vital information about the formation of our solar system, and this sort of exploration is a vital part of scientific discovery. The NASA Lucy spacecraft uses solar energy for power in deep space, but it will orbit Earth, Mars and the sun and rely on their gravitational pull to start its journey to the outer reaches of space, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy's first task is to orbit the sun, and by October 2022 it'll hurtle back toward Earth and get a gravity-assisted boost that will speed up the spacecraft. This speed will take Lucy on a two-year orbit around Mars before it comes back to Earth in 2024 for another shot of gravitational help. It's this second shove that will propel Lucy toward the solar system's main asteroid belt - and, beyond that, to the first cluster of Trojan asteroids. Once it has looped around those, Lucy will head back to Earth for its third gravitational boost, and this will push the spacecraft in the opposite direction, toward the second group of Trojan satellites. Lucy's smallest target is in the solar system's main asteroid belt, not the Trojan clusters. The target is 130 million years old, and NASA will use this asteroid to test Lucy's instruments.

Initial ground tests determined additional motor operations are required to increase the probability of the latching Lucy's array in place as intended, and the team has recommended additional testing. Spacecraft operations included discharging and charging the battery while pointed at Earth, moving the spacecraft to point to the Sun, operating the solar array motor with the launch day parameters, moving back to pointing at Earth, and then another battery discharge and recharge. The solar arrays charge the batteries, then the batteries are deliberately discharged, and the solar array circuits are used to recharge the batteries; performing these charging and discharging processes gives the team more information about the solar array circuits. The team gathered information on two of the 10 gores - the individual solar array panel segments that make up the full array - that previously had no data. NASA now has data on all 10 gores confirming they are open, producing power as expected, and not stuck together.

Because the asteroids are fossil-like remnants of our solar system's origins-having changed very little in the 4.6 billion years since they were formed-they are ideal for studying conditions in the early solar system. Scientists have designed Lucy to fly by and carry out remote sensing activities to achieve mission objectives by mapping surface geology, surface color and composition; study the asteroids' masses, densities and sub-surface composition; and look for rings and satellites of the Trojans. Lucy will travel four billion miles in all, reaching speeds of up to 92,000 mph, which means every step of the mission must be executed flawlessly. Planetary astronomer Josh Emery, professor in Northern Arizona University's Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science, leads the Surface Composition Working Group for the mission. It's his job to help plan the observations of the targets that are required to answer the open science questions about Trojan asteroids. The group will determine what materials the asteroids are made of as they search for ice, complex organic molecules and rocky material that will indicate where in the solar system the Trojan asteroids formed. \"The launch of Lucy was truly fantastic,\" Emery said. \"I have been studying the Trojan asteroids for my whole scientific career, since the 1990s, and I cannot wait to see these bodies close up.\" NAU Ph.D. student Audrey Martin also is heavily involved on the Lucy team. She has been studying data of Trojan asteroids captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope to learn what rocky minerals are present on their surfaces. Martin co-leads a sub-team on the mission that will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Lucy targets once it is launched. \"Working with the Lucy mission's science team is so exciting and unreal,\" Martin said. \"Being invited to the launch was an amazing privilege, and something not many graduate students can participate in. The launch itself was indescribable! I am so looking forward to continue working with the Lucy team on this amazing mission.\" One of the primary goals of the Lucy mission is figuring out where Trojan asteroids were originally formed. Martin said the observations Lucy sends back to Earth will demonstrate whether these bodies are more like the rocky asteroids of the inner solar system or the icy comets of the outer solar system. Trojans currently orbit the Sun at the same distance as Jupiter. There are more than 7,000 Trojan asteroids, which are located in two swarms-one 60 degrees in front of Jupiter in its orbit and one 60 degrees behind Jupiter. \"Our current understanding of the solar system suggests that the giant planets moved around a lot in the early stages of solar system history,\" she said. \"Learning where Trojans formed and how and when they were trapped in these regions is the best way to test whether this view for the history of the solar system is correct. The compositions determined by the working group that Professor Emery leads will be very important for distinguishing the formation locations of Trojans, and therefore the history of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://news.nau.edu/emery-lucy-probe/"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Begins Launch Preparations for First Mission to the Trojan Asteroids", "date": "2021-08-03", "content": "NASA's first spacecraft to explore the Trojan asteroids arrived Friday, July 30, at the agency's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida.

Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit these asteroids. By studying these asteroids up close, scientists hope to hone their theories on how our solar system's planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they ended up in their current configuration. \"With Lucy, we're going to eight never-before-seen asteroids in 12 years with a single spacecraft,\" said Tom Statler, Lucy project scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for discovery as we probe into our solar system's distant past.\" Following all pandemic protocols, Lucy team members have spent the past eight weeks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparing the spacecraft for flight. Engineers have tested the spacecraft's mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems and practiced executing the launch sequence from the mission operations centers at Kennedy and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. In early August, engineers installed the spacecraft's high-gain antenna, its second most prominent feature after the expansive solar arrays, which will allow the spacecraft to communicate with Earth. \"There has been a lot of hands-on work,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This summer has gone by so fast; it's hard to believe we're nearly at launch.\" On Sept. 18, propulsion engineers finished filling Lucy's fuel tanks with approximately 1,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine and liquid oxygen, which make up 40% of the mass of the spacecraft. The fuel will be used for precise maneuvers that will propel Lucy to its asteroid destinations on schedule, while the solar arrays - each the width of a school bus - will recharge the batteries that will power spacecraft instruments. The Lucy spacecraft will soon be packed into the two halves of the launch vehicle fairing, which will close around it like a clamshell. After the spacecraft is encapsulated, the Lucy team will be able to communicate with it electrically through an \"umbilical cord.\" \"Launching a spacecraft is almost like sending a child off to college - you've done what can for them to get them ready for that next big step on their own,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. In early October, the encapsulated spacecraft will be transported to the Vehicle Integration Facility at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, where it will be \"mated\" with the United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V will lift off from Space Launch Complex 41.The rocket will carry Lucy outside Earth's atmosphere to begin the long journey to the Trojan asteroids. A few days prior to launch, engineers will power up the Lucy spacecraft in preparation for the mission. This process will take about 20 minutes. \"The spacecraft will sit in launch configuration and the engineering team will continuously monitor its health and status to make sure Lucy is ready to go,\" said Jessica Lounsbury, the Lucy project systems engineer at Goddard. \"And then it's launch day.\" Lucy's first launch attempt is scheduled for 5:34 a.m. EDT on Oct. 16. That day, the team will be \"called to stations\" at 1 a.m., which is when everyone is expected to arrive at mission control and other stations to monitor the spacecraft and run through the full launch countdown procedures. If weather or any other issues prohibit a launch that day, the team will have additional launch opportunities beginning the following day. Lucy's principal investigator is based out of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of Southwest Research Institute, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Goddard provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft. Lucy is the 13th mission in NASA's Discovery Program. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Discovery Program for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The launch is managed by NASA's Launch Services Program based at Kennedy.

But Lucy appears to have encountered its first obstacle: One of the probe's two solar arrays, which are powering Lucy's exploration, may not properly be locked in place. \"Lucy's two solar arrays have deployed, and both are producing power and the battery is charging,\" NASA said Sunday in a blog post. \"While one of the arrays has latched, indications are that the second array may not be fully latched.\" \"In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety. The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate director for science, tweeted Sunday that he's confident the array issue will be solved. \"NASA's Lucy mission is safe and stable,\" he said. \"The two solar arrays have deployed, but one may not be fully latched. The team is analyzing data to determine next steps. This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well.\" The two solar arrays were folded when Lucy launched and were designed to unfurl like Chinese fans once the spacecraft reached space. The arrays were expected to take 20 minutes to fully unfurl, which the mission's principal investigator said would \"determine if the rest of the 12-year mission will be a success.\" The solar panels were successfully deployed 91 minutes after launch. Now it's just a matter of getting the second one to latch properly. CNET reached out to the Lucy team for confirmation on how the unlatched arrays might affect performance and how the issue may be rectified but didn't immediately hear back. Lucy's ultimate goal is to explore a set of asteroids that travel in Jupiter's orbit and have never been studied up close before. These Trojan asteroids move as huge swarms, or camps, at the Lagrangian points in Jupiter's orbit. Lagrangian points are regions where the push and pull of gravity from both Jupiter and the sun lock the camps in place, leading and trailing Jupiter in its journey around the sun in perpetuity. The collection of amorphous space rocks is like a series of cosmic fossils, providing a window into the earliest era of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Lucy will act as a cosmic paleontologist, flying past eight \"fossils\" at a distance and studying their surfaces with infrared imagers and cameras.

Any attempt to safely redeploy the array would occur no earlier than Nov. 16. This spacecraft is designed to travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft. The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter holds the current record, but Lucy will be farther when it flies through the Trojan asteroids. Other far-flung predecessors have relied on nuclear power. The spacecraft's two solar arrays were too big to be opened simultaneously on Earth; the testing facility couldn't accommodate the wingspan. So Lucy's team opened one solar array, closed it, moved the spacecraft and then opened the other solar array. The spacecraft never attempted to open them at the same time before reaching microgravity. These solar arrays should generate 18,000 watts of power when the spacecraft is near Earth. Katie Oakman, Lucy's structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, said that's enough to power her house and a couple of her neighbors. Near the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's two solar arrays would generate just 500 watts of power. This would turn on a few lights in the living room but not power the microwave. Yet it's sufficient for Lucy's science instruments that will need 82 watts of power when flying by the asteroids.

Unfortunately, a day after a successful launch, Lucy had problems. NASA named the craft Lucy in honor of the famous fossilized human ancestor. The mission's primary focus is to better better understand the solar system's formation by studying Trojan asteroids. NASA has experience with ambitious projects that require expensive technology and missions that do not always go as planned. For example, when the Hubble telescope was launched, astronauts had to fly to it and fix its defective mirrors. Recently, NASA has had its share of failures on Mars. NASA admitted defeat on its Insight Lander-a probe that could not penetrate the Red Planet's rocky surface. Three days after the launch of Lucy, NASA announced that only one of the solar arrays had fully deployed, while the other one only partially deployed. Lucy was settling into an Earth- orbiting cruise speed while top NASA experts tried to figure out how to solve the problem. The 12-year mission is possible thanks to Lucy's unique large solar panels-folded like origami to fit into the rocket payload carrier. The large solar panels are designed to harness enough energy for the craft as it moves further away from the sun. Without power, a spacecraft is good as dead. The latest NASA communications show that experts may be leaning towards their usual style of rolling with the problem due to the impossibilities of fixing it. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing,\" NASA said. So while engineers are looking into the data to understand what went wrong, they are also making calculations to figure out if Lucy will be able to do all the things it is supposed to do in the darker areas of the solar system. NASA admitted that they still cannot respond to whether the solar array malfunction will have long-term implications for the mission. Fortunately, other programmed tasks like thruster maneuvering and autonomous navigation configurations worked as planned. So it is more than likely that with or without a fully deployed solar array, Lucy will be directed to continue its journey to the swarms of Trojan asteroids. Scientists believe that these asteroids are remnants of the same material that formed giant planets and see them as \"fossilized space objects\" that hold the keys to understanding the solar system's evolution.

It is currently being held in place by a lanyard, specifically designed to help unfurl the arrays during deployment,\" NASA officials wrote in an update on Wednesday afternoon. \"An anomaly response team continues to work on establishing what caused the solar array to not fully deploy,\" NASA officials added. \"NASA and SwRI are evaluating a range of options, including the possibility of leaving the array in its current state.

It's currently in cruise mode, \"which is the standard flight mode for outbound flight and allows for substantial autonomy for the spacecraft,\" NASA officials wrote in the update. Another big milestone is scheduled for Friday. On that day, the Lucy team plans to point the spacecraft toward Earth, so they can prepare to start checking out its scientific instruments, NASA officials wrote today. Lucy is embarked on a long and ambitious deep-space trek that will see it fly by eight different asteroids between 2025 and 2033. Seven of those space rocks are Trojans, little-studied asteroids that zoom around the sun in Jupiter's orbit, but ahead of or behind the giant planet. The eighth resides in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Sunlight is about 25 times weaker in the realm of the Trojans than the flow we experience here on Earth, so Lucy needs huge solar arrays to soak it up. Each of its two panels is 23.9 feet wide when fully deployed. Lucy will visit more asteroids than any other spacecraft, if all goes according to plan. And it will set another record as well: No solar-powered spacecraft has ever operated as far from the sun as Lucy aims to, although NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe comes close.

Lucy will explore the Trojan asteroids with a suite of remote sensing instruments. Additionally, the navigation cameras will be used to determine the shapes of the Trojan asteroids. Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids are small bodies that are remnants of our early solar system, now trapped in stable orbits associated with, but not close to, the giant planet Jupiter. These primitive bodies hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. Moreover, when Lucy is making its flybys, it will break the record for the farthest from the sun a spacecraft has run exclusively on solar power.

The NASA Lucy launch took place on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will fly 445 million miles away from Earth to explore swarms of asteroids that orbit the sun in two groups - one ahead of Jupiter, and one behind, according to NASA. They're called the Trojan asteroids, and no spacecraft ever paid them a visit. These asteroid clusters have been orbiting the Sun for billions of years, and NASA's pre-mission tests show that they're probably made from the same ancient material that originally formed planets like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn. In lunar terms, they're simple, but they're time capsules that could give humanity some incredible insights into the birth of the solar system and the formation of life. What's the NASA Lucy mission plan? The NASA Lucy mission's sheer distance means it's a long-term journey - the probe will fly past Earth on Oct. 15, 2022 and use our planet's gravitational pull in several different phases so it can be flung towards the Trojan clusters, according to NASA. Lucy will arrive at the main solar system's asteroid belt in April 2025, and it'll analyze seven different Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033. And then, in March 2033, the Lucy mission will end. But Lucy won't stop there - it will continue its solar orbit for millions of years. NASA first mooted Lucy in 2015, and it was formally picked as a viable mission in 2017. Its first designs were approved in 2018, and it began assembly and testing in August 2020. The final NASA Lucy spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July 2021 ahead of the autumn launch period, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy might seem an odd name for a space mission, but it's named after a fossilized skeleton called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. That fossil is around 3 million years old, and it taught us loads of new things about the evolution of humanity, according to Arizona State University. So it's a fitting name for a space mission that NASA hopes will lead to similar discoveries from interstellar fossils. What will the NASA Lucy spacecraft test? The NASA Lucy spacecraft will fly past seven Trojan asteroids and carry out remote testing with its range of advanced instruments. NASA plans to examine the geology on the surface of each asteroid to check out their age, structure and shape, and other tools will check each asteroid for minerals, ice and organic materials, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Other tools will measure the mass and density of each asteroid and will map their interior structures, too. NASA doesn't quite know what Lucy will find - after all, no mission has ever been there. But the mission will supply vital information about the formation of our solar system, and this sort of exploration is a vital part of scientific discovery. The NASA Lucy spacecraft uses solar energy for power in deep space, but it will orbit Earth, Mars and the sun and rely on their gravitational pull to start its journey to the outer reaches of space, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy's first task is to orbit the sun, and by October 2022 it'll hurtle back toward Earth and get a gravity-assisted boost that will speed up the spacecraft. This speed will take Lucy on a two-year orbit around Mars before it comes back to Earth in 2024 for another shot of gravitational help. It's this second shove that will propel Lucy toward the solar system's main asteroid belt - and, beyond that, to the first cluster of Trojan asteroids. Once it has looped around those, Lucy will head back to Earth for its third gravitational boost, and this will push the spacecraft in the opposite direction, toward the second group of Trojan satellites. Lucy's smallest target is in the solar system's main asteroid belt, not the Trojan clusters. The target is 130 million years old, and NASA will use this asteroid to test Lucy's instruments.

Initial ground tests determined additional motor operations are required to increase the probability of the latching Lucy's array in place as intended, and the team has recommended additional testing. Spacecraft operations included discharging and charging the battery while pointed at Earth, moving the spacecraft to point to the Sun, operating the solar array motor with the launch day parameters, moving back to pointing at Earth, and then another battery discharge and recharge. The solar arrays charge the batteries, then the batteries are deliberately discharged, and the solar array circuits are used to recharge the batteries; performing these charging and discharging processes gives the team more information about the solar array circuits.

Expected to begin reaching its targets in 2027, the probe will fly by more asteroids than any other spacecraft in history, including one in the \"main belt\" between Mars and Jupiter and eight Trojan asteroids-Donaldjohanson, Eurybates, Queta, Polymele, Leucus, Orus, Patroclus and Menoetius. \"The Trojan asteroids are leftovers from the early days of our solar system, effectively the fossils of planet formation,\" said Hal Levison, principal investigator on the Lucy mission. Because the asteroids are fossil-like remnants of our solar system's origins-having changed very little in the 4.6 billion years since they were formed-they are ideal for studying conditions in the early solar system. Scientists have designed Lucy to fly by and carry out remote sensing activities to achieve mission objectives by mapping surface geology, surface color and composition; study the asteroids' masses, densities and sub-surface composition; and look for rings and satellites of the Trojans. Lucy will travel four billion miles in all, reaching speeds of up to 92,000 mph, which means every step of the mission must be executed flawlessly. Planetary astronomer Josh Emery, professor in Northern Arizona University's Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science, leads the Surface Composition Working Group for the mission. It's his job to help plan the observations of the targets that are required to answer the open science questions about Trojan asteroids. The group will determine what materials the asteroids are made of as they search for ice, complex organic molecules and rocky material that will indicate where in the solar system the Trojan asteroids formed. \"The launch of Lucy was truly fantastic,\" Emery said. \"I have been studying the Trojan asteroids for my whole scientific career, since the 1990s, and I cannot wait to see these bodies close up.\" NAU Ph.D. student Audrey Martin also is heavily involved on the Lucy team. She has been studying data of Trojan asteroids captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope to learn what rocky minerals are present on their surfaces. Martin co-leads a sub-team on the mission that will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Lucy targets once it is launched. \"Working with the Lucy mission's science team is so exciting and unreal,\" Martin said. \"Being invited to the launch was an amazing privilege, and something not many graduate students can participate in. The launch itself was indescribable! I am so looking forward to continue working with the Lucy team on this amazing mission.\" One of the primary goals of the Lucy mission is figuring out where Trojan asteroids were originally formed. Martin said the observations Lucy sends back to Earth will demonstrate whether these bodies are more like the rocky asteroids of the inner solar system or the icy comets of the outer solar system. Trojans currently orbit the Sun at the same distance as Jupiter. There are more than 7,000 Trojan asteroids, which are located in two swarms-one 60 degrees in front of Jupiter in its orbit and one 60 degrees behind Jupiter. \"Our current understanding of the solar system suggests that the giant planets moved around a lot in the early stages of solar system history,\" she said. \"Learning where Trojans formed and how and when they were trapped in these regions is the best way to test whether this view for the history of the solar system is correct. The compositions determined by the working group that Professor Emery leads will be very important for distinguishing the formation locations of Trojans, and therefore the history of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://news.nau.edu/emery-lucy-probe/"}, {"title": "Watching the Blink of a Star to Size Up \"Trojan\" Asteroids for NASA's Lucy Mission", "date": "2022-01-07", "content": " Gathering near Las Vegas recently, dozens of astronomers spread throughout the region, pointed their telescopes at the sky, and waited for the moment on October 20 that the light from a faraway star blinked out. It was an event so minuscule it would have been easy to miss. Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16. The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an \"occultation,\" a 40-mile- wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow's predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple of hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape. This information will be used by Lucy researchers to supplement data gathered by the Lucy spacecraft's close flyby of Eurybates in 2027, which is designed to determine what the asteroid is made of and where in the solar system it formed billions of years ago. Why Occultations? An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer's view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. \"It really does look like a star just vanished,\" said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. \"It's kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.\" Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy's target destinations, known as \"Trojan\" asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter. Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it's challenging to precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. \"Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we'll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,\" said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid's mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. \"Lucy will see each asteroid's surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,\" Keeney said. To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow's path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the asteroid passes in front of it and then use the asteroid's known velocity to calculate its width. Since the occultation time, and thus width, is different at each point on the line where telescopes are stationed - with each telescope station corresponding to a different line across the asteroid - scientists can also determine the shape of an asteroid's silhouette by combining data from each telescope. By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. \"Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,\" said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid's shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile path. Today, that area is six times smaller. Astronomers' predictions have improved dramatically thanks to Hubble and ESA's Gaia satellite, which help pin down the precise locations of nearly 2 billion stars. Additionally, the trajectories of Lucy's fast-moving target asteroids are constantly monitored and refined using ground-based telescopes and occasionally Hubble. Buie calls occultation events \"mega campaigns,\" as they require large teams, precise location predictions for each telescope, and many telescopes for successful data collection. In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. \"Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA's mission,\" said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. \"If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would've seen anything,\" Buie said. \"The clouds would have wiped us out.\" The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather.

In an update Wednesday, NASA said Lucy's team is still working to resolve this issue. But in the meantime, the arrays are producing \"ample energy\" and charging the spacecraft's battery as expected under normal operating conditions. NASA said it could attempt to latch the problem solar array in late April. In a lab on Earth, the mission team is testing a dual motor solar array deployment that would use the primary and backup motors. Using both motors at the same time could potentially apply enough force to latch the array. The team is also studying if they could leave the array unlatched. Lucy's other spacecraft systems are working as intended, and its team is moving forward with routine operations. As of Wednesday, the next activity was calibrating the spacecraft's guidance, navigation and control hardware, according to the NASA update.

At a Jan. 25 meeting NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, expressed confidence that, regardless if the solar array is fully deployed or not, the issue will not affect the spacecraft's ability to carry out its mission to study several Trojan asteroids leading and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. Shortly after its Oct. 16 launch, deployed two large circular solar arrays, each 7.3 meters in diameter. The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. \"Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. \"It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,\" he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a \"dynamic interaction\" between the two arrays during the deployment. Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,\" he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. \"The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we're planning.\" There's no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. \"We have plenty of time because we're not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,\" he said. \"We're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" That assessment matches the most recent NASA update about the mission, published Jan. 12. It stated that the current plan for the mission \"supports a latch attempt in the late April timeframe\" but that engineers were still studying leaving the array in its current unlatched condition. Levison added that all other aspects of the spacecraft, including its instruments, were working well. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt,\" he said. \"The instruments and the spacecraft are all behaving nominally.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/cause-of-lucy-solar-array-deployment-problem-identified/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy asteroid spacecraft still has a wonky solar array as it flies through space", "date": "2022-01-27", "content": "Three months after launch, a new NASA asteroid spacecraft is still getting settled into its life beyond Earth. NASA's Lucy mission launched Oct. 16 with a mission to explore the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind Jupiter. No spacecraft has ever visited the Trojan asteroids, which scientists believe are \"fossils\" from the formation of the solar system. But soon after launch, although the rest of the spacecraft's work has gone smoothly, the mission team realized that one of the spacecraft's two large solar arrays hadn't fully deployed. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try to figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said on Tuesday during a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group, which provides independent recommendations to the agency about studying moons, asteroids, comets and the like. However, Lucy is remaining in orbit around Earth for about a year before moving deeper into the solar system, and the arrays are much larger than they need to be in the relatively sunlit environment, so the situation isn't urgent. \"We have plenty of time, really, because we're not scheduled to fire the main engines for a while and we're in cruise,\" Levison said. \"So we're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" Levison also said that Lucy's current power production is sufficient to meet the mission's needs throughout the journey. \"The good news is that means we're producing over 90% of the expected power, it's actually 92 or 93%,\" Levison said. \"So power is not an issue for the spacecraft - nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" Lucy's two large solar arrays were folded up for the spacecraft's launch, then began deploying \"like a Chinese fan,\" as team members describe the process, into a decagon. Each array spans 24 feet and is opened by a lanyard rigged up to motors. One deployed completely, with the full 360 degrees unfurled and a latch closed to hold the array in place; the team's estimate suggests that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, preventing latching. Analysis completed since launch has suggested that an issue with the lanyard meant to pull the array open prevented full deployment. \"Through some unknown process, there was a period where there was no tension on the lanyard as it was deploying,\" Levison said. \"As a result, the lanyard fell off the spool. We think there's something like 30 inches 76 centimeters of lanyard remaining to be pulled in.\" The Lucy team is evaluating two options, he noted, adding that, \"both of them, I think, have a significantly good chance of success.\" One approach would attempt to finish deploying the temperamental solar array, turning the motors that work the lanyard back on. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can just pull a little harder, we might be able to get it all to latch,\" Levison said. However, the team doesn't want to rush this option. \"We're running it in a way it wasn't designed to run, so we've been spending quite a bit of time analyzing the risks in trying to do this redeploy.\" The other potential approach is to do nothing, since the solar array can meet the spacecraft's needs as it is. However, that would leave a gap in the array, like a missing pie slice, and would also leave the array without the support of the closed latch. \"We have plenty of power; the issue is the structural integrity of the array during main engine burns,\" Levison said. \"The forces and torques going through the array and particularly where it's connected to the spacecraft are different than designed.\" That distinction means that the team is building models and conducting analysis of what the spacecraft might experience during a main engine burn to ensure that leaving the array as is wouldn't damage the spacecraft, Levison said. \"The instruments and spacecraft are all behaving nominally,\" Levison said. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-solar-array-glitch-plan"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA's Lucy mission prepares for launch to Trojan asteroids", "date": "2021-10-03", "content": "NASA has tested the functions of Lucy, the agency's first spacecraft to study Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, filled it with fuel, and is preparing to pack it into a capsule for launch Saturday, Oct. 16. Named after characters in Greek mythology, these asteroids circle the Sun in two swarms, with one group leading ahead of Jupiter in its path, the other trailing behind it. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit these asteroids. By studying these asteroids up close, scientists hope to hone their theories on how our solar system's planets formed 4.5 billion years ago and why they ended up in their current configuration. \"With Lucy, we're going to eight never-before-seen asteroids in 12 years with a single spacecraft,\" said Tom Statler, Lucy project scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for discovery as we probe into our solar system's distant past.\" Following all pandemic protocols, Lucy team members have spent the past eight weeks at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, preparing the spacecraft for flight. Engineers have tested the spacecraft's mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems and practiced executing the launch sequence from the mission operations centers at Kennedy and Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado. In early August, engineers installed the spacecraft's high-gain antenna, its second most prominent feature after the expansive solar arrays, which will allow the spacecraft to communicate with Earth. \"There has been a lot of hands-on work,\" said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, Lucy project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"This summer has gone by so fast; it's hard to believe we're nearly at launch.\" On Sept. 18, propulsion engineers finished filling Lucy's fuel tanks with approximately 1,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine and liquid oxygen, which make up 40% of the mass of the spacecraft. The fuel will be used for precise maneuvers that will propel Lucy to its asteroid destinations on schedule, while the solar arrays - each the width of a school bus - will recharge the batteries that will power spacecraft instruments. The Lucy spacecraft will soon be packed into the two halves of the launch vehicle fairing, which will close around it like a clamshell. After the spacecraft is encapsulated, the Lucy team will be able to communicate with it electrically through an \"umbilical cord.\" \"Launching a spacecraft is almost like sending a child off to college - you've done what can for them to get them ready for that next big step on their own,\" said Hal Levison, the principal investigator of the Lucy mission, based at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. In early October, the encapsulated spacecraft will be transported to the Vehicle Integration Facility at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, where it will be \"mated\" with the United Launch Alliance Atlas V 401 rocket. The Atlas V will lift off from Space Launch Complex 41.The rocket will carry Lucy outside Earth's atmosphere to begin the long journey to the Trojan asteroids. A few days prior to launch, engineers will power up the Lucy spacecraft in preparation for the mission. This process will take about 20 minutes. \"The spacecraft will sit in launch configuration and the engineering team will continuously monitor its health and status to make sure Lucy is ready to go,\" said Jessica Lounsbury, the Lucy project systems engineer at Goddard. \"And then it's launch day.\" Lucy's first launch attempt is scheduled for 5:34 a.m. EDT on Oct. 16. That day, the team will be \"called to stations\" at 1 a.m., which is when everyone is expected to arrive at mission control and other stations to monitor the spacecraft and run through the full launch countdown procedures. If weather or any other issues prohibit a launch that day, the team will have additional launch opportunities beginning the following day. Lucy's principal investigator is based out of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of Southwest Research Institute, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Goddard provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft. Lucy is the 13th mission in NASA's Discovery Program. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Discovery Program for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate director for science, tweeted Sunday that he's confident the array issue will be solved. \"NASA's Lucy mission is safe and stable,\" he said. \"The two solar arrays have deployed, but one may not be fully latched. The team is analyzing data to determine next steps. This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well.\" The two solar arrays were folded when Lucy launched and were designed to unfurl like Chinese fans once the spacecraft reached space. The arrays were expected to take 20 minutes to fully unfurl, which the mission's principal investigator said would \"determine if the rest of the 12-year mission will be a success.\" The solar panels were successfully deployed 91 minutes after launch. Now it's just a matter of getting the second one to latch properly. CNET reached out to the Lucy team for confirmation on how the unlatched arrays might affect performance and how the issue may be rectified but didn't immediately hear back. Lucy's ultimate goal is to explore a set of asteroids that travel in Jupiter's orbit and have never been studied up close before. These Trojan asteroids move as huge swarms, or camps, at the Lagrangian points in Jupiter's orbit. Lagrangian points are regions where the push and pull of gravity from both Jupiter and the sun lock the camps in place, leading and trailing Jupiter in its journey around the sun in perpetuity. The collection of amorphous space rocks is like a series of cosmic fossils, providing a window into the earliest era of our solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Lucy will act as a cosmic paleontologist, flying past eight \"fossils\" at a distance and studying their surfaces with infrared imagers and cameras.

The Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter holds the current record, but Lucy will be farther when it flies through the Trojan asteroids. Other far-flung predecessors have relied on nuclear power. The spacecraft's two solar arrays were too big to be opened simultaneously on Earth; the testing facility couldn't accommodate the wingspan. So Lucy's team opened one solar array, closed it, moved the spacecraft and then opened the other solar array. The spacecraft never attempted to open them at the same time before reaching microgravity. These solar arrays should generate 18,000 watts of power when the spacecraft is near Earth. Katie Oakman, Lucy's structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, said that's enough to power her house and a couple of her neighbors. Near the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's two solar arrays would generate just 500 watts of power. This would turn on a few lights in the living room but not power the microwave.

Unfortunately, a day after a successful launch, Lucy had problems. NASA named the craft Lucy in honor of the famous fossilized human ancestor. The mission's primary focus is to better better understand the solar system's formation by studying Trojan asteroids. NASA has experience with ambitious projects that require expensive technology and missions that do not always go as planned. For example, when the Hubble telescope was launched, astronauts had to fly to it and fix its defective mirrors. Recently, NASA has had its share of failures on Mars. NASA admitted defeat on its Insight Lander-a probe that could not penetrate the Red Planet's rocky surface. Three days after the launch of Lucy, NASA announced that only one of the solar arrays had fully deployed, while the other one only partially deployed. Lucy was settling into an Earth- orbiting cruise speed while top NASA experts tried to figure out how to solve the problem. The 12-year mission is possible thanks to Lucy's unique large solar panels-folded like origami to fit into the rocket payload carrier. The large solar panels are designed to harness enough energy for the craft as it moves further away from the sun. Without power, a spacecraft is good as dead. The latest NASA communications show that experts may be leaning towards their usual style of rolling with the problem due to the impossibilities of fixing it. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing,\" NASA said. So while engineers are looking into the data to understand what went wrong, they are also making calculations to figure out if Lucy will be able to do all the things it is supposed to do in the darker areas of the solar system. NASA admitted that they still cannot respond to whether the solar array malfunction will have long-term implications for the mission. Fortunately, other programmed tasks like thruster maneuvering and autonomous navigation configurations worked as planned. So it is more than likely that with or without a fully deployed solar array, Lucy will be directed to continue its journey to the swarms of Trojan asteroids. Scientists believe that these asteroids are remnants of the same material that formed giant planets and see them as \"fossilized space objects\" that hold the keys to understanding the solar system's evolution.

The eighth resides in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Sunlight is about 25 times weaker in the realm of the Trojans than the flow we experience here on Earth, so Lucy needs huge solar arrays to soak it up. Each of its two panels is 23.9 feet wide when fully deployed. Lucy will visit more asteroids than any other spacecraft, if all goes according to plan. And it will set another record as well: No solar-powered spacecraft has ever operated as far from the sun as Lucy aims to, although NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno probe comes close.

The NASA Lucy launch took place on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will fly 445 million miles away from Earth to explore swarms of asteroids that orbit the sun in two groups - one ahead of Jupiter, and one behind, according to NASA. They're called the Trojan asteroids, and no spacecraft ever paid them a visit. These asteroid clusters have been orbiting the Sun for billions of years, and NASA's pre-mission tests show that they're probably made from the same ancient material that originally formed planets like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn. In lunar terms, they're simple, but they're time capsules that could give humanity some incredible insights into the birth of the solar system and the formation of life. What's the NASA Lucy mission plan? The NASA Lucy mission's sheer distance means it's a long-term journey - the probe will fly past Earth on Oct. 15, 2022 and use our planet's gravitational pull in several different phases so it can be flung towards the Trojan clusters, according to NASA. Lucy will arrive at the main solar system's asteroid belt in April 2025, and it'll analyze seven different Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033. And then, in March 2033, the Lucy mission will end. But Lucy won't stop there - it will continue its solar orbit for millions of years. NASA first mooted Lucy in 2015, and it was formally picked as a viable mission in 2017. Its first designs were approved in 2018, and it began assembly and testing in August 2020. The final NASA Lucy spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July 2021 ahead of the autumn launch period, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy might seem an odd name for a space mission, but it's named after a fossilized skeleton called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. That fossil is around 3 million years old, and it taught us loads of new things about the evolution of humanity, according to Arizona State University. So it's a fitting name for a space mission that NASA hopes will lead to similar discoveries from interstellar fossils. What will the NASA Lucy spacecraft test? The NASA Lucy spacecraft will fly past seven Trojan asteroids and carry out remote testing with its range of advanced instruments. NASA plans to examine the geology on the surface of each asteroid to check out their age, structure and shape, and other tools will check each asteroid for minerals, ice and organic materials, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Other tools will measure the mass and density of each asteroid and will map their interior structures, too. NASA doesn't quite know what Lucy will find - after all, no mission has ever been there. But the mission will supply vital information about the formation of our solar system, and this sort of exploration is a vital part of scientific discovery. The NASA Lucy spacecraft uses solar energy for power in deep space, but it will orbit Earth, Mars and the sun and rely on their gravitational pull to start its journey to the outer reaches of space, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy's first task is to orbit the sun, and by October 2022 it'll hurtle back toward Earth and get a gravity-assisted boost that will speed up the spacecraft. This speed will take Lucy on a two-year orbit around Mars before it comes back to Earth in 2024 for another shot of gravitational help. It's this second shove that will propel Lucy toward the solar system's main asteroid belt - and, beyond that, to the first cluster of Trojan asteroids. Once it has looped around those, Lucy will head back to Earth for its third gravitational boost, and this will push the spacecraft in the opposite direction, toward the second group of Trojan satellites. Lucy's smallest target is in the solar system's main asteroid belt, not the Trojan clusters. The target is 130 million years old, and NASA will use this asteroid to test Lucy's instruments.

Spacecraft operations included discharging and charging the battery while pointed at Earth, moving the spacecraft to point to the Sun, operating the solar array motor with the launch day parameters, moving back to pointing at Earth, and then another battery discharge and recharge. The solar arrays charge the batteries, then the batteries are deliberately discharged, and the solar array circuits are used to recharge the batteries; performing these charging and discharging processes gives the team more information about the solar array circuits. The team gathered information on two of the 10 gores - the individual solar array panel segments that make up the full array - that previously had no data. NASA now has data on all 10 gores confirming they are open, producing power as expected, and not stuck together. These activities are helping the agency create a robust plan for attempting to fully deploy the array. Additional ground tests using the engineering model setup will validate a two-motor attempt for full deployment. NASA currently is creating a schedule and the resources needed to support that effort, as well as continuing to study the possibility of leaving the array as is.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-lucy-trojan-asteroid-mission-update-zeroing-in-on-path-forward-for-solar-array/amp/"}, {"title": "Lucy in the sky with asteroids: Planetary astronomers on team supporting first NASA mission to outer solar system bodies", "date": "2021-12-14", "content": "On Oct. 16, NASA launched the Lucy probe, starting its 12-year journey to the Trojan asteroids near the planet Jupiter in the outer solar system. Expected to begin reaching its targets in 2027, the probe will fly by more asteroids than any other spacecraft in history, including one in the \"main belt\" between Mars and Jupiter and eight Trojan asteroids-Donaldjohanson, Eurybates, Queta, Polymele, Leucus, Orus, Patroclus and Menoetius. \"The Trojan asteroids are leftovers from the early days of our solar system, effectively the fossils of planet formation,\" said Hal Levison, principal investigator on the Lucy mission. Because the asteroids are fossil-like remnants of our solar system's origins-having changed very little in the 4.6 billion years since they were formed-they are ideal for studying conditions in the early solar system. Scientists have designed Lucy to fly by and carry out remote sensing activities to achieve mission objectives by mapping surface geology, surface color and composition; study the asteroids' masses, densities and sub-surface composition; and look for rings and satellites of the Trojans. Lucy will travel four billion miles in all, reaching speeds of up to 92,000 mph, which means every step of the mission must be executed flawlessly. Planetary astronomer Josh Emery, professor in Northern Arizona University's Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science, leads the Surface Composition Working Group for the mission. It's his job to help plan the observations of the targets that are required to answer the open science questions about Trojan asteroids. The group will determine what materials the asteroids are made of as they search for ice, complex organic molecules and rocky material that will indicate where in the solar system the Trojan asteroids formed. \"The launch of Lucy was truly fantastic,\" Emery said. \"I have been studying the Trojan asteroids for my whole scientific career, since the 1990s, and I cannot wait to see these bodies close up.\" NAU Ph.D. student Audrey Martin also is heavily involved on the Lucy team. She has been studying data of Trojan asteroids captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope to learn what rocky minerals are present on their surfaces. Martin co-leads a sub-team on the mission that will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Lucy targets once it is launched. \"Working with the Lucy mission's science team is so exciting and unreal,\" Martin said. \"Being invited to the launch was an amazing privilege, and something not many graduate students can participate in. The launch itself was indescribable! I am so looking forward to continue working with the Lucy team on this amazing mission.\" One of the primary goals of the Lucy mission is figuring out where Trojan asteroids were originally formed. Martin said the observations Lucy sends back to Earth will demonstrate whether these bodies are more like the rocky asteroids of the inner solar system or the icy comets of the outer solar system. Trojans currently orbit the Sun at the same distance as Jupiter. There are more than 7,000 Trojan asteroids, which are located in two swarms-one 60 degrees in front of Jupiter in its orbit and one 60 degrees behind Jupiter. \"Our current understanding of the solar system suggests that the giant planets moved around a lot in the early stages of solar system history,\" she said. \"Learning where Trojans formed and how and when they were trapped in these regions is the best way to test whether this view for the history of the solar system is correct. The compositions determined by the working group that Professor Emery leads will be very important for distinguishing the formation locations of Trojans, and therefore the history of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://news.nau.edu/emery-lucy-probe/"}, {"title": "Watching the Blink of a Star to Size Up \"Trojan\" Asteroids for NASA's Lucy Mission", "date": "2022-01-07", "content": " Gathering near Las Vegas recently, dozens of astronomers spread throughout the region, pointed their telescopes at the sky, and waited for the moment on October 20 that the light from a faraway star blinked out. It was an event so minuscule it would have been easy to miss. Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16. The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an \"occultation,\" a 40-mile- wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow's predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple of hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape. This information will be used by Lucy researchers to supplement data gathered by the Lucy spacecraft's close flyby of Eurybates in 2027, which is designed to determine what the asteroid is made of and where in the solar system it formed billions of years ago. Why Occultations? An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer's view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. \"It really does look like a star just vanished,\" said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. \"It's kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.\" Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy's target destinations, known as \"Trojan\" asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter. Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it's challenging to precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. \"Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we'll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,\" said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid's mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. \"Lucy will see each asteroid's surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,\" Keeney said. To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow's path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the asteroid passes in front of it and then use the asteroid's known velocity to calculate its width. Since the occultation time, and thus width, is different at each point on the line where telescopes are stationed - with each telescope station corresponding to a different line across the asteroid - scientists can also determine the shape of an asteroid's silhouette by combining data from each telescope. By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. \"Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,\" said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid's shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile path. Today, that area is six times smaller. Astronomers' predictions have improved dramatically thanks to Hubble and ESA's Gaia satellite, which help pin down the precise locations of nearly 2 billion stars. Additionally, the trajectories of Lucy's fast-moving target asteroids are constantly monitored and refined using ground-based telescopes and occasionally Hubble. Buie calls occultation events \"mega campaigns,\" as they require large teams, precise location predictions for each telescope, and many telescopes for successful data collection. In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. \"Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA's mission,\" said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. \"If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would've seen anything,\" Buie said. \"The clouds would have wiped us out.\" The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather.

In an update Wednesday, NASA said Lucy's team is still working to resolve this issue.

NASA said it could attempt to latch the problem solar array in late April. In a lab on Earth, the mission team is testing a dual motor solar array deployment that would use the primary and backup motors. Using both motors at the same time could potentially apply enough force to latch the array. The team is also studying if they could leave the array unlatched.

At a Jan. 25 meeting NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, expressed confidence that, regardless if the solar array is fully deployed or not, the issue will not affect the spacecraft's ability to carry out its mission to study several Trojan asteroids leading and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. Shortly after its Oct. 16 launch, deployed two large circular solar arrays, each 7.3 meters in diameter. The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. \"Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. \"It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,\" he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a \"dynamic interaction\" between the two arrays during the deployment. Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,\" he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. \"The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we're planning.\" There's no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. \"We have plenty of time because we're not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,\" he said. \"We're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" That assessment matches the most recent NASA update about the mission, published Jan. 12. It stated that the current plan for the mission \"supports a latch attempt in the late April timeframe\" but that engineers were still studying leaving the array in its current unlatched condition. Levison added that all other aspects of the spacecraft, including its instruments, were working well. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt,\" he said. \"The instruments and the spacecraft are all behaving nominally.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/cause-of-lucy-solar-array-deployment-problem-identified/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy asteroid spacecraft still has a wonky solar array as it flies through space", "date": "2022-01-27", "content": "Three months after launch, a new NASA asteroid spacecraft is still getting settled into its life beyond Earth. NASA's Lucy mission launched Oct. 16 with a mission to explore the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind Jupiter. No spacecraft has ever visited the Trojan asteroids, which scientists believe are \"fossils\" from the formation of the solar system. But soon after launch, although the rest of the spacecraft's work has gone smoothly, the mission team realized that one of the spacecraft's two large solar arrays hadn't fully deployed. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try to figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said on Tuesday during a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group, which provides independent recommendations to the agency about studying moons, asteroids, comets and the like. However, Lucy is remaining in orbit around Earth for about a year before moving deeper into the solar system, and the arrays are much larger than they need to be in the relatively sunlit environment, so the situation isn't urgent. \"We have plenty of time, really, because we're not scheduled to fire the main engines for a while and we're in cruise,\" Levison said. \"So we're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" Levison also said that Lucy's current power production is sufficient to meet the mission's needs throughout the journey. \"The good news is that means we're producing over 90% of the expected power, it's actually 92 or 93%,\" Levison said. \"So power is not an issue for the spacecraft - nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" Lucy's two large solar arrays were folded up for the spacecraft's launch, then began deploying \"like a Chinese fan,\" as team members describe the process, into a decagon. Each array spans 24 feet and is opened by a lanyard rigged up to motors. One deployed completely, with the full 360 degrees unfurled and a latch closed to hold the array in place; the team's estimate suggests that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, preventing latching. Analysis completed since launch has suggested that an issue with the lanyard meant to pull the array open prevented full deployment. \"Through some unknown process, there was a period where there was no tension on the lanyard as it was deploying,\" Levison said. \"As a result, the lanyard fell off the spool. We think there's something like 30 inches 76 centimeters of lanyard remaining to be pulled in.\" The Lucy team is evaluating two options, he noted, adding that, \"both of them, I think, have a significantly good chance of success.\" One approach would attempt to finish deploying the temperamental solar array, turning the motors that work the lanyard back on. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can just pull a little harder, we might be able to get it all to latch,\" Levison said. However, the team doesn't want to rush this option. \"We're running it in a way it wasn't designed to run, so we've been spending quite a bit of time analyzing the risks in trying to do this redeploy.\" The other potential approach is to do nothing, since the solar array can meet the spacecraft's needs as it is. However, that would leave a gap in the array, like a missing pie slice, and would also leave the array without the support of the closed latch. \"We have plenty of power; the issue is the structural integrity of the array during main engine burns,\" Levison said. \"The forces and torques going through the array and particularly where it's connected to the spacecraft are different than designed.\" That distinction means that the team is building models and conducting analysis of what the spacecraft might experience during a main engine burn to ensure that leaving the array as is wouldn't damage the spacecraft, Levison said. \"The instruments and spacecraft are all behaving nominally,\" Levison said. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-solar-array-glitch-plan"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "NASA Lucy Spacecraft Update: Instruments Powering On and Working Normally", "date": "2021-11-05", "content": "The Lucy spacecraft continues to operate in cruise mode - the standard mode for outbound orbit.

The NASA Lucy launch took place on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will fly 445 million miles away from Earth to explore swarms of asteroids that orbit the sun in two groups - one ahead of Jupiter, and one behind, according to NASA. They're called the Trojan asteroids, and no spacecraft ever paid them a visit. These asteroid clusters have been orbiting the Sun for billions of years, and NASA's pre-mission tests show that they're probably made from the same ancient material that originally formed planets like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn. In lunar terms, they're simple, but they're time capsules that could give humanity some incredible insights into the birth of the solar system and the formation of life. What's the NASA Lucy mission plan? The NASA Lucy mission's sheer distance means it's a long-term journey - the probe will fly past Earth on Oct. 15, 2022 and use our planet's gravitational pull in several different phases so it can be flung towards the Trojan clusters, according to NASA. Lucy will arrive at the main solar system's asteroid belt in April 2025, and it'll analyze seven different Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033. And then, in March 2033, the Lucy mission will end. But Lucy won't stop there - it will continue its solar orbit for millions of years. NASA first mooted Lucy in 2015, and it was formally picked as a viable mission in 2017. Its first designs were approved in 2018, and it began assembly and testing in August 2020. The final NASA Lucy spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July 2021 ahead of the autumn launch period, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy might seem an odd name for a space mission, but it's named after a fossilized skeleton called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. That fossil is around 3 million years old, and it taught us loads of new things about the evolution of humanity, according to Arizona State University. So it's a fitting name for a space mission that NASA hopes will lead to similar discoveries from interstellar fossils. What will the NASA Lucy spacecraft test? The NASA Lucy spacecraft will fly past seven Trojan asteroids and carry out remote testing with its range of advanced instruments. NASA plans to examine the geology on the surface of each asteroid to check out their age, structure and shape, and other tools will check each asteroid for minerals, ice and organic materials, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Other tools will measure the mass and density of each asteroid and will map their interior structures, too. NASA doesn't quite know what Lucy will find - after all, no mission has ever been there. But the mission will supply vital information about the formation of our solar system, and this sort of exploration is a vital part of scientific discovery. The NASA Lucy spacecraft uses solar energy for power in deep space, but it will orbit Earth, Mars and the sun and rely on their gravitational pull to start its journey to the outer reaches of space, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy's first task is to orbit the sun, and by October 2022 it'll hurtle back toward Earth and get a gravity-assisted boost that will speed up the spacecraft. This speed will take Lucy on a two-year orbit around Mars before it comes back to Earth in 2024 for another shot of gravitational help. It's this second shove that will propel Lucy toward the solar system's main asteroid belt - and, beyond that, to the first cluster of Trojan asteroids. Once it has looped around those, Lucy will head back to Earth for its third gravitational boost, and this will push the spacecraft in the opposite direction, toward the second group of Trojan satellites. Lucy's smallest target is in the solar system's main asteroid belt, not the Trojan clusters. The target is 130 million years old, and NASA will use this asteroid to test Lucy's instruments.

Martin co-leads a sub-team on the mission that will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Lucy targets once it is launched. \"Working with the Lucy mission's science team is so exciting and unreal,\" Martin said. \"Being invited to the launch was an amazing privilege, and something not many graduate students can participate in. The launch itself was indescribable! I am so looking forward to continue working with the Lucy team on this amazing mission.\" One of the primary goals of the Lucy mission is figuring out where Trojan asteroids were originally formed. Martin said the observations Lucy sends back to Earth will demonstrate whether these bodies are more like the rocky asteroids of the inner solar system or the icy comets of the outer solar system. Trojans currently orbit the Sun at the same distance as Jupiter. There are more than 7,000 Trojan asteroids, which are located in two swarms-one 60 degrees in front of Jupiter in its orbit and one 60 degrees behind Jupiter. \"Our current understanding of the solar system suggests that the giant planets moved around a lot in the early stages of solar system history,\" she said. \"Learning where Trojans formed and how and when they were trapped in these regions is the best way to test whether this view for the history of the solar system is correct. The compositions determined by the working group that Professor Emery leads will be very important for distinguishing the formation locations of Trojans, and therefore the history of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://news.nau.edu/emery-lucy-probe/"}, {"title": "Watching the Blink of a Star to Size Up \"Trojan\" Asteroids for NASA's Lucy Mission", "date": "2022-01-07", "content": " Gathering near Las Vegas recently, dozens of astronomers spread throughout the region, pointed their telescopes at the sky, and waited for the moment on October 20 that the light from a faraway star blinked out. It was an event so minuscule it would have been easy to miss. Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16. The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an \"occultation,\" a 40-mile- wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow's predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple of hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape. This information will be used by Lucy researchers to supplement data gathered by the Lucy spacecraft's close flyby of Eurybates in 2027, which is designed to determine what the asteroid is made of and where in the solar system it formed billions of years ago. Why Occultations? An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer's view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. \"It really does look like a star just vanished,\" said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. \"It's kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.\" Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy's target destinations, known as \"Trojan\" asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter. Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it's challenging to precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. \"Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we'll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,\" said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid's mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. \"Lucy will see each asteroid's surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,\" Keeney said. To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow's path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the asteroid passes in front of it and then use the asteroid's known velocity to calculate its width. Since the occultation time, and thus width, is different at each point on the line where telescopes are stationed - with each telescope station corresponding to a different line across the asteroid - scientists can also determine the shape of an asteroid's silhouette by combining data from each telescope. By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. \"Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,\" said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid's shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile path. Today, that area is six times smaller. Astronomers' predictions have improved dramatically thanks to Hubble and ESA's Gaia satellite, which help pin down the precise locations of nearly 2 billion stars. Additionally, the trajectories of Lucy's fast-moving target asteroids are constantly monitored and refined using ground-based telescopes and occasionally Hubble. Buie calls occultation events \"mega campaigns,\" as they require large teams, precise location predictions for each telescope, and many telescopes for successful data collection. In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. \"Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA's mission,\" said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. \"If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would've seen anything,\" Buie said. \"The clouds would have wiped us out.\" The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather.

NASA said it could attempt to latch the problem solar array in late April. In a lab on Earth, the mission team is testing a dual motor solar array deployment that would use the primary and backup motors. Using both motors at the same time could potentially apply enough force to latch the array. The team is also studying if they could leave the array unlatched.

At a Jan. 25 meeting NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, expressed confidence that, regardless if the solar array is fully deployed or not, the issue will not affect the spacecraft's ability to carry out its mission to study several Trojan asteroids leading and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. Shortly after its Oct. 16 launch, deployed two large circular solar arrays, each 7.3 meters in diameter. The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. \"Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. \"It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,\" he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a \"dynamic interaction\" between the two arrays during the deployment. Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,\" he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. \"The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we're planning.\" There's no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. \"We have plenty of time because we're not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,\" he said. \"We're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" That assessment matches the most recent NASA update about the mission, published Jan. 12. It stated that the current plan for the mission \"supports a latch attempt in the late April timeframe\" but that engineers were still studying leaving the array in its current unlatched condition. Levison added that all other aspects of the spacecraft, including its instruments, were working well. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt,\" he said. \"The instruments and the spacecraft are all behaving nominally.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/cause-of-lucy-solar-array-deployment-problem-identified/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy asteroid spacecraft still has a wonky solar array as it flies through space", "date": "2022-01-27", "content": "Three months after launch, a new NASA asteroid spacecraft is still getting settled into its life beyond Earth. NASA's Lucy mission launched Oct. 16 with a mission to explore the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind Jupiter. No spacecraft has ever visited the Trojan asteroids, which scientists believe are \"fossils\" from the formation of the solar system. But soon after launch, although the rest of the spacecraft's work has gone smoothly, the mission team realized that one of the spacecraft's two large solar arrays hadn't fully deployed. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try to figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said on Tuesday during a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group, which provides independent recommendations to the agency about studying moons, asteroids, comets and the like. However, Lucy is remaining in orbit around Earth for about a year before moving deeper into the solar system, and the arrays are much larger than they need to be in the relatively sunlit environment, so the situation isn't urgent. \"We have plenty of time, really, because we're not scheduled to fire the main engines for a while and we're in cruise,\" Levison said. \"So we're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" Levison also said that Lucy's current power production is sufficient to meet the mission's needs throughout the journey. \"The good news is that means we're producing over 90% of the expected power, it's actually 92 or 93%,\" Levison said. \"So power is not an issue for the spacecraft - nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" Lucy's two large solar arrays were folded up for the spacecraft's launch, then began deploying \"like a Chinese fan,\" as team members describe the process, into a decagon. Each array spans 24 feet and is opened by a lanyard rigged up to motors. One deployed completely, with the full 360 degrees unfurled and a latch closed to hold the array in place; the team's estimate suggests that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, preventing latching. Analysis completed since launch has suggested that an issue with the lanyard meant to pull the array open prevented full deployment. \"Through some unknown process, there was a period where there was no tension on the lanyard as it was deploying,\" Levison said. \"As a result, the lanyard fell off the spool. We think there's something like 30 inches 76 centimeters of lanyard remaining to be pulled in.\" The Lucy team is evaluating two options, he noted, adding that, \"both of them, I think, have a significantly good chance of success.\" One approach would attempt to finish deploying the temperamental solar array, turning the motors that work the lanyard back on. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can just pull a little harder, we might be able to get it all to latch,\" Levison said. However, the team doesn't want to rush this option. \"We're running it in a way it wasn't designed to run, so we've been spending quite a bit of time analyzing the risks in trying to do this redeploy.\" The other potential approach is to do nothing, since the solar array can meet the spacecraft's needs as it is. However, that would leave a gap in the array, like a missing pie slice, and would also leave the array without the support of the closed latch. \"We have plenty of power; the issue is the structural integrity of the array during main engine burns,\" Levison said. \"The forces and torques going through the array and particularly where it's connected to the spacecraft are different than designed.\" That distinction means that the team is building models and conducting analysis of what the spacecraft might experience during a main engine burn to ensure that leaving the array as is wouldn't damage the spacecraft, Levison said. \"The instruments and spacecraft are all behaving nominally,\" Levison said. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-solar-array-glitch-plan"}, {"title": "Here's the view from a NASA spacecraft bound for Jupiter asteroids", "date": "2022-04-19", "content": "The journey out to Jupiter's orbit is full of stars. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is early in its long trek to explore a group of asteroids called the Jupiter Trojans, which are small remnants of our early solar system that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the sun. Lucy launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Oct. 16, 2021, and is preparing for an Earth flyby this fall before it begins its asteroid explorations. During the cruise, mission personnel are also completing tasks like instrument calibration, and new images taken during a February test of the spacecraft's four visible-light cameras offer a detailed view of 11 different star fields. The spacecraft's four cameras include the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera and the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager. The calibration test, which occurred on Feb. 14, used Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform to test the cameras' performance, sensitivity and accuracy when pointed in different directions, according to the NASA statement. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view and are used to automatically lock onto and track certain targets, such as the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. In turn, the twin cameras help ensure that the spacecraft's other instruments are pointed at the target. One of the Feb. 14 test images was a 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula, which is visible in the lower right center of the frame, taken using the T2CAM. MVIC, which is part of the L'Ralph instrument, is a higher-resolution color scanning camera that produces panoramic views of space. During the test, a narrow part of the T2CAM field was captured and processed so that the faint stars could be seen against the dark backdrop of space. Lucy's most sensitive camera, L'LORRI, is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera with a narrow 0.29-degree-square field of view. It is the same kind of telescope as the instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope and will capture the most detailed images of the mission's asteroid targets. The test images captured stars roughly 50,000 times fainter than the unaided human eye can see, according to the NASA statement. The Feb. 14 test was a follow-up to the first set of test images taken in November 2021, only a few months after Lucy's launch. Therefore, this recent test was much more extensive, allowing the spacecraft's team to test its camera functionality. However, the test did not include Lucy's infrared spectrometer LEISA, which is also part of the L'Ralph instrument, or the spacecraft's temperature mapping L'TES instrument, which requires close-up planetary targets to obtain useful data. The Lucy spacecraft is slated to arrive at its first target in 2025 - a main belt asteroid named 52246 Donaldjohanson after the paleontologist who discovered the hominin fossil Lucy that is the mission's namesake.", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-lucy-asteroid-mission-test-star-photos"}, {"title": "See Postcards From NASA's Lucy Spacecraft as It Journeys to Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids", "date": "2022-04-20", "content": "Traveling through space can get lonely. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is currently on a six-year journey to Jupiter, traveling through the sparse interplanetary medium since launching in October 2021. Luckily for Lucy, the views have been spectacular. The spacecraft recently captured a series of calibration images, pointing its brand new cameras at 11 different star fields to make sure its photography skills are up to par. The latest batch of images were taken in February, which NASA did to test the spacecraft's camera performance and sensitivity, as well as its ability to point in different directions, according to the space agency. Lucy is on a mission to study the Trojan asteroids, two groups of rocky bodies that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. The Trojans may have existed for the past 4 billion years, but very little is known about them since no spacecraft has paid them a visit just yet. But before Lucy reaches its destination, the team behind the mission is working to ensure the probe's instruments are working properly in space. The spacecraft pointed its cameras toward the Orion Constellation, capturing different groups of stars, as well as a faint, 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula. Lucy is equipped with four visible light cameras: the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and the Long- Range Reconnaissance Imager. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view, and they are designed to automatically lock onto and track the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. The MVIC is a higher-resolution color scanning camera, while L'LORRI is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera designed to capture detailed images of the asteroids. A raw image from L'LORRI revealed stars that are 50,000 times fainter than what the unaided human eye can see. The recent image-taking was a follow-up to an initial test of Lucy's cameras conducted in November, shortly after the spacecraft launched. However, the team has not yet tested Lucy's infrared spectrometer, known as LEISA, or its temperature mapping L'TES instrument, both of which require close-up planetary targets, according to NASA. Shortly after it launched, one of Lucy's solar arrays failed to unfurl properly. However, the spacecraft's systems have been operating normally and the glitch does not seem to have had a major effect on the mission so far. Lucy is named after an exceptionally old hominid fossil found in Ethiopia in 1974, one that provided valuable insights into human evolution. The Lucy spacecraft, by exploring Jupiter's Trojans, could do the same for our understanding of the solar system and its origin story. Lucy is expected to reach the Trojan asteroids in 2027.

Two large arrays of solar cells, which were designed to unfold and latch into place after launch, power the spacecraft. One of the fan-like arrays opened as expected, but the other stopped just short of completing this operation. Through a combination of rigorous in-flight solar array characterization and ground testing, Lucy engineers determined the unlatched solar array is nearly fully open, positioned at approximately 345 out of the full 360 degrees, and is producing ample energy for the spacecraft. Nonetheless, the team is concerned about potential damage to the array if the spacecraft conducts a main engine burn in its present configuration. After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array. The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remain to be retracted for the open array to latch. The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch. The team is now preparing to complete the solar array deployment in two steps. The first step, tentatively scheduled for the week of May 9, is intended to pull in most of the remaining lanyard and verify that flight results are consistent with ground testing. This step will also strengthen the array by bringing it closer to a fully tensioned state. Because this step is designed to be limited in duration, the array is not likely to latch at that point. If this step goes as planned, the second step will continue the array deployment with the intent to fully latch. Information gleaned from the first part will help fine-tune the second. The second step is currently planned for a month after the initial one, giving engineers enough time to analyze the data seen in the first attempt.

It's headed out to Jupiter's orbit - not Jupiter itself, but its orbit - to pass by quite a few asteroids that share their path with the giant planet. In one sense it's the most ambitious asteroid mission ever created: It will take close-up images of at least seven asteroids! These are called Trojan asteroids, and they may have been orbiting the Sun along with Jupiter since the dawn of the solar system. They collect in two spots, one 60\u00b0 ahead and the other 60\u00b0 behind Jupiter in its orbit, and having so many together makes it much easier to get close to and study so many of them in a single mission. Shortly before its launch, I wrote an overview of the mission and its extremely wild trajectory through the inner solar system. Normally you don't hear much from missions like this until they get close to their goal, but as it happens images obtained on Feb. 14, 2022 were just released. They were taken by engineers on Earth to test Lucy's cameras, and they're pretty cool. This photo, taken on Earth in New Mexico, shows the familiar sight of Orion as well as part of Gemini and Monoceros. The image is a long unguided exposure, so the stars are streaked a bit due to Earth's rotation, but it's sufficient for the purpose of showing where Lucy's cameras were pointed when they took their engineering test observations. The red rectangle shows the field of view of Lucy's Terminal Tracking Cameras, also called T2C. These are a pair of cameras - one for main operations and the other as a backup in case something goes awry with the first - with a large field of view that will be used as Lucy approaches each of its asteroid targets. The stars in the field will be analyzed on board to aid in autonomous tracking of the asteroids. It takes roughly half an hour at least for light to reach Earth from Jupiter's orbit, which is too long to control the imaging sequences from the ground, so the spacecraft has to do it itself. The T2C can also take science data; the wide field of view means that even at close approach they can get the whole asteroid at once, and as the spacecraft moves these images can be used to make 3D stereo pairs to determine some surface topography on the asteroids, which is extremely cool. The engineering test image is a little ratty - there's background noise, for example, but that can be processed out - but you can still see a zillion stars. That fuzzy patch at the bottom right is real: That's the fantastic Rosette Nebula, a star- forming gas cloud about 5,000 light years away, with thousands of newborn stars in it. The fact that it can be seen at all in this 10-second exposure speaks well of the camera's sensitivity. The blue strip in the first image shows the field of view of Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, or MVIC, one of the detectors on a camera called L'Ralph. The name is... interesting; the first Ralph camera flew on the New Horizon Pluto mission, and was named that because a different camera on that spacecraft was called Alice, after the husband and wife characters in the old sitcom The Honeymooners. The Ralph camera on Lucy is the same setup, so they called it L'Ralph to show it's a part of Lucy. Anyway, MVIC has five filters that select colors associated with different minerals expected to be seen on the asteroids' surfaces. Although the exposure time was less than one second, many stars can be seen. Note this field overlaps that of T2C so that they can see the same thing at the same time, which will help in scientific analysis. The tiny yellow square in the center of the first image shows the field of view of L'LORRI - the Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager - the highest-resolution camera on Lucy, meaning it will see the most details on the asteroids. In the 10-second test image, stars 1/25,000th as faint as the human eye can see are visible. They're slightly elongated due to the long exposure, but this can be compensated for during science exposures to make usable images. Clearly L'LORRI will be able to see faint details on the asteroids, and is one of the workhorse cameras on Lucy that will provide a vast amount of scientific data. Although none of these images will win a prize for their beauty, they are all indeed beautiful: They show us a working spacecraft 6 months into a mission that will last for many, many years. We're just now T-3 years before it passes its first asteroid - Donaldjohanson, a main- belt rock about 4 kilometers wide - so it won't be too long before the first science images get sent to Earth, and we visit yet another asteroid up close and personal. What will we see? If we knew, we wouldn't have to send missions there. With every spacecraft that investigates new objects up close, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected, and it's never a surprise that we will be surprised.

The problem is with one of Lucy's two solar arrays. These needed to be folded up for launch so the spacecraft could fit inside its launch vehicle, then they deployed once Lucy reached space. The arrays deployed by unfolding, fan-like, into two distinctive round shapes which should then have been latched into place. But one solar array failed to latch correctly after deployment on October 17, 2021. The array was almost completely deployed and was still capable of providing solar energy to the spacecraft, but it was not secured in place as it should have been. The mission team opted to continue with the craft entering cruise mode as planned because the combined two arrays were generating enough power for the mission to go ahead. Now, though, NASA wants to try to lock the array in place once again. Engineers on the ground have been performing tests and looking at data from the spacecraft and have concluded that the array in question is open to 345 out of 360 degrees and is still producing enough power. But there are concerns that if and when the spacecraft fires its main engine, the unlocked solar array could be damaged. In a recent update, NASA shared that on Monday, April 18, the team decided to go ahead with trying to fix the array into its proper place. To do that, they will work with the motor which controls the array deployment. \"After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array,\" NASA writes. \"The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remains to be retracted for the open array to latch.\" The array has both a primary and a backup motor for this deployment, so engineers will try to use both of these motors together to pull the lanyard through and allow the array to latch into place. Testing suggests that the additional torque from using both motors may be enough to tug the lanyard out of its snag. Enacting this plan will require two steps. The first step, scheduled to begin in the week of May 9, is to pull the lanyard taut, which will allow the team to check that the spacecraft is in the same condition as the testing on the ground and will also help to strengthen the array. The second step, scheduled for a month after step one if everything goes well, will be to use the two motors to try to pull the array into place.

On Thursday, the Lucy team announced that it would perform two maneuvers to fully unfurl its solar arrays. The Lucy mission will study the crumbs leftover from the early Solar System, and it needs to reach Jupiter's orbit, where two gravitational crevices have collected them. Operating farther from the Sun requires big solar arrays to capture the diminishing sunlight for energy, so Lucy was equipped with two peeper-like solar wings. Shortly after its October 2021 launch, NASA officials noticed something was wrong with one of the solar arrays. Its readings were unusual, and personnel soon realized that the lanyard wrapping around one solar array hadn't fully retracted, blocking some sunlight from reaching the panels. An engineering model suggests that upon retracting, \"the lanyard may not have wound on the spool as intended,\" NASA reported one month after launch. According to NASA officials, the faulty array is between 75 percent and 95 percent deployed. The space agency has been monitoring the situation for the last half-year, and on April 18, they decided on a plan forward they hope will solve the issue. They will perform two steps over the next several months to see if the solar array can be fully deployed. The first will happen on May 9, when they will attempt to reel back some of the lanyard in a quick maneuver. The team anticipates that this single operation won't be enough, so they are planning a second array deployment task for a month later, which will hopefully successfully latch the solar array. The month between each task will give the teams time to analyze the best way to perform the second maneuver. \"The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch,\" NASA officials shared in a mission update published last Thursday. So far, the issue hasn't affected the mission too severely. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing. This power level is enough to keep the spacecraft healthy and functioning,\" NASA officials shared three days after launch. Having fully charged batteries is important. Lucy is heading out to Jupiter at a speed of roughly 67,000 mph to study the Trojan asteroids, peculiar rocks significantly different from those found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The Trojans are leftover pieces from the formation of the Solar System that were looped into Jupiter's orbit and thus avoided being ejected into deep space. The Trojans are trapped in two gravitationally stable spots called Lagrange Point 4 and Lagrange Point 5, created by the interaction of the Sun and Jupiter. Lucy will study seven asteroids over 12 years, so having fully-operating batteries will be critical. The team also hopes that, if the lanyard cannot be retracted and the solar array has to stay the way it is, the main engine burns won't mess with the solar array. Lucy will reach its first target in 2025, an Asteroid Belt object dubbed Donaldjohanson. After its encounter with that asteroid, the craft will continue toward the group of Trojans residing in front of Jupiter, targeting a 2027 arrival. After that, a maneuver will bring it back to the inner Solar System to use Earth for a gravity assist in 2031, only to swing back out for a second Trojan trip in 2033 toward the trailing asteroids. The mission is named after the three million-year-old hominid fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Donaldjohanson is named after Lucy's discoverer. \"Lucy\" is both an homage to the science of origins and likely a nod to The Beatles' song that inspired the fossil's name, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator, has previously compared the Trojans to jewels for their \"immense scientific value.\"", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/science/lucy-solar-array-may-maneuver"}]}, {"win label": 0, "news": [{"title": "Lucy mission: NASA's asteroid explorer", "date": "2021-12-06", "content": "The NASA Lucy mission is an incredible space expedition that will explore the history of the solar system and reveal more about life on Earth. The NASA Lucy launch took place on Oct. 16, 2021, and the spacecraft will fly 445 million miles away from Earth to explore swarms of asteroids that orbit the sun in two groups - one ahead of Jupiter, and one behind, according to NASA. They're called the Trojan asteroids, and no spacecraft ever paid them a visit. These asteroid clusters have been orbiting the Sun for billions of years, and NASA's pre-mission tests show that they're probably made from the same ancient material that originally formed planets like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn. In lunar terms, they're simple, but they're time capsules that could give humanity some incredible insights into the birth of the solar system and the formation of life. What's the NASA Lucy mission plan? The NASA Lucy mission's sheer distance means it's a long-term journey - the probe will fly past Earth on Oct. 15, 2022 and use our planet's gravitational pull in several different phases so it can be flung towards the Trojan clusters, according to NASA. Lucy will arrive at the main solar system's asteroid belt in April 2025, and it'll analyze seven different Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033. And then, in March 2033, the Lucy mission will end. But Lucy won't stop there - it will continue its solar orbit for millions of years. NASA first mooted Lucy in 2015, and it was formally picked as a viable mission in 2017. Its first designs were approved in 2018, and it began assembly and testing in August 2020. The final NASA Lucy spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July 2021 ahead of the autumn launch period, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy might seem an odd name for a space mission, but it's named after a fossilized skeleton called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. That fossil is around 3 million years old, and it taught us loads of new things about the evolution of humanity, according to Arizona State University. So it's a fitting name for a space mission that NASA hopes will lead to similar discoveries from interstellar fossils. What will the NASA Lucy spacecraft test? The NASA Lucy spacecraft will fly past seven Trojan asteroids and carry out remote testing with its range of advanced instruments. NASA plans to examine the geology on the surface of each asteroid to check out their age, structure and shape, and other tools will check each asteroid for minerals, ice and organic materials, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Other tools will measure the mass and density of each asteroid and will map their interior structures, too. NASA doesn't quite know what Lucy will find - after all, no mission has ever been there. But the mission will supply vital information about the formation of our solar system, and this sort of exploration is a vital part of scientific discovery. The NASA Lucy spacecraft uses solar energy for power in deep space, but it will orbit Earth, Mars and the sun and rely on their gravitational pull to start its journey to the outer reaches of space, according to NASA's Lucy mission webpage. Lucy's first task is to orbit the sun, and by October 2022 it'll hurtle back toward Earth and get a gravity-assisted boost that will speed up the spacecraft. This speed will take Lucy on a two-year orbit around Mars before it comes back to Earth in 2024 for another shot of gravitational help. It's this second shove that will propel Lucy toward the solar system's main asteroid belt - and, beyond that, to the first cluster of Trojan asteroids. Once it has looped around those, Lucy will head back to Earth for its third gravitational boost, and this will push the spacecraft in the opposite direction, toward the second group of Trojan satellites. Lucy's smallest target is in the solar system's main asteroid belt, not the Trojan clusters. The target is 130 million years old, and NASA will use this asteroid to test Lucy's instruments.

A project team completed an assessment on December 1 of the ongoing solar array issue, which did not appear to fully deploy as planned after launch in late October. Initial ground tests determined additional motor operations are required to increase the probability of the latching Lucy's array in place as intended, and the team has recommended additional testing. Spacecraft operations included discharging and charging the battery while pointed at Earth, moving the spacecraft to point to the Sun, operating the solar array motor with the launch day parameters, moving back to pointing at Earth, and then another battery discharge and recharge. The solar arrays charge the batteries, then the batteries are deliberately discharged, and the solar array circuits are used to recharge the batteries; performing these charging and discharging processes gives the team more information about the solar array circuits. The team gathered information on two of the 10 gores - the individual solar array panel segments that make up the full array - that previously had no data. NASA now has data on all 10 gores confirming they are open, producing power as expected, and not stuck together. These activities are helping the agency create a robust plan for attempting to fully deploy the array. Additional ground tests using the engineering model setup will validate a two-motor attempt for full deployment. NASA currently is creating a schedule and the resources needed to support that effort, as well as continuing to study the possibility of leaving the array as is.", "url": "https://scitechdaily.com/nasa-lucy-trojan-asteroid-mission-update-zeroing-in-on-path-forward-for-solar-array/amp/"}, {"title": "Lucy in the sky with asteroids: Planetary astronomers on team supporting first NASA mission to outer solar system bodies", "date": "2021-12-14", "content": "On Oct. 16, NASA launched the Lucy probe, starting its 12-year journey to the Trojan asteroids near the planet Jupiter in the outer solar system. Expected to begin reaching its targets in 2027, the probe will fly by more asteroids than any other spacecraft in history, including one in the \"main belt\" between Mars and Jupiter and eight Trojan asteroids-Donaldjohanson, Eurybates, Queta, Polymele, Leucus, Orus, Patroclus and Menoetius. \"The Trojan asteroids are leftovers from the early days of our solar system, effectively the fossils of planet formation,\" said Hal Levison, principal investigator on the Lucy mission. Because the asteroids are fossil-like remnants of our solar system's origins-having changed very little in the 4.6 billion years since they were formed-they are ideal for studying conditions in the early solar system. Scientists have designed Lucy to fly by and carry out remote sensing activities to achieve mission objectives by mapping surface geology, surface color and composition; study the asteroids' masses, densities and sub-surface composition; and look for rings and satellites of the Trojans. Lucy will travel four billion miles in all, reaching speeds of up to 92,000 mph, which means every step of the mission must be executed flawlessly. Planetary astronomer Josh Emery, professor in Northern Arizona University's Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science, leads the Surface Composition Working Group for the mission. It's his job to help plan the observations of the targets that are required to answer the open science questions about Trojan asteroids. The group will determine what materials the asteroids are made of as they search for ice, complex organic molecules and rocky material that will indicate where in the solar system the Trojan asteroids formed. \"The launch of Lucy was truly fantastic,\" Emery said. \"I have been studying the Trojan asteroids for my whole scientific career, since the 1990s, and I cannot wait to see these bodies close up.\" NAU Ph.D. student Audrey Martin also is heavily involved on the Lucy team. She has been studying data of Trojan asteroids captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope to learn what rocky minerals are present on their surfaces. Martin co-leads a sub-team on the mission that will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to observe the Lucy targets once it is launched. \"Working with the Lucy mission's science team is so exciting and unreal,\" Martin said. \"Being invited to the launch was an amazing privilege, and something not many graduate students can participate in. The launch itself was indescribable! I am so looking forward to continue working with the Lucy team on this amazing mission.\" One of the primary goals of the Lucy mission is figuring out where Trojan asteroids were originally formed. Martin said the observations Lucy sends back to Earth will demonstrate whether these bodies are more like the rocky asteroids of the inner solar system or the icy comets of the outer solar system. Trojans currently orbit the Sun at the same distance as Jupiter. There are more than 7,000 Trojan asteroids, which are located in two swarms-one 60 degrees in front of Jupiter in its orbit and one 60 degrees behind Jupiter. \"Our current understanding of the solar system suggests that the giant planets moved around a lot in the early stages of solar system history,\" she said. \"Learning where Trojans formed and how and when they were trapped in these regions is the best way to test whether this view for the history of the solar system is correct. The compositions determined by the working group that Professor Emery leads will be very important for distinguishing the formation locations of Trojans, and therefore the history of the solar system.\" ", "url": "https://news.nau.edu/emery-lucy-probe/"}, {"title": "Watching the Blink of a Star to Size Up \"Trojan\" Asteroids for NASA's Lucy Mission", "date": "2022-01-07", "content": " Gathering near Las Vegas recently, dozens of astronomers spread throughout the region, pointed their telescopes at the sky, and waited for the moment on October 20 that the light from a faraway star blinked out. It was an event so minuscule it would have been easy to miss. Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16. The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an \"occultation,\" a 40-mile- wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow's predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple of hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape. This information will be used by Lucy researchers to supplement data gathered by the Lucy spacecraft's close flyby of Eurybates in 2027, which is designed to determine what the asteroid is made of and where in the solar system it formed billions of years ago. Why Occultations? An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer's view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. \"It really does look like a star just vanished,\" said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. \"It's kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.\" Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy's target destinations, known as \"Trojan\" asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter. Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it's challenging to precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. \"Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we'll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,\" said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid's mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. \"Lucy will see each asteroid's surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,\" Keeney said. To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow's path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the asteroid passes in front of it and then use the asteroid's known velocity to calculate its width. Since the occultation time, and thus width, is different at each point on the line where telescopes are stationed - with each telescope station corresponding to a different line across the asteroid - scientists can also determine the shape of an asteroid's silhouette by combining data from each telescope. By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. \"Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,\" said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid's shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile path. Today, that area is six times smaller. Astronomers' predictions have improved dramatically thanks to Hubble and ESA's Gaia satellite, which help pin down the precise locations of nearly 2 billion stars. Additionally, the trajectories of Lucy's fast-moving target asteroids are constantly monitored and refined using ground-based telescopes and occasionally Hubble. Buie calls occultation events \"mega campaigns,\" as they require large teams, precise location predictions for each telescope, and many telescopes for successful data collection. In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. \"Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA's mission,\" said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. \"If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would've seen anything,\" Buie said. \"The clouds would have wiped us out.\" The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather.

At a Jan. 25 meeting NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, expressed confidence that, regardless if the solar array is fully deployed or not, the issue will not affect the spacecraft's ability to carry out its mission to study several Trojan asteroids leading and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. Shortly after its Oct. 16 launch, deployed two large circular solar arrays, each 7.3 meters in diameter. The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. \"Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. \"It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,\" he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a \"dynamic interaction\" between the two arrays during the deployment. Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,\" he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. \"The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we're planning.\" There's no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. \"We have plenty of time because we're not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,\" he said. \"We're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" That assessment matches the most recent NASA update about the mission, published Jan. 12. It stated that the current plan for the mission \"supports a latch attempt in the late April timeframe\" but that engineers were still studying leaving the array in its current unlatched condition. Levison added that all other aspects of the spacecraft, including its instruments, were working well. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt,\" he said. \"The instruments and the spacecraft are all behaving nominally.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/cause-of-lucy-solar-array-deployment-problem-identified/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy asteroid spacecraft still has a wonky solar array as it flies through space", "date": "2022-01-27", "content": "Three months after launch, a new NASA asteroid spacecraft is still getting settled into its life beyond Earth. NASA's Lucy mission launched Oct. 16 with a mission to explore the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind Jupiter. No spacecraft has ever visited the Trojan asteroids, which scientists believe are \"fossils\" from the formation of the solar system. But soon after launch, although the rest of the spacecraft's work has gone smoothly, the mission team realized that one of the spacecraft's two large solar arrays hadn't fully deployed. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try to figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said on Tuesday during a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group, which provides independent recommendations to the agency about studying moons, asteroids, comets and the like. However, Lucy is remaining in orbit around Earth for about a year before moving deeper into the solar system, and the arrays are much larger than they need to be in the relatively sunlit environment, so the situation isn't urgent. \"We have plenty of time, really, because we're not scheduled to fire the main engines for a while and we're in cruise,\" Levison said. \"So we're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" Levison also said that Lucy's current power production is sufficient to meet the mission's needs throughout the journey. \"The good news is that means we're producing over 90% of the expected power, it's actually 92 or 93%,\" Levison said. \"So power is not an issue for the spacecraft - nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" Lucy's two large solar arrays were folded up for the spacecraft's launch, then began deploying \"like a Chinese fan,\" as team members describe the process, into a decagon. Each array spans 24 feet and is opened by a lanyard rigged up to motors. One deployed completely, with the full 360 degrees unfurled and a latch closed to hold the array in place; the team's estimate suggests that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, preventing latching. Analysis completed since launch has suggested that an issue with the lanyard meant to pull the array open prevented full deployment. \"Through some unknown process, there was a period where there was no tension on the lanyard as it was deploying,\" Levison said. \"As a result, the lanyard fell off the spool. We think there's something like 30 inches 76 centimeters of lanyard remaining to be pulled in.\" The Lucy team is evaluating two options, he noted, adding that, \"both of them, I think, have a significantly good chance of success.\" One approach would attempt to finish deploying the temperamental solar array, turning the motors that work the lanyard back on. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can just pull a little harder, we might be able to get it all to latch,\" Levison said. However, the team doesn't want to rush this option. \"We're running it in a way it wasn't designed to run, so we've been spending quite a bit of time analyzing the risks in trying to do this redeploy.\" The other potential approach is to do nothing, since the solar array can meet the spacecraft's needs as it is. However, that would leave a gap in the array, like a missing pie slice, and would also leave the array without the support of the closed latch. \"We have plenty of power; the issue is the structural integrity of the array during main engine burns,\" Levison said. \"The forces and torques going through the array and particularly where it's connected to the spacecraft are different than designed.\" That distinction means that the team is building models and conducting analysis of what the spacecraft might experience during a main engine burn to ensure that leaving the array as is wouldn't damage the spacecraft, Levison said. \"The instruments and spacecraft are all behaving nominally,\" Levison said. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-solar-array-glitch-plan"}, {"title": "Here's the view from a NASA spacecraft bound for Jupiter asteroids", "date": "2022-04-19", "content": "The journey out to Jupiter's orbit is full of stars. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is early in its long trek to explore a group of asteroids called the Jupiter Trojans, which are small remnants of our early solar system that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the sun. Lucy launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Oct. 16, 2021, and is preparing for an Earth flyby this fall before it begins its asteroid explorations. During the cruise, mission personnel are also completing tasks like instrument calibration, and new images taken during a February test of the spacecraft's four visible-light cameras offer a detailed view of 11 different star fields. The spacecraft's four cameras include the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera and the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager. The calibration test, which occurred on Feb. 14, used Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform to test the cameras' performance, sensitivity and accuracy when pointed in different directions, according to the NASA statement. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view and are used to automatically lock onto and track certain targets, such as the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. In turn, the twin cameras help ensure that the spacecraft's other instruments are pointed at the target. One of the Feb. 14 test images was a 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula, which is visible in the lower right center of the frame, taken using the T2CAM. MVIC, which is part of the L'Ralph instrument, is a higher-resolution color scanning camera that produces panoramic views of space. During the test, a narrow part of the T2CAM field was captured and processed so that the faint stars could be seen against the dark backdrop of space. Lucy's most sensitive camera, L'LORRI, is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera with a narrow 0.29-degree-square field of view. It is the same kind of telescope as the instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope and will capture the most detailed images of the mission's asteroid targets. The test images captured stars roughly 50,000 times fainter than the unaided human eye can see, according to the NASA statement. The Feb. 14 test was a follow-up to the first set of test images taken in November 2021, only a few months after Lucy's launch. Therefore, this recent test was much more extensive, allowing the spacecraft's team to test its camera functionality. However, the test did not include Lucy's infrared spectrometer LEISA, which is also part of the L'Ralph instrument, or the spacecraft's temperature mapping L'TES instrument, which requires close-up planetary targets to obtain useful data.

The Trojans may have existed for the past 4 billion years, but very little is known about them since no spacecraft has paid them a visit just yet. But before Lucy reaches its destination, the team behind the mission is working to ensure the probe's instruments are working properly in space. The spacecraft pointed its cameras toward the Orion Constellation, capturing different groups of stars, as well as a faint, 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula. Lucy is equipped with four visible light cameras: the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and the Long- Range Reconnaissance Imager. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view, and they are designed to automatically lock onto and track the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. The MVIC is a higher-resolution color scanning camera, while L'LORRI is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera designed to capture detailed images of the asteroids. A raw image from L'LORRI revealed stars that are 50,000 times fainter than what the unaided human eye can see. The recent image-taking was a follow-up to an initial test of Lucy's cameras conducted in November, shortly after the spacecraft launched. However, the team has not yet tested Lucy's infrared spectrometer, known as LEISA, or its temperature mapping L'TES instrument, both of which require close-up planetary targets, according to NASA. Shortly after it launched, one of Lucy's solar arrays failed to unfurl properly. However, the spacecraft's systems have been operating normally and the glitch does not seem to have had a major effect on the mission so far. Lucy is named after an exceptionally old hominid fossil found in Ethiopia in 1974, one that provided valuable insights into human evolution. The Lucy spacecraft, by exploring Jupiter's Trojans, could do the same for our understanding of the solar system and its origin story. Lucy is expected to reach the Trojan asteroids in 2027.

Two large arrays of solar cells, which were designed to unfold and latch into place after launch, power the spacecraft. One of the fan-like arrays opened as expected, but the other stopped just short of completing this operation. Through a combination of rigorous in-flight solar array characterization and ground testing, Lucy engineers determined the unlatched solar array is nearly fully open, positioned at approximately 345 out of the full 360 degrees, and is producing ample energy for the spacecraft. Nonetheless, the team is concerned about potential damage to the array if the spacecraft conducts a main engine burn in its present configuration. After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array. The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remain to be retracted for the open array to latch. The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch. The team is now preparing to complete the solar array deployment in two steps. The first step, tentatively scheduled for the week of May 9, is intended to pull in most of the remaining lanyard and verify that flight results are consistent with ground testing. This step will also strengthen the array by bringing it closer to a fully tensioned state. Because this step is designed to be limited in duration, the array is not likely to latch at that point. If this step goes as planned, the second step will continue the array deployment with the intent to fully latch. Information gleaned from the first part will help fine-tune the second. The second step is currently planned for a month after the initial one, giving engineers enough time to analyze the data seen in the first attempt.

It's headed out to Jupiter's orbit - not Jupiter itself, but its orbit - to pass by quite a few asteroids that share their path with the giant planet. In one sense it's the most ambitious asteroid mission ever created: It will take close-up images of at least seven asteroids! These are called Trojan asteroids, and they may have been orbiting the Sun along with Jupiter since the dawn of the solar system. They collect in two spots, one 60\u00b0 ahead and the other 60\u00b0 behind Jupiter in its orbit, and having so many together makes it much easier to get close to and study so many of them in a single mission. Shortly before its launch, I wrote an overview of the mission and its extremely wild trajectory through the inner solar system. Normally you don't hear much from missions like this until they get close to their goal, but as it happens images obtained on Feb. 14, 2022 were just released. They were taken by engineers on Earth to test Lucy's cameras, and they're pretty cool. This photo, taken on Earth in New Mexico, shows the familiar sight of Orion as well as part of Gemini and Monoceros. The image is a long unguided exposure, so the stars are streaked a bit due to Earth's rotation, but it's sufficient for the purpose of showing where Lucy's cameras were pointed when they took their engineering test observations. The red rectangle shows the field of view of Lucy's Terminal Tracking Cameras, also called T2C. These are a pair of cameras - one for main operations and the other as a backup in case something goes awry with the first - with a large field of view that will be used as Lucy approaches each of its asteroid targets. The stars in the field will be analyzed on board to aid in autonomous tracking of the asteroids. It takes roughly half an hour at least for light to reach Earth from Jupiter's orbit, which is too long to control the imaging sequences from the ground, so the spacecraft has to do it itself. The T2C can also take science data; the wide field of view means that even at close approach they can get the whole asteroid at once, and as the spacecraft moves these images can be used to make 3D stereo pairs to determine some surface topography on the asteroids, which is extremely cool. The engineering test image is a little ratty - there's background noise, for example, but that can be processed out - but you can still see a zillion stars. That fuzzy patch at the bottom right is real: That's the fantastic Rosette Nebula, a star- forming gas cloud about 5,000 light years away, with thousands of newborn stars in it. The fact that it can be seen at all in this 10-second exposure speaks well of the camera's sensitivity. The blue strip in the first image shows the field of view of Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, or MVIC, one of the detectors on a camera called L'Ralph. The name is... interesting; the first Ralph camera flew on the New Horizon Pluto mission, and was named that because a different camera on that spacecraft was called Alice, after the husband and wife characters in the old sitcom The Honeymooners. The Ralph camera on Lucy is the same setup, so they called it L'Ralph to show it's a part of Lucy. Anyway, MVIC has five filters that select colors associated with different minerals expected to be seen on the asteroids' surfaces. Although the exposure time was less than one second, many stars can be seen. Note this field overlaps that of T2C so that they can see the same thing at the same time, which will help in scientific analysis. The tiny yellow square in the center of the first image shows the field of view of L'LORRI - the Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager - the highest-resolution camera on Lucy, meaning it will see the most details on the asteroids. In the 10-second test image, stars 1/25,000th as faint as the human eye can see are visible. They're slightly elongated due to the long exposure, but this can be compensated for during science exposures to make usable images. Clearly L'LORRI will be able to see faint details on the asteroids, and is one of the workhorse cameras on Lucy that will provide a vast amount of scientific data. Although none of these images will win a prize for their beauty, they are all indeed beautiful: They show us a working spacecraft 6 months into a mission that will last for many, many years. We're just now T-3 years before it passes its first asteroid - Donaldjohanson, a main- belt rock about 4 kilometers wide - so it won't be too long before the first science images get sent to Earth, and we visit yet another asteroid up close and personal. What will we see? If we knew, we wouldn't have to send missions there. With every spacecraft that investigates new objects up close, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected, and it's never a surprise that we will be surprised.

The problem is with one of Lucy's two solar arrays. These needed to be folded up for launch so the spacecraft could fit inside its launch vehicle, then they deployed once Lucy reached space. The arrays deployed by unfolding, fan-like, into two distinctive round shapes which should then have been latched into place. But one solar array failed to latch correctly after deployment on October 17, 2021. The array was almost completely deployed and was still capable of providing solar energy to the spacecraft, but it was not secured in place as it should have been. The mission team opted to continue with the craft entering cruise mode as planned because the combined two arrays were generating enough power for the mission to go ahead. Now, though, NASA wants to try to lock the array in place once again. Engineers on the ground have been performing tests and looking at data from the spacecraft and have concluded that the array in question is open to 345 out of 360 degrees and is still producing enough power. But there are concerns that if and when the spacecraft fires its main engine, the unlocked solar array could be damaged. In a recent update, NASA shared that on Monday, April 18, the team decided to go ahead with trying to fix the array into its proper place. To do that, they will work with the motor which controls the array deployment. \"After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array,\" NASA writes. \"The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remains to be retracted for the open array to latch.\" The array has both a primary and a backup motor for this deployment, so engineers will try to use both of these motors together to pull the lanyard through and allow the array to latch into place. Testing suggests that the additional torque from using both motors may be enough to tug the lanyard out of its snag. Enacting this plan will require two steps. The first step, scheduled to begin in the week of May 9, is to pull the lanyard taut, which will allow the team to check that the spacecraft is in the same condition as the testing on the ground and will also help to strengthen the array. The second step, scheduled for a month after step one if everything goes well, will be to use the two motors to try to pull the array into place.

On Thursday, the Lucy team announced that it would perform two maneuvers to fully unfurl its solar arrays. The Lucy mission will study the crumbs leftover from the early Solar System, and it needs to reach Jupiter's orbit, where two gravitational crevices have collected them. Operating farther from the Sun requires big solar arrays to capture the diminishing sunlight for energy, so Lucy was equipped with two peeper-like solar wings. Shortly after its October 2021 launch, NASA officials noticed something was wrong with one of the solar arrays. Its readings were unusual, and personnel soon realized that the lanyard wrapping around one solar array hadn't fully retracted, blocking some sunlight from reaching the panels. An engineering model suggests that upon retracting, \"the lanyard may not have wound on the spool as intended,\" NASA reported one month after launch. According to NASA officials, the faulty array is between 75 percent and 95 percent deployed. The space agency has been monitoring the situation for the last half-year, and on April 18, they decided on a plan forward they hope will solve the issue. They will perform two steps over the next several months to see if the solar array can be fully deployed. The first will happen on May 9, when they will attempt to reel back some of the lanyard in a quick maneuver. The team anticipates that this single operation won't be enough, so they are planning a second array deployment task for a month later, which will hopefully successfully latch the solar array. The month between each task will give the teams time to analyze the best way to perform the second maneuver. \"The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch,\" NASA officials shared in a mission update published last Thursday. So far, the issue hasn't affected the mission too severely. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing. This power level is enough to keep the spacecraft healthy and functioning,\" NASA officials shared three days after launch. Having fully charged batteries is important. Lucy is heading out to Jupiter at a speed of roughly 67,000 mph to study the Trojan asteroids, peculiar rocks significantly different from those found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The Trojans are leftover pieces from the formation of the Solar System that were looped into Jupiter's orbit and thus avoided being ejected into deep space. The Trojans are trapped in two gravitationally stable spots called Lagrange Point 4 and Lagrange Point 5, created by the interaction of the Sun and Jupiter. Lucy will study seven asteroids over 12 years, so having fully-operating batteries will be critical. The team also hopes that, if the lanyard cannot be retracted and the solar array has to stay the way it is, the main engine burns won't mess with the solar array. Lucy will reach its first target in 2025, an Asteroid Belt object dubbed Donaldjohanson. After its encounter with that asteroid, the craft will continue toward the group of Trojans residing in front of Jupiter, targeting a 2027 arrival. After that, a maneuver will bring it back to the inner Solar System to use Earth for a gravity assist in 2031, only to swing back out for a second Trojan trip in 2033 toward the trailing asteroids. The mission is named after the three million-year-old hominid fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Donaldjohanson is named after Lucy's discoverer. \"Lucy\" is both an homage to the science of origins and likely a nod to The Beatles' song that inspired the fossil's name, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator, has previously compared the Trojans to jewels for their \"immense scientific value.\"", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/science/lucy-solar-array-may-maneuver"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft to observe total lunar eclipse on May 16 from deep space", "date": "2022-05-16", "content": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft, which launched last October to study Jupiter's trojan asteroids, will be our eyes and ears for the upcoming lunar eclipse. The celestial event will occur on May 16 after 7:58 am, as per Indian standard time, and will end at 11:25 am. Notably, the peak of the total lunar eclipse, wherein the Moon will turn red will occur at 9:41 am, as per Time and Date. It is also worth noting that the eclipse will not be visible in India but you can watch it courtesy of NASA's live stream. Interestingly, the Lucy probe will provide views of the eclipse as if we are seeing it from deep space. The first leg of the spacecraft's journey to the trojan asteroids is making one orbit around the sun and it is currently headed back towards the Earth for a gravity assist this October. According to NASA, the spacecraft reached 65 million miles from the Earth, which is the maximum distance it would travel from our planet during this first year in space. As of now, Lucy is significantly far from Earth, about 70% of the distance between the Earth and the Moon, but scientists are confident that the spacecraft's high-resolution camera will provide sharp images. The photos sent by the spacecraft will be much-awaited since it would view the eclipse from an angle rarely seen. NASA says that from Lucy's position, the gibbous Earth and Moon will be easily visible. When the moon will enter and exit the Earth's shadow, which is the reason for a lunar eclipse, the moon will appear to blink and the phenomenon will be captured by an instrument named L'LORRI fitted aboard the probe. The agency even shared a simulated picture of the Earth and the moon from the perspective of the Lucy spacecraft. An image has also been shared above showing Lucy's orbit which overlaps that of the Earth. \"Viewing this eclipse will allow the Lucy team to do a \"test run\" of the observation procedures, making sure that all the imagers and equipment are working as expected.

NASA released a short black-and-white timelapse video capturing the rotating Earth on the left and the disappearing moon passing through the planet's shadow on the right. The sequence consists of images taken over a three-hour period starting at 9:40 p.m. EDT on May 15 (0140 GMT on May 16) and ending on May 16 at 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT). The observations ended before the moon left the planet's shadow. The moon's brightness in the images had to be artificially enhanced by a factor of six, NASA said in a statement, to make the natural satellite visible.

It was an event so minuscule it would have been easy to miss. Yet the data gathered in those few seconds will contribute to the success of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16. The star appeared to briefly blink out because the asteroid Eurybates had passed in front of it. Eurybates is one of a handful of asteroids Lucy will visit over the next 12 years. As Eurybates eclipsed the star, a phenomenon scientists call an \"occultation,\" a 40-mile- wide shadow the size of the asteroid passed over the region. By spreading out inside the shadow's predicted path across Nevada, astronomers sought to measure the width of Eurybates down to several hundred feet, or a couple of hundred meters, and to ascertain its shape. This information will be used by Lucy researchers to supplement data gathered by the Lucy spacecraft's close flyby of Eurybates in 2027, which is designed to determine what the asteroid is made of and where in the solar system it formed billions of years ago. Why Occultations? An occultation is any event where one celestial object passes in front of another, blocking the latter object from an observer's view. The best-known example is a solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun from our view. \"It really does look like a star just vanished,\" said Marc Buie, occultation science lead for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. Buie helped coordinate the Eurybates observations in Nevada. \"It's kind of a weird thing to see, but an occultation gives us really valuable information.\" Observing occultations is one of the tools scientists have for gathering precise information about the size and shape of Lucy's target destinations, known as \"Trojan\" asteroids. These Trojans are clustered in two swarms that orbit the Sun at about the same distance as Jupiter. Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early solar system, with the largest ones named after characters from Greek mythology. The Lucy mission, for the first time, will analyze seven of them up close, helping scientists hone the theory of how the planets formed and ended up in their current locations. While scientists can spot Trojan asteroids using powerful observatories such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope this way in 2018), the asteroids appear only as small points of light, so it's challenging to precisely determine their true sizes and shapes. \"Occultations are one way for us to learn as much as we can about the objects before Lucy gets there, so that we can make the most of the brief opportunity we'll get when the spacecraft is super close to each target,\" said Brian Keeney, an occultation specialist for the Lucy mission at the Southwest Research Institute. After Lucy reaches each asteroid, scientists will be able to measure each asteroid's mass. That information, combined with size and shape data from flybys, occultations, and other Earth-based techniques, will help reveal the density of each asteroid. Density tells scientists about composition, or whether an asteroid is made mostly of ice or of rock. Scientists hope to compare the compositions of the Trojan asteroids to figure out if they came from the same or different parts of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, and how the Trojans relate to other asteroids in the solar system. \"Lucy will see each asteroid's surface, but we need to learn more about the interior, which is where occultations can help,\" Keeney said. To prepare for an occultation, astronomers predict a shadow's path across Earth, based on the known orbit of the asteroid and the precise position of the star to be occulted. Then they set up dozens of telescopes along a line perpendicular to that path and wait for the asteroid to eclipse a specific star. They count the seconds that starlight blinks out as the asteroid passes in front of it and then use the asteroid's known velocity to calculate its width. Since the occultation time, and thus width, is different at each point on the line where telescopes are stationed - with each telescope station corresponding to a different line across the asteroid - scientists can also determine the shape of an asteroid's silhouette by combining data from each telescope. By observing multiple occultations of the same asteroid, scientists can catch different sides of the asteroid and combine their two-dimensional silhouette projections into a three-dimensional shape model. \"Occultations have proven to be an excellent technique to maximize the science return of missions such as Lucy,\" said Adriana Ocampo, program executive for the Lucy mission based at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Accurate predictions of future occultation times and locations rely on impeccable information related to star and asteroid locations. When Buie started tracking occultations in the 1980s, the data available left him with huge areas of uncertainty, meaning his team could end up miles outside an asteroid's shadow. To catch an occultation of a 10-mile- wide asteroid, for instance, Buie would have spread telescopes out along a 190-mile path. Today, that area is six times smaller. Astronomers' predictions have improved dramatically thanks to Hubble and ESA's Gaia satellite, which help pin down the precise locations of nearly 2 billion stars. Additionally, the trajectories of Lucy's fast-moving target asteroids are constantly monitored and refined using ground-based telescopes and occasionally Hubble. Buie calls occultation events \"mega campaigns,\" as they require large teams, precise location predictions for each telescope, and many telescopes for successful data collection. In Nevada, for instance, professional and amateur astronomers from across the country, including teachers and high school students, used 37 telescopes to observe Eurybates. But occultations happen all over world, from Argentina to South Africa, Senegal and Spain. Buie and other Lucy scientists must coordinate travel to these destinations, find observation volunteers locally, and train them. \"Occultations provide an important international collaborative factor of scientific advancement for the good of humanity, excitement, engagement and inspiration which is at the core of NASA's mission,\" said Ocampo, who participates in observation campaigns. On top of the logistical challenges of organizing occultation campaigns, scientists must contend with unpredictable weather. Successful campaigns depend on clear skies. As observers waited for Eurybates occultation in Nevada, they saw clouds moving toward them. \"If that Eurybates occultation had been an hour later, nobody would've seen anything,\" Buie said. \"The clouds would have wiped us out.\" The team will continue to observe occultations until Lucy's last flyby of Trojan asteroid Patroclus in 2033, even in the face of bad weather.

At a Jan. 25 meeting NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, expressed confidence that, regardless if the solar array is fully deployed or not, the issue will not affect the spacecraft's ability to carry out its mission to study several Trojan asteroids leading and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. Shortly after its Oct. 16 launch, deployed two large circular solar arrays, each 7.3 meters in diameter. The arrays are designed to unfurl like fans and latch into place. While one array, called -Y, did completely unfurl and latch, the other, +Y, did not latch into place. \"People have been working day and night since the launch to try and figure out what's going on, and I think we understand it,\" Levison said. The +Y array, rather than unfurling a full 360 degrees, instead went 347 degrees. In that configuration, the spacecraft is still generating more than 90% of its expected power. \"Power is not an issue for the spacecraft, nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" The arrays unfurl when a motor pulls on a lanyard, swinging one end of the array around and into place. Levison said that the most likely reason the array did not latch is that, for some reason, there was a loss of tension in the lanyard during deployment. That caused it to fall off a spool and wrap around the motor shaft. About 75 centimeters of lanyard remains to be pulled in. \"It matches the data really well, so we have really high confidence this is true,\" he said. One possible cause of the loss of tension, he added, is a \"dynamic interaction\" between the two arrays during the deployment. Mission managers are considering two alternatives. One is to turn the motors back on and try to bring in the remaining lanyard segment so that the array can lock into place. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can pull a little harder, we might be able to get it to latch,\" he said. The motor can pull harder, he said, but engineers want to assess the risks of doing so before making another attempt. The other option is to keep the array as is. While the array can generate enough power without being fully deployed, Levison said engineers want to study its integrity in that configuration during main engine burns. \"The analysis so far is looking good. We should be able to do at least some of the main engine burns we're planning.\" There's no rush to decide whether to redeploy the array or leave it as is. \"We have plenty of time because we're not scheduled to fire the main engine for a while,\" he said. \"We're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" That assessment matches the most recent NASA update about the mission, published Jan. 12. It stated that the current plan for the mission \"supports a latch attempt in the late April timeframe\" but that engineers were still studying leaving the array in its current unlatched condition. Levison added that all other aspects of the spacecraft, including its instruments, were working well. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt,\" he said. \"The instruments and the spacecraft are all behaving nominally.\" ", "url": "https://spacenews.com/cause-of-lucy-solar-array-deployment-problem-identified/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy asteroid spacecraft still has a wonky solar array as it flies through space", "date": "2022-01-27", "content": "Three months after launch, a new NASA asteroid spacecraft is still getting settled into its life beyond Earth.

However, Lucy is remaining in orbit around Earth for about a year before moving deeper into the solar system, and the arrays are much larger than they need to be in the relatively sunlit environment, so the situation isn't urgent. \"We have plenty of time, really, because we're not scheduled to fire the main engines for a while and we're in cruise,\" Levison said. \"So we're taking our time to carefully go through our options.\" Levison also said that Lucy's current power production is sufficient to meet the mission's needs throughout the journey. \"The good news is that means we're producing over 90% of the expected power, it's actually 92 or 93%,\" Levison said. \"So power is not an issue for the spacecraft - nor will it be through the entire mission if we have to fly it like it is.\" Lucy's two large solar arrays were folded up for the spacecraft's launch, then began deploying \"like a Chinese fan,\" as team members describe the process, into a decagon. Each array spans 24 feet and is opened by a lanyard rigged up to motors. One deployed completely, with the full 360 degrees unfurled and a latch closed to hold the array in place; the team's estimate suggests that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, preventing latching. Analysis completed since launch has suggested that an issue with the lanyard meant to pull the array open prevented full deployment. \"Through some unknown process, there was a period where there was no tension on the lanyard as it was deploying,\" Levison said. \"As a result, the lanyard fell off the spool. We think there's something like 30 inches 76 centimeters of lanyard remaining to be pulled in.\" The Lucy team is evaluating two options, he noted, adding that, \"both of them, I think, have a significantly good chance of success.\" One approach would attempt to finish deploying the temperamental solar array, turning the motors that work the lanyard back on. \"We're almost there, so I think if we can just pull a little harder, we might be able to get it all to latch,\" Levison said. However, the team doesn't want to rush this option. \"We're running it in a way it wasn't designed to run, so we've been spending quite a bit of time analyzing the risks in trying to do this redeploy.\" The other potential approach is to do nothing, since the solar array can meet the spacecraft's needs as it is. However, that would leave a gap in the array, like a missing pie slice, and would also leave the array without the support of the closed latch. \"We have plenty of power; the issue is the structural integrity of the array during main engine burns,\" Levison said. \"The forces and torques going through the array and particularly where it's connected to the spacecraft are different than designed.\" That distinction means that the team is building models and conducting analysis of what the spacecraft might experience during a main engine burn to ensure that leaving the array as is wouldn't damage the spacecraft, Levison said. \"The instruments and spacecraft are all behaving nominally,\" Levison said. \"Except for this problem, the spacecraft is really kicking butt.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-solar-array-glitch-plan"}, {"title": "Here's the view from a NASA spacecraft bound for Jupiter asteroids", "date": "2022-04-19", "content": "The journey out to Jupiter's orbit is full of stars. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is early in its long trek to explore a group of asteroids called the Jupiter Trojans, which are small remnants of our early solar system that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the sun. Lucy launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Oct. 16, 2021, and is preparing for an Earth flyby this fall before it begins its asteroid explorations. During the cruise, mission personnel are also completing tasks like instrument calibration, and new images taken during a February test of the spacecraft's four visible-light cameras offer a detailed view of 11 different star fields. The spacecraft's four cameras include the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera and the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager. The calibration test, which occurred on Feb. 14, used Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform to test the cameras' performance, sensitivity and accuracy when pointed in different directions, according to the NASA statement. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view and are used to automatically lock onto and track certain targets, such as the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. In turn, the twin cameras help ensure that the spacecraft's other instruments are pointed at the target. One of the Feb. 14 test images was a 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula, which is visible in the lower right center of the frame, taken using the T2CAM. MVIC, which is part of the L'Ralph instrument, is a higher-resolution color scanning camera that produces panoramic views of space. During the test, a narrow part of the T2CAM field was captured and processed so that the faint stars could be seen against the dark backdrop of space. Lucy's most sensitive camera, L'LORRI, is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera with a narrow 0.29-degree-square field of view. It is the same kind of telescope as the instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope and will capture the most detailed images of the mission's asteroid targets. The test images captured stars roughly 50,000 times fainter than the unaided human eye can see, according to the NASA statement. The Feb. 14 test was a follow-up to the first set of test images taken in November 2021, only a few months after Lucy's launch. Therefore, this recent test was much more extensive, allowing the spacecraft's team to test its camera functionality. However, the test did not include Lucy's infrared spectrometer LEISA, which is also part of the L'Ralph instrument, or the spacecraft's temperature mapping L'TES instrument, which requires close-up planetary targets to obtain useful data. The Lucy spacecraft is slated to arrive at its first target in 2025 - a main belt asteroid named 52246 Donaldjohanson after the paleontologist who discovered the hominin fossil Lucy that is the mission's namesake.", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-lucy-asteroid-mission-test-star-photos"}, {"title": "See Postcards From NASA's Lucy Spacecraft as It Journeys to Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids", "date": "2022-04-20", "content": "Traveling through space can get lonely. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is currently on a six-year journey to Jupiter, traveling through the sparse interplanetary medium since launching in October 2021. Luckily for Lucy, the views have been spectacular. The spacecraft recently captured a series of calibration images, pointing its brand new cameras at 11 different star fields to make sure its photography skills are up to par. The latest batch of images were taken in February, which NASA did to test the spacecraft's camera performance and sensitivity, as well as its ability to point in different directions, according to the space agency. Lucy is on a mission to study the Trojan asteroids, two groups of rocky bodies that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. The Trojans may have existed for the past 4 billion years, but very little is known about them since no spacecraft has paid them a visit just yet. But before Lucy reaches its destination, the team behind the mission is working to ensure the probe's instruments are working properly in space. The spacecraft pointed its cameras toward the Orion Constellation, capturing different groups of stars, as well as a faint, 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula. Lucy is equipped with four visible light cameras: the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and the Long- Range Reconnaissance Imager. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view, and they are designed to automatically lock onto and track the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. The MVIC is a higher-resolution color scanning camera, while L'LORRI is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera designed to capture detailed images of the asteroids. A raw image from L'LORRI revealed stars that are 50,000 times fainter than what the unaided human eye can see. The recent image-taking was a follow-up to an initial test of Lucy's cameras conducted in November, shortly after the spacecraft launched. However, the team has not yet tested Lucy's infrared spectrometer, known as LEISA, or its temperature mapping L'TES instrument, both of which require close-up planetary targets, according to NASA. Shortly after it launched, one of Lucy's solar arrays failed to unfurl properly. However, the spacecraft's systems have been operating normally and the glitch does not seem to have had a major effect on the mission so far. Lucy is named after an exceptionally old hominid fossil found in Ethiopia in 1974, one that provided valuable insights into human evolution. The Lucy spacecraft, by exploring Jupiter's Trojans, could do the same for our understanding of the solar system and its origin story. Lucy is expected to reach the Trojan asteroids in 2027.

Two large arrays of solar cells, which were designed to unfold and latch into place after launch, power the spacecraft. One of the fan-like arrays opened as expected, but the other stopped just short of completing this operation. Through a combination of rigorous in-flight solar array characterization and ground testing, Lucy engineers determined the unlatched solar array is nearly fully open, positioned at approximately 345 out of the full 360 degrees, and is producing ample energy for the spacecraft. Nonetheless, the team is concerned about potential damage to the array if the spacecraft conducts a main engine burn in its present configuration. After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array. The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remain to be retracted for the open array to latch. The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch. The team is now preparing to complete the solar array deployment in two steps. The first step, tentatively scheduled for the week of May 9, is intended to pull in most of the remaining lanyard and verify that flight results are consistent with ground testing. This step will also strengthen the array by bringing it closer to a fully tensioned state. Because this step is designed to be limited in duration, the array is not likely to latch at that point. If this step goes as planned, the second step will continue the array deployment with the intent to fully latch. Information gleaned from the first part will help fine-tune the second. The second step is currently planned for a month after the initial one, giving engineers enough time to analyze the data seen in the first attempt.

It's headed out to Jupiter's orbit - not Jupiter itself, but its orbit - to pass by quite a few asteroids that share their path with the giant planet. In one sense it's the most ambitious asteroid mission ever created: It will take close-up images of at least seven asteroids! These are called Trojan asteroids, and they may have been orbiting the Sun along with Jupiter since the dawn of the solar system. They collect in two spots, one 60\u00b0 ahead and the other 60\u00b0 behind Jupiter in its orbit, and having so many together makes it much easier to get close to and study so many of them in a single mission. Shortly before its launch, I wrote an overview of the mission and its extremely wild trajectory through the inner solar system. Normally you don't hear much from missions like this until they get close to their goal, but as it happens images obtained on Feb. 14, 2022 were just released. They were taken by engineers on Earth to test Lucy's cameras, and they're pretty cool. This photo, taken on Earth in New Mexico, shows the familiar sight of Orion as well as part of Gemini and Monoceros. The image is a long unguided exposure, so the stars are streaked a bit due to Earth's rotation, but it's sufficient for the purpose of showing where Lucy's cameras were pointed when they took their engineering test observations. The red rectangle shows the field of view of Lucy's Terminal Tracking Cameras, also called T2C. These are a pair of cameras - one for main operations and the other as a backup in case something goes awry with the first - with a large field of view that will be used as Lucy approaches each of its asteroid targets. The stars in the field will be analyzed on board to aid in autonomous tracking of the asteroids. It takes roughly half an hour at least for light to reach Earth from Jupiter's orbit, which is too long to control the imaging sequences from the ground, so the spacecraft has to do it itself. The T2C can also take science data; the wide field of view means that even at close approach they can get the whole asteroid at once, and as the spacecraft moves these images can be used to make 3D stereo pairs to determine some surface topography on the asteroids, which is extremely cool. The engineering test image is a little ratty - there's background noise, for example, but that can be processed out - but you can still see a zillion stars. That fuzzy patch at the bottom right is real: That's the fantastic Rosette Nebula, a star- forming gas cloud about 5,000 light years away, with thousands of newborn stars in it. The fact that it can be seen at all in this 10-second exposure speaks well of the camera's sensitivity. The blue strip in the first image shows the field of view of Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, or MVIC, one of the detectors on a camera called L'Ralph. The name is... interesting; the first Ralph camera flew on the New Horizon Pluto mission, and was named that because a different camera on that spacecraft was called Alice, after the husband and wife characters in the old sitcom The Honeymooners. The Ralph camera on Lucy is the same setup, so they called it L'Ralph to show it's a part of Lucy. Anyway, MVIC has five filters that select colors associated with different minerals expected to be seen on the asteroids' surfaces. Although the exposure time was less than one second, many stars can be seen. Note this field overlaps that of T2C so that they can see the same thing at the same time, which will help in scientific analysis. The tiny yellow square in the center of the first image shows the field of view of L'LORRI - the Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager - the highest-resolution camera on Lucy, meaning it will see the most details on the asteroids. In the 10-second test image, stars 1/25,000th as faint as the human eye can see are visible. They're slightly elongated due to the long exposure, but this can be compensated for during science exposures to make usable images. Clearly L'LORRI will be able to see faint details on the asteroids, and is one of the workhorse cameras on Lucy that will provide a vast amount of scientific data. Although none of these images will win a prize for their beauty, they are all indeed beautiful: They show us a working spacecraft 6 months into a mission that will last for many, many years. We're just now T-3 years before it passes its first asteroid - Donaldjohanson, a main- belt rock about 4 kilometers wide - so it won't be too long before the first science images get sent to Earth, and we visit yet another asteroid up close and personal. What will we see? If we knew, we wouldn't have to send missions there. With every spacecraft that investigates new objects up close, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected, and it's never a surprise that we will be surprised.

The problem is with one of Lucy's two solar arrays. These needed to be folded up for launch so the spacecraft could fit inside its launch vehicle, then they deployed once Lucy reached space. The arrays deployed by unfolding, fan-like, into two distinctive round shapes which should then have been latched into place. But one solar array failed to latch correctly after deployment on October 17, 2021. The array was almost completely deployed and was still capable of providing solar energy to the spacecraft, but it was not secured in place as it should have been. The mission team opted to continue with the craft entering cruise mode as planned because the combined two arrays were generating enough power for the mission to go ahead. Now, though, NASA wants to try to lock the array in place once again. Engineers on the ground have been performing tests and looking at data from the spacecraft and have concluded that the array in question is open to 345 out of 360 degrees and is still producing enough power. But there are concerns that if and when the spacecraft fires its main engine, the unlocked solar array could be damaged. In a recent update, NASA shared that on Monday, April 18, the team decided to go ahead with trying to fix the array into its proper place. To do that, they will work with the motor which controls the array deployment. \"After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array,\" NASA writes. \"The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remains to be retracted for the open array to latch.\" The array has both a primary and a backup motor for this deployment, so engineers will try to use both of these motors together to pull the lanyard through and allow the array to latch into place. Testing suggests that the additional torque from using both motors may be enough to tug the lanyard out of its snag. Enacting this plan will require two steps. The first step, scheduled to begin in the week of May 9, is to pull the lanyard taut, which will allow the team to check that the spacecraft is in the same condition as the testing on the ground and will also help to strengthen the array. The second step, scheduled for a month after step one if everything goes well, will be to use the two motors to try to pull the array into place.

On Thursday, the Lucy team announced that it would perform two maneuvers to fully unfurl its solar arrays. The Lucy mission will study the crumbs leftover from the early Solar System, and it needs to reach Jupiter's orbit, where two gravitational crevices have collected them. Operating farther from the Sun requires big solar arrays to capture the diminishing sunlight for energy, so Lucy was equipped with two peeper-like solar wings. Shortly after its October 2021 launch, NASA officials noticed something was wrong with one of the solar arrays. Its readings were unusual, and personnel soon realized that the lanyard wrapping around one solar array hadn't fully retracted, blocking some sunlight from reaching the panels. An engineering model suggests that upon retracting, \"the lanyard may not have wound on the spool as intended,\" NASA reported one month after launch. According to NASA officials, the faulty array is between 75 percent and 95 percent deployed. The space agency has been monitoring the situation for the last half-year, and on April 18, they decided on a plan forward they hope will solve the issue. They will perform two steps over the next several months to see if the solar array can be fully deployed. The first will happen on May 9, when they will attempt to reel back some of the lanyard in a quick maneuver. The team anticipates that this single operation won't be enough, so they are planning a second array deployment task for a month later, which will hopefully successfully latch the solar array. The month between each task will give the teams time to analyze the best way to perform the second maneuver. \"The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch,\" NASA officials shared in a mission update published last Thursday. So far, the issue hasn't affected the mission too severely. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing. This power level is enough to keep the spacecraft healthy and functioning,\" NASA officials shared three days after launch. Having fully charged batteries is important. Lucy is heading out to Jupiter at a speed of roughly 67,000 mph to study the Trojan asteroids, peculiar rocks significantly different from those found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The Trojans are leftover pieces from the formation of the Solar System that were looped into Jupiter's orbit and thus avoided being ejected into deep space. The Trojans are trapped in two gravitationally stable spots called Lagrange Point 4 and Lagrange Point 5, created by the interaction of the Sun and Jupiter. Lucy will study seven asteroids over 12 years, so having fully-operating batteries will be critical. The team also hopes that, if the lanyard cannot be retracted and the solar array has to stay the way it is, the main engine burns won't mess with the solar array. Lucy will reach its first target in 2025, an Asteroid Belt object dubbed Donaldjohanson. After its encounter with that asteroid, the craft will continue toward the group of Trojans residing in front of Jupiter, targeting a 2027 arrival. After that, a maneuver will bring it back to the inner Solar System to use Earth for a gravity assist in 2031, only to swing back out for a second Trojan trip in 2033 toward the trailing asteroids. The mission is named after the three million-year-old hominid fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Donaldjohanson is named after Lucy's discoverer. \"Lucy\" is both an homage to the science of origins and likely a nod to The Beatles' song that inspired the fossil's name, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator, has previously compared the Trojans to jewels for their \"immense scientific value.\"", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/science/lucy-solar-array-may-maneuver"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft to observe total lunar eclipse on May 16 from deep space", "date": "2022-05-16", "content": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft, which launched last October to study Jupiter's trojan asteroids, will be our eyes and ears for the upcoming lunar eclipse.

The spacecraft similarly ran both motors three times since then. \"That's allowing us to make significant process towards latch, but we're not latched yet,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a presentation at a meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group June 8. \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array.\" That tensioning, he said, is a positive sign even though the array has not latched into place. \"It makes it likely that, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as-is,\" he said, noting the array, in its current configuration, is generating more than 90% of its planned power. The mission is preparing for an Earth gravity-assist flyby in October, when the spacecraft will pass about 350 kilometers above the Earth. After a second Earth flyby in 2024, Lucy will go past an asteroid in the main belt in 2025, then several Trojan asteroids in a cluster leading Jupiter in orbit around the sun in 2027 and 2028. A third Earth flyby in 2030 will set up encounters with two Trojan asteroids in a separate cluster trailing Jupiter in 2033. To set up the October flyby, Lucy performed a trajectory correction maneuver June 7, NASA said in a June 8 blog post. The maneuver is the first of several planned before the October flyby.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/efforts-continue-to-fully-deploy-lucy-solar-array/"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft refuses to fully unfurl solar panel as it races toward Jupiter", "date": "2022-06-11", "content": "NASA's team handling the Lucy mission is facing major challenges as one of the solar panels, which failed to fully deploy, is still refusing to unfurl completely. Soon after the spacecraft's launch, which was conducted on October 16 last year, the engineers noticed that one of Lucy's two solar panels is unfurled between 75% to 95% but assured that this would not hinder the probe's journey. Now, in June 2022, the mission team is still struggling with the jammed solar panel. Lucy was launched by NASA last year to study eight Trojan asteroids of Jupiter. Lucy would fly past one of the main belt asteroids and seven Trojan asteroids during the following 12 years, marking it the first single spaceship expedition of NASA to visit so many distinct asteroids. In the latest mission update, NASA revealed that the engineers attempted to fully spread the panels by using both the primary and backup motor windings to pull them outward. According to NASA, the commands to start the panel- deploying motors were first sent on May 9 and the results of the process were analysed. Since the mission team was careful about not overheating the motor, they again sent the commands on May 12 and May 26. During their third attempt, i.e. on May 26, the engineers found that the array was continuing to open; however, it is still not at its 100%. \"The team repeated the deployment command sequence a fourth time on June 2. While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt\", the agency said in a statement. NASA said that there are a few more opportunities to attempt the deployment of the panels but there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array. This is because the team believes that the repeated process using the motors is putting more tension on the array and is further stabilising it. However, NASA is confident that even if the panels do not latch completely, it will be enough for the spacecraft to continue its journey. Notably, Lucy completed its trajectory correction manoeuvre on June 7, which was the first in the series of manoeuvres it will execute before its first- ever Earth gravity assist scheduled for October 16 this year.

The Lucy mission, which launched in October 2021, has two large, circular solar arrays, each spanning 24 feet, to provide power for its pioneering voyage. However, one of the arrays failed to fully deploy after launch, posing a problem for the team. An update in January stated that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, due to an issue with a lanyard suspected to have prevented full deployment, but work to fix the issue has continued. After a series of tests and measures, the team again commanded the spacecraft to deploy the solar array on May 26, using both primary and backup motors to try to tighten the lanyard and complete deployment. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA Lucy mission representatives wrote in a June 8 update. \"The team has several more opportunities to repeat these deployment commands. While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it.\" But even if the array does not fully deploy, Lucy may be able to fly as planned. For now, energy is not an issue, as the spacecraft is still relatively near the sun. Lucy carried out a successful trajectory correction maneuver on June 7 as part of preparation for its first Earth gravity assist, scheduled for Oct. 16. The arrays have been designed to generate enough electricity while out at the orbit of Jupiter - an average distance of 484 million miles from the sun. Jupiter's Trojan asteroids orbit the sun ahead of and behind Jupiter, and no spacecraft has ever visited them. Scientists think these primitive rocks are remnants of the early solar system and could hold important clues about its creation.

One of Lucy's two UltraFlex circular solar arrays opened to about 96% of its fully deployed state after arriving in space last October following a launch from Cape Canaveral. The other solar array fully unfurled as the spacecraft began a robotic science mission to fly through swarms of unexplored asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. In recent weeks, ground teams at a Lockheed Martin control center in Colorado have uplinked commands for Lucy run primary and backup motors to drive the stuck solar array closer to full deployment. NASA believes a lanyard used to pull the solar array open somehow lost tension and fell off a spool during the initial deployment last October, preventing the array from completely opening. Additional attempts to pull the solar array open have further reeled in the lanyard. The first try May 9 involved running the deployment motors in a series of short intervals to avoid overheating. Ground controllers sent more commands May 12, further advancing the solar array deployment and adding tension to the structure, helping stabilize the array. Engineers made more progress during two additional deployment attempts May 26 and June 2. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA said. Most recently, the Lucy ground team sent another command to run the deployment motors June 9, which continued to \"further stabilize the array,\" NASA said. \"There are future opportunities to repeat the deployment commands if necessary.\" Officials are increasingly optimistic that the Lucy mission can proceed without any issues, even if the solar array does not latch into place. Before the recent tries to fully deploy the array, the spacecraft's power system was generating more than 90% of the expected level of 18,000 watts. \"While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it,\" NASA said in a statement. \"Even if the array does not ultimately latch, the additional stiffening may be enough to fly the mission as planned.\" \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"These things are made out of cloth, and where you get a lot of the strength is by putting it under tension. And we're clearly at a point where we're tensioning the array, which makes it likely, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as is.\" One concern engineers have studied is the effect of engine burns on the partially deployed array. The Lucy spacecraft completed its first trajectory correction maneuver June 7 to help guide it toward a flyby with Earth in October, the first of multiple gravity assists to slingshot the probe toward Jupiter's orbit in the distant solar system. Lucy has also extended the platform holding its scientific instruments, and the sensors are all working as designed, Levison said. Lucy will become the farthest spacecraft from the sun to ever rely on solar power, reaching a maximum distance of 530 million miles, nearly six times farther than Earth's orbit. When it reaches the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's solar arrays were expected to generate just 500 watts of power. That level of power output is sufficient to feed Lucy's three science instruments, which only need about 82 watts of power during each asteroid encounter. Lucy's flight computer, communications system, and other components will also draw on power generated by the UltraFlex arrays. The $981 million Lucy Mission is the first to explore the Trojan asteroids, which scientists say are leftover building blocks similar to objects that came together to form the solar system's giant outer planets. The probe will fly by eight Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, plus one object in the main asteroid belt in 2025. That's one more asteroid than scientists expected Lucy to visit when it launched last year. One of the Trojan asteroids on Lucy's tour, named Polymele, has a companion. Scientists discovered an apparent satellite of Polymele during a ground-based occultation observation in March, when Polymele briefly passed in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light from reaching Earth. The occultation observations were intended to help the Lucy science team determine the shape of Polymele, which only appears as a point of light in telescope images. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Levison said last week in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" Lucy's science team has temporarily named the object Shaun, after \"Shaun the Sheep\" in the show \"Wallace and Gromit.\" More data on the object's exact position and orbit are required to assign a permanent name to Polymele's companion, and that probably won't happen until after Lucy's flyby in 2027. Polymele itself has an \"oblate spheroid,\" or gourd-like, shape and measures about 17 miles long and 8 miles wide. The shape of Polymele suggests it is likely a leftover remnant from the young solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago, and may have avoided any collisions with other objects throughout its history. \"It's hard to imagine you can get that shape ... out of an object that's collisionally evolved, so my thinking right now is Polymele is probably a primordial object, which is going to make seeing it really fascinating.\" Polymele's companion is not the first asteroid to be added to Lucy's flight plan since the mission was approved by NASA in 2017. Astronomers announced in 2020 that observations with the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed a small object, less than 1 kilometer in diameter, orbiting asteroid Eurybates, another Lucy target in the Trojan belt.

In 2027, Lucy will become the first human-made object to fly past one of these asteroids. The mission was designed to zoom past a main-belt asteroid then swing through a complicated itinerary of Trojan asteroids. And now, scientists have determined that one of Lucy's original target asteroids has a companion: another, tiny asteroid that orbits it and that Lucy will also be able to observe, Spaceflight Now reports. Lucy's third target is an asteroid called Polymele, a gourd-shaped space rock that's roughly 13 miles from end to end. Polymele's shape is strange for an asteroid, suggesting that it's a remnant from the very early solar system - one that has managed to avoid collisions so far. In March, astronomers observing Polymele in preparation for Lucy's eventual visit watched the asteroid pass in front of a star, blocking that star's distant light. In the process, they found something very curious: a tiny companion space rock. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and Lucy's principal investigator, said in a presentation last week, according to Spaceflight Now. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" That companion does not have a name and won't have one until scientists know more about the asteroid's exact orbit, which might not happen until Lucy's visit. But some astronomers have jokingly begun calling it Shaun after the character in the animation \"Shaun the Sheep.\" Shaun is the second space rock to be added to the Lucy mission's itinerary: In 2020, scientists working on the mission determined that target asteroid Eurybates also boasts a small companion.

This new object was identified by scientists when they discovered one of Lucy's targets - Polymele - having a companion in March this year when the asteroid briefly passed in front of the star. Currently on a 12-year-long journey, Lucy will become the first man-made object to fly past one of the trojan asteroids in 2027. The mission was launched with the objective to study one main-belt asteroid and seven trojan asteroids which are clustered around the two Lagrange points equidistant from the Sun and Jupiter. Scientists believe that these primitive asteroids hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system as they might be leftover building blocks. Lucy will fly by each of these asteroids in a span of 12 years and the initial Earth's gravitational assistance this year will boost and guide the spacecraft's course past Mars' orbit. In 2024, the probe will again fly back toward Earth for another gravitational assistance, propelling Lucy into the Donaldjohanson asteroid into the main asteroid belt of the solar system.

NASA's Lucy spacecraft is early in its long trek to explore a group of asteroids called the Jupiter Trojans, which are small remnants of our early solar system that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the sun. Lucy launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Oct. 16, 2021, and is preparing for an Earth flyby this fall before it begins its asteroid explorations. During the cruise, mission personnel are also completing tasks like instrument calibration, and new images taken during a February test of the spacecraft's four visible-light cameras offer a detailed view of 11 different star fields. The spacecraft's four cameras include the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera and the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager. The calibration test, which occurred on Feb. 14, used Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform to test the cameras' performance, sensitivity and accuracy when pointed in different directions, according to the NASA statement. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view and are used to automatically lock onto and track certain targets, such as the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. In turn, the twin cameras help ensure that the spacecraft's other instruments are pointed at the target. One of the Feb. 14 test images was a 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula, which is visible in the lower right center of the frame, taken using the T2CAM. MVIC, which is part of the L'Ralph instrument, is a higher-resolution color scanning camera that produces panoramic views of space. During the test, a narrow part of the T2CAM field was captured and processed so that the faint stars could be seen against the dark backdrop of space. Lucy's most sensitive camera, L'LORRI, is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera with a narrow 0.29-degree-square field of view. It is the same kind of telescope as the instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope and will capture the most detailed images of the mission's asteroid targets. The test images captured stars roughly 50,000 times fainter than the unaided human eye can see, according to the NASA statement. The Feb. 14 test was a follow-up to the first set of test images taken in November 2021, only a few months after Lucy's launch. Therefore, this recent test was much more extensive, allowing the spacecraft's team to test its camera functionality. However, the test did not include Lucy's infrared spectrometer LEISA, which is also part of the L'Ralph instrument, or the spacecraft's temperature mapping L'TES instrument, which requires close-up planetary targets to obtain useful data.

NASA's Lucy spacecraft is currently on a six-year journey to Jupiter, traveling through the sparse interplanetary medium since launching in October 2021. Luckily for Lucy, the views have been spectacular. The spacecraft recently captured a series of calibration images, pointing its brand new cameras at 11 different star fields to make sure its photography skills are up to par. The latest batch of images were taken in February, which NASA did to test the spacecraft's camera performance and sensitivity, as well as its ability to point in different directions, according to the space agency. Lucy is on a mission to study the Trojan asteroids, two groups of rocky bodies that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. The Trojans may have existed for the past 4 billion years, but very little is known about them since no spacecraft has paid them a visit just yet. But before Lucy reaches its destination, the team behind the mission is working to ensure the probe's instruments are working properly in space. The spacecraft pointed its cameras toward the Orion Constellation, capturing different groups of stars, as well as a faint, 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula. Lucy is equipped with four visible light cameras: the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and the Long- Range Reconnaissance Imager. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view, and they are designed to automatically lock onto and track the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. The MVIC is a higher-resolution color scanning camera, while L'LORRI is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera designed to capture detailed images of the asteroids. A raw image from L'LORRI revealed stars that are 50,000 times fainter than what the unaided human eye can see. The recent image-taking was a follow-up to an initial test of Lucy's cameras conducted in November, shortly after the spacecraft launched. However, the team has not yet tested Lucy's infrared spectrometer, known as LEISA, or its temperature mapping L'TES instrument, both of which require close-up planetary targets, according to NASA. Shortly after it launched, one of Lucy's solar arrays failed to unfurl properly. However, the spacecraft's systems have been operating normally and the glitch does not seem to have had a major effect on the mission so far. Lucy is named after an exceptionally old hominid fossil found in Ethiopia in 1974, one that provided valuable insights into human evolution. The Lucy spacecraft, by exploring Jupiter's Trojans, could do the same for our understanding of the solar system and its origin story. Lucy is expected to reach the Trojan asteroids in 2027.

Two large arrays of solar cells, which were designed to unfold and latch into place after launch, power the spacecraft. One of the fan-like arrays opened as expected, but the other stopped just short of completing this operation. Through a combination of rigorous in-flight solar array characterization and ground testing, Lucy engineers determined the unlatched solar array is nearly fully open, positioned at approximately 345 out of the full 360 degrees, and is producing ample energy for the spacecraft. Nonetheless, the team is concerned about potential damage to the array if the spacecraft conducts a main engine burn in its present configuration. After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array. The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remain to be retracted for the open array to latch. The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch. The team is now preparing to complete the solar array deployment in two steps. The first step, tentatively scheduled for the week of May 9, is intended to pull in most of the remaining lanyard and verify that flight results are consistent with ground testing. This step will also strengthen the array by bringing it closer to a fully tensioned state. Because this step is designed to be limited in duration, the array is not likely to latch at that point. If this step goes as planned, the second step will continue the array deployment with the intent to fully latch. Information gleaned from the first part will help fine-tune the second. The second step is currently planned for a month after the initial one, giving engineers enough time to analyze the data seen in the first attempt.

It's headed out to Jupiter's orbit - not Jupiter itself, but its orbit - to pass by quite a few asteroids that share their path with the giant planet. In one sense it's the most ambitious asteroid mission ever created: It will take close-up images of at least seven asteroids! These are called Trojan asteroids, and they may have been orbiting the Sun along with Jupiter since the dawn of the solar system. They collect in two spots, one 60\u00b0 ahead and the other 60\u00b0 behind Jupiter in its orbit, and having so many together makes it much easier to get close to and study so many of them in a single mission. Shortly before its launch, I wrote an overview of the mission and its extremely wild trajectory through the inner solar system. Normally you don't hear much from missions like this until they get close to their goal, but as it happens images obtained on Feb. 14, 2022 were just released. They were taken by engineers on Earth to test Lucy's cameras, and they're pretty cool. This photo, taken on Earth in New Mexico, shows the familiar sight of Orion as well as part of Gemini and Monoceros. The image is a long unguided exposure, so the stars are streaked a bit due to Earth's rotation, but it's sufficient for the purpose of showing where Lucy's cameras were pointed when they took their engineering test observations. The red rectangle shows the field of view of Lucy's Terminal Tracking Cameras, also called T2C. These are a pair of cameras - one for main operations and the other as a backup in case something goes awry with the first - with a large field of view that will be used as Lucy approaches each of its asteroid targets. The stars in the field will be analyzed on board to aid in autonomous tracking of the asteroids. It takes roughly half an hour at least for light to reach Earth from Jupiter's orbit, which is too long to control the imaging sequences from the ground, so the spacecraft has to do it itself. The T2C can also take science data; the wide field of view means that even at close approach they can get the whole asteroid at once, and as the spacecraft moves these images can be used to make 3D stereo pairs to determine some surface topography on the asteroids, which is extremely cool. The engineering test image is a little ratty - there's background noise, for example, but that can be processed out - but you can still see a zillion stars. That fuzzy patch at the bottom right is real: That's the fantastic Rosette Nebula, a star- forming gas cloud about 5,000 light years away, with thousands of newborn stars in it. The fact that it can be seen at all in this 10-second exposure speaks well of the camera's sensitivity. The blue strip in the first image shows the field of view of Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, or MVIC, one of the detectors on a camera called L'Ralph. The name is... interesting; the first Ralph camera flew on the New Horizon Pluto mission, and was named that because a different camera on that spacecraft was called Alice, after the husband and wife characters in the old sitcom The Honeymooners. The Ralph camera on Lucy is the same setup, so they called it L'Ralph to show it's a part of Lucy. Anyway, MVIC has five filters that select colors associated with different minerals expected to be seen on the asteroids' surfaces. Although the exposure time was less than one second, many stars can be seen. Note this field overlaps that of T2C so that they can see the same thing at the same time, which will help in scientific analysis. The tiny yellow square in the center of the first image shows the field of view of L'LORRI - the Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager - the highest-resolution camera on Lucy, meaning it will see the most details on the asteroids. In the 10-second test image, stars 1/25,000th as faint as the human eye can see are visible. They're slightly elongated due to the long exposure, but this can be compensated for during science exposures to make usable images. Clearly L'LORRI will be able to see faint details on the asteroids, and is one of the workhorse cameras on Lucy that will provide a vast amount of scientific data. Although none of these images will win a prize for their beauty, they are all indeed beautiful: They show us a working spacecraft 6 months into a mission that will last for many, many years. We're just now T-3 years before it passes its first asteroid - Donaldjohanson, a main- belt rock about 4 kilometers wide - so it won't be too long before the first science images get sent to Earth, and we visit yet another asteroid up close and personal. What will we see? If we knew, we wouldn't have to send missions there. With every spacecraft that investigates new objects up close, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected, and it's never a surprise that we will be surprised.

The problem is with one of Lucy's two solar arrays. These needed to be folded up for launch so the spacecraft could fit inside its launch vehicle, then they deployed once Lucy reached space. The arrays deployed by unfolding, fan-like, into two distinctive round shapes which should then have been latched into place. But one solar array failed to latch correctly after deployment on October 17, 2021. The array was almost completely deployed and was still capable of providing solar energy to the spacecraft, but it was not secured in place as it should have been. The mission team opted to continue with the craft entering cruise mode as planned because the combined two arrays were generating enough power for the mission to go ahead. Now, though, NASA wants to try to lock the array in place once again. Engineers on the ground have been performing tests and looking at data from the spacecraft and have concluded that the array in question is open to 345 out of 360 degrees and is still producing enough power. But there are concerns that if and when the spacecraft fires its main engine, the unlocked solar array could be damaged. In a recent update, NASA shared that on Monday, April 18, the team decided to go ahead with trying to fix the array into its proper place. To do that, they will work with the motor which controls the array deployment. \"After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array,\" NASA writes. \"The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remains to be retracted for the open array to latch.\" The array has both a primary and a backup motor for this deployment, so engineers will try to use both of these motors together to pull the lanyard through and allow the array to latch into place. Testing suggests that the additional torque from using both motors may be enough to tug the lanyard out of its snag. Enacting this plan will require two steps. The first step, scheduled to begin in the week of May 9, is to pull the lanyard taut, which will allow the team to check that the spacecraft is in the same condition as the testing on the ground and will also help to strengthen the array. The second step, scheduled for a month after step one if everything goes well, will be to use the two motors to try to pull the array into place.

Shortly after its October 2021 launch, NASA officials noticed something was wrong with one of the solar arrays. Its readings were unusual, and personnel soon realized that the lanyard wrapping around one solar array hadn't fully retracted, blocking some sunlight from reaching the panels.

According to NASA officials, the faulty array is between 75 percent and 95 percent deployed. The space agency has been monitoring the situation for the last half-year, and on April 18, they decided on a plan forward they hope will solve the issue. They will perform two steps over the next several months to see if the solar array can be fully deployed. The first will happen on May 9, when they will attempt to reel back some of the lanyard in a quick maneuver. The team anticipates that this single operation won't be enough, so they are planning a second array deployment task for a month later, which will hopefully successfully latch the solar array. The month between each task will give the teams time to analyze the best way to perform the second maneuver. \"The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch,\" NASA officials shared in a mission update published last Thursday. So far, the issue hasn't affected the mission too severely. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing. This power level is enough to keep the spacecraft healthy and functioning,\" NASA officials shared three days after launch. Having fully charged batteries is important. Lucy is heading out to Jupiter at a speed of roughly 67,000 mph to study the Trojan asteroids, peculiar rocks significantly different from those found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The Trojans are leftover pieces from the formation of the Solar System that were looped into Jupiter's orbit and thus avoided being ejected into deep space. The Trojans are trapped in two gravitationally stable spots called Lagrange Point 4 and Lagrange Point 5, created by the interaction of the Sun and Jupiter. Lucy will study seven asteroids over 12 years, so having fully-operating batteries will be critical. The team also hopes that, if the lanyard cannot be retracted and the solar array has to stay the way it is, the main engine burns won't mess with the solar array. Lucy will reach its first target in 2025, an Asteroid Belt object dubbed Donaldjohanson. After its encounter with that asteroid, the craft will continue toward the group of Trojans residing in front of Jupiter, targeting a 2027 arrival. After that, a maneuver will bring it back to the inner Solar System to use Earth for a gravity assist in 2031, only to swing back out for a second Trojan trip in 2033 toward the trailing asteroids. The mission is named after the three million-year-old hominid fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Donaldjohanson is named after Lucy's discoverer. \"Lucy\" is both an homage to the science of origins and likely a nod to The Beatles' song that inspired the fossil's name, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator, has previously compared the Trojans to jewels for their \"immense scientific value.\"", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/science/lucy-solar-array-may-maneuver"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft to observe total lunar eclipse on May 16 from deep space", "date": "2022-05-16", "content": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft, which launched last October to study Jupiter's trojan asteroids, will be our eyes and ears for the upcoming lunar eclipse.

Notably, the peak of the total lunar eclipse, wherein the Moon will turn red will occur at 9:41 am, as per Time and Date. It is also worth noting that the eclipse will not be visible in India but you can watch it courtesy of NASA's live stream. Interestingly, the Lucy probe will provide views of the eclipse as if we are seeing it from deep space. The first leg of the spacecraft's journey to the trojan asteroids is making one orbit around the sun and it is currently headed back towards the Earth for a gravity assist this October. According to NASA, the spacecraft reached 65 million miles from the Earth, which is the maximum distance it would travel from our planet during this first year in space. As of now, Lucy is significantly far from Earth, about 70% of the distance between the Earth and the Moon, but scientists are confident that the spacecraft's high-resolution camera will provide sharp images. The photos sent by the spacecraft will be much-awaited since it would view the eclipse from an angle rarely seen. NASA says that from Lucy's position, the gibbous Earth and Moon will be easily visible. When the moon will enter and exit the Earth's shadow, which is the reason for a lunar eclipse, the moon will appear to blink and the phenomenon will be captured by an instrument named L'LORRI fitted aboard the probe. The agency even shared a simulated picture of the Earth and the moon from the perspective of the Lucy spacecraft. An image has also been shared above showing Lucy's orbit which overlaps that of the Earth. \"Viewing this eclipse will allow the Lucy team to do a \"test run\" of the observation procedures, making sure that all the imagers and equipment are working as expected.

Engineers have been studying for months one of two circular solar arrays that did not fully deploy and latch into place after the spacecraft's launch in October 2021. They concluded that a lanyard used to pull open the solar array lost tension during the deployment process, causing the lanyard to wrap around the motor shaft. On May 9, controllers issued commands to run both the primary and backup motors for the solar array deployment process simultaneously, hoping that a harder pull would be sufficient to restore tension in the lanyard and continue deployment of the array. The spacecraft similarly ran both motors three times since then. \"That's allowing us to make significant process towards latch, but we're not latched yet,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a presentation at a meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group June 8. \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array.\" That tensioning, he said, is a positive sign even though the array has not latched into place. \"It makes it likely that, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as-is,\" he said, noting the array, in its current configuration, is generating more than 90% of its planned power.

Soon after the spacecraft's launch, which was conducted on October 16 last year, the engineers noticed that one of Lucy's two solar panels is unfurled between 75% to 95% but assured that this would not hinder the probe's journey. Now, in June 2022, the mission team is still struggling with the jammed solar panel. Lucy was launched by NASA last year to study eight Trojan asteroids of Jupiter. Lucy would fly past one of the main belt asteroids and seven Trojan asteroids during the following 12 years, marking it the first single spaceship expedition of NASA to visit so many distinct asteroids.

One of Lucy's two UltraFlex circular solar arrays opened to about 96% of its fully deployed state after arriving in space last October following a launch from Cape Canaveral. The other solar array fully unfurled as the spacecraft began a robotic science mission to fly through swarms of unexplored asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. In recent weeks, ground teams at a Lockheed Martin control center in Colorado have uplinked commands for Lucy run primary and backup motors to drive the stuck solar array closer to full deployment. NASA believes a lanyard used to pull the solar array open somehow lost tension and fell off a spool during the initial deployment last October, preventing the array from completely opening. Additional attempts to pull the solar array open have further reeled in the lanyard. The first try May 9 involved running the deployment motors in a series of short intervals to avoid overheating. Ground controllers sent more commands May 12, further advancing the solar array deployment and adding tension to the structure, helping stabilize the array. Engineers made more progress during two additional deployment attempts May 26 and June 2. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA said. Most recently, the Lucy ground team sent another command to run the deployment motors June 9, which continued to \"further stabilize the array,\" NASA said. \"There are future opportunities to repeat the deployment commands if necessary.\" Officials are increasingly optimistic that the Lucy mission can proceed without any issues, even if the solar array does not latch into place. Before the recent tries to fully deploy the array, the spacecraft's power system was generating more than 90% of the expected level of 18,000 watts. \"While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it,\" NASA said in a statement. \"Even if the array does not ultimately latch, the additional stiffening may be enough to fly the mission as planned.\" \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"These things are made out of cloth, and where you get a lot of the strength is by putting it under tension. And we're clearly at a point where we're tensioning the array, which makes it likely, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as is.\" One concern engineers have studied is the effect of engine burns on the partially deployed array. The Lucy spacecraft completed its first trajectory correction maneuver June 7 to help guide it toward a flyby with Earth in October, the first of multiple gravity assists to slingshot the probe toward Jupiter's orbit in the distant solar system. Lucy has also extended the platform holding its scientific instruments, and the sensors are all working as designed, Levison said. Lucy will become the farthest spacecraft from the sun to ever rely on solar power, reaching a maximum distance of 530 million miles, nearly six times farther than Earth's orbit. When it reaches the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's solar arrays were expected to generate just 500 watts of power. That level of power output is sufficient to feed Lucy's three science instruments, which only need about 82 watts of power during each asteroid encounter. Lucy's flight computer, communications system, and other components will also draw on power generated by the UltraFlex arrays. The $981 million Lucy Mission is the first to explore the Trojan asteroids, which scientists say are leftover building blocks similar to objects that came together to form the solar system's giant outer planets. The probe will fly by eight Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, plus one object in the main asteroid belt in 2025. That's one more asteroid than scientists expected Lucy to visit when it launched last year. One of the Trojan asteroids on Lucy's tour, named Polymele, has a companion. Scientists discovered an apparent satellite of Polymele during a ground-based occultation observation in March, when Polymele briefly passed in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light from reaching Earth. The occultation observations were intended to help the Lucy science team determine the shape of Polymele, which only appears as a point of light in telescope images. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Levison said last week in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" Lucy's science team has temporarily named the object Shaun, after \"Shaun the Sheep\" in the show \"Wallace and Gromit.\" More data on the object's exact position and orbit are required to assign a permanent name to Polymele's companion, and that probably won't happen until after Lucy's flyby in 2027. Polymele itself has an \"oblate spheroid,\" or gourd-like, shape and measures about 17 miles long and 8 miles wide. The shape of Polymele suggests it is likely a leftover remnant from the young solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago, and may have avoided any collisions with other objects throughout its history. \"It's hard to imagine you can get that shape ... out of an object that's collisionally evolved, so my thinking right now is Polymele is probably a primordial object, which is going to make seeing it really fascinating.\" Polymele's companion is not the first asteroid to be added to Lucy's flight plan since the mission was approved by NASA in 2017. Astronomers announced in 2020 that observations with the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed a small object, less than 1 kilometer in diameter, orbiting asteroid Eurybates, another Lucy target in the Trojan belt.

In 2027, Lucy will become the first human-made object to fly past one of these asteroids. The mission was designed to zoom past a main-belt asteroid then swing through a complicated itinerary of Trojan asteroids. And now, scientists have determined that one of Lucy's original target asteroids has a companion: another, tiny asteroid that orbits it and that Lucy will also be able to observe, Spaceflight Now reports. Lucy's third target is an asteroid called Polymele, a gourd-shaped space rock that's roughly 13 miles from end to end. Polymele's shape is strange for an asteroid, suggesting that it's a remnant from the very early solar system - one that has managed to avoid collisions so far. In March, astronomers observing Polymele in preparation for Lucy's eventual visit watched the asteroid pass in front of a star, blocking that star's distant light. In the process, they found something very curious: a tiny companion space rock. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and Lucy's principal investigator, said in a presentation last week, according to Spaceflight Now. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" That companion does not have a name and won't have one until scientists know more about the asteroid's exact orbit, which might not happen until Lucy's visit.

On Oct. 16, Lucy will fly by Earth to pick up speed for its journey to nine Trojan asteroids orbiting the sun at the same distance as Jupiter; the spacecraft will also emerge from the partial blackout at that time. NASA may attempt to get that tricky solar array further deployed while the spacecraft remains nearby \"if deemed necessary,\" officials wrote in the post.

After its Earth gravity assist maneuver on October 16, the spacecraft will emerge from this partial communications blackout. At that time, the mission team will have more opportunities to attempt further deployment efforts if deemed necessary. On June 21, the spacecraft successfully carried out a trajectory correction maneuver, which is the second in a series of maneuvers to prepare the spacecraft for its Earth flyby.

NASA's Lucy spacecraft is early in its long trek to explore a group of asteroids called the Jupiter Trojans, which are small remnants of our early solar system that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the sun. Lucy launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Oct. 16, 2021, and is preparing for an Earth flyby this fall before it begins its asteroid explorations. During the cruise, mission personnel are also completing tasks like instrument calibration, and new images taken during a February test of the spacecraft's four visible-light cameras offer a detailed view of 11 different star fields. The spacecraft's four cameras include the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera and the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager. The calibration test, which occurred on Feb. 14, used Lucy's Instrument Pointing Platform to test the cameras' performance, sensitivity and accuracy when pointed in different directions, according to the NASA statement. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view and are used to automatically lock onto and track certain targets, such as the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. In turn, the twin cameras help ensure that the spacecraft's other instruments are pointed at the target. One of the Feb. 14 test images was a 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula, which is visible in the lower right center of the frame, taken using the T2CAM. MVIC, which is part of the L'Ralph instrument, is a higher-resolution color scanning camera that produces panoramic views of space. During the test, a narrow part of the T2CAM field was captured and processed so that the faint stars could be seen against the dark backdrop of space. Lucy's most sensitive camera, L'LORRI, is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera with a narrow 0.29-degree-square field of view. It is the same kind of telescope as the instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope and will capture the most detailed images of the mission's asteroid targets. The test images captured stars roughly 50,000 times fainter than the unaided human eye can see, according to the NASA statement. The Feb. 14 test was a follow-up to the first set of test images taken in November 2021, only a few months after Lucy's launch. Therefore, this recent test was much more extensive, allowing the spacecraft's team to test its camera functionality. However, the test did not include Lucy's infrared spectrometer LEISA, which is also part of the L'Ralph instrument, or the spacecraft's temperature mapping L'TES instrument, which requires close-up planetary targets to obtain useful data. The Lucy spacecraft is slated to arrive at its first target in 2025 - a main belt asteroid named 52246 Donaldjohanson after the paleontologist who discovered the hominin fossil Lucy that is the mission's namesake.", "url": "https://www.space.com/nasa-lucy-asteroid-mission-test-star-photos"}, {"title": "See Postcards From NASA's Lucy Spacecraft as It Journeys to Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids", "date": "2022-04-20", "content": "Traveling through space can get lonely. NASA's Lucy spacecraft is currently on a six-year journey to Jupiter, traveling through the sparse interplanetary medium since launching in October 2021. Luckily for Lucy, the views have been spectacular. The spacecraft recently captured a series of calibration images, pointing its brand new cameras at 11 different star fields to make sure its photography skills are up to par. The latest batch of images were taken in February, which NASA did to test the spacecraft's camera performance and sensitivity, as well as its ability to point in different directions, according to the space agency. Lucy is on a mission to study the Trojan asteroids, two groups of rocky bodies that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. The Trojans may have existed for the past 4 billion years, but very little is known about them since no spacecraft has paid them a visit just yet. But before Lucy reaches its destination, the team behind the mission is working to ensure the probe's instruments are working properly in space. The spacecraft pointed its cameras toward the Orion Constellation, capturing different groups of stars, as well as a faint, 10-second exposure of the Rosette Nebula. Lucy is equipped with four visible light cameras: the twin Terminal Tracking Cameras, the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, and the Long- Range Reconnaissance Imager. The T2CAM cameras have a wide field of view, and they are designed to automatically lock onto and track the Trojan asteroids during Lucy's close flybys. The MVIC is a higher-resolution color scanning camera, while L'LORRI is a high-resolution monochromatic telephoto camera designed to capture detailed images of the asteroids. A raw image from L'LORRI revealed stars that are 50,000 times fainter than what the unaided human eye can see. The recent image-taking was a follow-up to an initial test of Lucy's cameras conducted in November, shortly after the spacecraft launched. However, the team has not yet tested Lucy's infrared spectrometer, known as LEISA, or its temperature mapping L'TES instrument, both of which require close-up planetary targets, according to NASA. Shortly after it launched, one of Lucy's solar arrays failed to unfurl properly. However, the spacecraft's systems have been operating normally and the glitch does not seem to have had a major effect on the mission so far. Lucy is named after an exceptionally old hominid fossil found in Ethiopia in 1974, one that provided valuable insights into human evolution. The Lucy spacecraft, by exploring Jupiter's Trojans, could do the same for our understanding of the solar system and its origin story. Lucy is expected to reach the Trojan asteroids in 2027.

Two large arrays of solar cells, which were designed to unfold and latch into place after launch, power the spacecraft. One of the fan-like arrays opened as expected, but the other stopped just short of completing this operation. Through a combination of rigorous in-flight solar array characterization and ground testing, Lucy engineers determined the unlatched solar array is nearly fully open, positioned at approximately 345 out of the full 360 degrees, and is producing ample energy for the spacecraft. Nonetheless, the team is concerned about potential damage to the array if the spacecraft conducts a main engine burn in its present configuration. After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array. The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remain to be retracted for the open array to latch. The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch. The team is now preparing to complete the solar array deployment in two steps. The first step, tentatively scheduled for the week of May 9, is intended to pull in most of the remaining lanyard and verify that flight results are consistent with ground testing. This step will also strengthen the array by bringing it closer to a fully tensioned state. Because this step is designed to be limited in duration, the array is not likely to latch at that point. If this step goes as planned, the second step will continue the array deployment with the intent to fully latch. Information gleaned from the first part will help fine-tune the second. The second step is currently planned for a month after the initial one, giving engineers enough time to analyze the data seen in the first attempt.

It's headed out to Jupiter's orbit - not Jupiter itself, but its orbit - to pass by quite a few asteroids that share their path with the giant planet. In one sense it's the most ambitious asteroid mission ever created: It will take close-up images of at least seven asteroids! These are called Trojan asteroids, and they may have been orbiting the Sun along with Jupiter since the dawn of the solar system. They collect in two spots, one 60\u00b0 ahead and the other 60\u00b0 behind Jupiter in its orbit, and having so many together makes it much easier to get close to and study so many of them in a single mission. Shortly before its launch, I wrote an overview of the mission and its extremely wild trajectory through the inner solar system. Normally you don't hear much from missions like this until they get close to their goal, but as it happens images obtained on Feb. 14, 2022 were just released. They were taken by engineers on Earth to test Lucy's cameras, and they're pretty cool. This photo, taken on Earth in New Mexico, shows the familiar sight of Orion as well as part of Gemini and Monoceros. The image is a long unguided exposure, so the stars are streaked a bit due to Earth's rotation, but it's sufficient for the purpose of showing where Lucy's cameras were pointed when they took their engineering test observations. The red rectangle shows the field of view of Lucy's Terminal Tracking Cameras, also called T2C. These are a pair of cameras - one for main operations and the other as a backup in case something goes awry with the first - with a large field of view that will be used as Lucy approaches each of its asteroid targets. The stars in the field will be analyzed on board to aid in autonomous tracking of the asteroids. It takes roughly half an hour at least for light to reach Earth from Jupiter's orbit, which is too long to control the imaging sequences from the ground, so the spacecraft has to do it itself. The T2C can also take science data; the wide field of view means that even at close approach they can get the whole asteroid at once, and as the spacecraft moves these images can be used to make 3D stereo pairs to determine some surface topography on the asteroids, which is extremely cool. The engineering test image is a little ratty - there's background noise, for example, but that can be processed out - but you can still see a zillion stars. That fuzzy patch at the bottom right is real: That's the fantastic Rosette Nebula, a star- forming gas cloud about 5,000 light years away, with thousands of newborn stars in it. The fact that it can be seen at all in this 10-second exposure speaks well of the camera's sensitivity. The blue strip in the first image shows the field of view of Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera, or MVIC, one of the detectors on a camera called L'Ralph. The name is... interesting; the first Ralph camera flew on the New Horizon Pluto mission, and was named that because a different camera on that spacecraft was called Alice, after the husband and wife characters in the old sitcom The Honeymooners. The Ralph camera on Lucy is the same setup, so they called it L'Ralph to show it's a part of Lucy. Anyway, MVIC has five filters that select colors associated with different minerals expected to be seen on the asteroids' surfaces. Although the exposure time was less than one second, many stars can be seen. Note this field overlaps that of T2C so that they can see the same thing at the same time, which will help in scientific analysis. The tiny yellow square in the center of the first image shows the field of view of L'LORRI - the Lucy LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager - the highest-resolution camera on Lucy, meaning it will see the most details on the asteroids. In the 10-second test image, stars 1/25,000th as faint as the human eye can see are visible. They're slightly elongated due to the long exposure, but this can be compensated for during science exposures to make usable images. Clearly L'LORRI will be able to see faint details on the asteroids, and is one of the workhorse cameras on Lucy that will provide a vast amount of scientific data. Although none of these images will win a prize for their beauty, they are all indeed beautiful: They show us a working spacecraft 6 months into a mission that will last for many, many years. We're just now T-3 years before it passes its first asteroid - Donaldjohanson, a main- belt rock about 4 kilometers wide - so it won't be too long before the first science images get sent to Earth, and we visit yet another asteroid up close and personal. What will we see? If we knew, we wouldn't have to send missions there. With every spacecraft that investigates new objects up close, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected, and it's never a surprise that we will be surprised.

The problem is with one of Lucy's two solar arrays. These needed to be folded up for launch so the spacecraft could fit inside its launch vehicle, then they deployed once Lucy reached space. The arrays deployed by unfolding, fan-like, into two distinctive round shapes which should then have been latched into place. But one solar array failed to latch correctly after deployment on October 17, 2021. The array was almost completely deployed and was still capable of providing solar energy to the spacecraft, but it was not secured in place as it should have been. The mission team opted to continue with the craft entering cruise mode as planned because the combined two arrays were generating enough power for the mission to go ahead. Now, though, NASA wants to try to lock the array in place once again. Engineers on the ground have been performing tests and looking at data from the spacecraft and have concluded that the array in question is open to 345 out of 360 degrees and is still producing enough power. But there are concerns that if and when the spacecraft fires its main engine, the unlocked solar array could be damaged. In a recent update, NASA shared that on Monday, April 18, the team decided to go ahead with trying to fix the array into its proper place. To do that, they will work with the motor which controls the array deployment. \"After launch, the arrays were opened by a small motor that reels in a lanyard attached to both ends of the folded solar array,\" NASA writes. \"The team estimates that 20 to 40 inches of this lanyard remains to be retracted for the open array to latch.\" The array has both a primary and a backup motor for this deployment, so engineers will try to use both of these motors together to pull the lanyard through and allow the array to latch into place. Testing suggests that the additional torque from using both motors may be enough to tug the lanyard out of its snag. Enacting this plan will require two steps. The first step, scheduled to begin in the week of May 9, is to pull the lanyard taut, which will allow the team to check that the spacecraft is in the same condition as the testing on the ground and will also help to strengthen the array. The second step, scheduled for a month after step one if everything goes well, will be to use the two motors to try to pull the array into place.

On Thursday, the Lucy team announced that it would perform two maneuvers to fully unfurl its solar arrays. The Lucy mission will study the crumbs leftover from the early Solar System, and it needs to reach Jupiter's orbit, where two gravitational crevices have collected them. Operating farther from the Sun requires big solar arrays to capture the diminishing sunlight for energy, so Lucy was equipped with two peeper-like solar wings. Shortly after its October 2021 launch, NASA officials noticed something was wrong with one of the solar arrays. Its readings were unusual, and personnel soon realized that the lanyard wrapping around one solar array hadn't fully retracted, blocking some sunlight from reaching the panels. An engineering model suggests that upon retracting, \"the lanyard may not have wound on the spool as intended,\" NASA reported one month after launch. According to NASA officials, the faulty array is between 75 percent and 95 percent deployed. The space agency has been monitoring the situation for the last half-year, and on April 18, they decided on a plan forward they hope will solve the issue. They will perform two steps over the next several months to see if the solar array can be fully deployed. The first will happen on May 9, when they will attempt to reel back some of the lanyard in a quick maneuver. The team anticipates that this single operation won't be enough, so they are planning a second array deployment task for a month later, which will hopefully successfully latch the solar array. The month between each task will give the teams time to analyze the best way to perform the second maneuver. \"The solar array was designed with both a primary and a backup motor winding to give an added layer of reliability for the mission-critical solar array deployment. Lucy engineers will take advantage of this redundancy by using both motors simultaneously to generate higher torque than was used on the day of launch. Ground tests show that this added torque may be enough to pull the snarled lanyard the remaining distance needed to latch,\" NASA officials shared in a mission update published last Thursday. So far, the issue hasn't affected the mission too severely. \"That solar array is generating nearly the expected power when compared to the fully deployed wing. This power level is enough to keep the spacecraft healthy and functioning,\" NASA officials shared three days after launch. Having fully charged batteries is important. Lucy is heading out to Jupiter at a speed of roughly 67,000 mph to study the Trojan asteroids, peculiar rocks significantly different from those found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The Trojans are leftover pieces from the formation of the Solar System that were looped into Jupiter's orbit and thus avoided being ejected into deep space. The Trojans are trapped in two gravitationally stable spots called Lagrange Point 4 and Lagrange Point 5, created by the interaction of the Sun and Jupiter. Lucy will study seven asteroids over 12 years, so having fully-operating batteries will be critical. The team also hopes that, if the lanyard cannot be retracted and the solar array has to stay the way it is, the main engine burns won't mess with the solar array. Lucy will reach its first target in 2025, an Asteroid Belt object dubbed Donaldjohanson. After its encounter with that asteroid, the craft will continue toward the group of Trojans residing in front of Jupiter, targeting a 2027 arrival. After that, a maneuver will bring it back to the inner Solar System to use Earth for a gravity assist in 2031, only to swing back out for a second Trojan trip in 2033 toward the trailing asteroids. The mission is named after the three million-year-old hominid fossil discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Donaldjohanson is named after Lucy's discoverer. \"Lucy\" is both an homage to the science of origins and likely a nod to The Beatles' song that inspired the fossil's name, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator, has previously compared the Trojans to jewels for their \"immense scientific value.\"", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/science/lucy-solar-array-may-maneuver"}, {"title": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft to observe total lunar eclipse on May 16 from deep space", "date": "2022-05-16", "content": "NASA's Lucy spacecraft, which launched last October to study Jupiter's trojan asteroids, will be our eyes and ears for the upcoming lunar eclipse.

Engineers have been studying for months one of two circular solar arrays that did not fully deploy and latch into place after the spacecraft's launch in October 2021. They concluded that a lanyard used to pull open the solar array lost tension during the deployment process, causing the lanyard to wrap around the motor shaft. On May 9, controllers issued commands to run both the primary and backup motors for the solar array deployment process simultaneously, hoping that a harder pull would be sufficient to restore tension in the lanyard and continue deployment of the array. The spacecraft similarly ran both motors three times since then. \"That's allowing us to make significant process towards latch, but we're not latched yet,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a presentation at a meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group June 8. \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array.\" That tensioning, he said, is a positive sign even though the array has not latched into place. \"It makes it likely that, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as-is,\" he said, noting the array, in its current configuration, is generating more than 90% of its planned power.

While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt\", the agency said in a statement. NASA said that there are a few more opportunities to attempt the deployment of the panels but there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array. This is because the team believes that the repeated process using the motors is putting more tension on the array and is further stabilising it. However, NASA is confident that even if the panels do not latch completely, it will be enough for the spacecraft to continue its journey. Notably, Lucy completed its trajectory correction manoeuvre on June 7, which was the first in the series of manoeuvres it will execute before its first- ever Earth gravity assist scheduled for October 16 this year.

The Lucy mission, which launched in October 2021, has two large, circular solar arrays, each spanning 24 feet, to provide power for its pioneering voyage. However, one of the arrays failed to fully deploy after launch, posing a problem for the team. An update in January stated that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, due to an issue with a lanyard suspected to have prevented full deployment, but work to fix the issue has continued. After a series of tests and measures, the team again commanded the spacecraft to deploy the solar array on May 26, using both primary and backup motors to try to tighten the lanyard and complete deployment. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA Lucy mission representatives wrote in a June 8 update. \"The team has several more opportunities to repeat these deployment commands. While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it.\" But even if the array does not fully deploy, Lucy may be able to fly as planned.

One of Lucy's two UltraFlex circular solar arrays opened to about 96% of its fully deployed state after arriving in space last October following a launch from Cape Canaveral. The other solar array fully unfurled as the spacecraft began a robotic science mission to fly through swarms of unexplored asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. In recent weeks, ground teams at a Lockheed Martin control center in Colorado have uplinked commands for Lucy run primary and backup motors to drive the stuck solar array closer to full deployment. NASA believes a lanyard used to pull the solar array open somehow lost tension and fell off a spool during the initial deployment last October, preventing the array from completely opening. Additional attempts to pull the solar array open have further reeled in the lanyard. The first try May 9 involved running the deployment motors in a series of short intervals to avoid overheating. Ground controllers sent more commands May 12, further advancing the solar array deployment and adding tension to the structure, helping stabilize the array. Engineers made more progress during two additional deployment attempts May 26 and June 2. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA said. Most recently, the Lucy ground team sent another command to run the deployment motors June 9, which continued to \"further stabilize the array,\" NASA said. \"There are future opportunities to repeat the deployment commands if necessary.\" Officials are increasingly optimistic that the Lucy mission can proceed without any issues, even if the solar array does not latch into place. Before the recent tries to fully deploy the array, the spacecraft's power system was generating more than 90% of the expected level of 18,000 watts. \"While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it,\" NASA said in a statement. \"Even if the array does not ultimately latch, the additional stiffening may be enough to fly the mission as planned.\" \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"These things are made out of cloth, and where you get a lot of the strength is by putting it under tension. And we're clearly at a point where we're tensioning the array, which makes it likely, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as is.\" One concern engineers have studied is the effect of engine burns on the partially deployed array. The Lucy spacecraft completed its first trajectory correction maneuver June 7 to help guide it toward a flyby with Earth in October, the first of multiple gravity assists to slingshot the probe toward Jupiter's orbit in the distant solar system. Lucy has also extended the platform holding its scientific instruments, and the sensors are all working as designed, Levison said. Lucy will become the farthest spacecraft from the sun to ever rely on solar power, reaching a maximum distance of 530 million miles, nearly six times farther than Earth's orbit. When it reaches the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's solar arrays were expected to generate just 500 watts of power. That level of power output is sufficient to feed Lucy's three science instruments, which only need about 82 watts of power during each asteroid encounter. Lucy's flight computer, communications system, and other components will also draw on power generated by the UltraFlex arrays. The $981 million Lucy Mission is the first to explore the Trojan asteroids, which scientists say are leftover building blocks similar to objects that came together to form the solar system's giant outer planets. The probe will fly by eight Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, plus one object in the main asteroid belt in 2025. That's one more asteroid than scientists expected Lucy to visit when it launched last year. One of the Trojan asteroids on Lucy's tour, named Polymele, has a companion. Scientists discovered an apparent satellite of Polymele during a ground-based occultation observation in March, when Polymele briefly passed in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light from reaching Earth. The occultation observations were intended to help the Lucy science team determine the shape of Polymele, which only appears as a point of light in telescope images. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Levison said last week in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" Lucy's science team has temporarily named the object Shaun, after \"Shaun the Sheep\" in the show \"Wallace and Gromit.\" More data on the object's exact position and orbit are required to assign a permanent name to Polymele's companion, and that probably won't happen until after Lucy's flyby in 2027. Polymele itself has an \"oblate spheroid,\" or gourd-like, shape and measures about 17 miles long and 8 miles wide. The shape of Polymele suggests it is likely a leftover remnant from the young solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago, and may have avoided any collisions with other objects throughout its history. \"It's hard to imagine you can get that shape ... out of an object that's collisionally evolved, so my thinking right now is Polymele is probably a primordial object, which is going to make seeing it really fascinating.\" Polymele's companion is not the first asteroid to be added to Lucy's flight plan since the mission was approved by NASA in 2017. Astronomers announced in 2020 that observations with the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed a small object, less than 1 kilometer in diameter, orbiting asteroid Eurybates, another Lucy target in the Trojan belt.

In 2027, Lucy will become the first human-made object to fly past one of these asteroids. The mission was designed to zoom past a main-belt asteroid then swing through a complicated itinerary of Trojan asteroids. And now, scientists have determined that one of Lucy's original target asteroids has a companion: another, tiny asteroid that orbits it and that Lucy will also be able to observe, Spaceflight Now reports. Lucy's third target is an asteroid called Polymele, a gourd-shaped space rock that's roughly 13 miles from end to end. Polymele's shape is strange for an asteroid, suggesting that it's a remnant from the very early solar system - one that has managed to avoid collisions so far. In March, astronomers observing Polymele in preparation for Lucy's eventual visit watched the asteroid pass in front of a star, blocking that star's distant light. In the process, they found something very curious: a tiny companion space rock. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and Lucy's principal investigator, said in a presentation last week, according to Spaceflight Now. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" That companion does not have a name and won't have one until scientists know more about the asteroid's exact orbit, which might not happen until Lucy's visit. But some astronomers have jokingly begun calling it Shaun after the character in the animation \"Shaun the Sheep.\" Shaun is the second space rock to be added to the Lucy mission's itinerary: In 2020, scientists working on the mission determined that target asteroid Eurybates also boasts a small companion.

This new object was identified by scientists when they discovered one of Lucy's targets - Polymele - having a companion in March this year when the asteroid briefly passed in front of the star. Currently on a 12-year-long journey, Lucy will become the first man-made object to fly past one of the trojan asteroids in 2027. The mission was launched with the objective to study one main-belt asteroid and seven trojan asteroids which are clustered around the two Lagrange points equidistant from the Sun and Jupiter. Scientists believe that these primitive asteroids hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system as they might be leftover building blocks. Lucy will fly by each of these asteroids in a span of 12 years and the initial Earth's gravitational assistance this year will boost and guide the spacecraft's course past Mars' orbit. In 2024, the probe will again fly back toward Earth for another gravitational assistance, propelling Lucy into the Donaldjohanson asteroid into the main asteroid belt of the solar system.

Following its liftoff from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the solar arrays got stuck during their deployment and were somewhere between 75% to 95%, NASA revealed. Most recently, the engineers tried to free the jammed arrays by using both the primary and backup motor windings to pull them outward. According to NASA, the commands to start the panel-deploying motors were first sent on May 9, May 12 and May 26, and the results of the process were analysed.

The agency said it has made \"significant progress\" in dealing with a solar array on the Lucy mission that failed to fully deploy after the spacecraft's launch, which took place in October 2021. Engineers have been troubleshooting the matter for months. Lucy has two near-circular solar arrays that are each 24 feet across and designed to unfold like a fan. The arrays are crucial in providing power to the mission, but one of the arrays faced an issue in deployment. An update in January stated that at the time, the second array was a little less than 350 degrees deployed, due to an issue with a lanyard. On Thursday, however, NASA officials stated the Lucy team managed to get the array to between 353 degrees and 357 degrees open. \"The array is under substantially more tension, giving it significantly more stabilization,\" agency officials added in a blog post. \"The mission team is increasingly confident the solar array will successfully meet the mission's needs in its current tensioned and stabilized state.\" However, NASA must now pause its efforts to assist Lucy because the spacecraft is moving into a location where it cannot easily receive commands from its humans back on Earth. \"Due to thermal constraints caused by the relative positions of the Earth, spacecraft and sun, the spacecraft will be unable to communicate with the Earth via its high-gain antenna for several months,\" NASA officials wrote. While engineers can stay in contact with Lucy through a low-gain antenna, that transmitter can process less data. Full communications should resume in October, according to NASA. On Oct. 16, Lucy will fly by Earth to pick up speed for its journey to nine Trojan asteroids orbiting the sun at the same distance as Jupiter; the spacecraft will also emerge from the partial blackout at that time. NASA may attempt to get that tricky solar array further deployed while the spacecraft remains nearby \"if deemed necessary,\" officials wrote in the post. Lucy successfully completed a trajectory correction maneuver on June 21, NASA noted. Although the spacecraft receives plenty of power while it is near Earth, the arrays will need to be close to full deployment to generate enough electricity at the orbit of Jupiter, where sunlight is much fainter. The enormous gas giant planet has an average orbital distance of 484 million miles from the sun, roughly five times more distant than Earth is. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit the Trojan asteroids of Jupiter, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind the planet.

As a consequence of this work, the mission succeeded in further deploying the array and now estimates that the solar array is between 353 degrees and 357 degrees open. Furthermore, the array is under considerably more tension, giving it substantially more stabilization. Because of this, the mission team is increasingly optimistic the solar array will successfully meet the mission's requirements in its current tensioned and stabilized state.

However, a problem arose just 12 hours after launch - one of the large solar arrays designed to generate power from an increasingly distant Sun had failed to fully deploy and latch. Now, NASA has announced that a team was able to troubleshoot the problem sufficiently for the mission to continue - thanks to several clever tricks. Hours after the problem was first discovered, NASA pulled together an anomaly response team with members from the science mission lead Southwest Research Institute, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the spacecraft's builder, Northrop Grumman. Since there's no camera aimed at the solar arrays, the team had to figure out another way to find the problem. To that end, they fired the spacecraft's thrusters to measure any anomalous vibrations, and created a detailed model of the array's motor assembly to determine the array's rigidness. They finally figured out that a lanyard designed to pull the array open was probably snagged on its spool.

Not nowTurn onTurned onTurn on The team quickly honed in on two potential solutions. One was simply to use the array as it was, because it was still generating 90 percent of expected power. The other was to attempt to pull the lanyard harder by using the back- up deployment motor as well as the primary motor, hopefully allowing it to wind further and engage the latching mechanism. Both motors were never designed to work at the same time, so the team modeled it to test out possible outcomes and potential ripple effects. After months of simulations, they decided to proceed with the two-motor option. They ran both the primary and backup solar deployment motors simultaneously seven times, and succeeded in further opening and tensioning the array. Unfortunately, it didn't close enough to latch, but it's now \"under substantially more tension, making it stable enough for the spacecraft to operate as needed for mission operations,\" NASA said. It's now \"ready and able\" to complete its next deadline, getting a boost from Earth's gravity in October 2022. It's scheduled to arrive at its first asteroid target in 2025.

NASA's Lucy spacecraft rocketed off our planet at 5:34 a.m. on October 16, 2021, so Levison and his team had been up all night preparing. It was a spectacular, \"picture perfect\" launch, recalls Levison, who is the Lucy mission principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The spacecraft would soon be on its way to the Trojan asteroids, unexplored fossils of the solar system that sit roughly the same distance from the sun as Jupiter. Those small space rocks, which are thought to have formed from the same processes that created the planets, could shed light on how our world came to be. But then, just a few hours after launch, the team received data from Lucy that revealed that one of her two solar arrays-which power the spacecraft's systems- hadn't fully opened. Without both solar arrays deployed, the team wasn't sure Lucy would make it to her intended destination. \"The basic mission was in jeopardy,\" Levison says. There would be no time for a nap. \"It was a very hard day.\" The team jumped into action to figure out what went wrong and to devise a solution. After months of sleuthing through the data, testing ideas on computer models and spare parts on the ground, and considering alternative trajectories for the scientific mission, the Lucy engineering team came up with a plan, which they set into action earlier this summer. Now, the spacecraft's troublesome solar array is almost completely unfurled-enough so that the mission can continue as planned. \"The state of the spacecraft is much, much healthier,\" Levison says, calling the feat pulled off by the team's engineers \"totally amazing and brilliant.\" When the mission engineers first discovered the problem, they didn't immediately know what had gone wrong. All the data showed them was that one of the solar arrays hadn't completely unfurled and latched into place. The engineers couldn't get a visual because Lucy's cameras point outward. Everything came through data about the spacecraft's performance. Lucy's solar arrays are like large folding fans. When the spacecraft launched, the arrays were folded up. To deploy them, a motor pulled on a lanyard attached to each array. Then, if it had reached full deployment, a latch would have held the edge of the array in place, keeping it from moving. \"What we think happened is somewhere along in the deployment, that lanyard got misaligned and came out of the spool that brings the lanyard toward the latching mechanism,\" explains Mark Effertz, spacecraft lead engineer for Lucy at Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft. The team had no direct data about the lanyard being tangled, he adds, but they extrapolated that it \"started to snarl on either side of the spool and create a kind of bundle of lanyard as the motor kept pulling.\" With the power supply in jeopardy, the engineers determined that they had two main choices, Effertz says: They could fly Lucy as-is, and change the course of the mission. Or, they could keep tugging on the lanyard. If the team decided to keep the solar array partly furled, Levison says, the science team would have likely had to select a new, less power-hungry trajectory for the spacecraft. And that would mean not going to the group of eight, hand-selected Trojan asteroids. Instead, he says, the spacecraft would travel a shorter distance to three small Trojans. Levison doesn't mince words about that alternative plan, saying those asteroids are \"much less interesting, scientifically.\" That's because the original trajectory took Lucy by a richly diverse group of asteroids. They range in size and in color from gray to red, and are close together, making it possible for the spacecraft to study many in one trip. It's their diversity that piqued Levison and others' interests, because it likely means that these asteroids formed in far-flung areas of the solar system. Some probably hail from the outer solar system. Levison likes to call the Trojan asteroids \"fossils,\" and even named the mission \"Lucy\" after the famous hominin fossil that has contributed significant insights to our current understanding of early human ancestors. This mission, he explains, aims to answer questions about our origins in other ways. \"Planets don't form, if you'll excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" Levison says. \"Planetary systems form as part of an ecosystem where the growing planets are competing for food, they're knocking each other around gravitationally, they move around.\" The Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early parts of that evolutionary process and therefore windows into our planetary origins. So the team decided the original trajectory for the Lucy space mission was worth rescuing and devised a plan to yank the lanyard a bit harder in an attempt to fully deploy the snagged solar array. The spacecraft had a backup motor built into its system in case the primary motor to pull the lanyard failed. \"We never really designed both motors to run at the same time. But we found that there was a way to\" tell the spacecraft to do it anyway, Effertz says. Using both motors at the same time gives it more torque, or pulling power, he explains. Although this maneuver doesn't detangle the snarled lanyard, it can wind up more of the lanyard onto the spool over the tangle, pulling the array open and holding tension on the line. The team estimates that Lucy's troubled solar array is now nearly fully open, though it isn't secured in place with the latch. That configuration seems to be generating enough power to get Lucy to its original target Trojans. The engineers are still considering pulling further on the lanyard in the hopes of getting it to latch. But there are risks associated, Effertz says. The tangle would get bigger and bigger, which could rub against the spacecraft and that might cause new problems. They have time to decide, however, as Lucy is currently flying through a region where the team can't use the craft's antenna to download the necessary data, Effertz says. So any further tweaks will have to wait until around November.

In preparation for the Lucy mission to explore a distant class of asteroids called the Trojans, astronomers have been monitoring the targeted space rocks. One day in March, mission personnel gathered 26 different teams from around the world to watch one of those asteroids, 17-mile-wide Polymele, appear to pass in front of a star in what scientists call an occultation. By comparing observations from many different locations on Earth, scientists can precisely measure the shadow an asteroid casts on a star during such an event, allowing them to precisely study the size and shape of the space rock. But during the March observations, which were briefly reported at the time, two of the participating teams saw something different. \"We were thrilled that 14 teams reported observing the star blink out as it passed behind the asteroid, but as we analyzed the data, we saw that two of the observations were not like the others,\" Marc Buie, a Lucy scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said in a statement. A diagram of occultation observations show Polymele in the upper left and its newly discovered satellite on the right. Astronomers reviewing the data concluded that those observations indicated a previously undiscovered space rock orbiting Polymele about 125 miles away. \"It had to be a satellite,\" Buie said. The scientists could even determine the newly found asteroid's size: about 3 miles across. The still-unnamed asteroid has since been added to Lucy's ambitious itinerary of space rock flybys. The new detection is the second time that scientists have spotted an extra satellite; in 2020, researchers announced they had spotted a satellite orbiting Eurybates, which Lucy will fly past just a month before Polymele. Like most of Lucy's destinations, Polymele, is a Trojan: an asteroid that drifts around the sun in about the same orbit as Jupiter due to the large gas giant's immense gravitational pull. Scientists believe that these \"fossil\" rocks are the rubble left over from planet formation and could therefore teach us about the early days of our solar system. About the newly discovered asteroid's name: while some of the discovery team have reportedly nicknamed it \"Shaun\" after the animated sheep, it won't have an official name until astronomers can confirm the characteristics of its orbit. That likely won't happen any time soon because Polymele's satellite isn't discernible by current Earth-based telescopes. So, unless astronomers get lucky with a future occultation, they may have to wait until Lucy itself swings past the asteroid, scheduled to occur in 2027. \"Lucy's tagline started out: 12 years, seven asteroids, one spacecraft,\" NASA's Lucy program scientist, Tom Statler, said in the statement. \"We keep having to change the tagline for this mission, but that's a good problem to have.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/trojan-asteroids-lucy-mission-9th-target"}, {"title": "Unknown 'Mini Moon' in Outer Solar System Is One of The Smallest Ever Found", "date": "2022-08-25", "content": "Astronomers may have detected a previously undiscovered 'mini moon' in the Solar System: a rocky object orbiting a small asteroid near Jupiter. If the rocky satellite, which is just a little wider than the width of Manhattan, is confirmed to be a proper moon, it would be one of the smallest moons ever spotted. The tiny satellite was discovered by scientists working on NASA's Lucy mission, which is sending a space probe to study some of the Trojan asteroids, two massive groups of space rocks that are located on each side of Jupiter on its orbit around the Sun. The Lucy probe was launched on 16 October 2021, and will arrive at the Trojan asteroids in late 2027, after making a quick stop in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Until then, Lucy mission scientists are trying to learn more about some of these mysterious rocks to help identify where the probe can be most useful. On March 27, the smallest of Lucy's Trojan targets, known as Polymele, passed in front of a distant star, allowing mission scientists to accurately measure the space rock's size by observing how much of the star's light the asteroid blocked out as it whizzed past. However, the team also observed an unexpected subsequent, smaller blip as a second asteroid followed in Polymele's wake. After reviewing the data, the team concluded that the second blip \"had to be a satellite,\" lead researcher Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a NASA statement. The newly discovered satellite has a diameter of about 3 miles and is separated from the 17-mile-wide Polymele by a distance of around 125 miles. At the time of the observation, Polymele was around 480 million miles from Earth. \"Those distances are roughly equivalent to finding a quarter on a sidewalk in Los Angeles while trying to spot it from a skyscraper in Manhattan,\" NASA representatives wrote in the statement. The term \" moon \" can refer to any naturally occurring solid body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet or asteroid. More than 200 moons have been recognized in the Solar System, but the actual number is likely much higher, according to NASA. The researchers could make only fleeting observations of Polymele's satellite, so its orbital path is highly uncertain. As a result, the space rock cannot yet be officially designated as a moon or be properly named. But the researchers are confident that when the Lucy probe arrives at Polymele, the spacecraft will be able to collect sufficient data to designate it as a true moon. This is not the first time that Lucy mission scientists have spotted a satellite trailing a Trojan asteroid.

As of now, Lucy is significantly far from Earth, about 70% of the distance between the Earth and the Moon, but scientists are confident that the spacecraft's high-resolution camera will provide sharp images. The photos sent by the spacecraft will be much-awaited since it would view the eclipse from an angle rarely seen. NASA says that from Lucy's position, the gibbous Earth and Moon will be easily visible. When the moon will enter and exit the Earth's shadow, which is the reason for a lunar eclipse, the moon will appear to blink and the phenomenon will be captured by an instrument named L'LORRI fitted aboard the probe. The agency even shared a simulated picture of the Earth and the moon from the perspective of the Lucy spacecraft. An image has also been shared above showing Lucy's orbit which overlaps that of the Earth. \"Viewing this eclipse will allow the Lucy team to do a \"test run\" of the observation procedures, making sure that all the imagers and equipment are working as expected. It is also a fun opportunity as it is extremely rare to get real images of astronomical events like this from such a unique vantage point\", NASA said in a statement.

The observations ended before the moon left the planet's shadow. The moon's brightness in the images had to be artificially enhanced by a factor of six, NASA said in a statement, to make the natural satellite visible.

At this distance, Earth and its companion appeared only 0.2 degrees apart to Lucy, having the same separation as a car's taillights as viewed from a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, NASA said in the statement. The spacecraft used its high-resolution panchromatic camera, L'LORRI to take the time lapse video.

Engineers have been studying for months one of two circular solar arrays that did not fully deploy and latch into place after the spacecraft's launch in October 2021. They concluded that a lanyard used to pull open the solar array lost tension during the deployment process, causing the lanyard to wrap around the motor shaft. On May 9, controllers issued commands to run both the primary and backup motors for the solar array deployment process simultaneously, hoping that a harder pull would be sufficient to restore tension in the lanyard and continue deployment of the array. The spacecraft similarly ran both motors three times since then. \"That's allowing us to make significant process towards latch, but we're not latched yet,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a presentation at a meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group June 8. \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array.\" That tensioning, he said, is a positive sign even though the array has not latched into place. \"It makes it likely that, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as-is,\" he said, noting the array, in its current configuration, is generating more than 90% of its planned power.

Soon after the spacecraft's launch, which was conducted on October 16 last year, the engineers noticed that one of Lucy's two solar panels is unfurled between 75% to 95% but assured that this would not hinder the probe's journey. Now, in June 2022, the mission team is still struggling with the jammed solar panel. Lucy was launched by NASA last year to study eight Trojan asteroids of Jupiter. Lucy would fly past one of the main belt asteroids and seven Trojan asteroids during the following 12 years, marking it the first single spaceship expedition of NASA to visit so many distinct asteroids. In the latest mission update, NASA revealed that the engineers attempted to fully spread the panels by using both the primary and backup motor windings to pull them outward.

However, one of the arrays failed to fully deploy after launch, posing a problem for the team. An update in January stated that the second array is a little less than 350 degrees deployed, due to an issue with a lanyard suspected to have prevented full deployment, but work to fix the issue has continued. After a series of tests and measures, the team again commanded the spacecraft to deploy the solar array on May 26, using both primary and backup motors to try to tighten the lanyard and complete deployment. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA Lucy mission representatives wrote in a June 8 update. \"The team has several more opportunities to repeat these deployment commands.

One of Lucy's two UltraFlex circular solar arrays opened to about 96% of its fully deployed state after arriving in space last October following a launch from Cape Canaveral. The other solar array fully unfurled as the spacecraft began a robotic science mission to fly through swarms of unexplored asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. In recent weeks, ground teams at a Lockheed Martin control center in Colorado have uplinked commands for Lucy run primary and backup motors to drive the stuck solar array closer to full deployment. NASA believes a lanyard used to pull the solar array open somehow lost tension and fell off a spool during the initial deployment last October, preventing the array from completely opening. Additional attempts to pull the solar array open have further reeled in the lanyard. The first try May 9 involved running the deployment motors in a series of short intervals to avoid overheating. Ground controllers sent more commands May 12, further advancing the solar array deployment and adding tension to the structure, helping stabilize the array. Engineers made more progress during two additional deployment attempts May 26 and June 2. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA said. Most recently, the Lucy ground team sent another command to run the deployment motors June 9, which continued to \"further stabilize the array,\" NASA said. \"There are future opportunities to repeat the deployment commands if necessary.\" Officials are increasingly optimistic that the Lucy mission can proceed without any issues, even if the solar array does not latch into place. Before the recent tries to fully deploy the array, the spacecraft's power system was generating more than 90% of the expected level of 18,000 watts. \"While there is no guarantee that additional attempts will latch the array, there is strong evidence that the process is putting the array under more tension, further stabilizing it,\" NASA said in a statement. \"Even if the array does not ultimately latch, the additional stiffening may be enough to fly the mission as planned.\" \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute. \"These things are made out of cloth, and where you get a lot of the strength is by putting it under tension. And we're clearly at a point where we're tensioning the array, which makes it likely, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as is.\" One concern engineers have studied is the effect of engine burns on the partially deployed array. The Lucy spacecraft completed its first trajectory correction maneuver June 7 to help guide it toward a flyby with Earth in October, the first of multiple gravity assists to slingshot the probe toward Jupiter's orbit in the distant solar system. Lucy has also extended the platform holding its scientific instruments, and the sensors are all working as designed, Levison said. Lucy will become the farthest spacecraft from the sun to ever rely on solar power, reaching a maximum distance of 530 million miles, nearly six times farther than Earth's orbit. When it reaches the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's solar arrays were expected to generate just 500 watts of power. That level of power output is sufficient to feed Lucy's three science instruments, which only need about 82 watts of power during each asteroid encounter. Lucy's flight computer, communications system, and other components will also draw on power generated by the UltraFlex arrays. The $981 million Lucy Mission is the first to explore the Trojan asteroids, which scientists say are leftover building blocks similar to objects that came together to form the solar system's giant outer planets. The probe will fly by eight Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, plus one object in the main asteroid belt in 2025. That's one more asteroid than scientists expected Lucy to visit when it launched last year. One of the Trojan asteroids on Lucy's tour, named Polymele, has a companion. Scientists discovered an apparent satellite of Polymele during a ground-based occultation observation in March, when Polymele briefly passed in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light from reaching Earth. The occultation observations were intended to help the Lucy science team determine the shape of Polymele, which only appears as a point of light in telescope images. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Levison said last week in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" Lucy's science team has temporarily named the object Shaun, after \"Shaun the Sheep\" in the show \"Wallace and Gromit.\" More data on the object's exact position and orbit are required to assign a permanent name to Polymele's companion, and that probably won't happen until after Lucy's flyby in 2027. Polymele itself has an \"oblate spheroid,\" or gourd-like, shape and measures about 17 miles long and 8 miles wide. The shape of Polymele suggests it is likely a leftover remnant from the young solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago, and may have avoided any collisions with other objects throughout its history. \"It's hard to imagine you can get that shape ... out of an object that's collisionally evolved, so my thinking right now is Polymele is probably a primordial object, which is going to make seeing it really fascinating.\" Polymele's companion is not the first asteroid to be added to Lucy's flight plan since the mission was approved by NASA in 2017. Astronomers announced in 2020 that observations with the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed a small object, less than 1 kilometer in diameter, orbiting asteroid Eurybates, another Lucy target in the Trojan belt.

In 2027, Lucy will become the first human-made object to fly past one of these asteroids. The mission was designed to zoom past a main-belt asteroid then swing through a complicated itinerary of Trojan asteroids. And now, scientists have determined that one of Lucy's original target asteroids has a companion: another, tiny asteroid that orbits it and that Lucy will also be able to observe, Spaceflight Now reports. Lucy's third target is an asteroid called Polymele, a gourd-shaped space rock that's roughly 13 miles from end to end. Polymele's shape is strange for an asteroid, suggesting that it's a remnant from the very early solar system - one that has managed to avoid collisions so far. In March, astronomers observing Polymele in preparation for Lucy's eventual visit watched the asteroid pass in front of a star, blocking that star's distant light. In the process, they found something very curious: a tiny companion space rock. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and Lucy's principal investigator, said in a presentation last week, according to Spaceflight Now. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" That companion does not have a name and won't have one until scientists know more about the asteroid's exact orbit, which might not happen until Lucy's visit. But some astronomers have jokingly begun calling it Shaun after the character in the animation \"Shaun the Sheep.\" Shaun is the second space rock to be added to the Lucy mission's itinerary: In 2020, scientists working on the mission determined that target asteroid Eurybates also boasts a small companion.

Now, NASA has announced that a team was able to troubleshoot the problem sufficiently for the mission to continue - thanks to several clever tricks. Hours after the problem was first discovered, NASA pulled together an anomaly response team with members from the science mission lead Southwest Research Institute, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the spacecraft's builder, Northrop Grumman. Since there's no camera aimed at the solar arrays, the team had to figure out another way to find the problem. To that end, they fired the spacecraft's thrusters to measure any anomalous vibrations, and created a detailed model of the array's motor assembly to determine the array's rigidness. They finally figured out that a lanyard designed to pull the array open was probably snagged on its spool.

The other was to attempt to pull the lanyard harder by using the back- up deployment motor as well as the primary motor, hopefully allowing it to wind further and engage the latching mechanism. Both motors were never designed to work at the same time, so the team modeled it to test out possible outcomes and potential ripple effects. After months of simulations, they decided to proceed with the two-motor option. They ran both the primary and backup solar deployment motors simultaneously seven times, and succeeded in further opening and tensioning the array. Unfortunately, it didn't close enough to latch, but it's now \"under substantially more tension, making it stable enough for the spacecraft to operate as needed for mission operations,\" NASA said.

There would be no time for a nap. \"It was a very hard day.\" The team jumped into action to figure out what went wrong and to devise a solution. After months of sleuthing through the data, testing ideas on computer models and spare parts on the ground, and considering alternative trajectories for the scientific mission, the Lucy engineering team came up with a plan, which they set into action earlier this summer. Now, the spacecraft's troublesome solar array is almost completely unfurled-enough so that the mission can continue as planned. \"The state of the spacecraft is much, much healthier,\" Levison says, calling the feat pulled off by the team's engineers \"totally amazing and brilliant.\" When the mission engineers first discovered the problem, they didn't immediately know what had gone wrong. All the data showed them was that one of the solar arrays hadn't completely unfurled and latched into place. The engineers couldn't get a visual because Lucy's cameras point outward. Everything came through data about the spacecraft's performance. Lucy's solar arrays are like large folding fans. When the spacecraft launched, the arrays were folded up. To deploy them, a motor pulled on a lanyard attached to each array. Then, if it had reached full deployment, a latch would have held the edge of the array in place, keeping it from moving. \"What we think happened is somewhere along in the deployment, that lanyard got misaligned and came out of the spool that brings the lanyard toward the latching mechanism,\" explains Mark Effertz, spacecraft lead engineer for Lucy at Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft. The team had no direct data about the lanyard being tangled, he adds, but they extrapolated that it \"started to snarl on either side of the spool and create a kind of bundle of lanyard as the motor kept pulling.\" With the power supply in jeopardy, the engineers determined that they had two main choices, Effertz says: They could fly Lucy as-is, and change the course of the mission. Or, they could keep tugging on the lanyard. If the team decided to keep the solar array partly furled, Levison says, the science team would have likely had to select a new, less power-hungry trajectory for the spacecraft. And that would mean not going to the group of eight, hand-selected Trojan asteroids. Instead, he says, the spacecraft would travel a shorter distance to three small Trojans. Levison doesn't mince words about that alternative plan, saying those asteroids are \"much less interesting, scientifically.\" That's because the original trajectory took Lucy by a richly diverse group of asteroids. They range in size and in color from gray to red, and are close together, making it possible for the spacecraft to study many in one trip. It's their diversity that piqued Levison and others' interests, because it likely means that these asteroids formed in far-flung areas of the solar system. Some probably hail from the outer solar system. Levison likes to call the Trojan asteroids \"fossils,\" and even named the mission \"Lucy\" after the famous hominin fossil that has contributed significant insights to our current understanding of early human ancestors. This mission, he explains, aims to answer questions about our origins in other ways. \"Planets don't form, if you'll excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" Levison says. \"Planetary systems form as part of an ecosystem where the growing planets are competing for food, they're knocking each other around gravitationally, they move around.\" The Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early parts of that evolutionary process and therefore windows into our planetary origins. So the team decided the original trajectory for the Lucy space mission was worth rescuing and devised a plan to yank the lanyard a bit harder in an attempt to fully deploy the snagged solar array. The spacecraft had a backup motor built into its system in case the primary motor to pull the lanyard failed. \"We never really designed both motors to run at the same time. But we found that there was a way to\" tell the spacecraft to do it anyway, Effertz says. Using both motors at the same time gives it more torque, or pulling power, he explains. Although this maneuver doesn't detangle the snarled lanyard, it can wind up more of the lanyard onto the spool over the tangle, pulling the array open and holding tension on the line. The team estimates that Lucy's troubled solar array is now nearly fully open, though it isn't secured in place with the latch. That configuration seems to be generating enough power to get Lucy to its original target Trojans. The engineers are still considering pulling further on the lanyard in the hopes of getting it to latch. But there are risks associated, Effertz says. The tangle would get bigger and bigger, which could rub against the spacecraft and that might cause new problems. They have time to decide, however, as Lucy is currently flying through a region where the team can't use the craft's antenna to download the necessary data, Effertz says. So any further tweaks will have to wait until around November.

In preparation for the Lucy mission to explore a distant class of asteroids called the Trojans, astronomers have been monitoring the targeted space rocks. One day in March, mission personnel gathered 26 different teams from around the world to watch one of those asteroids, 17-mile-wide Polymele, appear to pass in front of a star in what scientists call an occultation. By comparing observations from many different locations on Earth, scientists can precisely measure the shadow an asteroid casts on a star during such an event, allowing them to precisely study the size and shape of the space rock. But during the March observations, which were briefly reported at the time, two of the participating teams saw something different. \"We were thrilled that 14 teams reported observing the star blink out as it passed behind the asteroid, but as we analyzed the data, we saw that two of the observations were not like the others,\" Marc Buie, a Lucy scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said in a statement. A diagram of occultation observations show Polymele in the upper left and its newly discovered satellite on the right. Astronomers reviewing the data concluded that those observations indicated a previously undiscovered space rock orbiting Polymele about 125 miles away. \"It had to be a satellite,\" Buie said. The scientists could even determine the newly found asteroid's size: about 3 miles across. The still-unnamed asteroid has since been added to Lucy's ambitious itinerary of space rock flybys. The new detection is the second time that scientists have spotted an extra satellite; in 2020, researchers announced they had spotted a satellite orbiting Eurybates, which Lucy will fly past just a month before Polymele. Like most of Lucy's destinations, Polymele, is a Trojan: an asteroid that drifts around the sun in about the same orbit as Jupiter due to the large gas giant's immense gravitational pull. Scientists believe that these \"fossil\" rocks are the rubble left over from planet formation and could therefore teach us about the early days of our solar system. About the newly discovered asteroid's name: while some of the discovery team have reportedly nicknamed it \"Shaun\" after the animated sheep, it won't have an official name until astronomers can confirm the characteristics of its orbit. That likely won't happen any time soon because Polymele's satellite isn't discernible by current Earth-based telescopes. So, unless astronomers get lucky with a future occultation, they may have to wait until Lucy itself swings past the asteroid, scheduled to occur in 2027. \"Lucy's tagline started out: 12 years, seven asteroids, one spacecraft,\" NASA's Lucy program scientist, Tom Statler, said in the statement. \"We keep having to change the tagline for this mission, but that's a good problem to have.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/trojan-asteroids-lucy-mission-9th-target"}, {"title": "Unknown 'Mini Moon' in Outer Solar System Is One of The Smallest Ever Found", "date": "2022-08-25", "content": "Astronomers may have detected a previously undiscovered 'mini moon' in the Solar System: a rocky object orbiting a small asteroid near Jupiter. If the rocky satellite, which is just a little wider than the width of Manhattan, is confirmed to be a proper moon, it would be one of the smallest moons ever spotted. The tiny satellite was discovered by scientists working on NASA's Lucy mission, which is sending a space probe to study some of the Trojan asteroids, two massive groups of space rocks that are located on each side of Jupiter on its orbit around the Sun. The Lucy probe was launched on 16 October 2021, and will arrive at the Trojan asteroids in late 2027, after making a quick stop in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Until then, Lucy mission scientists are trying to learn more about some of these mysterious rocks to help identify where the probe can be most useful. On March 27, the smallest of Lucy's Trojan targets, known as Polymele, passed in front of a distant star, allowing mission scientists to accurately measure the space rock's size by observing how much of the star's light the asteroid blocked out as it whizzed past. However, the team also observed an unexpected subsequent, smaller blip as a second asteroid followed in Polymele's wake. After reviewing the data, the team concluded that the second blip \"had to be a satellite,\" lead researcher Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a NASA statement. The newly discovered satellite has a diameter of about 3 miles and is separated from the 17-mile-wide Polymele by a distance of around 125 miles. At the time of the observation, Polymele was around 480 million miles from Earth. \"Those distances are roughly equivalent to finding a quarter on a sidewalk in Los Angeles while trying to spot it from a skyscraper in Manhattan,\" NASA representatives wrote in the statement. The term \" moon \" can refer to any naturally occurring solid body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet or asteroid. More than 200 moons have been recognized in the Solar System, but the actual number is likely much higher, according to NASA. The researchers could make only fleeting observations of Polymele's satellite, so its orbital path is highly uncertain. As a result, the space rock cannot yet be officially designated as a moon or be properly named. But the researchers are confident that when the Lucy probe arrives at Polymele, the spacecraft will be able to collect sufficient data to designate it as a true moon. This is not the first time that Lucy mission scientists have spotted a satellite trailing a Trojan asteroid. In 2021, the team detected a 0.6-mile-wide satellite orbiting Eurybates, which will be Lucy's first Trojan target, after analyzing data collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. On this occasion, the researchers determined the moon's orbital path and officially named it Queta.

Engineers have been studying for months one of two circular solar arrays that did not fully deploy and latch into place after the spacecraft's launch in October 2021. They concluded that a lanyard used to pull open the solar array lost tension during the deployment process, causing the lanyard to wrap around the motor shaft. On May 9, controllers issued commands to run both the primary and backup motors for the solar array deployment process simultaneously, hoping that a harder pull would be sufficient to restore tension in the lanyard and continue deployment of the array. The spacecraft similarly ran both motors three times since then. \"That's allowing us to make significant process towards latch, but we're not latched yet,\" Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a presentation at a meeting of NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group June 8. \"We are seeing significant tensioning of the array.\" That tensioning, he said, is a positive sign even though the array has not latched into place. \"It makes it likely that, even if we don't get the thing latched, we'll be able to fly the mission as-is,\" he said, noting the array, in its current configuration, is generating more than 90% of its planned power.

Now, in June 2022, the mission team is still struggling with the jammed solar panel. Lucy was launched by NASA last year to study eight Trojan asteroids of Jupiter.

One of Lucy's two UltraFlex circular solar arrays opened to about 96% of its fully deployed state after arriving in space last October following a launch from Cape Canaveral. The other solar array fully unfurled as the spacecraft began a robotic science mission to fly through swarms of unexplored asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. In recent weeks, ground teams at a Lockheed Martin control center in Colorado have uplinked commands for Lucy run primary and backup motors to drive the stuck solar array closer to full deployment. NASA believes a lanyard used to pull the solar array open somehow lost tension and fell off a spool during the initial deployment last October, preventing the array from completely opening. Additional attempts to pull the solar array open have further reeled in the lanyard. The first try May 9 involved running the deployment motors in a series of short intervals to avoid overheating. Ground controllers sent more commands May 12, further advancing the solar array deployment and adding tension to the structure, helping stabilize the array. Engineers made more progress during two additional deployment attempts May 26 and June 2. \"While the array still did not latch, the data indicates that it continued to further deploy and stiffen throughout the attempt,\" NASA said.

The Lucy spacecraft completed its first trajectory correction maneuver June 7 to help guide it toward a flyby with Earth in October, the first of multiple gravity assists to slingshot the probe toward Jupiter's orbit in the distant solar system. Lucy has also extended the platform holding its scientific instruments, and the sensors are all working as designed, Levison said. Lucy will become the farthest spacecraft from the sun to ever rely on solar power, reaching a maximum distance of 530 million miles, nearly six times farther than Earth's orbit. When it reaches the Trojan asteroids, Lucy's solar arrays were expected to generate just 500 watts of power. That level of power output is sufficient to feed Lucy's three science instruments, which only need about 82 watts of power during each asteroid encounter. Lucy's flight computer, communications system, and other components will also draw on power generated by the UltraFlex arrays. The $981 million Lucy Mission is the first to explore the Trojan asteroids, which scientists say are leftover building blocks similar to objects that came together to form the solar system's giant outer planets. The probe will fly by eight Trojan asteroids between 2027 and 2033, plus one object in the main asteroid belt in 2025. That's one more asteroid than scientists expected Lucy to visit when it launched last year. One of the Trojan asteroids on Lucy's tour, named Polymele, has a companion. Scientists discovered an apparent satellite of Polymele during a ground-based occultation observation in March, when Polymele briefly passed in front of a star, temporarily blocking its light from reaching Earth. The occultation observations were intended to help the Lucy science team determine the shape of Polymele, which only appears as a point of light in telescope images. \"We got a really nice projected shape of Polymele, and then we were very surprised to detect an object about 200 kilometers away from Polymele,\" Levison said last week in a presentation to NASA's Small Bodies Advisory Group. \"It's 5 kilometers in diameter, and it's sitting almost exactly in Polymele's equatorial plane.\" Lucy's science team has temporarily named the object Shaun, after \"Shaun the Sheep\" in the show \"Wallace and Gromit.\" More data on the object's exact position and orbit are required to assign a permanent name to Polymele's companion, and that probably won't happen until after Lucy's flyby in 2027. Polymele itself has an \"oblate spheroid,\" or gourd-like, shape and measures about 17 miles long and 8 miles wide. The shape of Polymele suggests it is likely a leftover remnant from the young solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago, and may have avoided any collisions with other objects throughout its history. \"It's hard to imagine you can get that shape ... out of an object that's collisionally evolved, so my thinking right now is Polymele is probably a primordial object, which is going to make seeing it really fascinating.\" Polymele's companion is not the first asteroid to be added to Lucy's flight plan since the mission was approved by NASA in 2017.

Polymele's shape is strange for an asteroid, suggesting that it's a remnant from the very early solar system - one that has managed to avoid collisions so far. In March, astronomers observing Polymele in preparation for Lucy's eventual visit watched the asteroid pass in front of a star, blocking that star's distant light.

The arrays are crucial in providing power to the mission, but one of the arrays faced an issue in deployment. An update in January stated that at the time, the second array was a little less than 350 degrees deployed, due to an issue with a lanyard. On Thursday, however, NASA officials stated the Lucy team managed to get the array to between 353 degrees and 357 degrees open. \"The array is under substantially more tension, giving it significantly more stabilization,\" agency officials added in a blog post. \"The mission team is increasingly confident the solar array will successfully meet the mission's needs in its current tensioned and stabilized state.\" However, NASA must now pause its efforts to assist Lucy because the spacecraft is moving into a location where it cannot easily receive commands from its humans back on Earth. \"Due to thermal constraints caused by the relative positions of the Earth, spacecraft and sun, the spacecraft will be unable to communicate with the Earth via its high-gain antenna for several months,\" NASA officials wrote. While engineers can stay in contact with Lucy through a low-gain antenna, that transmitter can process less data. Full communications should resume in October, according to NASA. On Oct. 16, Lucy will fly by Earth to pick up speed for its journey to nine Trojan asteroids orbiting the sun at the same distance as Jupiter; the spacecraft will also emerge from the partial blackout at that time. NASA may attempt to get that tricky solar array further deployed while the spacecraft remains nearby \"if deemed necessary,\" officials wrote in the post. Lucy successfully completed a trajectory correction maneuver on June 21, NASA noted. Although the spacecraft receives plenty of power while it is near Earth, the arrays will need to be close to full deployment to generate enough electricity at the orbit of Jupiter, where sunlight is much fainter. The enormous gas giant planet has an average orbital distance of 484 million miles from the sun, roughly five times more distant than Earth is. Lucy will be the first spacecraft to visit the Trojan asteroids of Jupiter, which orbit the sun ahead of and behind the planet. These little worlds may hold remnants of the early solar system and in turn, provide information about how our neighborhood was formed.", "url": "https://www.space.com/lucy-asteroid-mission-progress-solar-array"}, {"title": "Significant Progress in NASA's Lucy Spacecraft Solar Array Deployment Fix", "date": "2022-07-04", "content": "Beginning on May 6 and continuing through June 16, NASA's Lucy mission team carried out a multi-stage effort intended to further deploy the spacecraft's unlatched solar array.

Hours after the problem was first discovered, NASA pulled together an anomaly response team with members from the science mission lead Southwest Research Institute, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the spacecraft's builder, Northrop Grumman. Since there's no camera aimed at the solar arrays, the team had to figure out another way to find the problem. To that end, they fired the spacecraft's thrusters to measure any anomalous vibrations, and created a detailed model of the array's motor assembly to determine the array's rigidness.

After months of simulations, they decided to proceed with the two-motor option. They ran both the primary and backup solar deployment motors simultaneously seven times, and succeeded in further opening and tensioning the array. Unfortunately, it didn't close enough to latch, but it's now \"under substantially more tension, making it stable enough for the spacecraft to operate as needed for mission operations,\" NASA said.

NASA's Lucy spacecraft rocketed off our planet at 5:34 a.m. on October 16, 2021, so Levison and his team had been up all night preparing. It was a spectacular, \"picture perfect\" launch, recalls Levison, who is the Lucy mission principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The spacecraft would soon be on its way to the Trojan asteroids, unexplored fossils of the solar system that sit roughly the same distance from the sun as Jupiter. Those small space rocks, which are thought to have formed from the same processes that created the planets, could shed light on how our world came to be. But then, just a few hours after launch, the team received data from Lucy that revealed that one of her two solar arrays-which power the spacecraft's systems- hadn't fully opened. Without both solar arrays deployed, the team wasn't sure Lucy would make it to her intended destination. \"The basic mission was in jeopardy,\" Levison says. There would be no time for a nap. \"It was a very hard day.\" The team jumped into action to figure out what went wrong and to devise a solution. After months of sleuthing through the data, testing ideas on computer models and spare parts on the ground, and considering alternative trajectories for the scientific mission, the Lucy engineering team came up with a plan, which they set into action earlier this summer. Now, the spacecraft's troublesome solar array is almost completely unfurled-enough so that the mission can continue as planned. \"The state of the spacecraft is much, much healthier,\" Levison says, calling the feat pulled off by the team's engineers \"totally amazing and brilliant.\" When the mission engineers first discovered the problem, they didn't immediately know what had gone wrong. All the data showed them was that one of the solar arrays hadn't completely unfurled and latched into place. The engineers couldn't get a visual because Lucy's cameras point outward. Everything came through data about the spacecraft's performance. Lucy's solar arrays are like large folding fans. When the spacecraft launched, the arrays were folded up. To deploy them, a motor pulled on a lanyard attached to each array. Then, if it had reached full deployment, a latch would have held the edge of the array in place, keeping it from moving. \"What we think happened is somewhere along in the deployment, that lanyard got misaligned and came out of the spool that brings the lanyard toward the latching mechanism,\" explains Mark Effertz, spacecraft lead engineer for Lucy at Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft. The team had no direct data about the lanyard being tangled, he adds, but they extrapolated that it \"started to snarl on either side of the spool and create a kind of bundle of lanyard as the motor kept pulling.\" With the power supply in jeopardy, the engineers determined that they had two main choices, Effertz says: They could fly Lucy as-is, and change the course of the mission. Or, they could keep tugging on the lanyard. If the team decided to keep the solar array partly furled, Levison says, the science team would have likely had to select a new, less power-hungry trajectory for the spacecraft. And that would mean not going to the group of eight, hand-selected Trojan asteroids. Instead, he says, the spacecraft would travel a shorter distance to three small Trojans. Levison doesn't mince words about that alternative plan, saying those asteroids are \"much less interesting, scientifically.\" That's because the original trajectory took Lucy by a richly diverse group of asteroids. They range in size and in color from gray to red, and are close together, making it possible for the spacecraft to study many in one trip. It's their diversity that piqued Levison and others' interests, because it likely means that these asteroids formed in far-flung areas of the solar system. Some probably hail from the outer solar system. Levison likes to call the Trojan asteroids \"fossils,\" and even named the mission \"Lucy\" after the famous hominin fossil that has contributed significant insights to our current understanding of early human ancestors. This mission, he explains, aims to answer questions about our origins in other ways. \"Planets don't form, if you'll excuse the pun, in a vacuum,\" Levison says. \"Planetary systems form as part of an ecosystem where the growing planets are competing for food, they're knocking each other around gravitationally, they move around.\" The Trojan asteroids are remnants of the early parts of that evolutionary process and therefore windows into our planetary origins. So the team decided the original trajectory for the Lucy space mission was worth rescuing and devised a plan to yank the lanyard a bit harder in an attempt to fully deploy the snagged solar array. The spacecraft had a backup motor built into its system in case the primary motor to pull the lanyard failed. \"We never really designed both motors to run at the same time. But we found that there was a way to\" tell the spacecraft to do it anyway, Effertz says. Using both motors at the same time gives it more torque, or pulling power, he explains. Although this maneuver doesn't detangle the snarled lanyard, it can wind up more of the lanyard onto the spool over the tangle, pulling the array open and holding tension on the line. The team estimates that Lucy's troubled solar array is now nearly fully open, though it isn't secured in place with the latch. That configuration seems to be generating enough power to get Lucy to its original target Trojans. The engineers are still considering pulling further on the lanyard in the hopes of getting it to latch. But there are risks associated, Effertz says. The tangle would get bigger and bigger, which could rub against the spacecraft and that might cause new problems. They have time to decide, however, as Lucy is currently flying through a region where the team can't use the craft's antenna to download the necessary data, Effertz says. So any further tweaks will have to wait until around November.

In preparation for the Lucy mission to explore a distant class of asteroids called the Trojans, astronomers have been monitoring the targeted space rocks. One day in March, mission personnel gathered 26 different teams from around the world to watch one of those asteroids, 17-mile-wide Polymele, appear to pass in front of a star in what scientists call an occultation. By comparing observations from many different locations on Earth, scientists can precisely measure the shadow an asteroid casts on a star during such an event, allowing them to precisely study the size and shape of the space rock. But during the March observations, which were briefly reported at the time, two of the participating teams saw something different. \"We were thrilled that 14 teams reported observing the star blink out as it passed behind the asteroid, but as we analyzed the data, we saw that two of the observations were not like the others,\" Marc Buie, a Lucy scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said in a statement. A diagram of occultation observations show Polymele in the upper left and its newly discovered satellite on the right. Astronomers reviewing the data concluded that those observations indicated a previously undiscovered space rock orbiting Polymele about 125 miles away. \"It had to be a satellite,\" Buie said. The scientists could even determine the newly found asteroid's size: about 3 miles across. The still-unnamed asteroid has since been added to Lucy's ambitious itinerary of space rock flybys. The new detection is the second time that scientists have spotted an extra satellite; in 2020, researchers announced they had spotted a satellite orbiting Eurybates, which Lucy will fly past just a month before Polymele. Like most of Lucy's destinations, Polymele, is a Trojan: an asteroid that drifts around the sun in about the same orbit as Jupiter due to the large gas giant's immense gravitational pull. Scientists believe that these \"fossil\" rocks are the rubble left over from planet formation and could therefore teach us about the early days of our solar system. About the newly discovered asteroid's name: while some of the discovery team have reportedly nicknamed it \"Shaun\" after the animated sheep, it won't have an official name until astronomers can confirm the characteristics of its orbit. That likely won't happen any time soon because Polymele's satellite isn't discernible by current Earth-based telescopes. So, unless astronomers get lucky with a future occultation, they may have to wait until Lucy itself swings past the asteroid, scheduled to occur in 2027. \"Lucy's tagline started out: 12 years, seven asteroids, one spacecraft,\" NASA's Lucy program scientist, Tom Statler, said in the statement. \"We keep having to change the tagline for this mission, but that's a good problem to have.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/trojan-asteroids-lucy-mission-9th-target"}, {"title": "Unknown 'Mini Moon' in Outer Solar System Is One of The Smallest Ever Found", "date": "2022-08-25", "content": "Astronomers may have detected a previously undiscovered 'mini moon' in the Solar System: a rocky object orbiting a small asteroid near Jupiter. If the rocky satellite, which is just a little wider than the width of Manhattan, is confirmed to be a proper moon, it would be one of the smallest moons ever spotted. The tiny satellite was discovered by scientists working on NASA's Lucy mission, which is sending a space probe to study some of the Trojan asteroids, two massive groups of space rocks that are located on each side of Jupiter on its orbit around the Sun. The Lucy probe was launched on 16 October 2021, and will arrive at the Trojan asteroids in late 2027, after making a quick stop in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Until then, Lucy mission scientists are trying to learn more about some of these mysterious rocks to help identify where the probe can be most useful. On March 27, the smallest of Lucy's Trojan targets, known as Polymele, passed in front of a distant star, allowing mission scientists to accurately measure the space rock's size by observing how much of the star's light the asteroid blocked out as it whizzed past. However, the team also observed an unexpected subsequent, smaller blip as a second asteroid followed in Polymele's wake. After reviewing the data, the team concluded that the second blip \"had to be a satellite,\" lead researcher Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a NASA statement. The newly discovered satellite has a diameter of about 3 miles and is separated from the 17-mile-wide Polymele by a distance of around 125 miles. At the time of the observation, Polymele was around 480 million miles from Earth. \"Those distances are roughly equivalent to finding a quarter on a sidewalk in Los Angeles while trying to spot it from a skyscraper in Manhattan,\" NASA representatives wrote in the statement. The term \" moon \" can refer to any naturally occurring solid body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet or asteroid. More than 200 moons have been recognized in the Solar System, but the actual number is likely much higher, according to NASA. The researchers could make only fleeting observations of Polymele's satellite, so its orbital path is highly uncertain. As a result, the space rock cannot yet be officially designated as a moon or be properly named. But the researchers are confident that when the Lucy probe arrives at Polymele, the spacecraft will be able to collect sufficient data to designate it as a true moon. This is not the first time that Lucy mission scientists have spotted a satellite trailing a Trojan asteroid. In 2021, the team detected a 0.6-mile-wide satellite orbiting Eurybates, which will be Lucy's first Trojan target, after analyzing data collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. On this occasion, the researchers determined the moon's orbital path and officially named it Queta.

So, unless astronomers get lucky with a future occultation, they may have to wait until Lucy itself swings past the asteroid, scheduled to occur in 2027. \"Lucy's tagline started out: 12 years, seven asteroids, one spacecraft,\" NASA's Lucy program scientist, Tom Statler, said in the statement. \"We keep having to change the tagline for this mission, but that's a good problem to have.\" ", "url": "https://www.space.com/trojan-asteroids-lucy-mission-9th-target"}, {"title": "Unknown 'Mini Moon' in Outer Solar System Is One of The Smallest Ever Found", "date": "2022-08-25", "content": "Astronomers may have detected a previously undiscovered 'mini moon' in the Solar System: a rocky object orbiting a small asteroid near Jupiter. If the rocky satellite, which is just a little wider than the width of Manhattan, is confirmed to be a proper moon, it would be one of the smallest moons ever spotted. The tiny satellite was discovered by scientists working on NASA's Lucy mission, which is sending a space probe to study some of the Trojan asteroids, two massive groups of space rocks that are located on each side of Jupiter on its orbit around the Sun. The Lucy probe was launched on 16 October 2021, and will arrive at the Trojan asteroids in late 2027, after making a quick stop in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Until then, Lucy mission scientists are trying to learn more about some of these mysterious rocks to help identify where the probe can be most useful. On March 27, the smallest of Lucy's Trojan targets, known as Polymele, passed in front of a distant star, allowing mission scientists to accurately measure the space rock's size by observing how much of the star's light the asteroid blocked out as it whizzed past. However, the team also observed an unexpected subsequent, smaller blip as a second asteroid followed in Polymele's wake. After reviewing the data, the team concluded that the second blip \"had to be a satellite,\" lead researcher Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a NASA statement. The newly discovered satellite has a diameter of about 3 miles and is separated from the 17-mile-wide Polymele by a distance of around 125 miles. At the time of the observation, Polymele was around 480 million miles from Earth. \"Those distances are roughly equivalent to finding a quarter on a sidewalk in Los Angeles while trying to spot it from a skyscraper in Manhattan,\" NASA representatives wrote in the statement. The term \" moon \" can refer to any naturally occurring solid body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet or asteroid. More than 200 moons have been recognized in the Solar System, but the actual number is likely much higher, according to NASA. The researchers could make only fleeting observations of Polymele's satellite, so its orbital path is highly uncertain. As a result, the space rock cannot yet be officially designated as a moon or be properly named. But the researchers are confident that when the Lucy probe arrives at Polymele, the spacecraft will be able to collect sufficient data to designate it as a true moon. This is not the first time that Lucy mission scientists have spotted a satellite trailing a Trojan asteroid. In 2021, the team detected a 0.6-mile-wide satellite orbiting Eurybates, which will be Lucy's first Trojan target, after analyzing data collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. On this occasion, the researchers determined the moon's orbital path and officially named it Queta.
